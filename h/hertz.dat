5|$|Heinrich <b>Hertz</b> (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the other was tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). <b>Hertz</b> showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by <b>Hertz</b> in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{background of the}} 19 th century electromagnetic theory is revisited {{from the standpoint of}} the opposition between alternative approaches in respect to the problem of interactions. The 19 th century electrodynamics became the battle-field of a paramount importance to test existing conceptions of interactions. <b>Hertz’s</b> experiments were designed to bring a solid experimental evidence in favor of one of them. The modern scientific method applied to analyze <b>Hertz’s</b> experimental approach as well as the analysis of his laboratory notes, dairy and private letters show that <b>Hertz’s</b> “crucial” experiments cannot be considered as conclusive at many points as it is generally implied. We found that alternative Helmholtz’s electrodynamics did not contradict any of <b>Hertz’s</b> experimental observations of transverse components as Maxwell’s theory predicted. Moreover, as we now know from recently published <b>Hertz’s</b> dairy and private notes, his first experimental results indicated clearly on infinite rate of propagation. Nevertheless, <b>Hertz’s</b> experiments provided no further explicit information on non-local longitudinal components which were such an essential feature of Helmholtz’s theory. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a decisive choice on the adequate account of electromagnetic interactions are discussed from the position of modern scientific method...|$|R

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred <b>Hertz</b> at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 <b>Hertz</b> gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig <b>Hertz</b> had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who had used the process to separate gases.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with <b>Hertz</b> to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 <b>Hertz</b> frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E

50|$|In his {{academic}} inaugural lecture at Leipzig of 1900 on The Extension of our Senses, he presented {{the theory of}} physical education {{in the context of}} evolutionary theory.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 <b>hertz</b> (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A <b>Hertz</b> horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav <b>Hertz</b> {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E
