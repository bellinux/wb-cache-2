5|$|According to a {{study done}} in 1927, the Dewey system {{was used in the}} US in {{approximately}} 96% of responding public libraries and 89% of the college libraries. After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931, administration of the classification was under the <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation, and the editorial body was the <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association (ALA), Library of Congress, and Forest Press. By the 14th edition in 1942, the Dewey <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> index was over 1,900 pages in length and was published in two volumes.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the International Institute of Bibliography, {{located in}} Belgium {{and led by}} Paul Otlet, {{contacted}} Dewey {{about the possibility of}} translating the classification into French, and using the classification system for bibliographies (as opposed to its use for books in libraries). This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright. Dewey gave permission {{for the creation of a}} version intended for bibliographies, and also for its translation into French. Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well as a violation of Dewey's copyright. Shortly after Dewey's death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> and the developers of the French Classification Decimal. The English version was published as the Universal <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> and is still in use today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Mostly {{the purpose}} of {{information}} retrieval development {{is to increase the}} performance of searching by using keywords matching techniques between content and user’s query string based on mathematics and linguistics. However, users were inundated with thousands of results from the relevant query but irrelevant to users. In addition, the query method by using a single language query in searching data from multi language can not be implied. In this research, Dewey <b>Decimals</b> <b>Classification</b> (DDC) scheme in library system was used to classify in order to support multiple relational DDC retrieval. Pattern of relation in DDC would be created for retrieval based on similarity relation between query string and content. Fuzzy logic was used for measuring the degree of similarity. This method can retrieve information which will enable users to meet their need while it can also retrieve content in multi language...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E

25|$|Metis is a Dewey-free library {{classification}} system developed and implemented in 2011 by Sue Giffard, Tali Balas Kaplan, Jennifer Still, and Andrea Dolloff, the librarians at the Ethical Culture School in New York City. The system places the thinking, interests, information needs and information-seeking behavior of children at its center. It was developed {{as an alternative}} to the Dewey <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> System and the practices which customarily accompany that system in school and public libraries in the United States: namely, the alphabetical arrangement of fiction by author, and the frequent arrangement of biographies in alphabetical order by biographee. The Metis system (named for Metis the Titan who was the mother of Athena in Greek mythology) was designed to encourage productive independent browsing by children, as well as allowing for successful catalog searching by elementary school students.|$|E

In 1888, Warren Stone Gordis was hired by the university to be a language professor. In addition to teaching Greek and Latin, Gordis found himself charged as the library’s manager. While acquainting himself with the materials, Gordis discovered that the library had no traditional classification system; instead, the books were arranged and shelved by subject after being logged into a ledger in the order of their reception. Aware that the expanding library needed a permanent solution, Gordis did some research and decided to employ the dictionary cataloging method and the Dewey <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> System. Gordis also recognized that the library needed to incorporate periodicals as source material. As {{he was in charge of}} building the collection, he designated funds toward the purchase of some of the most prevalent journals of the time, including The Nation Scientific American, North American Review, Atlantic Monthly, the Edinburgh Review, and the London Quarterly Review. Additionally, Gordis trained library assistants to follow correct library procedures and taught students how to locate items in the library.|$|E

500|$|The Dewey <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> has {{a number}} for all subjects, {{including}} fiction, although many libraries create a separate fiction section shelved by alphabetical order of the author's surname.

[...] A common form of the book number is called a Cutter number, which represents the author and distinguishes the book from other books on the same topic.|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{classification}} to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use the abridged edition but found the full classification overwhelming. Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions: the library edition, {{which would be the}} fullest edition; the bibliographic edition, in English and French, which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf; and the abridged edition. In 1933, the bibliographic edition became the Universal <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification,</b> which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey <b>Decimal</b> <b>Classification</b> editions. The 15th edition, edited by Milton Ferguson, implemented the growing concept of the [...] "standard edition", designed for the majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy the needs of the very largest or of special libraries. It also reduced the size of the Dewey system by over half, from 1,900 to 700 pages. This revision was so radical that an advisory committee was formed right away for the 16th and 17th editions. The 16th and 17th editions, under the editorship of the Library of Congress, grew again to two volumes. However, by now, the Dewey Decimal system had established itself as a classification for general libraries, with the Library of Congress Classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries.|$|E

50|$|In December 1889, the University Board of Trustees {{authorized}} $650 for periodicals and books, {{which were}} placed in a single room in Holladay Hall. The collection was overseen by the university's first professor of English and future third chancellor, Daniel Harvey Hill Jr. Comprising 1,500 volumes by 1890, it reflected Hill's scholarly and literary interests instead of a purely scientific and engineering focus; indeed, the library {{was considered to be}} part of the Department of English. Through the 1890s, the collection primarily consisted of required reading materials for English courses taught by Hill and American and European history courses taught by Professor Alexander Holladay. The concept of a centralized library system was not considered; by 1893, the departments of agriculture, horticulture, mechanics, physics and mechanical and civil engineering had each developed their own reference collections separately from the primary library. The library moved to three rooms on the third floor of Main Building in the fall of 1897. In 1899, the University of Texas librarian, Benjamin Wyche, came as a consultant and introduced the Dewey <b>Decimal</b> System of <b>classification,</b> a card catalog and library cards; also that year, Edward Bentley Owen, a recent graduate of the college, was hired as librarian. In 1899, the collection totaled some 3,000 volumes, increasing to 3,500 volumes and 125 periodicals by the following year.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} viruses as {{pathogens}} or silent passengers of other organisms, from bacteria {{to the dominant}} mammal, is very large. As we explore new niches for life and as the sensitivity and specificity of detection techniques improve, the list of viruses expands. Today, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes about 1, 550 virus species (20), but some 30, 000 virus strains and isolates are being tracked by virologists in different fields of biology. The ICTV is the "international court " of experts that rules on names and relationships of all viruses, but only {{to the level of}} species. Virus taxonomy has been described as "a polarizing subject, based on the opinionated use of data " (12). Recognizing this intrinsic problem, ICTV took early initiatives in electronic data management (1) and has supported the development of a universal virus database, ICTVdB, since 1991. The last sentence in Melnick's chapter, "Taxonomy and Classification of Viruses, " in the previous edition of this Manual (11) referred to the recent development of ICTVdB. Although originally designed as a tool for taxonomic research, ICTVdB will soon be available as a continually updated reference source for clinical and other uses.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, Design and Architecture courses {{such as in}} Italy, Brazil and France have {{explored}} both physical and virtual materials collections to present to students the diversity available {{in the market for}} a new and appropriated use in project. Dantas and Campos [1] demonstrated some of these collections and showed different approaches for their construction, pointing out difficulties in terms of a consensus on the type of information provided, the organization of the physical space, the existing system of classification and cataloguing, as well as information availability free of charge. According to Del Curto and Dantas [2], distinct objectives are defined in academic initiatives and also in the commercial ones. Furthermore, there are specificities on the use of these materials collections regarding project tools in teaching, which can cause the consensus conflicts mentioned above. The international cooperation between Materiali e Design, the material library of Politecnico di Milano and LabDesign from FAU USP (Brazil) resulted in the implementation of the project “Materialize: Material library for design and architecture”, in virtual and physical version. The main challenge of this partnership was to converge the vast experience accumulated over the last 15 years of Materiali e Design and to respect the requirements of course of architecture and urbanism as well as the design (product and graphic) course in the context of free public higher education in Brazil. To achieve that goal, the following procedures were taken into account: a. Compatibility of technical terminology of materials, properties and production processes, in Italian, English and Portuguese; b. Use and expansion of the <b>decimal</b> system of <b>classification</b> of materials from Materiali e Design, due to the demand for the inclusion of sub-categories required for the profiles of FAU USP courses; c.
