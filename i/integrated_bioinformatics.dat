40|$|Functional {{analysis}} and interpretation of large-scale proteomics and gene expression data require effective use of bioinformatics tools and public knowledge resources coupled with expert-guided examination. An <b>integrated</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> approach was used to analyze cellular pathways in response to ionizing radiation. ATM, or ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, a serine-threonine protein kinase, plays critical roles in radiation responses, including cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. We analyzed radiation responsive pathways based on 2 D-gel/MS proteomics and microarray gene expression data from fibroblasts expressing wild type or mutant ATM gene. The analysis showed that metabolism was significantly affected by radiation in an ATM dependent manner. In particular, purine metabolic pathways were differentially changed in the two cell lines. The expression of ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M 2 (RRM 2) was increased in ATM-wild type cells at both mRNA and protein levels, but no changes were detected in ATM-mutated cells. Increased expression of p 53 was observed 30 min after irradiation of the ATM-wild type cells. These results suggest that RRM 2 is a downstream target of the ATM-p 53 pathway that mediates radiation-induced DNA repair. We demonstrated that the <b>integrated</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> approach facilitated pathway analysis, hypothesis generation and target gene/protein identification...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Comorbidity of Major Depressive Disorder (depression) and Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) is well documented. Depression, AUD, and the {{comorbidity}} {{of depression}} with AUD show evidence of genetic and environmental influences on susceptibility. We used an <b>integrated</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> approach, mining available data in multiple databases, {{to develop and}} refine a model of gene-by-environment interaction consistent with this comorbidity. Methods We established the validity of a genetic model via queries against NCBI databases, identifying and validating TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) and MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase) as candidate genes. We used the PDG-ACE algorithm (Prioritizing Disease Genes by Analysis of Common Elements) to show that TNF and MTHFR share significant commonality and that this commonality {{is consistent with a}} response to environmental exposure to ethanol. Finally, we used MetaCore from GeneGo, Inc. to model a gene-by-environment interaction consistent with the data. Results TNF Alpha Converting Enzyme (TACE) activity is suppressed by ethanol exposure, resulting in reduced TNF signaling. TNF binds to TNF receptors, initiating signal transduction pathways that activate MTHFR expression. MTHFR is an essential enzyme in folate metabolism and reduced folate levels are associated with both AUD and depression. Integrating these pieces of information our model shows how excessive alcohol use would be expected to lead to reduced TNF signaling, reduced MTHFR expression, and increased susceptibility to depression. Conclusion The proposed model provides a novel hypothesis on the genetic etiology of comorbid depression with AUD, consistent with established clinical and biochemical data. This analysis also provides an example of how an <b>integrated</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> approach can maximize the use of available biomedical data to improve our understanding of complex disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a relatively}} common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that leads to progressive narrowing of the lumen of leg arteries. Circulating monocytes are {{in contact with the}} arterial wall and can serve as reporters of vascular pathology in the setting of PAD. We performed gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with PAD and controls without PAD to identify differentially regulated genes. Methods PAD was defined as an ankle brachial index (ABI) ≤ 0. 9 (n = 19) while age and gender matched controls had an ABI > 1. 0 (n = 18). Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix HG-U 133 plus 2. 0 gene chips and analyzed using GeneSpring GX 11. 0. Gene expression data was normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) normalization method, differential expression was defined as a fold change ≥ 1. 5, followed by unpaired Mann-Whitney test (P) and correction for multiple testing by Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate. Meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using an <b>integrated</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> pipeline with tools for enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathway analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), molecular event enrichment using Reactome annotations and network analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis suite. Extensive biocuration was also performed to understand the functional context of genes. Results We identified 87 genes differentially expressed in the setting of PAD; 40 genes were upregulated and 47 genes were downregulated. We employed an <b>integrated</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> pipeline coupled with literature curation to characterize the functional coherence of differentially regulated genes. Conclusion Notably, upregulated genes mediate immune response, inflammation, apoptosis, stress response, phosphorylation, hemostasis, platelet activation and platelet aggregation. Downregulated genes included several genes from the zinc finger family that are involved in transcriptional regulation. These results provide insights into molecular mechanisms relevant to the pathophysiology of PAD. </p...|$|E

We describe a number of novel putative caspase- 8 substrates using the Prediction of Protease Specificity (PoPS) program, {{one of which is}} histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC 7). HDAC 7 is cleaved faster than any other caspase- 8 substrate described to date. It is also cleaved in primary CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes undergoing extrinsic apoptosis. By using naturally occurring caspase inhibitors that have evolved exquisite specificity at concentrations found within the cell, we could unequivocally assign the cleavage activity to caspase- 8. Importantly, cleavage of HDAC 7 alters its subcellular localization and abrogates its Nur 77 repressor function. Thus we demonstrate a direct role for initiator caspase-mediated proteolysis in promoting gene transcription. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The association of rare variants in PSEN 1 with LOAD-related endophenotypes has received little attention. In this study, we performed a rare variant association analysis of PSEN 1 with quantitative biomarkers of LOAD using whole genome sequencing (WGS) by <b>integrating</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> and imaging informatics. METHODS: A WGS data set (N[*]=[*] 815) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort {{was used in this}} analysis. 757 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants underwent WGS from a blood sample and high resolution T 1 -weighted structural MRI at baseline. An automated MRI analysis technique (FreeSurfer) was used to measure cortical thickness and volume of neuroanatomical structures. We assessed imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as LOAD-related quantitative endophenotypes. Single variant analyses were performed using PLINK and gene-based analyses of rare variants were performed using the optimal Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O). RESULTS: A total of 839 rare variants (MAF[*]<[*] 1 /√(2 N) [*]=[*] 0. 0257) were found within a region of ± 10 kb from PSEN 1. Among them, six exonic (three non-synonymous) variants were observed. A single variant association analysis showed that the PSEN 1 p. E 318 G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in participants carrying APOE ε 4 allele where individuals carrying the minor allele of this PSEN 1 risk variant have lower CSF Aβ 1 - 42 and higher CSF tau. A gene-based analysis resulted in a significant association of rare but not common (MAF[*]≥[*] 0. 0257) PSEN 1 variants with bilateral entorhinal cortical thickness. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that PSEN 1 rare variants collectively show a significant association with the brain atrophy in regions preferentially affected by LOAD, providing further support for a role of PSEN 1 in LOAD. The PSEN 1 p. E 318 G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in APOE ε 4 carriers. <b>Integrating</b> <b>bioinformatics</b> with imaging informatics for identification of rare variants could help explain the missing heritability in LOAD...|$|R
