The Oregon plan provides important lessons to a nation striving to expand health care coverage in an era of shrinking budgets. At first, the Oregon plan made repeated headlines and provoked strong criticism. “The Oregon plan will target a new group for discrimination — the se-riously ill, ” wrote an Oregon physician {{in a letter to the}} editor of the Journal. 1 “It denies care only to the politically powerless poor, ” commented health ana-lyst Emily Friedman. 2 “Oregon’s decision to ration health care to its poorest women and children,” charged Al Gore, “is a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> unconditional <b>surrender</b> just as the first battles are being fought over the future of our health care system. ” 3 Why all the outrage?
