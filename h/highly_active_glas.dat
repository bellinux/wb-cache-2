40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of renal impairment and associated risk factors among human immunodeficiency virus positive patients. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among human immunodeficiency virus positive patients at Bahir Dar Felege Hiwot referral Hospital. Demographic and other data were collected using structured questionnaires. Body mass index, urine protein, CD 4 count, hemoglobin, electrolyte, lipid profile, serum urea and creatinine were measured. Data was entered into EPI info version 3. 5. 1 and analyzed using SPSS version 16. Descriptive statistics was calculated and logistic regression models were used to investigate factors associated with renal impairment. Results: A total 307 human immunodeficiency virus positive patients, 153 <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy na&# 239;ve (who didn&# 8217;t take <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy) and 154 on <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy were enrolled in the study. The mean (&# 177;SD) age of the participants was 34. 69 (&# 177; 8. 86) years and about 61 % were females. The prevalence of renal impairment in <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy na&# 239;ve and on <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy individuals was 30. 1 % and 12. 9 % respectively. Proteinuria was found in 17. 9 % of the participant.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{whether or not}} <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy is associated with carotid artery stiffness in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients in Henan Province, China. Method: Fifty human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients {{with at least a}} 5 -year history of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy use and 50 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients without a history of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy use were enrolled in this study. Carotid artery intima-media thickness and stiffness were determined by quantitative inter-media thickness and quantitative artery stiffness, respectively. Results: No statistically significant difference in carotid artery intima-media thickness and stiffness was observed between groups. A significant association between human immunodeficiency virus infection time and carotid artery stiffness was observed, but no significant association between human immunodeficiency virus infection time and intima-media thickness was found. No significant association between intima-media thickness, stiffness, and CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell counts were observed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the features and outcomes {{of patients with}} AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis after <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy availability. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 30 consecutive patients (44 eyes) with AIDS and newly diagnosed, active AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis, examined from January 2005 to December 2007. RESULTS: The mean age was 34. 8 years, 18 patients (60. 0 %) were male and median duration of AIDS was 90 months. Nineteen patients (63. 3 %) had evidence of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy failure and median CD 4 + lymphocyte count was 12. 5 cells/µl. Visual acuity at presentation was 20 / 40 or better in 27 eyes (61. 4 %). Retinitis involved Zone 1 in 13 eyes (39. 5 %). Despite specific anti-AIDSrelated cytomegalovirus therapy, 16 eyes (36. 4 %) presented relapse of retinitis and 10 eyes (22. 7 %) lost at least three lines of vision.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the pre-highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy era, a loss {{of specific}} antibodies was seen. Our objective with {{this study was to}} describe the loss of specific antibodies during treatment with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: In a prospective, single-center, cohort study of 59 children with HIV- 1 infection, we investigated the long-term effect of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy on the titers and course of specific antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strains compared with wild-type varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. RESULTS: During <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy, age-adjusted CD 4 + T cells and B cells increased, whereas total immunoglobulin levels declined. Although these children were preimmunized before the start of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy, only 24 (43 %) had antibodies against all 3 measles, mumps, and rubella. Antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella were lost in 14 (40 %), 11 (38 %), and 5 (11 %) children who were seropositive at baseline. We also observed loss of varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G in 7 (21 %) of 34, cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G in 3 (7 %) of 45, but none of 53 Epstein-Barr virus-seropositive children. During <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy, primary vaccination in 3 patients and 15 revaccinations in those with negative serology demonstrated incomplete seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: Humoral reactivity in children with HIV- 1 infection remains abnormal during <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy.

40|$|The {{severity}} {{and longevity}} of inflammation {{is controlled by}} endogenous counter-regulatory signals. Among them are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) -derived lipid mediators, which promote the resolution of inflammation, an active process for returning to tissue homeostasis. To determine whether endogenous production of lipid-derived resolution agonists is regulated differentially in patients with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> and less active multiple sclerosis (MS). Matched-pairs study in University hospital Neurology department. Based on clinical (relapse frequency) and paraclinical (MRI lesions, contrast enhancement) criteria, 10 pairs of age- and sex-matched patients with relapsing-remitting MS were assigned either to a group with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> or less active MS. Lipid mediators were quantified in serum and cerebrospinal fluid using LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics. Levels of the key arachidonic (ω- 6) and docosahexaenoic acid (ω- 6) -derived mediators prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) and resolution agonists lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)), resolvin D 1 (RvD 1) and neuroprotectin D 1 (NPD 1) were quantified. In the patient group with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> MS, 15 -HETE and PGE(2) were increased, which are products of the 15 -lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. The proresolution mediator RvD 1 was significantly upregulated and NPD 1 was detected in the <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> group only. LXA(4) levels were not increased in patients with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> MS. Lipid mediator pathways are regulated differentially in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients, depending on disease severity.

Undoubtedly, the development of <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) dramatically changed {{the future of the}} syndrome that we know today. In the present study, we evaluate the impact of <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy on macrophage function and its relevance to HIV pathogenesis. Methods: PBMCs were isolated from blood samples and monocytes (CD 14 + cells) were purified. Monocyte-Derived Macrophages (MDMs) were activated on classical (MGM-CSF+IFN-γ) or alternative (MIL- 4 +IL 13) patterns using human recombinant cytokines for six days. After this period, Monocyte-Derived Macrophages were stimulated with TLR 2 /Dectin- 1 or TLR 4 agonists and we evaluated the influence of HIV- 1 infection and <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy on the release of cytokines/chemokines by macrophages. Results: The data were obtained using Monocyte-Derived Macrophages derived from HIV naïve or from patients on regular <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy. Classically Monocyte-Derived Macrophages obtained from HIV- 1 infected patients on <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy released higher levels of IL- 6 and IL- 12 even without PAMPs stimuli when compared to control group. On the other hand, alternative Monocyte-Derived Macrophages derived from HIV- 1 infected patients on <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy released lower levels of IL- 6, IL- 10, TNF-α, IP- 10 and RANTES after LPS stimuli when compared to control group. Furthermore, healthy individuals have a complex network of cytokines/chemokines released by Monocyte-Derived Macrophages after PAMP stimuli, which was deeply affected in MDMs obtained from naïve HIV- 1 infected patients and only partially restored in MDMs derived from HIV- 1 infected patients even on regular <b>Highly</b> <b>Active</b> Antiretroviral Therapy.

The Rieke manganese {{can be easily}} prepared by reduction of anhydrous manganese halides using lithium {{in the presence of}} a catalytic amount of naphthalene in THF at room temperature. ^ Primary, secondary and tertiary alkylmanganese bromides can be generated from the direct oxidative addition of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> manganese to alkyl bromides. These organomanganese reagents have been found to undergo cross-coupling reaction with acid chlorides to give the corresponding ketones in good yields. In addition, preparation and subsequent cross-coupling reaction of arylmanganese bromides is also performed. ^ The direct formation of 3 -thienylmanganese bromides can be readily accomplished under mild conditions from the direct oxidative addition of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> manganese to thienyl bromides. Interestingly, the reaction of 3, 4 -dibromothiophene with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> manganese affords a mono-organometallic intermediate, which upon subsequent treatment with an electrophile provides unsymmetrical disubstituted thiophenes. ^ A facile synthetic route for the direct formation of non-functionalized and functionalized benzylic manganese halides from <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> manganese and benzylic halides was developed. The resulting benzylic manganese halides react readily with a variety of different electrophiles to give the corresponding cross-coupled products in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. ^ For the first time, a new synthetic route to organomanganese tosylates and mesylates has been developed. This can be easily accomplished via the direct oxidative addition of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> manganese to the corresponding tosylates and mesylates, respectively. The subsequent cross-coupling reaction with several electrophiles was found to proceed in the absence of any transition metal catalyst. ^ Finally, the reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds and imines was achieved by the reaction of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> manganese. The corresponding coupling products, 1, 2 -diols and vicinal diamines, were obtained in good isolated yields. Significantly, some functional groups can be tolerated under the conditions used. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Reducing viral load, <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} the potential to limit onwards transmission of HIV- 1 and thus help contain epidemic spread. However, increases in risk behaviour and resurgent epidemics have been widely reported post-highly active antiretroviral therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the impact that <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy had on the epidemic. DESIGN: We focus on the HIV- 1 epidemic among men who have sex with men in the Netherlands, which has been well documented over the past 20 years within several long-standing national surveillance programs. METHODS: We used a mathematical model including <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy use and estimated the changes in risk behaviour and diagnosis rate needed to explain annual data on HIV and AIDS diagnoses. RESULTS: We show that the reproduction number R(t), a measure of the state of the epidemic, declined early on from initial values above two and was maintained below one from 1985 to 2000. Since 1996, when <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy became widely used, the risk behaviour rate has increased 66 %, resulting in an increase of R(t) to 1. 04 in the latest period 2000 - 2004 (95 % confidence interval 0. 98 - 1. 09) near or just above the threshold for a self-sustaining epidemic. Hypothetical scenario analysis shows that the epidemiological benefits of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy and earlier diagnosis on incidence have been entirely offset by increases in the risk behaviour rate. CONCLUSION: We provide the first detailed quantitative analysis of the HIV epidemic in a well defined population and find a resurgent epidemic in the era of <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy, most likely predominantly caused by increasing sexual risk behaviou...|$|R

METHODS: HIV- 1 -infected children naive to efavirenz were treated {{with a combination of}} efavirenz, abacavir, didanosine, and lamivudine in an observational, prospective, single-center study. Virologic failure-free survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. The CD 4 + T-cell increase was estimated by using a generalized linear model incorporating repeated measurements. RESULTS: Thirty-six children received the study medication for a median of 69 weeks. Virologic failure-free survival rates were 76 % and 67 % after 48 weeks and 96 weeks, respectively. No significant difference was found in efficacy between first-line and second-line <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy. All children receiving <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy showed a sustained CD 4 + T-cell increase, irrespective of virologic suppression. Growth rates improved with <b>highly</b> <b>active</b> antiretroviral therapy. Study medication administration was stopped for 14 children, mostly because of nonadherence (4 cases) or virologic rebound (5 cases) and because of adverse events (unrelated death and grade 2 liver toxicity) in 2 cases.
