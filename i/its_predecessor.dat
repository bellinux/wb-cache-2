5|$|Similar to <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> Jumping Flash! 2 {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who praised {{the game for}} its updated interface, advanced graphics and gameplay. However, also like <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> it was criticised for its short length, lack of challenging gameplay and close similarities to the first game. Despite this, Jumping Flash! 2 gained enough popularity to spawn a final sequel, Robbit Mon Dieu.|$|E

5|$|Williams shipped around 1,000units of Joust 2, {{significantly}} fewer than <b>its</b> <b>predecessor.</b> Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame and Mike Bevan of Retro Gamer attributed the poor numbers to an industry slump in the mid-1980s. Joust 2 arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare among collectors. Weiss negatively compared {{the game to}} <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> calling Joust more popular and enjoyable. However, he commented that Joust 2s graphics are more detailed and robust.|$|E

We also present a model-theoretic semantics with respect to which the logic is sound. The logic herein captures all of the desirable features of <b>its</b> <b>predecessors</b> and more; nonetheless, it accomplishes this with no more axioms or rules than the simplest of <b>its</b> <b>predecessors...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from <b>its</b> <b>predecessor</b> to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike <b>its</b> <b>predecessor.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the kth iteration, the variable b holds the latest remainder r'k−1, whereas the variable a holds <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> r'k−2. The step b := a mod b is equivalent to the above recursion formula r'k ≡ r'k−2 mod r'k−1. The temporary variable t holds the value of r'k−1 while the next remainder r'k is being calculated. At the end of the loop iteration, the variable b holds the remainder r'k, whereas the variable a holds <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> r'k−1.|$|E
