30|$|Schneider et al. [14] {{described}} ten {{criteria for}} evaluating surgical treatment of olecranon fractures based on ten operative imperfections: (1) nonparallel <b>K-wires,</b> (2) long <b>K-wires,</b> (3) <b>K-wires</b> extending radially outwards, (4) insufficient fixation of the proximal {{ends of the}} <b>K-wires,</b> (5) intramedullary <b>K-wires,</b> (6) perforation of the joint surface, (7) single wire knot, (8) jutting wire knot(s), (9) loose figure-of-eight configuration, and (10) incorrect repositioning to evaluate radiographs of olecranon fractures.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we report {{antibacterial}} modification of Kirschner wires (<b>K-wires)</b> with polyluteolin (PL) toward methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). <b>K-wires</b> were modified by immersing them in the luteolin-containing aqueous solution for 24 h. Characterizations using scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical methods confirmed {{the presence of the}} PL coatings on the <b>K-wires.</b> The PL-coated <b>K-wires</b> were further found to show antibacterial activity toward MRSA and remained unimpaired antibacterial activity even after the steam sterilization treatment...|$|R
30|$|Each {{operative}} {{method has}} its own specific drawbacks and complications. <b>K-wires</b> with cerclage have {{a high rate of}} infection and nonunion due to migration of the <b>K-wires</b> [5].|$|R
50|$|If x-rays {{show that}} the Capitate {{fracture}} fragments are out of alignment, surgery is indicated. A surgeon can use small compression screws or K-Wires to unite the two pieces of bone. The headless compression screw has advantage over the <b>K-wire</b> as it provides compression across the fracture site and allows early motion. It {{may be the case}} that the ligament between the Capitate and the Scaphoid bone is also injured, is so this would be repaired at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} device {{used in the}} {{surgical}} correction of hammer toes is the <b>K-wire.</b> After bone has been removed and the toe has been re-aligned, the wire is inserted through the open end of the afflicted toe to hold the joint in place and stabilize it. The wire stays in place {{for up to six}} weeks during the healing process. K-wires can be painful, uncomfortable and prone to infection. Because the wound is open, K-wires can lead to [...] "pin tract" [...] infection requiring additional treatment and further complicating the recovery period.|$|E
50|$|Options include {{operative}} or non-operative treatment. If the dislocation is {{less than}} 2 mm, the fracture can be managed with casting for six weeks. The patient's injured limb cannot bear weight during this period. For severe Lisfranc injuries, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) and temporary screw or Kirschner wire (<b>K-wire)</b> fixation is the treatment of choice. The foot cannot be allowed to bear weight {{for a minimum of}} six weeks. Partial weight-bearing may then begin, with full weight bearing after an additional several weeks, depending on the specific injury. K-wires are typically removed after six weeks, before weight bearing, while screws are often removed after 12 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Migration of <b>K-wires</b> can occur; {{instead of}} backing out the wire can move deeper. <b>K-wires</b> passed across the acromioclavicular (AC) joint in the {{shoulder}} {{have been found to}} migrate into the chest with the potential to penetrate the major blood vessels, the trachea, lung, or the heart.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Fractures of {{the lateral}} condyle of the humerus in {{children}} {{are a common}} injury. If displaced or unstable they may require surgical reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires (<b>K-wires).</b> <b>K-wires</b> are placed using either an open or closed technique. The decision to bury or leave the ends extending through the skin is surgeon-dependent and based on factors including post-operative infection risk, bony union and ease of wire removal. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-buried versus buried <b>K-wires</b> for lateral condyle elbow fractures in children {{in accordance with the}} Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. A comprehensive search strategy included Medline, Embase and CINAHL via NICE Evidence from database inception to June 2017. Two authors independently reviewed, included or excluded articles, extracted data and assessed for quality with the ROBINS-I tool. We performed direct comparison meta-analysis for all adverse events, post-operative infection and failure of bony union. Results Three studies were analysed comprising of 434 participants. There was a significantly reduced relative risk of adverse events in the non-buried group, equating to approximately 45 % reduced risk (RR 0. 55, 95 % confidence interval 0. 34 to 0. 88). There {{were no significant differences in}} risk of post-operative infection or failure of bony union. All three cost-analyses in the included studies observed savings with non-buried <b>K-wires.</b> Conclusion Non-buried <b>K-wires</b> for lateral condyle elbow fractures convey a lower risk of adverse events and may be more cost-effective compared with buried <b>K-wires.</b> Non-buried <b>K-wires</b> do not appear to increase the risk of infection or failure of bony union. These findings are limited by a high risk of bias due to inherent methodological flaws in the design of included studies...|$|R
5000|$|Breakage: <b>K-wires</b> may bend or break, {{especially}} if the fracture does not heal.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{a patient}} has been struck with mallet finger, ice {{should be applied}} {{immediately}} and the patient’s arm should be elevated above the heart {{in order to reduce}} blood circulation to the fingers. This is because this reduces inflammation, which causes further damage. The patient should be seen by a doctor within a week after the injury. Treatment options include surgery or putting the finger in a Mallet splint for 6 to 8 weeks or extension block <b>k-wire</b> for 4 weeks. The splint allows the tendon to return to normal length, if the finger is bent during these weeks the healing process must start all over again. Surgery is used to reattach the tendon and is usually performed within a week of the injury.|$|E
30|$|Because of this, the {{intramedullary}} devices aim {{to solve}} the weak points of the <b>K-wire</b> technique. Indeed, the results reported above seem to be slightly better {{than those of the}} <b>K-wire,</b> especially regarding patient satisfaction and malalignment of the arthrodesis.|$|E
30|$|Migration of Kirschner (K) wires {{from the}} upper {{extremity}} joints has often been reported, but it is less common from the lower extremities. In this report, we describe an 85 -year-old man treated, during a hip replacement procedure, with a <b>K-wire</b> because of a trochanteric fracture; after one year, the <b>K-wire</b> {{was found in the}} popliteal fossa. This report illustrates the first case of <b>K-wire</b> migration in the popliteal area of the knee and suggests avoiding the use of free K-wires without any tension banding.|$|E

30|$|Percutaneous pinning using Kirschner wires (<b>K-wires)</b> is {{a common}} method used to manage {{unstable}} distal radius fractures.

A review of the literature surrounding Brodie’s abscess is presented. Due to the morbidity associated with <b>K-wiring,</b> this should be reserved for unstable fractures and full aseptic techniques used.|$|R

40|$|Kirschner wires (K-wires) {{are widely}} used for {{fixation}} of fractures and dislocations in the hand as they are readily available, reliable, and cost-effective. Complication rates of up to 18 % have been reported. However, <b>K-wire</b> breakage during removal is rare. We present one such case illustrating a simple technique for retrieval. A 35 -year-old male presented with a distal phalanx fracture of his right middle finger. This open fracture was treated with <b>K-wire</b> fixation. Postoperatively, he developed a pin site infection with associated finger swelling. The <b>K-wire</b> broke during removal with the proximal piece completely retained in his middle phalanx. To minimise risk of osteomyelitis, the <b>K-wire</b> was removed with a novel surgical technique. He had full return of hand function. Intraoperative <b>K-wire</b> breakage has a reported rate of 0. 1 %. In our case, there was no obvious cause of breakage and the patient denied postoperative trauma. On the other hand, pin site infections are much more common with reported rates of up to 7 % in the hand or wrist. <b>K-wire</b> fixation is a simple method for bony stabilisation but can be a demanding procedure with complications often overlooked.

40|$|A century ago, in 1909, Martin Kirschner (1879 - 942) {{introduced}} a smooth pin, presently {{known as the}} Kirschner wire (<b>K-wire).</b> The <b>K-wire</b> was initiallly used for skeletal traction and is now currently used for many different goals. The development of the <b>K-wire</b> and its insertion devices were mainly influenced by the change in operative goals and {{by the introduction of}} antibiotics. The first versions of the Kirschner wire were hammered through a predrilled hole into the bone, but later on drilling became the standard technique of insertion. Drilling is considered a simple way of implanting, with many advantages, such as percutaneous and atraumatic insertion. However, this technique also has its disadvantages like temperature elevation, resulting in osteonecrosis and heat-related complications. Despite these complications the <b>K-wire</b> is now standard for the treatment of hand fractures., worldwide...|$|E

40|$|Kirschner wires (<b>K-wires)</b> {{have long}} been {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} hammertoe digital repair. ” [AQ: 1] Abstract: Hammertoe digital defor-mity correction is a very controversial topic among foot and ankle surgeons. Hammertoes are characterized by an extension deformity at the metatarsopha-langeal joint (MTPJ) and flexion defor-mity at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ). Current treatment options are often guided by the patient’s dis-comfort as well as the reducibility of the affected digit. Kirschner wires (<b>K-wires)</b> {{have long been}} considered the gold stan-dard for hammertoe digital repair. Although <b>K-wires</b> are simplistic to use as fixation, they carry inherit risks such as pin tract infections, migration, and breakage. This has lead to multiple intra-medullary hammertoe devices including the PROTOE intramedullary device. This paper will discuss the usage and benefits the PROTOE has to offer over the conven-tional K- wire...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a broken <b>K-wire</b> {{migrating}} to the cervical spine from the right clavicle in a 9 -year-old child. The initial diagnosis, fracture of the clavicle with an acromioclavicular joint dislocation, was treated by open reduction and K-wiring. One <b>K-wire</b> broke and migrated to the neck, posterolateral to the C 6 vertebra. The <b>K-wire</b> was removed percutaneously under image intensif ication. Acromioclavicular joint dislocation in children is rare since the distal clavicle does not ossify until the age of 18 or 19 years meaning that almost all closed fractures of the clavicle in children can be treated non- operatively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} of a hinged elbow external fixator is technically demanding because the hinge axis must coincide exactly with theflexion–extension axis of the elbow. The standard technique involves inserting a 3 -mm <b>K-wire</b> freehand into the distal humerus to materialize theflexion–extension axis. We designed a guidewire device for extracorporeal hinge positioning without <b>K-wire</b> insertion. In a cadaver study, wecompared freehand <b>K-wire</b> insertion and our extracorporeal technique. Methods. – In 12 cadaveric elbows, we induced acute elbow instability by sectioning the medial collateral ligament complex and the anterior andposterior capsule. A hinged external fixator was applied to each elbow using both techniques. The outcome measures were procedure duration,number of image-intensifier shots (as a measure of radiation exposure), and passive motion range after fixator implantation. Results. – Compared with the freehand <b>K-wire</b> technique, the extracorporeal technique provided greater range of motion and significantly lowervalues for procedure duration and number of image-intensifier shots. Data dispersion was less marked with the extracorporeal technique, indicatingbetter reproducibility. Conclusion. – The extracorporeal technique based on a guidewire device enabled non-invasive positioning of a hinged elbow external fixator. Thistechnique was faster, less irradiating, and more reproducible than the freehand <b>K-wire</b> technique...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of intramedullary fixation using the Kirschner-wire (<b>K-wire)</b> compared to the titanium elastic nail (TEN) in pediatric femoral shaft fractures. Methods:A sample of 42 pediatric patients {{with a mean age of}} 6. 55 ± 2. 42 years (range 4 - 11 years) presenting femoral shaft fractures underwent intramedullary fixation using the <b>K-wire</b> or TEN. Results:There was no significant difference found between groups, of which 16 (38. 1 %) patients were treated with <b>K-wire</b> and 26 (61. 9 %) patients were treated with TEN in terms of union duration. Moreover, none of the patients showed nonunion or a delayed union. Conclusions:The use of adjusted <b>K-wire</b> instead of TEN in the intramedullary fixation of femoral shaft fractures in selected children may be an advantageous surgical option due to the lower cost, easy accessibility and no need for a second surgery for implant removal.

40|$|Background Tension band wiring of {{olecranon}} fractures {{has been}} shown to be associated with a high rate of metalwork removal. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether this remained true or whether there had been a reduction in metalwork removal following improvements in surgical technique. Methods The outcome of 44 olecranon fractures treated by tension band wire fixation were reviewed. Eighteen (41 %) required a second operation to remove the metalwork. In order todeterminewhat factorsmightpre-dispose tometalwork removal continuous (age) andcategorical variables (sex, <b>k-wire</b> diameter, <b>k-wire</b> alignment, <b>k-wire</b> orientation, <b>k-wire</b> length distal to the fracture and the number of tightening loops on the cerclage wire) were evaluated. ResultsNostatistical significancewas identifiedwheneachvariablewasanalysed individuallyor cumulatively using a multiple backward stepwise logistic regression (P< 0. 05). Using Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis removal of the tension band device was found to be most commonly performed within 6 months of the index procedure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most of the physician's {{attention}} during spinal surgery, {{when using}} wires and screws, is toward {{the avoidance of}} injuries of critical structures (nerves and vessels). When such wires are broken during surgery, the most important point is {{to take them out}} safely or, if it is impossible, to leaf them in secure place and follow the patient closely. Migrations of broken Kirschner wire (<b>K-wire)</b> are well known in literature; however, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, migration of a fractured <b>K-wire</b> during anterior atlantoaxial fixation of cervical spine has not been reported in the literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case in which a fractured <b>K-wire</b> was imbedded in the lateral mass of C 1 for 3 years and then migrated to endanger the dominant right vertebral artery. By using posterior approach and drilling right part of posterior arch of C 1, we manage to secure the vertebral artery. The broken <b>K-wire</b> was extracted successfully. In our case, with optimal follow-up, the burred wire inside hard bone was moved in delayed fashion to come out of the bone, grooving the dominant vertebral artery. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendation is to inspect the <b>K-wire</b> before using it and to try retrieve as much as possible when removing it...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} rigidity {{of three}} different methods of resorbable intramedullary fixation (bone peg, and polyglycolide rods with and without interlocking) was assessed in a comminuted phalangeal fracture model and the results compared with two commonly used internal fixation devices (lateral plate, crossed <b>K-wires)</b> in a cadaver model. Each fixation technique was tested for its biomechanical strength in apex palmar bending, compression and torsion. Failure testing for the three resorbable methods was also done. The results showed that lateral plating provided the best rigidity in apex palmar bending and torsion, followed by intramedullary bone peg fixation. All resorbable intramedullary fixations had rigidity that was at least the same as crossed <b>K-wires.</b> For the torque test, polyglycolide rods with interlocking provided better rigidity than without interlocking.

40|$|Implant {{associated}} {{infections are}} a critical health concern following orthopaedic surgery. Sustained local delivery of antibiotics {{has been suggested}} {{as a means of}} preventing these infections. Poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) is a biodegradable polymer that has been used to coat implants for the delivery of antibiotics and other bioactive molecules. While effective, these studies show that antibiotics are released in a burst profile. Here we evaluated a method for controlled release of gentamicin from implant surfaces using the palmitate alkyl salt to decrease its solubility in aqueous solution. Steel Kirschner wires (<b>K-wires)</b> were coated with Gentamicin-palmitate (GP) -PDLLA, gentamicin sulphate (GS) -PDLLA or vancomycin sulphate (VS) -PDLLA, and elution of antibiotics from coated <b>K-wires</b> investigated using HPLC/MS/ MS. In contrast to burst antibiotic release from the GS-PDLLA and VS-PDLLA groups, GP was released in a slower sustained manner. Colonisation and initial attachment of Staphylococcus aureus Xen 29 to gentamicin-coated <b>K-wires</b> was reduced by 90 % when compared to the non-coated control group. However there was no statistical difference in recovery of bacteria from GS or GP groups. Bacteria recovered from VS-PDLLA coated <b>K-wires</b> decreased by 36 %. Bioluminescence emitted by S. aureus Xen 29 was also reduced over seven days in the antibiotic control groups, demonstrating that growth and biofilm development over the longer term was impaired by antibiotic-PDLLA coating. These results indicate that using alkyl salts of antibiotics may be an effective strategy for controlling the release of antibiotics from implants...|$|R
