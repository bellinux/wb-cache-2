40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} whether dentine irradiation with a pulsed CO(2) laser (10. 6 mu m) emitting pulses of 10 ms is capable of reducing dentine calcium and phosphorus losses in an artificial caries model. Design: The 90 dentine slabs obtained from bovine teeth were randomly divided into six groups (n = 15) : negative control group (GC); positive control group, treated with <b>fluoride</b> <b>1.</b> 23 % (GF); and laser groups irradiated with 8 J/cm(2) (L 8); irradiated as in L 8 + <b>fluoride</b> <b>1.</b> 23 % (L 8 F); irradiated with 11 j/cm(2) (L 11); irradiated as in L 11 + <b>fluoride</b> <b>1.</b> 23 % (L 11 F). After laser irradiation the samples were submitted to a pH-cycling model for 9 days. The calcium and phosphorous contents in the de- and remineralization solutions were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer - ICP-OES. Additionally intra-pulpal temperature measurements were performed. The obtained data were analysed by means of ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: In the demineralization solutions the groups L 11 F and GF presented significantly lower means of calcium and phosphorous losses than the control group; and in L 11 F means were significantly lower than in the fluoride group. Both irradiation parameters tested caused intrapulpal temperature increase below 2 degrees C. Conclusion: It can be concluded that under the conditions of this study, CO(2) laser irradiation (10. 6 mu m) with 11 J/cm(2) (540 mJ and 10 Hz) of fluoride treated dentine surfaces decreases the loss of calcium and phosphorous in the demineralization process and does not cause excessive temperature increase inside the pulp chamber.

40|$|Background: Caries {{prevalence}} {{has declined}} significantly since {{the introduction of}} fluoridated toothpastes. There {{have been a number}} of developments with regards to specific active fluoride ingredients but not enough evidence to support one over the other. Aim: To compare the salivary fluoride concentrations of different fluoride formulations in the form of toothpaste: fluoride-free (0 ppmF), sodium <b>fluoride</b> (<b>1,</b> 450 ppmF), sodium monofluorophosphate (1, 450 ppmF), sodium fluoride and monofluorophosphate combined (1, 450 ppmF), stannous fluoride and sodium <b>fluoride</b> combined (<b>1,</b> 450 ppmF) and amine <b>fluoride</b> (<b>1,</b> 400 ppmF) with and without post-brushing water rinsing. Design: Study registered with ClilincalTrials. gov public database (NCT 02740803). In vivo double-blinded randomised controlled trial measuring salivary fluoride concentrations following brushing with six toothpaste formulations. Power calculation was performed using PASS 11. 0 software and the total sample size of 120 was recruited in this study. Participants brushed with 1. 0 g of one of six different formulations of toothpastes either with or without water rinsing post-brushing. Participants were randomly assigned to groups using an online random team generator. Saliva was collected at six different times (baseline and at 1, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minute(s) post-brushing]. Samples were analysed using a fluoride ion-specific sensitive electrode connected to an ion analyser. Codes were broken after data analysis. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 23 software. Results: Demographic characteristics were not significant variables (p> 0. 05). Time, toothpaste formulation and rinsing methods had significant effects (p< 0. 05). In general, amine fluoride toothpaste resulted in significantly higher salivary fluoride concentrations at 90 minutes than control groups, in both rinsing and non-rinsing groups. Sodium monofuorophosphate toothpaste did not result in significant difference compared to control group at any time point, in both rinsing and non-rinsing groups. Conclusion: The results of this study supports the current recommendation of no rinsing post-brushing.

In both sexes, the G-protein activator sodium <b>fluoride</b> and <b>1,</b> 2 -dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, a membrane-permeable analog of the protein kinase C activator diacylglycerol, elicited nerve impulse responses similar to those elicited by weak continuous stimulation with odorants. Therefore, G(q) -proteins and diacylglycerol-activated ion channels seem {{to be involved in the}} transduction process in both pheromone-sensitive neurons in males and general odorant-sensitive neurons in females. Decyl-thio-trifluoro-propanone is known to inhibit electrophysiological {{responses of}} male moths to pheromones, but has no effect in females. Application of this inhibitor reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude of elementary receptor potentials. It had no inhibitory effect on nerve impulse responses elicited by sodium <b>fluoride</b> or <b>1,</b> 2 -dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol. This supports the idea that decyl-thio-trifluoro-propanone acts on a prior step of the transduction cascade, e. g. on the pheromone receptor molecules. General odorants, such as (+/-) -linalool and 1 -heptanol, excite olfactory receptor neurons in females, but inhibit the pheromone-sensitive neurons in males. Both (+/-) -linalool and 1 -heptanol inhibited the responses of male neurons elicited by sodium <b>fluoride</b> or <b>1,</b> 2 -dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol.

Most stationary points on the PES corresponding to the molecular elimination and rearrangement channels from these intermediates have been identified.

In the reactions of both CH 3 CO. and F-. radicals, both these processes are energetically feasible for the thermal reactants and hence should lead to a spontaneous emission of vibrationally hot HF.

In addition to its direct decomposition to ketene, 9 can give rise to stable rearrangement products, viz., 2 -fluorovinyl alcohol (12) and 6.

Subsequent to fluoride treatment, 40 specimens from each group were stored in human saliva and sterile water, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Non-destructive {{testing methods}} of {{composite}} materials {{are very important}} for improving material reliability and safety. AE measurement {{is based on the}} detection of microscopic surface movements from stress waves in a material during the fracture process. The examination of AE is a useful tool for the sensitive detection and location of active damage in polymer and composite materials. FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensors have attracted much interest owing to the important advantages of optical fiber sensing. Compared to conventional electronic sensors, fiber-optical sensors are known for their high resolution and high accuracy. Furthermore, they offer important advantages such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, and electrically passive operation. In this paper, the crack detection capability of AE (Acoustic Emission) measurement was compared with that of an FBG sensor under tensile testing and buckling test of composite materials. The AE signals of the PVDF sensor were measured and an AE signal analyzer, which had a low pass filter and a resonance filter, was designed and fabricated. Also, the wavelength variation of the FBG sensor was measured and its strain was calculated. Calculated strains were compared with those determined by finite element analysis.
