5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} {{the forerunner of}} the <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> the electrostatic clock. It was powered with dry piles, a high voltage battery with extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with the weather. He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable {{across a range of}} meteorological conditions.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the 98. For {{the first time}} air conditioning was an option.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>clocks</b> {{can operate}} by several {{different}} types of mechanism: ...|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> have {{a simple}} two-pole {{synchronous}} motor which runs at one revolution per cycle of power, i.e., 3600 RPM at 60 Hz and 3000 RPM at 50 Hz. [...] However most <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> have rotors with more magnetic poles (teeth), consequently rotating at a smaller submultiple of line frequency. This allows the gear train which turns the hands to be built with fewer gears, saving money.|$|R
25|$|In 1970, the 98s {{were the}} largest Oldsmobiles. They still shared the luxury side of Oldsmobile {{business}} with the Toronado. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission, power steering, power brakes with front discs, power windows, power seats, Deluxe steering wheel, <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> and full wheel discs. Standard tire size was J78-15. Interiors were vinyl, cloth or leather. All 98s were made in Lansing indicated by the codel letter M in the Vehicle Identification Number. The length grew to 225.2inches.|$|E
25|$|Some luxury market buyers {{purchased}} {{either the}} Starfires {{or the new}} Toronados in 1966 but the 98 remained the full-size top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. Five models, including a trio of 4-doors were available. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic transmission; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; special wheel covers; front and rear seat belts; carpeting; windshield washer and two-speed wipers; foam seat cushions; <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> and special armrests on selected models. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were built in Lansing.|$|E
25|$|Four {{body styles}} were {{offered in the}} 98 series for 1972. Standard {{equipment}} included: Deluxe armrests, dual ashtrays, power brakes with front discs, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> carpeting, interior hood release, remote control outside mirror, molding package, interior light package, windshield radio antenna, power seat, power steering, spare tire cover and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. A midyear version of the 4-door hardtop named the Regency was produced to commemorate Oldsmobile's 75th year as an automaker. For {{the first time in}} 17 years the 98 set a new sales record of 121,568.|$|E
50|$|Clocks {{were either}} {{electrical}} or mechanical. <b>Electric</b> <b>clocks</b> usually have the coloured segments pointing inwards, mechanical clocks have the segments pointing outwards.|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the same}} time that the local rail lines were in decline, the {{inventor}} Henry E. Warren developed the Warren Synchronizing Timer in 1916, which made synchronous <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> possible by keeping alternating current flowing from power plants at a consistent sixty cycles per second. Warren founded Telechron, which, in partnership with General <b>Electric,</b> manufactured <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> in Ashland until 1979. A Warren Synchronizing Timer is on display at the Smithsonian's Museum of American History in Washington D.C., and the Ashland High School sports teams are coined [...] "The Clockers." ...|$|R
50|$|The Hammond Clock Company of Chicago, Illinois, {{produced}} <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> between 1928 and 1941. It {{was one of}} the ventures of Laurens Hammond, {{the inventor}} of the famous Hammond organ.|$|R
25|$|The {{bucket seat}} option {{introduced}} on Electra 225 convertibles in 1959 was now available on Electra coupes and included a center consolette with storage compartment. Standard Electra features included windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, a single-key locking system, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> trunk light, license plate frames, glovebox light, power steering and power brakes. In addition Electra 225s had back-up lights, a Glare-proof rear view mirror, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, map light and Super Deluxe wheelcovers as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|As {{befitting}} {{a luxury}} car, Toronados featured {{a long list}} of standard equipment that included Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes along with an <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> carpeting and deluxe wheel covers. Virtually all Toronados were sold loaded with extra-cost options including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with 8-track tape player, power trunk release, vinyl roof, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks and six-way power seats. Power windows became standard equipment in 1975. A new feature in 1974 was a gauge that monitored if the driver was driving economically or not.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 1840, he {{exhibited}} his electro-magnetic {{clock in}} the library of the Royal Society, and propounded a plan for distributing the correct time from a standard clock to a number of local timepieces. The circuits of these were to be electrified by a key or contact-maker actuated by the arbour of the standard, and their hands corrected by electro-magnetism. The following January Alexander Bain took out a patent for an electro-magnetic clock, and he subsequently charged Wheatstone with appropriating his ideas. It appears that Bain worked as a mechanist to Wheatstone from August to December 1840, and he asserted that he had communicated the idea of an <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> to Wheatstone during that period; but Wheatstone maintained that he had experimented in that direction during May. Bain further accused Wheatstone of stealing his idea of the electro-magnetic printing telegraph; but Wheatstone showed that the instrument was only a modification of his own electro-magnetic telegraph.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> had {{prominent}} pendulums {{because this}} was a familiar shape and design. Smaller clocks and watches with a spiral-balance are made on the same principles as pendulum clocks.|$|R
50|$|Electromagnetic clocks keep {{time with}} a {{pendulum}} or balance wheel, but the pulses {{to keep it going}} are not provided by a mechanical movement and escapement linkage, but by magnetic force from an electromagnet (solenoid). This was the mechanism used in the first <b>electric</b> <b>clocks,</b> and is found in antique <b>electric</b> pendulum <b>clocks.</b> It is also found in a few modern decorative mantel and desk clocks.|$|R
50|$|In Roman Piekarski's own words: When {{we started}} {{collecting}} in the 1970s {{no one wanted}} them because battery and <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> were all the rage. We picked many up for next to nothing.|$|R
25|$|Several {{factors were}} {{incorporated}} into the compact Nash Rambler's marketing mix that including making the most from the limited steel supplies during the Korean War, {{as well as the}} automaker selecting a strategy for profit maximization from the new Rambler line. The new Nash Rambler came only in a convertible body, a style that had a higher price in the marketplace and incorporating more standard features that make the open top models suitable more for leisure-type use than ordinary transportation. With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> and even a pushbutton AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking gas cap, among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|E
50|$|The Church of St Peter in Hornblotton {{was built}} in 1872-74 by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, for the rector, Geoffrey Thring. It is a Grade I listed building, and {{features}} {{one of the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> produced.|$|R
5000|$|To allow {{customers}} to use <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> regulated by synchronous motors, a Frequency [...] "Indicator" [...] {{was added to}} the Powerhouse switchboard. To allow parallel alternators and power grid, a Synchroscope {{was added to the}} Switch Panel.|$|R

2500|$|The Gran Torino Brougham {{featured}} the finest upholsteries in the Torino line-up, including nylon cloth fabrics and [...] "leather like" [...] vinyl. Standard equipment included a {{front bench seat}} with a fold down armrest, woodgrained trim on the instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> bright pedal pad trim, and a dual note horn. The Squire wagon was trimmed similarly to the Brougham. [...] The comfortweave inserts were no longer offered in the Torino for 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the {{straight}} eight engine. Standard 98 equipment included safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump, cigarette lighter, and a solenoid starter system. Upholstery was either custom broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] An <b>electric</b> <b>clock</b> was standard in 1947. A record 37,140 98s were sold in 1947.|$|E
50|$|During {{the year}} of 1914 , a three story {{concrete}} school was built with a concrete shop in the rear for vocational training. Every classroom now had <b>electric</b> <b>clocks.</b> The original frame building was moved to Briggs school (an elementary school).|$|R
50|$|In {{episode number}} 6 of the 2006 CBS series, Jericho, a missile {{launched}} by unknown agents {{from within the}} United States causes a high-altitude nuclear electromagnetic pulse. The episode was titled 9:02 after the time at which all <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> stopped running.|$|R
50|$|Because of this, these motors {{are often}} used to drive <b>electric</b> <b>clocks</b> and, occasionally, {{phonograph}} turntables. In these applications, {{the speed of the}} motor is as accurate as the frequency of the mains power applied to the motor.These motors are also used in shavers.|$|R
2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, <b>electric</b> <b>clock,</b> special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission.
