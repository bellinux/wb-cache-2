5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by <b>encapsulating</b> organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by <b>encapsulating</b> certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{scenarios}} where customized allocators are desirable.

In particular, programs with many frequent allocations of small amounts of memory may benefit greatly from specialized allocators, both in terms of running time and memory footprint.|$|E

To investigate whether macrophages on overgrown capsules affect neighboring nonovergrown <b>encapsulated</b> islets, <b>encapsulated</b> islets were studied during coculture.

Coculture was associated with inhibition of the stimulated insulin secretion, with decreased cell replication, and with increased cell necrosis, but not with apoptosis of <b>encapsulated</b> islet cells. mRNA expression levels in <b>encapsulated</b> islets after coculture were not different from controls, except for a decrease in Bax mRNA.
