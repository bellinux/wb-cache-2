5|$|The album {{maintains}} the ska punk and reggae influences of the band's previous work, but with slower, more ballad-like songs. The lyrics {{to many of}} the songs describe singer Gwen Stefani's pining for a more domestic life, contrasting that with <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to a music career.|$|E
5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006.

5|$|Due to <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to the band, Turunen was {{not able}} to {{concentrate}} sufficiently on her schoolwork and her academic studies were interrupted. In 1998, Nightwish published their second album, Oceanborn. This album lacked the earlier elements of folk and ambient music, and instead focused on fast, melodic keyboard and guitar lines and Turunen's dramatic voice. In addition to the Oceanborn Europe Tour (1999), Turunen sang solo in Waltari's rock-themed ballet Evankeliumi (also known as Evangelicum) in several sold-out performances at the Finnish National Opera. In 2000 and 2001, Nightwish recorded Wishmaster and Over the Hills and Far Away and toured Europe and South America (the Wishmaster World Tour). During the Wishmaster World Tour, Turunen met Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli whom she married in 2003.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to what she {{believed}} in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to {{and appreciation of}} feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E

5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe {{to gain a}} professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.|$|E
5|$|Because of the Pandavas' ruined {{financial}} state, Balarama's wife, Revati, {{refuses to}} honour <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her {{support for the}} alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the forests to Ghatotkacha hermitage. Ghatotkacha, {{who happens to be}} Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead to try some trickery in Dvaraka. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, he carries the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, {{with the help of his}} assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.|$|E
5|$|Jim briefly {{transfers}} to Stamford branch after Pam confirms <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to Roy. Corporate is later forced to merge the Stamford branch and staff into the Scranton branch. Included in the transfer to Scranton are Karen Filippelli, with whom Jim {{has developed a}} relationship, and the anger-prone Andy Bernard. Pam is newly single after calling off her marriage and relationship to Roy prior to the merger, and Jim's unresolved feelings for her and new relationship with Karen lead to shifting tensions amongst the three. Meanwhile, Michael and Jan's relationship escalates which causes them both to behave erratically on the job while Dwight and Angela continue their secret relationship. In the season's finale, Jim, Karen, and Michael interview for a corporate position {{that turns out to}} be Jan's, who is fired that day for poor performance. Jim wins and rejects the offer off-screen, opting instead to return to Scranton without Karen and asks Pam out on a date, which she joyfully accepts.

5|$|Published posthumously, The Autobiography of MalcolmX is {{an account}} of the life of MalcolmX, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book {{describes}} Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, {{the death of his father}} under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. MalcolmX was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of MalcolmX's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.|$|E
5|$|She {{applied to}} {{participate}} in the CBS reality competition show The Amazing Race 16 with NASCAR Truck Series driver Jennifer Jo Cobb as her teammate but both were cut from the program. Robinson was invited to donate memorabilia to the NASCAR Hall of Fame but did not send anything because of <b>her</b> <b>commitment</b> to audition for The Amazing Race 16. She was involved with the planning and decorating for Kelley Earnhardt Miller's marriage in 2011. In March 2014, Robinson was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, which she was told had also spread to her lymph nodes. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy which caused 18 lymph nodes and a lump in her breast to be removed. Robinson was cared for by her mother-in-law for seven months. Her friends ran her businesses on her behalf, and Earnhardt Miller along with Dale Earnhardt Jr., ran fundraising events to help Robinson pay her medical bills. She later entered remission, and completed her final radiation treatment in September 2015.|$|E
