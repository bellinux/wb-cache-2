40|$|By binding {{to their}} cognate GPCRs, many potent mitogens such as neuropeptides, {{angiotensin}} II or lysophosphatidic acid stimulate cell proliferation via engaging the ERK/MAPK cascade. As mentioned before, agonists stimulating Gq/ 11 -coupled receptors activate PLCb isoforms thereby activating PKCs and elevating [Ca 2 +]i. These two second messengers represent <b>key</b> molecules <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> Gq/ 11 proteins to the ERK/MAPK cascade. In this work, {{by means of}} GnRH in gonadotropic aT 3 - 1 cells and galanin or bradykinin in SCLC cells, different aspects of Gq/ 11 -dependent mitogenic signaling pathways were revealed. Our findings together with previous reports underline the notion that signaling pathways emanating from Gq/ 11 -coupled receptors are tightly regulated in a cell- and receptor-specific manner...|$|R
40|$|Coupling of Rab GTPase {{activation}} and SNARE complex assembly during membrane fusion {{is poorly}} understood. The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex links these two processes: {{it is an}} effector for the vacuolar Rab GTPase Ypt 7 p and is required for vacuolar SNARE complex assembly. We now report that pure, active HOPS complex binds phosphoinositides and the PX domain of the vacuolar SNARE protein Vam 7 p. These binding interactions support HOPS complex association with the vacuole and explain its enrichment at the same microdomains on docked vacuoles as phosphoinositides, Ypt 7 p, Vam 7 p, and the other SNARE proteins. Concentration of the HOPS complex at these microdomains may be a <b>key</b> factor <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> Rab GTPase activation to SNARE complex assembly...|$|R
40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{understanding of}} the interface between cells and nanostructures {{is one of the}} <b>key</b> challenges <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> electrically excitable cells and electronic devices. Recently, various 3 D nanostructures have been introduced to stimulate and record electrical signals emanating from inside of the cell. Even though such approaches are highly sensitive and scalable, it remains an open question how cells couple to 3 D structures, in particular how the engulfment-like processes of nanostructures work. Here, we present a profound study of the cell interface with two widely used nanostructure types, cylindrical pillars with and without a cap. While basic functionality was shown for these approaches before, a systematic investigation linking experimental data with membrane properties was not presented so far. The combination of electron microscopy investigations with a theoretical membrane deformation model allows us to predict the optimal shape and dimensions of 3 D nanostructures <b>for</b> cell-chip <b>coupling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Deductive {{reasoning}} lies in {{the expressive}} intersection of Datalog and Description Logics. In this paper, we present the D 2 R 2 engine, which implements deductive reasoning capabilities based on the Query-Sub-Query (QSQR) algorithm {{on top of the}} disk-oriented RDF- 3 X engine. D 2 R 2 aims {{to bridge the gap between}} rule-oriented (inten-sional) reasoning with deduction rules and data-oriented (extensional) processing of large joins, over a set of highly tuned, disk-based index structures for large RDF collections. We present a generalization of QSQR, which allows for dynamic sub-query scheduling and chaining of extensional predicates into atomic join patterns—two <b>key</b> extensions <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> QSQR with a disk-oriented storage backend. Experiments over a set of recursive queries and a very large knowledge base, consisting of 20 million RDF facts, as well as comparisons to disk-oriented reasoning engines, confirm the practical viability and significant runtime improve-ments of D 2 R 2 compared to these engines...|$|R

Accounting for the reflectivity of the mirror we infer a photon collection efficiency of 54. 8 % for our setup. The underlying experimentally detected maximum fluorescence rate is 1. 91 x 10 (6) s(- 1) from a single Yb- 174 (+) ion, mainly limited by the quantum efficiency of our photon detector. Besides the high collection efficiency, the integration of an ion trap into a parabolic mirror is a <b>key</b> ingredient <b>for</b> efficient <b>coupling</b> of light to a single ion in free space...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaf-area index}} (LAI) is a <b>key</b> {{parameter}} <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> earth-observation data with crop-growth models {{from the perspective}} of crop-yield forecasting. Remote sensing is of particular interest in estimating LAI over large areas. SAR data, thanks to their systematic acquisition, offer an ideal temporal resolution throughout the crop-growing season. Nevertheless, surface soil dielectric permittivity, which is strongly correlated with soil moisture, also affects the SAR signal. Thus, surface-soil permittivity or moisture has to be taken into account. This study tackles the issues related to soil influence on the SAR signal in monitoring maize crop growth. Different methods of assessing surface-soil moisture or permittivity are explored in order to retrieve LAI values from SAR data. The first method is based on a hydrological model * the soil, water, atmosphere, and plant (SWAP) model * with which the surface-soil moisture level can be estimated as a function of time. This method is tested with two kinds of meteorological data as inputs for the hydrological model: ground meteorological data and estimated meteorological data. The second method resorts to ground-penetrating radar, an alternative means of estimating surface-soil permittivity. This study demonstrates that both soil-moisture levels estimated by the SWAP model and soil permittivity measured by ground-penetrating radar can be successfully used for retrieving maize LAI values from SAR data using the water cloud model...|$|R

We present {{a simple and}} intuitive leaky-mode phase-matching model using a ray-optics approach to determine the conditions <b>for</b> efficient <b>coupling,</b> both in 2 D and 3 D structures. It is shown {{that the presence of}} leaky modes that are phase-matched between the waveguide and the Si or Ge photodetector layer is the <b>key</b> condition <b>for</b> efficient <b>coupling.</b> Our approach was compared to other methods, such as finite-difference time domain (FDTD) /beam propagation method (BPM) and mode analysis. We report that, depending on the way a waveguide photodetector device is designed, waveguide-to-photodetector coupling efficiency {{may or may not be}} critically sensitive to design parameters, such as the photodetector layer thickness. As an example, the stark contrast of coupling behavior in the two most popular Ge photodetector structures integrated with Si rib waveguide versus channel waveguide is shown. The device design factors and the trends that affect such coupling sensitivity are identified and explained in the paper...|$|R

Here we report the temperature-dependent thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of monolayer MoS_ 2 with AlN and SiO_ 2, using Raman thermometry with laser-induced heating. The temperature-dependent {{optical absorption of}} the 2 D material is crucial in such experiments, which we characterize {{here for the first}} time above room temperature. We obtain TBC 15 MWm^-^ 2 K^-^ 1 near room temperature, increasing as T^ 0 ^. ^ 2 up to 300 C. The similar TBC of MoS_ 2 with the two substrates indicates that MoS_ 2 is the "softer" material with weaker phonon irradiance, and the relatively low TBC signifies that such interfaces present a key bottleneck in energy dissipation from 2 D devices. Our approach is needed to correctly perform Raman thermometry of 2 D materials, and our findings are <b>key</b> <b>for</b> understanding energy <b>coupling</b> at the nanoscale...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} dynamics {{model and}} qualitative analysis are presented {{to study the}} <b>key</b> effective factors <b>for</b> <b>coupled</b> axial/torsional vibrations of a drill string, which {{is described as a}} simplified, equivalent, flexible shell under axial rotation. Here, after dimensionless processing, the mathematical models are obtained accounting <b>for</b> the <b>coupling</b> of axial and torsional vibrations using the nonlinear dynamics qualitative method, in which excitation loads and boundary conditions of the drill string are simplified to a rotating, flexible shell. The analysis of dynamics responses is performed by means of the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method, in which the rules that govern the changing of the torsional and axial excitation are revealed, and suggestions for engineering applications are also given. The simulation analysis shows that when the drill string is in a lower-speed rotation zone, the torsional excitation is the key factor in the coupling vibration, and increasing the torsional stress of the drill string more easily leads to the coupling vibration; however, when the drill string is in a higher-speed rotating zone, the axial excitation is a key factor in the coupling vibration, and the axial stress in a particular interval more easily leads to the coupling vibration of the drill string...|$|R

Previous researches suggest that, the problems of the working women, who are a significant part of a dual career couple, may include lack of flexibility in the workplace, male-trailing spouses, career versus relationship child bearing conflicts etc. The <b>key</b> <b>for</b> dual career <b>couples</b> is to establish a system to help them balance their career and personal activities. <b>For</b> each <b>couple</b> the dynamics are little different, depending on their personal situations.

40|$|AbstractComplex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase) {{is central}} to {{cellular}} aerobic energy metabolism, and its deficiency is involved in many human mitochondrial diseases. Complex I translocates protons across the membrane using electron transfer energy. Semiquinone (SQ) intermediates appearing during catalysis are suggested to be <b>key</b> <b>for</b> the <b>coupling</b> mechanism in complex I. However, the existence of SQ has remained controversial due to the extreme difficulty in detecting unstable and low intensity SQ signals. Here, {{for the first time}} with Escherichia coli complex I reconstituted in proteoliposomes, we successfully resolved and characterized three distinct SQ species by EPR. These species include: fast-relaxing SQ (SQNf) with P 1 / 2 (half-saturation power level) > 50 mW and a wider linewidth (12. 8 G); slow-relaxing SQ (SQNs) with P 1 / 2 = 2 – 3 mW and a 10 G linewidth; and very slow-relaxing SQ (SQNvs) with P 1 / 2 = ~ 0. 1 mW and a 7. 5 G linewidth. The SQNf signals completely disappeared in the presence of the uncoupler gramicidin D or squamotacin, a potent E. coli complex I inhibitor. The pH dependency of the SQNf signals correlated with the proton-pumping activities of complex I. The SQNs signals were insensitive to gramicidin D, but sensitive to squamotacin. The SQNvs signals were insensitive to both gramicidin D and squamotacin. Our deuterium exchange experiments suggested that SQNf is neutral, while SQNs and SQNvs are anion radicals. The SQNs signals were lost in the ΔNuoL mutant missing transporter module subunits NuoL and NuoM. The roles and relationships of the SQ intermediates in the coupling mechanism are discussed...|$|R
40|$|CLC-ec 1, a {{bacterial}} homologue of the CLC family’s transporter subclass, catalyzes transmembrane exchange of Cl− and H+. Mutational analysis {{based on the}} known structure reveals several <b>key</b> residues required <b>for</b> <b>coupling</b> H+ to the stoichiometric countermovement of Cl−. E 148 (Gluex) transfers protons between extracellular water and the protein interior, and E 203 (Gluin) is thought to function analogously on the intracellular face of the protein. Mutation of either residue eliminates H+ transport while preserving Cl− transport. We tested the role of Gluin by examining structural and functional properties of mutants at this position. Certain dissociable side chains (E, D, H, K, R, but not C and Y) retain H+/Cl− exchanger activity to varying degrees, while other mutations (V, I, or C) abolish H+ coupling and severely inhibit Cl− flux. Transporters substituted with other nonprotonatable side chains (Q, S, and A) show highly impaired H+ transport with substantial Cl− transport. Influence on H+ transport of side chain length and acidity was assessed using a single-cysteine mutant to introduce non-natural side chains. Crystal structures of both coupled (E 203 H) and uncoupled (E 203 V) mutants are similar to wild type. The results {{support the idea that}} Gluin is the internal proton-transfer residue that delivers protons from intracellular solution to the protein interior, where they couple to Cl− movements to bring about Cl−/H+ exchange...|$|R

40|$|Enhancing the {{selectivity}} of catalytic processes {{has potential}} for substantially increasing {{the sustainability of}} chemical production. Herein, we establish relationships between reaction selectivity and molecular structure for a homologous series of <b>key</b> intermediates <b>for</b> oxidative <b>coupling</b> of alcohols on gold {{using a combination of}} experiment and theory. We establish a scale of binding for molecules with different alkyl structures and chain lengths and thereby demonstrate the critical nature of noncovalent van der Waals interactions in determining the selectivity by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates bound to the surface. The binding hierarchy is the same for Au(111) and Au(110), which demonstrates a relative lack of sensitivity to the surface structure. The hierarchy of binding established in this work provides guiding principles for predicting how molecular structure affects the competition for binding sites more broadly. Besides the nature of the primary surface-molecule bonding, three additional factors that affect the stabilities of the reactive intermediates are clearly established: (1) the number of C atoms in the alkyl chain, (2) the presence of C–C bond unsaturation, and (3) the degree of branching of the alkyl group of the adsorbed molecules. We suggest that this is a fundamental principle that is generally applicable to a broad range of reactions on metal catalysts...|$|R
40|$|Analyzing {{subduction}} initiation is <b>key</b> <b>for</b> {{understanding the}} <b>coupling</b> between plate tectonics {{and the underlying}} mantle. Here we focus on suprasubduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites and how their formation links to intraoceanic subduction initiation in an absolute plate motion frame. SSZ ophiolites form the majority of exposed oceanic lithosphere fragments and are widely recognized to have formed during intraoceanic subduction initiation. Structural, petrological, geochemical, and plate kinematic constraints on their kinematic evolution show that SSZ crust forms at fore-arc spreading centers {{at the expense of}} a mantle wedge, thereby flattening the nascent slab. This leads to the typical inverted pressure gradients found in metamorphic soles that form at the subduction plate contact below and during SSZ crust crystallization. Former spreading centers are preserved in forearcs when subduction initiates along transform faults or off-ridge oceanic detachments. We show how these are reactivated when subduction initiates in the absolute plate motion direction of the inverting weakness zone. Upon inception of slab pull due to, e. g., eclogitization, the sole is separated from the slab, remains welded to the thinned overriding plate lithosphere, and can become intruded by mafic dikes upon asthenospheric influx into the mantle wedge. We propound that most ophiolites thus formed under special geodynamic circumstances and may not be representative of normal oceanic crust. Our study highlights how far-field geodynamic processes and absolute plate motions may force intraoceanic subduction initiation as key toward advancing our understanding of the entire plate tectonic cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multidrug {{resistance}} of tumors, characterized by resistance against {{a variety of}} chemically unrelated anticancer agents, {{can be caused by}} overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, such as P-glycoprotein and MRP 1. These multidrug-resistance proteins are plasma-membrane proteins that actively extrude chemotherapeutic agents from the cell interior, decreasing drug accumulation and thus, allowing the cells to survive in the presence of toxic levels of anticancer agents. ABC proteins contain multispanning transmembrane domains and nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The NBDs are responsible for the ATP binding/hydrolysis that drives drug transport, and their structure is conserved independently of the degree of primary-sequence homology. The transmembrane domains contain the drug-binding sites that are likely located in a flexible internal chamber that is sufficiently large to accommodate different drugs. It has been recently proposed that dimerization of the NBDs induced by ATP binding is a <b>key</b> step <b>for</b> the <b>coupling</b> of ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport. The power stroke for substrate transport can be the formation or the dissociation of the dimers. Since the NBDs and TMDs are tightly associated, association/dissociation of the NBDs may control the “gate ” of the translocation pathway, formed by intracellular loops. In the case of P-glycoprotein it seems that the power stroke for transport is ATP binding (and therefore NBD dimerization), and not hydrolysis, because the major conformational and functional changes seem to occur at this step...|$|R
