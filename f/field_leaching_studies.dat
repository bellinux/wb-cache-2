40|$|This review {{summarizes}} current {{knowledge from}} the literature and experimental studies {{on the role of}} cover crops (CCs) in reducing nitrogen (N) leaching and phosphorus (P) losses to waters under the marine and humid continental climate conditions of southern Scandinavia and Finland. <b>Field</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>studies</b> from 11 sites indicate that undersown ryegrass (Lolium spp.) CCs are robust, with average N uptake in aboveground CC biomass of 7 to 38 kg N ha(- 1) (6. 2 to 34 lb N ac(- 1)). Use of CCs sown at harvest (e. g., crucifers) is restricted to southern Scandinavia for climate reasons. The mean relative reduction in N leaching reported for all CCs investigated was 43 %, but it ranged between 62 % increase instead of a reduction after a red clover (Trifolium pratense) CC on a clay soil to a reduction of 85 % to 89 % with a perennial ryegrass CC on sandy soils in Denmark (36 to 51 kg ha(- 1) [32 to 46 lb ac(- 1) ]). The data indicate that CCs do not substantially reduce total P losses by runoff and leaching. The effects of CCs on total P leaching varied between a relative increase of 86 % and a decrease of 43 %. Climate conditions involving freezing-thawing during winter increased the risk of losses of dissolved P from CC biomass. CCs have been implemented to varying degrees into agri-environmental programs. They are mandatory in Denmark and subsidized in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. CCs are grown on 8 % of arable land in Denmark, 5 % in Sweden, 1 % in Finland, and 0. 5 % in Norway, but CC area is now increasing dramatically in Finland due to a new subsidy program. In all countries there is a need, and potential, for increased use of CCs, but there are several constraints, particularly reduced interest among farmers. There is a clear need to identify CC systems and develop implementation strategies for appropriate distribution of CCs on different soils and regions with respect to required reductions in N leaching and P losses. For this, more knowledge is required, especially about the effect of CCs on P losses (e. g., the effect of species with different partitioning between shoot and root biomass and the effects of CC systems with harvesting of biomass). There is also a need to devise balanced solutions for maintaining and increasing the frequency of CCs in crop rotations to exploit the possible benefits of CCs in reducing nutrient losses. 201...|$|E
30|$|Historically, pre-mining {{overburden}} {{analysis to}} minimize water quality impacts has focused upon conventional ABA (Sobek et al. 2000) since discharge pH, SO 42 −, Fe and Mn levels {{have been the}} principal compliance parameters. The seminal study by Skousen et al. (2002) demonstrated that conventional ABA was effective at predicting and limiting strongly acidic discharge from central Appalachian coal mines. However, little if any work {{has been reported to}} date on the utility of either ABA or other techniques to predict bulk TDS, primarily due the fact that regulatory pressure on TDS discharge is relatively recent. Several significant recent studies are documented below including the large scale <b>field</b> spoil <b>leaching</b> <b>study</b> by Agouridis et al.

40|$|Background: As {{part of the}} Dutch {{authorisation}} procedure for pesticides, {{an assessment of the}} effects on aquatic organisms in surface waters adjacent to agricultural fields is required. The peak concentration is considered {{to be the most important}} exposure endpoint for the ecotoxicological effect assessment. Macropore flow is an important driver for the peak concentration, so the leaching model PEARL was extended with a macropore module. The new model has two macropore domains: a bypass domain and an internal catchment domain. The model was tested against data from a <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>study</b> on a cracking clay soil in the Netherlands. Results: Most parameters of the model could be obtained from site-specific measurements, pedotransfer functions and general soil structural knowledge; only three macropore-flow-related parameters needed calibration. The flow-related macropore parameters could not be calibrated without using the concentration in drain water. Sequential calibration strategies, in which firstly the water flow model and then the pesticide fate model are calibrated, may therefore be less suitable for preferential flow models. Conclusion: After calibration, PEARL could simulate well the observed rapid movement towards drains of two pesticides with contrasting sorption and degradation rate properties. The calibrated value for the fraction of the internal catchment domain was high (90 %). This means that a large fraction of water entering the macropores infiltrates into the soil matrix, thus reducing the fraction of rapid flow...|$|R
40|$|Testing of {{pesticide}} leaching models {{is important to}} increase confidence in their use in pesticide registration procedures world-wide. The chromatographic PEARL model was tested against {{the results of a}} <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>study</b> on a cracking clay soil with a tracer (bromide), a mobile pesticide (bentazone) and a moderately sorbing, persistent pesticide (imidacloprid). Input parameters for water flow and solute transport were obtained from site-specific measurements and from literature. The model was tested using a stepwise approach in which each sub-model was sequentially and separately tested. Uncalibrated simulations for the water flow resulted in moisture profiles that were too wet. Calibration of the hydraulic relationships resulted in a good description of the moisture profiles. Calibration of the dispersion length was necessary to obtain a good description of bromide leaching. The calibrated dispersion length was 61 cm, which is very long and indicates a large non-uniformity of solute transport. The half-life of bentazone had to be calibrated to obtain a good description of its field persistence. The calibrated half-life was 2. 5 times shorter than the half-life derived from the laboratory studies. Concentrations of bentazone in drain water and groundwater were described reasonably well by PEARL. Although measured and simulated persistence of imidacloprid in soil corresponded well, the bulk of the imidacloprid movement was overestimated by PEARL. However, imidacloprid concentrations in drain water were underestimated. In spite of the extensive calibration of water flow and tracer movement, the behaviour of the moderately sorbing pesticide imidacloprid could not be simulated. This indicates that the convection-dispersion equation cannot be used for accurate simulation {{of pesticide}} transport in cracking clay soils (even if extremely long dispersion length is used). Comparison of the model results from a poorly sorbed chemical (bentazone) and a moderately sorbed chemical (imidacloprid) were useful in defining the limitations of using a chromatographic flow model to simulate the effects of preferential flow...|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} 30  years, many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} gain a better prediction of the complex interactions occurring in weathering mine spoils via a variety of techniques and some of the more notable examples are discussed below. Caruccio et al. (1993) performed an overburden analysis and leachate prediction study comparing acid–base accounting, humidity weathering cells, column tests (large and small), and Soxhlet reactors for the purpose of predicting <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> conditions. They concluded that the leaching columns provided the best approximations of field weathering conditions. Historically, column <b>leaching</b> <b>studies</b> have been favored for the more accurate prediction of pH/acidity generation via pyrite oxidation, TDS release from mine spoil, and the kinetics of trace metal leaching (Hood and Oertel 1984; Halverson and Gentry 1990; Caruccio et al. 1993; Daniels et al. 2009; Orndorff et al. 2010). However, column <b>leaching</b> <b>studies</b> are labor intensive and take many months to complete while static tests such as the components of ABA (pyritic-S, neutralization potentials, etc.) are completed quickly at much lower relative cost. It is also {{important to point out that}} while certain authors (e.g. Vengosh et al. 2013) refer to short-term solution: solid extracts of crushed spoils as “leaching tests”, such procedures are short-term lab extractions and do not provide the kinetic/temporal data of column or <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> trials.|$|R

The thesis {{is focused on}} field weathering rates and variations in the chemical composition of water with time and space. Variations in weathering rates of silicate minerals are important for the global CO 2 cycle, and thus also for climatic changes. Soil, soil water, groundwater, and stream water samples have been collected and analyzed. Complementary to the <b>field</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>leaching</b> experiments in the laboratory have also been performed.

In this study SWAP and LEACHC models were used for the simulation of soil moisture profile and salinity, and the results were compared with those of a <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> experiment. The SWAP model gave better results in simulating soil moisture movement and profile, compared to LEACHC model, but statistical indexes showed that both models produced satisfactory results in predicting soil moisture profile. LEACHC model gave better results in comparison to SWAP model for the prediction of soil salinity profile at different time, possibly because it takes into account different solute transport mechanisms such as advection, diffusion, dispersion and also chemical interactions such as adsorption, precipitation and dissolution. In spite of the differences between predicted and measured values of salinity in the initial stages of leaching process, both models were able to predict the trend of leaching process with an acceptable accuracy...|$|R

Physiochemical and biological analyses included biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, turbidity, human sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (HSBB), fecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC) tests. Membrane filtration was used to isolate human sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (HSBB), fecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC).

3000|$|Our column <b>leaching</b> <b>studies</b> {{combined}} with the field lysimeter studies of Agouridis et al. (2012) clearly indicate that TDS release potential from non-acid forming spoils should drop quickly once {{they are exposed to}} leaching. However, a recent extensive study by Evans et al. (2014) of the actual long-term TDS discharge response of a large number (n >  100) of valley fills in SW Virginia indicates that the time for discharge SC to decline below 500  µs/cm was 10 – 15  years, on average, beyond final revegetation. The reason for this time lag in field behavior has not been determined, but is most likely due to a combination of factors including (a) changes in leachate flow paths/macroporosity over time, (b) the heterogeneity of spoils placed in valley fills before current concerns over TDS emerged, (c) the large spoil volumes that have been placed in the valley fills relative to annual rainwater infiltration, and (d) contributions from deep mine influenced groundwater seepage into valley fill drainage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{undertake}} an initial step that would lead to a better understanding of the effects of nutrients released from vegetation inundated by water at newly constructed reservoirs. Specifically, a series of <b>leaching</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted on representative grasses, herbage and trees to determine the relative nutrient release rates of nitrogen and phosphorous. In addition, a limited field study was conducted as well as a vegetation inventory of a proposed Bureau of Reclamation reservoir near Edna, Texas. The results of the <b>leaching</b> <b>study</b> were presented as percent nutrients released from the various types of vegetation as a function of time. The total quantity and rate of nutrient release varied greatly depending upon the type of vegetation. As an example, nutrients released from grasses and herbage proved to be released at a greater rate, contain a greater quantity of nutrients per unit weight of vegetation and generally be more available in greater quantities based on weight per unit area than for trees. This indicated that although trees are often the only vegetation removed from a reservior site, the amount of nutrients available for release by the herbage and grasses will probably have a much more significant impact on reservoir water quality and should be considered in the reservoir clearing policy.
