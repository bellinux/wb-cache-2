40|$|In a {{previous}} research, a preliminary {{analysis on the}} thermal balance in different crushing systems for olive oil production was carried out. According to the previous results, in this paper the study has been extended to power consumption aspects related to the main quality features of the extracted olive oil, restricting the analysis only to the <b>hammer</b> <b>crushing</b> (Coratina cultivar), which represents the worst case. In particular, {{the effect of the}} olives delivery on the power consumption and quality of the extracted oil has been studied. The experimental trials, carried out on a laboratory plant during the 1993 - 94 and 1994 - 95 olive-oil seasons, show that, even though the diagram of power consumption has a parabolic increasing trend, the specific power decreases with the olives delivery. Anyway, studying the olives <b>hammer</b> <b>crushing</b> process also from the qualitative point of view (polyphenols number, acidity, peroxide number and induction time), it is possible to define an optimal range of olives delivery values. This optimal range (140 kg/h- 240 kg/h for the studied <b>hammer</b> <b>crusher)</b> represents the better working solution from both {{the point of view of}} the power consumption and the quality of the extracted oil. In particular, at the beginning of the olive oil season it is necessary to work near the greatest lower bound of the optimal range just defined.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental and numerical studies of the comparative behavior of square hollow section (SHS) tubes filled with rigid polyurethane foam (RPF) and concrete undergoing transverse impact loading. A series of instrumented <b>drop</b> <b>hammer</b> tests were performed on mild steel and stainless steel SHSs for both filled and unfilled constructions. The concrete-filled tubes had the highest impact resistance and energy absorption capacity, followed by the steel tubes filled with RPF, and then the hollow tubes. The results also show that RPFs can be used as an effective infill material in structural steel hollow columns when expedient enhancement of the energy absorption capacity is required, e. g., to increase blast and impact resistance of hollow structural elements. Nonlinear dynamic finite-element analyses were carried out to simulate <b>drop</b> <b>hammer</b> test conditions.

40|$|Fittings and {{fixtures}} in horse stables {{may cause}} injuries to horses when trapped {{and there is}} a great risk of an accident to animal and handler when releasing a horse. The risk of injuries to horses and handlers must be minimised by correct structural design and appropriate choice of building material. The physical load of horse kicks were measured in order to obtain data for the design of safe horse fittings and fixtures. To record the forces exerted by horse kicks a measuring wall and a computerised measuring system were constructed and used in single horse boxes. For reference, the characteristics of the measuring system were determined by a <b>drop</b> <b>hammer</b> test. Through regression analysis a linear relation was found between the field recorded impact values from horse kicks obtained by the measuring system and <b>drop</b> <b>hammer</b> impact values. The <b>drop</b> <b>hammer</b> method can thus be used to test fittings. Impacts recorded in the field tests were rapid, often shorter than 0. 03 s and 90 % had a maximum value below 1924 N. The greatest impact force and impulse caused by a horse kick were 8722 N and 131 N s respectively, with no statistical difference between provoked and unprovoked kicks. Considering the data obtained and allowing a certain safety margin, the impact resistance of horse fixtures and fittings in single horse boxes, to be used for horses of up to 700 kg mass, should be at least equivalent to 150 Ns exerted by a horse shoe at 45 °...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or {{installed}} {{by use of}} an auger. Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: <b>drop</b> <b>hammers,</b> diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air <b>hammers.</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>hammers</b> simply <b>drop</b> a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.|$|R
