50|$|The <b>flush</b> <b>timer</b> {{controls}} {{the time between}} the route is invalidated or marked as unreachable and removal of entry from the routing table. By default the value is 240 seconds. This is 60 seconds longer than Invalid timer. So for 60 seconds the router will be advertising about this unreachable route to all its neighbours. This timer must be set to a higher value than the invalid timer.|$|E
30|$|Deadline timer for staging queue Use of wait timer {{alone can}} cause starvation, as staging queue SQ_p which always gets enqueued with request(s) before wait(SQ_p) expires {{will never be}} flushed. Additionally, a non-bulky process might suffer due to large wait time. To avoid such {{situations}} BID employs a deadline timer. The deadline timer deadline(SQ_p) of a staging queue SQ_p indicates maximum allowable time the queue SQ_p can exists before marked for flushing. The deadline of a staged queue SQ_p depends {{on the type of}} requests in the staging queue SQ_p. If there are only non-blocking I/Os (writes) in SQ_p, deadline(SQ_p) is set initially to 5000  ms. Whenever a blocking I/O (read) request is enqueued to SQ_p, the deadline(SQ_p) is set to 500  ms if its current value is more than 500  ms. The reseting of deadline deadline(SQ_p) ensures that blocking I/Os do not encounter higher delays. Whenever deadline(SQ_p) expires, SQ_p is marked for <b>flushing.</b> The deadline <b>timer</b> also ensures that a process with high disk I/O (bulky) does not starve another process with lighter disk I/O (non-bulky).|$|R
