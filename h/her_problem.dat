5|$|Back in the car, Jack {{begins to}} lose {{confidence}} in his problem-solving abilities because Liz still wants to break up with Carol. As they talk through Liz's past problems with sex, they {{realize that they are}} all connected to the incident with the Tom Jones poster and that each time she has had a problem, it is because she has been reminded of the singer. Liz is relieved that she has found the root of <b>her</b> <b>problem</b> and Jack convinces her to stay with Carol. When they finally reach Newark Airport, Liz realizes that she is supposed to meet him at John F. Kennedy International Airport instead.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs {{to the site}} of the grounding with the hope that they would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound <b>her</b> <b>problem</b> she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{agrees to}} give sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{a ride to}} Newark Liberty International Airport to meet her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). On the way, she tells him that she is having {{intimacy}} issues with Carol and wants to end the relationship. Jack, who is having a successful run of problem-solving, encourages Liz to confide in him {{so that he can}} help solve <b>her</b> <b>problem.</b> She tells him of a traumatic incident from her childhood when, preparing to use the bathroom whilst wearing roller skates, she pulled down her underpants and fell, pulling a Tom Jones poster on top of her. Her mother (Anita Gillette) discovered Liz under the poster and suspected her of masturbating, so she took all her posters away. With their limousine stuck in traffic, Jack exits the vehicle to try to digest Liz's story.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{problems}} faced by the main female character, Blanche Dubois, in Tennessee William?s A Streetcar Named Desire. I try to explore her internal and external <b>problems,</b> <b>her</b> ways in overcoming <b>problems,</b> and finally <b>her</b> failure in solving <b>her</b> <b>problems.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to show Blanche?s problems, both past and present ones, and also her attempts to solve them. Besides, I also want to show that her failure in overcoming <b>her</b> <b>problems</b> is due to internal and external factors. In my study, I use literary approach, while the psychological concepts such as inferiority, loneliness, lying, and illusion are used to identify Blanche Dubois?s problems and to show the way she solves <b>her</b> <b>problems.</b> In the analysis, I find out that despite Blanche?s present problems, she actually has brought many unsolved problems from the past. <b>Her</b> past <b>problems</b> are related to her family?s and husband?s death while <b>her</b> present <b>problems</b> happen in <b>her</b> trying to start a new life, including her serious conflict with her brother-in-law. The encounter between them and the external factors such as her up bringing and dependency on other people, her inability to face the reality, the abandonment done by Mitch - a man who likes her, and the rape done by her brother-in-law finally become the reasons of her failure in overcoming <b>her</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

25|$|Other {{treatment}} methods {{may be used}} in psychiatric emergency service settings. Brief psychotherapy can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected. The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals. The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or <b>her</b> <b>problem</b> in the proper perspective. If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.|$|E
25|$|Deianira feared {{she would}} lose Heracles {{to the younger}} and more {{beautiful}} Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying breath that if she were to give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessusâ€™ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed like the perfect solution to <b>her</b> <b>problem</b> to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E

Wendy Richard commented in 1990, [...] "It's important for her to keep the family together.

500|$|In 1989, Cindy McCain {{developed}} {{an addiction to}} Percocet and Vicodin, opioid painkillers, which she initially took to alleviate pain following two spinal surgeries for ruptured discs and to ease emotional stress during the Keating Five affair.

[...] In 1992, her parents staged an intervention to force her to get help; she told her husband about <b>her</b> <b>problem,</b> attended a drug treatment facility, began outpatient sessions and ended her three years of addiction.

500|$|In 1983, Dworkin {{published}} Right-Wing Women: The Politics of Domesticated Females, {{an examination}} of women's reasons for collaborating with men for the limitation of women's freedom. In the preface to the British edition, Dworkin stated that the New Right in the United States focused especially on preserving male authority in the family, the promotion of fundamentalist versions of orthodox religion, combating abortion, and undermining efforts to combat domestic violence, but that it also had, for the first time, [...] "succeeded in getting women as women (women who claim to be acting {{in the interests of}} women as a group) to act effectively on behalf of male authority over women, on behalf of a hierarchy in which women are subservient to men, on behalf of women as the rightful property of men, on behalf of religion as an expression of transcendent male supremacy". Taking this as <b>her</b> <b>problem,</b> Dworkin asked, [...] "Why do right-wing women agitate for their own subordination? How does the Right, controlled by men, enlist their participation and loyalty? And why do right-wing women truly hate the feminist struggle for equality?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Scripting legendary {{character}} Erica {{as having}} a gay daughter initially upset {{a significant portion of}} the audience.

[...] Female viewers in Boston and some in Atlanta found the storyline [...] "refreshing and reflective" [...] of what they called the [...] "real world and its diversity." [...] The Atlanta group, however, had a good portion who were concerned about morality and did not want a major character [...] "saddled with a lifelong problem." [...] Boston viewers felt Bianca's problem was being in the closet; Atlantans voiced <b>her</b> <b>problem</b> was her sexual preference itself. In addition, there was opposition to the increased love for the character. Critics of gay marriage complained about a sympathetic gay heroine, saying Bianca made daytime television even more licentious.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sweet Guy" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of three minutes and forty seconds. The song {{is set in the}} key of C major and has a medium fast tempo â€“ 128 beats per minute â€“ with a piano range of C2â€“G5 and a vocal range of E4â€“G5. Kelly is {{credited}} with both lyrics and music. The lyrics are written in the first person perspective, with the narrator, a female, reflecting on the violent nature of her relationship and broods over the Jekyll and Hyde transformation of her partner from being loving and attentive into a violent man. Typical of the 'battered woman syndrome', she adopts a victim's view claiming that it is <b>her</b> <b>problem,</b> and is happy to forgive the man after heâ€™s bashed her. According to Rolling Stones Clinton Walker the song is about Ian Rilen, where [...] "his friend Paul Kelly sang in a song that was always understood to be about him, 'What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?' He could be his own worst enemy". Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X) had supplied bass guitar for Kelly's first solo album, Post (1985), and was married to Stephanie Falcolner (Sardine v) at the time.|$|E

6000|$|Fleda {{knew exactly}} how much worse, but she felt a {{delicacy}} about explicitly assenting: she was already immersed moreover in the deep consideration of what might make [...] "Mummy" [...] better. She couldn't see as yet at all; she could only clutch at the hope of some inspiration after he should go. Oh, there was a remedy, to be sure, but {{it was out of}} the question; in spite of which, in the strong light of Owen's troubled presence, of his anxious face and restless step, it hung there before her for some minutes. She felt that, remarkably, beneath the decent rigor of his errand, the poor young man, for reasons, for weariness, for disgust, would have been ready not to insist. His fitness to fight his mother had left him--he wasn't in fighting trim. He had no natural avidity and even no special wrath; he had none that had not been taught him, and it was doing his best to learn the lesson that had made him so sick. He had his delicacies, but he hid them away like presents before Christmas. He was hollow, perfunctory, pathetic; he had been girded by another hand. That hand had naturally been Mona's, and it was heavy even now on his strong, broad back. Why then had he originally rejoiced so in its touch? Fleda dashed aside this question, for {{it had nothing to do}} with <b>her</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>problem</b> was to help him to live as a gentleman and carry through what he had undertaken; <b>her</b> <b>problem</b> was to reinstate him in his rights. It was quite irrelevant that Mona had no intelligence of what she had lost--quite irrelevant that she was moved not by the privation, but by the insult: she had every reason to be moved, though she was so much more movable, in the vindictive way, at any rate, than one might have supposed--assuredly more than Owen himself had imagined.|$|E
