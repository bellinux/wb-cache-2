6000|$|When I {{went down}} into the drawing-room--I was very punctual--I found that neither my hostess nor my host had appeared. A lady rose from a sofa, however, and {{inclined}} her head as I rather surprisedly gazed at her. [...] "I dare say you don't know me," [...] she said, with the modern laugh. [...] "I am Mark Ambient's sister." [...] Whereupon I shook hands with her, saluting her very low. Her laugh was modern--by which I mean that it consisted of the vocal agitation which, between people who meet in drawing-rooms, serves as the solvent of social mysteries, the medium of transitions; but her appearance was--what shall I call it?--mediaeval. She was pale and angular, with a long, thin face, inhabited by sad, dark eyes, and black hair intertwined with golden fillets and curious chains. She wore a faded velvet robe, which clung {{to her when she}} moved, fashioned, as to the neck and sleeves, like the garments of old Venetians and Florentines. She looked pictorial and melancholy, and was so perfect an image of a type which I, in my ignorance, supposed to be extinct, that while she rose before me I was almost as much startled as if I had seen a ghost. I afterwards perceived that Miss Ambient was not incapable of deriving pleasure from the effect she produced, and I think this sentiment {{had something to do with}} her sinking again into her seat, with her long, lean, but not ungraceful arms locked together in an archaic manner on her knees, and her mournful eyes addressing themselves to me with an intentness which was a menace of what they were destined subsequently to inflict upon me. She was a singular, self-conscious, artificial creature, and I never, subsequently, more than half penetrated her motives and, mysteries. Of one thing I am sure, however: that they were considerably less extraordinary than her appearance announced. Miss Ambient was a restless, disappointed, imaginative spinster, consumed with the love of Michael-Angelesque attitudes and mystical robes; but I am pretty sure she had not in her nature those depths of unutterable thought which, when you first knew her, seemed to look out from her eyes and to prompt her complicated gestures. Those features, in especial, had a misleading eloquence; they rested upon you with a far-off dimness, an air of obstructed sympathy, which was certainly not always a key to the spirit of their owner; and I suspect that a young lady could not really have been so dejected and disillusioned as Miss Ambient looked, without having committed a crime for which she was consumed with remorse, or parted with a hope which she could not sanely have entertained. She had, I believe, the usual allowance of vulgar impulses: she wished to be looked at, she wished to be married, she wished to be thought original. It costs me something to speak in this irreverent manner of Mark Ambient's sister, but I shall have still more disagreeable things to say before I have finished my little anecdote, and moreover,--I confess it,--I owe the young lady a sort of grudge. Putting aside the curious cast of her face, she had no natural aptitude for an artistic development,--she had little real intelligence. But her affectations rubbed off on her brother's renown, and as there were plenty of people who disapproved of him totally, they could easily point to his sister as a person formed by his influence. It was quite possible to regard her as a warning, and she had done him but little good with the world at large. He was the original, and she was the inevitable imitation. I think he was scarcely aware of the impression she produced, beyond having a general idea that she made up very well as a Rossetti; he was used to her, and he was sorry for her,--wishing she would marry and observing that she did n't Doubtless I take her too seriously, for she did me no harm, though I am bound to add that I feel I can only half account for her. She was not so mystical as she looked, but she was a strange, indirect, uncomfortable, embarrassing woman. My story will give the reader at best so very small a knot to untie that I need not hope to excite his curiosity by delaying to remark that Mrs. Ambient hated her sister-in-law. This I only found out afterwards, when I found out some other things. But I mention it at once, for I shall perhaps not seem to count too much on having enlisted the imagination of the reader if I say that he will already have guessed it Mrs. Ambient was a person of conscience, and she endeavored to behave properly to her kinswoman, who spent a month with her twice a year; but it required no great insight to discover that the two ladies were made of a very different paste, and that the usual feminine hypocrisies must have cost them, on either side, much more than the usual effort. Mrs. Ambient, smooth-haired, thin-lipped, perpetually <b>fresh,</b> <b>must</b> have regarded her crumpled and dishevelled visitor as a very stale joke; she herself was not a Rossetti, but a Gainsborough or a Lawrence, and she had in her appearance no elements more romantic than a cold, ladylike candor, and a well-starched muslin dress.|$|E

40|$|Acetic acid {{bacteria}} are microorganisms that can profoundly influence {{the quality of}} wine. Surprisingly, {{little research has been}} done on these microorganisms in the winemaking field. The object {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence of acetic acid bacteria in South African red wine fermentations and to identify the dominant species occurring. Acetic acid bacteria were isolated and enumerated from small-scale and commercial red must fermentations in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The initial occurrence of acetic acid bacteria in the must was shown to vary with cell numbers ranging from 106 - 107 to 104 - 105 cfu/ml for the 1998 and 1999 musts, respectively. The acetic acid bacteria decreased to 102 - 103 cfu/ml in musts having a low pH (≤ 3. 6), whereas in some musts having a high pH (≥ 3. 7), the cell numbers increased during fermentation. During the process of cold soaking, the cell numbers of acetic acid bacteria also increased until inoculation with commercial wine yeast.

40|$|Today in {{the wine}} industry, oenological tannins are widely used to improve wine quality and prevent {{oxidation}} in wine aging. With the development of tannin products, new oenological tannins are developed with many specific functions, such as modifying antioxidant effect, colour stabilization and aroma modifications.

Results indicated that tannin treatments significantly improved wine aroma complexity and sensorial properties. However, the concentration of some stable pigments such as Vitisin A, Vitisin A-Ac and Vitisin B was negatively affected by tannin additions. Nevertheless, by means of cluster analysis and principal component analysis, it was observed that higher alcohols were significantly promoted by grape seed tannin while most anthocyanins can be improved by addition of grape tannins.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{quality of}} wine is {{influenced}} by numerous factors. These factors include {{the quality of the}} grapes, winemaking techniques and quality control throughout the winemaking process. It is thus very important that any process leading to the lowering {{of the quality of the}} wine be prevented. Evidence in the wine industry shows that bacterial spoilage is still very much a common problem in many wineries. The spoilage of wine by bacteria can lead to amongst other problems, elevated volatile acidity levels, of which only a certain concentration limit in wine is permitted. Usually more than 90 % of the volatile acidity of wine consists of acetic acid. Different yeast strains, heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria (which can all be spoilage microorganisms) can produce acetic acid in high concentrations. It is thus important to be able to prevent the formation of this acid by controling the unwanted growth of these spoilage microorganisms. Acetic acid and other medium chain fatty acids, octanoic- and decanoic acid, can also lead to stuck or sluggish fermentations. A stuck or sluggish fermentation can also lead to wine spoilage, due to sugar remaining in the fermentation which can be utilized by spoilage microorganisms. Acetic- and other fatty acids enter the yeast cell by passive diffussion and releases its proton in the cytoplasm, thereby acidifying the cytoplasm and inhibiting some enzymes. These acids can also work synergistically with ethanol and its inhibitory effect is also dependent on the temperature. Yeast strains can also differ in their resistance to acetic and other medium chain fatty acids and these acids can also influence the growth of lactic acid bacteria. How acetic acid bacteria influence the winemaking process and the used measures to keep these bacteria from spoiling wine have been the subject of very little attention in the past. This was due to the belief that the anaerobic conditions prevailing in wine and the use of sulfur dioxide are enough to control these bacteria, since acetic acid bacteria were always described as being strictly aerobic microorganisms. Recently, some evidence showed that acetic acid bacteria can survive and even overcome the limits that the winemaking process places on its growth. These bacteria are also known to inhibit the yeasts growth and fermentation ability due to the production of acetic acid and other factors. A research programme on the origin of volatile acidity in South African wines had been initiated at the Department of Viticulture and Enology and at the Institute for Wine Biotechnology at the University of Stellenbosch after increases in volatile acidity in different South African wines had been reported. This spurred us to investigate the occurrence of acetic acid bacteria in South African red wine fermentations, which forms part of this study, and to identify the dominant acetic acid bacterial strains. The sulfur dioxide resistance of five representative strains were also determined, as well as the effect of metabolites which were produced by these bacteria on yeast growth and fermentation ability. Our results indicate that acetic acid bacteria can occur in high concentrations in the <b>fresh</b> <b>must</b> and during alcoholic fermentation. In the 1998 harvesting season acetic acid bacteria occurred at 106 - 107 cfu per ml in the <b>fresh</b> <b>must.</b> In 1999 these numbers were 104 - 105 cfu/ml. Acetic acid bacteria numbers decreased in 1998 to 102 - 103 cfulml during fermentation. The survival of these bacteria in 1999 correlated with the pH of the must, as well as sulfur dioxide dosages in the must. In must with a low pH and higher sulfur dioxide the number of acetic acid bacterial numbers decreased more drastically than in the high pH, low sulfur dioxide musts. This was also true for acetic acid bacterial counts during cold soaking of musts, with the number of acetic acid bacteria increasing during the cold soaking period in musts with a high pH. In musts with a low pH and higher S 02 dosages acetic acid bacterial counts did not, however, increase during cold soaking. Gluconobacter oxydans dominated in the <b>fresh</b> <b>must</b> with Acetobacter liquefaciens and especially Acetobacter pasteurianus dominating during the fermentation. Different biochemical and physiological tests revealed that 52 % of the 115 isolates tested belong to A. pasteurianus. The high occurrence of A. liquefaciens with A. pasteurianus during fermentation showed that the dominant acetic acid bacterial species in South Africa differed from reports from other wine producing countries. The sulfur dioxide resistance of the acetic acid bacteria tested also differed in white grape juice, with a molecular sulfur dioxide concentration of 0. 64 mg/I being necessary to eliminate all the acetic acid bacterial strains tested. The A. hansenii strain was found to be the most resistant to sulfur dioxide and G. oxydans the least resistant. The latter strain was eliminated by only 0. 05 mg/I molecular sulfur dioxide, while A. hansenii was only eliminated by 0. 64 mg/I molecular sulfur dioxide. The A. pasteurianus, A. liquefaciens and A. aceti strains tested displayed varying degrees of resistance to sulfur dioxide. The volatile acidity produced by these bacteria profoundly influenced the growth and fermentation ability of yeast, which led to slow/stuck fermentation. The A. hansenii and A. pasteurianus strains produced the most volatile acidity in grape juice, with up to 4. 02 g/I for A. hansenii within 4 days, which led to a stuck alcoholic fermentation. This was, however, prevented by inhibiting or eliminating the acetic acid bacteria with sufficient sulfur dioxide additions prior to yeast inoculation. Compounds produced by acetic acid bacteria can also influence wine quality. Certain organic acids were produced and metabolized by acetic acid bacteria, as well as acetoin. We could not, however, detect any other fatty acids that are inhibitory to yeast (produced by these bacteria). This study clearly showed that acetic acid bacteria could occur during fermentation and that certain winemaking techniques, like the maintenance of a low pH in the must and sulfur dioxide additions can influence the growth and survival of acetic acid bacteria. Acetic acid bacteria also influence both the winemaking process by inhibiting yeast as well as the quality of the wine by producing acetic acid and/or other compounds. This study also shed some light on the occurrence of acetic acid bacterial species in the South African context and could be important in assisting the winemaker, as well as the scientific reseacher, in finding ways to inhibit acetic acid bacteria in the ongoing battle against these spoilage microorganisms of wine. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wynkwaliteit word deur verskillende faktore beinvloed. Dit sluit die druifkwaliteit, wynmaak tegnieke en kwaliteitsbeheer deur die wynmaakproses in. Enige prosesse en faktore wat tot die verlaging in wynkwaliteit kan lei moet dus ten alle koste voorkom word. Die bederf van wyn deur bakterieë kan en is 'n algemene probleem in enige kelder. Bakteriese bederf kan, onder andere, lei tot verhoogte vlugtige suurheid, waarvan 'n sekere konsentrasie limiet in wyn toegelaat word. Asynsuur maak gewoonlik 90 % van die vlugtige suurheid uit. Asynsuur kan deur verskillende gisrasse, heterofermantatiewe melksuurbakterieë en asynsuurbakterieë (wat almal wyn kan bederf) gevorm word. Die vorming van asynsuur in wyn kan dus voorkom word deur die ongewenste groei van dié organismes te voorkom. Asynsuur en ander medium ketting vetsure, soos oktanoë- en dekanoësuur, kan ook tot slepende of gestaakte gistings lei. Suiker wat in die wyn agterbly wat In slepende/gestaakte fermentasie ondergaan kan deur bederf bakterieë gebruik word om die wyn te bederf. Ongedissosieerde asynsuur en ander vetsure dring die gissel binne deur passiewe diffussie en stel 'n proton vry in die sitoplasma wat sitoplasma versuur en sekere ensieme inhibeer. Hierdie sure werk ook sinergisties met etanol en hul inhiberede effek is ook temperatuur afhanklik. Gisrasse verskil in hul weerstandbiedendheid teen asynsuur- en ander mediumketting vetsure en dié vetsure kan ook melksuurbakterieë se groei beïnvloed. Hoe asynsuurbakterieë wyn bederf en die aksies wat geneem kan word om dit te verhoed is in die verlede nie baie ondrsoek nie. Dit is hoofsaaklik daaraan toe te skryf dat geglo is dat die anaerobiese kondisies in wyn en die gebruik van swaweidioksied die groei van asynsuurbakterieë, wat altyd beskryf is as streng aerobe mikroorganismes, kan beheer. Daar is onlangs aangetoon dat asynsuurbakterieë kan oorleef in wyn en selfs die ongunstige kondisies daarin kan oorkom. Hierdie bakterieë is ook in staat om gisgroei en fermentasie vermoë te inhibeer deur die produksie van asynsuur en ander faktore. In Navorsingsprogram om die oorsprong van verhoogde vlugtige suurheid in Suid-Afrikaanse wyne te bepaal is deur die Departement Wingerd- en Wynkunde en die Instituut vir Wynbiotegnologie van die Universiteit van Stellenbosch geinisieer. Dit het ons aangemoedig om die voorkoms van asynsuurbakterieë in Suid-Afrikaanse rooiwyngistings, wat deel vorm van hierdie ondersoek, en ook die dominante asynsuurbakterie rasse te identifiseer. Die swaweidioksied bestandheid van vyf verteenwoordegende rasse en die effek wat metaboliete wat deur dié bakterieë geproduseer is op gisgroei en gisitingsvermoë is bepaal. Ons resultate bewys dat asynsuurbakterieë teen hoë getalle in vars mos en gedurende alkoholiese gisting kan voorkom. Asynsuurbakterieë het gedurende die 1998 seisoen teen 106 - 107 kve/ml en in 1999 teen 104 - 105 kve/ml in die vars mos voorgekom. Gedurende fermentasie het hierdie getalle in die 1998 seisoen gedaal na 102 - 103 kve/ml. Die oorlewing van hierdie bakterieë het gedurende die 1999 seisoen gekorrelleer met die pH en swaweidioksied konsentrasies van die mos. In die lae pH, hoë swaweidioksied moste het asynsuurbakterie getalle vinniger en meer dramaties gedaal as in die hoë pH, lae swaweidioksied moste. Asynsuurbakterie getalle het dieselfde tendens getoon in moste gedurende dopkontak by lae temperature. In moste met 'n hoë pH het asynsuurbakterie getalle toegeneem gedurende koue dopkontak, terwyl dit nie gebeur het nie in moste met 'n lae pH en hoë swaweidioksied konsentrasies. In die vars mos het Gluconobacter oxydans en gedurende die fermentasie Acetobacter liquefaciens en veral Acetobacter pasteurianus oorheers. Verskillende biochemiese en fisiologiese toetse het bepaal dat 52 % van die 115 isolate A. pasteurianus is. Die hoë voorkoms van A. liquefaciens saam met A. pasteurianus gedurende gisting bewys dat die voorkoms en dominansie van asynsuurbakterieë in Suid- Afrika verskil van ander wynproduserende lande. Die swaweidioksied weerstandbiedendheid van die asynsuurbakterieë wat getoets het, het ook verskil, met 0. 64 mg/I molekulêre swaweIdioksied nodig om hul almal te elimineer in wit druiwesap. Die A. hansenii en G. oxydans rasse was die mees weerstandbiedend en sensitiefste onderskeidelik ten opsigte van swaweidioksied. Slegs 0. 05 mg/I molekulêre swaweidioksied was voldoende om G. oxydans te elimineer, terwyl A. hansenii deur 0. 64 mg/I molekulêre swaweidioksied geëlimineer is. Die A. pasteurianus, A. liquefaciens en A. aceti rasse het verskillende swaweidioksied weerstandbiedendheid getoon. Die vlugtige suurheid wat deur dié bakterieë geproduseer is het die groei en gistingvermoë van gis drasties beinvloed, wat tot slepende/gestaakte fermentasies gelei het. Die A. hansenii en A. pasteurianus rasse het die meeste vlugtige suurheid geproduseer, met tot 4. 02 g/I geproduseer deur A. hansenii na vier dae se groei, wat tot 'n gestaakte fermentasie gelei het. Dit is egter voorkom deur die asynsuurbakterieë te elimineer deur genoegsame swaweidioksied toevoegings tot die mos voor gisinokulasie te doen. Verbindings wat deur asynsuurbakterieë geproduseer word kan ook wynkwaliteit beinvloed. Sekere anorganiese sure is deur hierdie bakterieë geproduseer, terwyl ander gemetaboliseer is. Asetoïen is geproduseer deur die getoetse asynsuurbakterieë. Ons kon egter nie ander vetsure wat gis inhibeer opspoor nie. (Geproduseer deur die bakterieë). Hierdie studie bewys dat asynsuurbakterieë gedurende alkoholiese fermentasie kan voorkom en dat sekere wynmaaktegnieke, soos die verkryging van moste met 'n lae pH en genoegsame swaweidioksied toevoegings die groei en oorlewing van asynsuurbakterieë kan beivloed. Asynsuurbakterieë kan ook beide die wynmaakproses, deur giste te inhibeer, en die wynkwaliteit beivloed deur die produksie van asynsuur en/of ander verbindings. Hierdie studie het ook kennis oor die voorkoms van asynsuurbakterieë in Suid-Afrikaanse moste verbeter en kan ook as 'n nuttige hulpmiddel dien vir die wynmaker en navorser in die stryd om hierdie bederf organismes van wyn te elimineer...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{winemaking}} process involves different complex {{chemical and}} biochemical reactions, which include those of oxygen (O 2). Oxygen can {{come into contact}} with the wine through various winemaking procedures and can be used by the winemaker to enhance the quality of red wine. In wine, the main substrates for oxidation are phenolic molecules, which form quinones. These can influence the sensory characteristics of the wine. O 2 can be used in <b>fresh</b> <b>must</b> to remove oxidisable phenolic molecules through a process called hyper-oxidation and can also be added to fermenting must to enhance the fermentation performance of yeast. Controlled O 2 additions during ageing can lead to the wine’s colour being increased and the astringency of the wine decreased. This is due to the formation of acetaldehyde from the oxidation of ethanol, which induces the polymerisation of tannin and anthocyanin molecules. The addition of too much O 2 to wine can, however, lead to unwanted over-oxidation, with certain off-odours being formed. It can also enhance the growth of unwanted spoilage microorganisms, such as Brettanomyces and acetic acid bacteria. Although research on O 2 in wine was started many years ago, many questions still remain. These include the general effect of O 2 on the sensory and phenolic profile of red wine especially and the microbiology of wine during ageing. An effective way of measuring oxidation, especially in red wine must also be developed. In {{the first part of this}} study, the effects of O 2 and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) additions on a strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis (also known as Dekkera bruxellensis) and Acetobacter pasteurianus were investigated. Epifluorescence microscopy and plating revealed that the A. pasteurianus strain went into a viable but non-culturable state in the wine after prolonged storage under relative anaerobic conditions. This state, however, could be negated with successive increases in culturability by the addition of O 2, as would happen during the transfer of wine when air is introduced. The A. pasteurianus strain was also relatively resistant to SO 2, but the B. bruxellensis strain was more sensitive to SO 2. A short exposure time to molecular SO 2 drastically decreased the culturability of the B. bruxellensis strain, but bound SO 2 had no effect on the culturability or viability of either of the two types of microorganisms. Oxygen addition to the B. bruxellensis strain also led to a drastic increase in viability and culturability. It is thus clear that SO 2 and O 2 management in the cellar is of critical importance for the winemaker to produce wines that have not been spoiled by Brettanomyces or acetic acid bacteria. This study should contribute to the understanding of the factors responsible for the growth and survival of Brettanomyces and acetic acid bacteria in wine, but it should be kept in mind that only one strain of each microorganism was used. This should be expanded in future to include more strains that occur in wine. The second part of this study investigated the effect of micro-oxygenation on four different South African red wines. It was found that the micro-oxygenation led to an increase in the colour density and SO 2 resistant pigments of the two wines in which micro-oxygenation was started just after the completion of malolactic fermentation. In one of these wines, a tasting panel preferred the micro-oxygenation treated wines to the control. In the other two red wines, in which the micro-oxygenation was started seven months after the completion of malolactic fermentation, very little colour increase was observed. One of these two wines was also matured in an oak barrel, where the change in phenolic composition was on par with the treated wines. A prolonged period of micro-oxygenation, however, led to this wine obtaining an oxidised, over-aged character. Micro-oxygenation and maturation in an oak barrel also enhanced the survival of acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces in this wine. Micro-oxygenation can hence be used by the wine producer on young red wines to enhance the quality of the wine, but should be applied with care in older red wines. Future research into micro-oxygenation should focus on whether it can simulate an oak barrel. More research into the effect of micro-oxygenation on the sensory profile of the wine is needed. As mentioned, the addition of O 2 can lead to oxidative degradation of wine. The brown colour in wine is often used as an indication of oxidation, but oxidative aromas can be perceived before a drastic increase in the brown colour has been observed in red wine. The third part of this study was to assess the possible use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to measure the progression of oxidation in Pinotage red wines. Three wines were used in this study and clear separation between the control and aerated wines was observed by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Sensory analysis of these wines confirmed this observation, with a reduction especially in berry fruit and coffee characters and an increase first in potato skin and then acetaldehyde aroma characters as the oxidation progressed. PCA analysis also revealed that in certain wines the visible spectrum of light did not indicate the progression of oxidation as sensitively as with the use of FTIR. This also correlated with the inability of the panel to observe a drastic colour change. FTIR should be further investigated as a possible means of monitoring oxidation in wine and this study should be expanded to wines made from other cultivars as well...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of biogenic amines and other nitrogen compounds during the elaboration period of natural ciders in two successive seasons and {{two types of}} presses was studied. The harvest year affects the concentrations {{of most of the}} amino acids, while few of them were affected by the type of press. Asparagine and aspartic acid were the most abundant amino acids in <b>fresh</b> <b>musts</b> followed by α-alanine, α-aminobutyric acid, glutamine and glutamic acid. The mean concentrations of these amino acids in the <b>fresh</b> <b>musts</b> from the two harvest years were 12. 35, 11. 12, 6. 45, 6. 29, 5. 28 and 4. 87 mg L− 1, respectively. During cidermaking, a decrease in the sum of all amino acids was detected (from 128 ± 54. 311 mg L− 1 to 22. 5 ± 4. 863 mg L− 1 in 2005 and from 72. 2 ± 15. 256 mg L− 1 to 6. 5 ± 4. 112 mg L− 1 in 2006). Furthermore, significant differences in the concentration of most amino acids related to harvest year were observed. Concerning the biogenic amine content, putrescine was the main and the only amine present in all musts (3. 72 ± 1. 68 mg L− 1) and ciders (3. 59 ± 1. 83 mg L− 1). Histamine was the second biogenic amine of quantitative importance in final ciders (1. 15 ± 0. 69 mg L− 1), and tyramine was only detected in one of the cidermaker cellars {{at the end of the}} elaboration period. The low concentrations of biogenic amines in ciders were attributed to the low contents of the corresponding precursor amino acids and do not affect to cider quality,This study was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Projects, PET 2007 - 0134 and AGL 2006 n- 04514).

40|$|Grapevine-associated {{microbiota}} influences wine organoleptic properties. Spoilage due to undesired microorganisms and biogenic amines (BAs) presence are {{two main}} constrains that must be seriously considered. In wine, BAs can originate from the grape berries or can be produced during fermentation, ageing or storage. This work aimed to understand if the high BAs levels observed in musts can have its origin in the microbial community present on grapes. The following methodologies were done: bacterial and fungal grapes communities' isolation, BAs quantification in grapes and musts and molecular amplification of the genes related to BAs production. For comparative purposes, microbial communities from grapes and musts from Douro (low BAs levels in musts) and Alentejo (high BAs levels in musts) were used. Higher number and diversity of bacteria were observed in Alentejo grapes comparatively to Douro ones. Filamentous fungi were predominant when compared with yeasts and the diversity was higher in Alentejo. BAs levels mainly due to putrescin were about ten times higher in grapes and musts from Alentejo. As bacteria isolated from Alentejo grapes showed a great BAs-production potential, namely putrescin, our results suggest a bacterial grape origin for the high putrescine levels found in <b>fresh</b> <b>musts</b> of this region...|$|R
