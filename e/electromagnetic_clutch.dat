25|$|A {{magnetic}} particle clutch {{is a special}} type of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> which does not use friction plates. Instead, it uses a fine powder of magnetically susceptible material (typically stainless steel) to mechanically link an otherwise free wheeling disc attached to one shaft, to a rotor attached to the other shaft. The {{magnetic particle}} clutch was invented in 1947 by Ukrainian-American Jacob Rabinow.|$|E
500|$|The reactor used cadmium-clad steel control rods. Made from neutron-absorbing cadmium, {{these could}} {{restrict}} or halt the reaction. Three [...] rods penetrated the reactor vertically, {{held in place}} by a clutch to form the scram system. They were suspended from steel cables that were wound around a drum, and {{held in place by}} an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch.</b> If power was lost, they would drop into the reactor, halting it. The other four rods were made of boron steel and horizontally penetrated the reactor from the north side. Two of them, known as [...] "shim" [...] rods, were hydraulically controlled. Sand-filled hydraulic accumulators could be used {{in the event of a}} power failure. The other two rods were driven by electric motors.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{patent application}} proposed that <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> {{be used in}} the transmission. The year of the patent was 1949, a time when pressure operated hydraulic technology was less well developed. Several years later, when the Ravigneaux went into production at Ford Motor Company, hydraulically operated band brakes and cluches were used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> operate {{electrically}} but transmit torque mechanically. This is {{why they}} used to be referred to as electro-mechanical clutches. Over the years, EM became known as electromagnetic versus electro-mechanical, referring more about their actuation method versus physical operation.

5000|$|The {{supercharged}} engine {{is different from}} the normally aspirated engine, owing to a slight decrease in compression ratio and stronger engine internals.

5000|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> are, typically, engaged by an {{electromagnet}} that is {{an integral}} part of the clutch assembly. Another type, magnetic particle clutches, contain magnetically influenced particles in a chamber between driving and driven members—application of direct current makes the particles clump together and adhere to the operating surfaces. Engagement and slippage are notably smooth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> and brakes operate electrically, but {{transmit}} torque mechanically. This is {{why they}} used to be referred to as electro-mechanical clutches or brakes. Over the years, EM became known as electromagnetic versus electro mechanical, referring more about their actuation method versus physical operation. Since the clutches started becoming popular over 60 years ago, the variety of applications and brake and clutch designs has increased dramatically, but the basic operation remains the same.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are most}} {{suitable}} for remote operation since no mechanical linkages are required to control their engagement, providing fast, smooth operation. However, because the activation energy dissipates as heat in the electromagnetic actuator when the clutch is engaged, {{there is a risk}} of overheating. Consequently, the maximum operating temperature of the clutch is limited by the temperature rating of the insulation of the electromagnet. This is a major limitation. Another disadvantage is higher initial cost.|$|R
50|$|The Cotal self-changing gearbox of the 1930s was a {{manually}} controlled epicyclic, {{like the}} Wilson. The {{difference is that}} instead of band brakes, it used <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches.</b> These two clutches each consisted of a central rotating disk (a simple steel pole piece) {{and a pair of}} coil-carrying rings, one rotating and one fixed (this coil could be considered as either a clutch or a brake). Sliprings were used to transmit electrical power to the rotating clutch elements.|$|R

50|$|Throughout its production, VW marketed the Beetle with a four-speed manual transmission. From 1961 (and almost {{exclusively}} in Europe), VW offered an optional version of the Saxomat semi-automatic transmission: a regular 4-speed manual transaxle coupled to an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> with a centrifugal clutch used for idle. Subsequently, (beginning in 1967 in Europe and 1968 in the United States), VW offered an optional semi-automatic transmission (marketed as Automatic Stick Shift and also called AutoStick), which was a 3-speed manual coupled to an electro-pneumatic clutch and torque converter.|$|E

In order to adjust the surgical instrument and manipulator conveniently, many researchers try to design some back-drivable equipments; however, due to the safety of medical equipments, these devices are rarely used. In order to accomplish preoperative adjustment, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> are used in the medical devices. However, clutches increase the weight and volume of the device which leads to vibration and unstable equipment. So an easy way to achieve preoperative {{adjustment is}} needed.|$|R
40|$|Even {{if the air}} {{conditioning}} is switched off, {{the internal combustion engine}} in today’s cars continues to drive the common compressor. To avoid resulting power losses, the automotive industry aspires to apply <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches.</b> When the {{air conditioning}} is used, however, CO 2 -emission increases significantly because the electromag-netic coil consumes electricity. The CO 2 -reduction per year is consequently very low, which is why new compressor clutches were developed that do not require a permanent electric power supply. Additionally, these clutches are characterized by low production costs, a simple functional principle and a small package...|$|R
50|$|Introduction - Of all the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>{{clutches}},</b> {{the tooth}} clutches provide {{the greatest amount}} of torque in the smallest overall size. Because torque is transmitted without any slippage, clutches are ideal for multi stage machines where timing is critical such as multi-stage printing presses. Sometimes, exact timing needs to be kept, so tooth clutches can be made with a single position option which means that they will only engage at a specific degree mark. They can be used in dry or wet (oil bath) applications, so they are very well suited for gear box type drives.|$|R
50|$|The company's initial {{design was}} the Rotortec Cloud Dancer I, a single-seat, {{enclosed}} cockpit gyro, that uses an innovative <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> for the Carden Drive. This was followed into production by the two-seats in side-by-side configuration Rotortec Cloud Dancer II, which was first shown at AERO Friedrichshafen in 2009. The third design, the Rotortec Cloud Dancer Light, is a simplified {{version of the}} Cloud Dancer I, without a cockpit fairing and intended {{to qualify for the}} German 120 kg ultralight class as it has an empty weight of 120 kg (265 lb).|$|E
5000|$|... 47,299 of the PC-series Contessa were built, between April 1961 and {{the second}} quarter of 1964.

The first Contessa originally received a three-speed column mounted shifter, later a four-speed manual became optional, utilizing an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> apparatus called Shinko-Hinomatic. The gear change came in for a certain amount of criticism, a result of its long and cumbersome linkage from the steering column to the rear-mounted transmission.|$|E
50|$|In the North American market, Honda {{introduced}} the original SH-AWD system introduced in late 2004 {{with the second}} generation 2005 Acura RL. Two other SH-AWD variants were introduced in late 2006 in the then all new 2007 Acura RDX and the new second generation 2007 Acura MDX Sport Utility Vehicles SUV. In late 2008, an improved version of the Acura RL SH-AWD {{was introduced in the}} significantly revised Mid-Model Change (MMC) of the 2009 Acura RL.

50|$|To help {{increase}} life in applications, {{friction material}} is used between the poles. This friction material is {{flush with the}} steel on the coil shell or rotor, since if the friction material was not flush, good magnetic traction could not occur between the faces. Some people look at <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> and mistakenly assume that, since the friction material is flush with the steel, that the clutch has already worn down, {{but this is not}} the case. Clutches used in most mobile applications, (automotive, agriculture, construction equipment) do not use friction material. Their cycle requirements tend to be lower than industrial clutches, and their cost is more sensitive. Also, many mobile clutches are exposed to outside elements, so by not having friction material, it eliminates the possibility of swelling (reduced torque), that can happen when friction material absorbs moisture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{multiple}} generator drivetrain (MGD), where {{a single}} large generator in a wind turbine {{is replaced by}} multiple generators with the same or different rated powers, is proposed along with an automatic switch {{as an alternative to}} an existing MGD configuration. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of a MGD with a conventional drivetrain are provided to better understand {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} having a MGD in wind turbines. New approaches for improving the efficiency and the reliability, expanding the operational range, and reducing the cost of a wind turbine are mentioned. A simple mathematical model for a MGD with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> is developed, a novel prototype of a MGD is designed and fabricated, and experiments are conducted on the prototype. It is concluded that a multiple-generator drivetrain with generators operating individually or in parallel has a better potential of improving the efficiency and the reliability, expanding the operational range, and reducing the cost of offshore and onshore wind turbines than the existing MGD configuration...|$|R
50|$|The series {{arrangement}}, {{the more}} common arrangement of twinchargers, is set up such that one compressor's (turbo or supercharger) output feeds the inlet of another. A sequentially-organized supercharger is connected to a medium- to large-sized turbocharger. The supercharger provides near-instant manifold pressure (eliminating turbo lag, which would otherwise result when the turbocharger {{is not up to}} its operating speed). Once the turbocharger has reached operating speed, the supercharger can either continue compounding the pressurized air to the turbocharger inlet (yielding elevated intake pressures), or it can be bypassed and/or mechanically decoupled from the drivetrain via an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> and bypass valve (increasing efficiency of the induction system).|$|E
50|$|Current SH-AWD {{configurations}} are all mated to a transverse engine, {{either a}} turbo-charged in-line four-cylinder Honda K-Series engine {{in the case}} of the RDX, or naturally aspirated V-6 versions of the Honda J-Series engine. The engines are mated to a front-wheel-drive transaxle. There is no center differential. The transaxle is bolted to torque transfer unit that spins a center drive shaft that powers the rear differential unit. The rear differential is a T-shaped device. Power coming from the engine is transferred via a central hypoid gear that delivers power to each rear axle. Power to the each axle is modulated by identical planetary gear sets and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> packs which can vary incoming power side to side.|$|E
5000|$|The Acceleration Device {{allows the}} rear wheels to be variably overdriven {{with respect to the}} speed of the front wheels up to 5.7%. [...] The Acceleration Device in the Acura RL is {{positioned}} in front of the rear differential. During normal steady state driving, the Acceleration Device input shaft (from the engine) and output shaft (to the rear differential) spin at almost equal speeds. In a cornering situation, the output shaft spins up to 5.7% faster than the input shaft, effectively speeding up {{the rear wheels}}. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> packs, based on sensor inputs, will vary the torque sent to the rear differential from side to side providing constant and dynamic balancing of the car handling characteristics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{relates to}} the {{development}} of prosthetic myoelectric hand that performs many functions of real human hand like opening and closing of fingers and wrist rotation. This dual movement of prosthetic hand is controlled by a single DC motor. Below-elbow amputee persons with missing limbs can append this prosthetic hand with the available stump and can do some of the hand operations with multiple degrees of freedom by voluntary activation of muscles using electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. To rehabilitate such a person, facilities like opening, closing, grasping, and lifting objects of different weight with variable grip force are available like natural hand. The main design consideration includes degrees of freedom, number of actuators, power of actuators, reliability, electronic control, light weight, economic viability, wrist rotation, variable grip force pattern, and ease of attachment with limb. Use of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> along with the coupling logic of DC motor and microcontroller based on grip force generation and wrist rotation based on EMG signals imparts a new function to the device. It will be useful for both robotic and prosthetic industry...|$|R
40|$|Now-a-days, {{industrial}} robot is been custom made by various companies which serves companies of different sectors in fulfilling the very specific demand, such as welding, painting, fabricating microchips, etc. Usually these robots {{are provided with}} actuators at each joint for simplicity and reliability. This paper introduces a new concept of a concentric driven serial chain manipulator where only one motor is used to supply the power required by the robot {{to do all the}} required motion or it’s a uni-motor robot or manipulator. The sole idea is to power the manipulator by a single servo motor, which will enable motion to each joint, but one at a time. An auto clutch system is designed, so that the requirement of additional costly <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches</b> is totally eliminated. Such a design configuration of the manipulator has an obvious advantage on design reliability, cost saving and easy maintenance. This project includes a new mechanical drive to achieve the required power transmission and subsequently new locking design for the joints.

40|$|Haptic {{interfaces}} enhance {{cooperation between}} humans and robotic manipulators by providing force and tactile feedback to the human user during the execution of arbitrary tasks. The use of active actuators in haptic displays presents {{a certain amount of}} risk since they are capable of providing unacceptable levels of energy to the systems upon which they operate. An alternative to providing numerous safeguards is to remove the sources of risk altogether. This research investigates the feasibility of trajectory control using passive devices, that is, devices that cannot add energy to the system. Passive actuators are capable only of removing energy from the system or transferring energy within the system. It is proposed that the utility of passive devices is greatly enhanced by the use of redundant actuators. In a passive system, once motion is provided to the system, presumably by a human user, passive devices may be able to modify this motion to achieve a desired resultant trajectory. A mechanically passive, 2 -Degree-of-Freedom (D. O. F.) manipulator has been designed and built. It is equipped with four passive actuators: two electromagnetic brakes and two <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>clutches.</b> This paper gives {{a review of the literature}} on passive and robotics and describes the experimental test bed used in this research. Several control algorithms are investigated, resulting in the formulation of a passive control law...|$|R
