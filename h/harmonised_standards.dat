These include requirements for the design and construction of crafts such as boat design categories, craft identification, the owner’s manual, as well as integrity, structural and installation requirements. Other requirements apply to the exhaust and noise emissions from propulsion engines. To comply with the essential requirements, over 60 EN-ISO <b>harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> were developed, which provide guidelines to meet the essential requirements. Using the EN-ISO <b>harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity with the Directive’s requirements.

50|$|When {{all of the}} {{requirements}} have been established, the conformity of the product to the essential requirements of the Directive(s) needs to be assessed.

50|$|Directive 98/71/EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 13 October 1998 on {{the legal}} {{protection}} of designs is a European Union directive {{in the field of}} industrial design rights, made under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome. It sets <b>harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> for eligibility and protection of most types of registered design.|$|E
50|$|The {{best way}} to {{demonstrate}} that these essential requirements have been met is by meeting the requirements of an applicable ‘harmonised standard,’ which offer a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements, although the use of standards usually remains voluntary. <b>Harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> can be identified by searching the ‘Official Journal’ on the European Commission’s website, or by visiting the New Approach website established by the European Commission and EFTA with the European Standardisation Organisations.|$|E

50|$|The Directors' Report arose out of {{a general}} move for greater {{transparency}} in corporate governance. It is useful for shareholders to find out issues such as whether the company has good finances, whether the market has potential, and whether the business has the structural capacity to expand into new opportunities. In order for shareholders {{to make informed decisions}} when casting their votes at annual or other meetings, the Directors' Report provides part of that essential minimum standard of information. It is complemented by the Director's Remuneration Report and the Company Accounts. Much of the Directors' Report requirements are basic <b>harmonised</b> <b>standards</b> in all European companies, through the Accounts Modernisation Directive, but the UK chose to go further in the interests of greater transparency and accountability.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} in the recast {{is that it is}} now necessary to demonstrate conformity in a similar way to the LVD and EMC directives. Not being able to show compliance in sufficiently detailed files, and not ensuring it is implemented in production is now a criminal offence. Like the other CE marking directives it mandates production control and traceability to the technical files. It describes 2 methods of achieving presumption of conformity (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 16.2), either technical files should include test data for all materials or a standard accepted in the official journal for the directive, is used.

Commission Decision 2008/671/EC harmonises {{the use of the}} 5 875-5 905 MHz frequency band for transport safety ITS applications. In 2010 the ITS Directive 2010/40/EU was adopted. It aims to assure that ITS applications are interoperable and can operate across national borders, it defines priority areas for secondary legislation, which cover V2X and requires technologies to be mature. In 2014 the European Commission’s industry stakeholder “C-ITS Deployment Platform” started working on a regulatory framework for V2X in the EU. It identified key approaches to an EU-wide V2X security Public Key infrastructure (PKI) and data protection, as well as facilitating a mitigation standard to prevent radio interference between ITS-G5 based V2X and road charging systems. The European Commission recognised ITS-G5 as the initial communication technology in its 5G Action Plan and the accompanying explanatory document, to form a communication environment consisting of ITS-G5 and cellular communication as envisioned by EU Member States. Various pre-deployment projects exist at EU or EU Member State level, such as SCOOP@F, the Testfeld Telematik, the digital testbed Autobahn, the Rotterdam-Vienna ITS Corridor, Nordic Way, COMPASS4D or C-ROADS.|$|R
