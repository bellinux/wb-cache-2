50|$|This {{confusion}} is perhaps explained {{by reference to}} the treaty provision governing regulations which provides that they, and only they, have <b>direct</b> <b>applicability</b> within the member states. The early jurisprudence of the ECJ suggested that 'direct effect' was a consequence of <b>direct</b> <b>applicability</b> as {{it was thought that}} the drafters of the original treaty intended regulations, and only regulations, to be directly effective. However, the expansion of the doctrine of direct effect to include directives and other measures served to create a distinction between <b>direct</b> <b>applicability</b> and direct effect. <b>Direct</b> <b>applicability</b> is now taken to mean that regulations require no domestic implementation - if direct effect was only ever intended to be a consequence of <b>direct</b> <b>applicability</b> then the relationship has been severed by a series of ECJ cases.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{simplicity}} and <b>direct</b> phenomenological <b>applicability</b> of field-theoretic orbifold constructions {{in the context}} of grand unification, we set out to survey the immensely rich group-theoretical possibilities open to this type of model building. In particular, we show how every maximal-rank, regular subgroup of a simple Lie group can be obtained by orbifolding and determine under which conditions rank reduction is possible. We investigate how standard model matter can arise from the higher-dimensional SUSY gauge multiplet. New model building options arise if, giving up the global orbifold construction, generic conical singularities and generic gauge twists associated with these singularities are considered. Viewed from the purely field-theoretic perspective, such models, which one might call conifold GUTs, require only a very mild relaxation of the constraints of orbifold model building. Our most interesting concrete examples include the breaking of E 7 to SU(5) and of E 8 to SU(4) ×SU(2) ×SU(2) (with extra factor groups), where three generations of standard model matter come from the gauge sector and the families are interrelated either by SU(3) R-symmetry or by an SU(3) flavou...|$|R

Previous HR-MAS MR results have been obtained from post-surgery samples, which limits their <b>direct</b> clinical <b>applicability.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we performed HR-MAS MR spectroscopic studies on 31 breast tissue samples (13 cancer and 18 non-cancer) obtained by percutaneous core needle biopsy. We showed that cancer and non-cancer samples can be discriminated very well with Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structure-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate model on the MR spectra. A subsequent blind test showed 69 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity in the prediction of the cancer status. A spectral analysis showed that in cancer cells, taurine- and choline-containing compounds are elevated. Our approach, additionally, could predict the progesterone receptor statuses of the cancer patients.

To our knowledge, {{there is no}} published data on the culture and local susceptibility pattern of Helicobacter pylori in the Philippines. Methods 52 dyspeptic adult patients undergoing endoscopy from the Outpatient Gastroenterology clinic of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital underwent multiple gastric biopsy and specimens were submitted for gram stain, culture, antimicrobial sensitivity testing, rapid urease test and histology. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by Epsilometer testing (Etest) method against metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline. Results Sixty percent (60 %) of the study population was positive for H. pylori infection (mean age of 44 years ± 13), 70 % were males. H. pylori culture showed a sensitivity of 45 % (95 % CI [29. 5 – 62. 1]), specificity of 98 % (95 %CI [81. 5 – 100 %]), positive likelihood ratio of 19. 93 (95 % CI [1. 254 – 317. 04]) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 56 (95 % CI [0. 406 – 0. 772]).

40|$|Abstract Background A major {{challenge}} in computational biology is to extract {{knowledge about the}} genetic nature of disease from high-throughput data. However, an important obstacle to both biological understanding and clinical applications is the "black box" nature of the decision rules provided by most machine learning approaches, which usually involve many genes combined in a highly complex fashion. Achieving biologically relevant results argues for a different strategy. A promising alternative is to base prediction entirely upon the relative expression ordering of {{a small number of}} genes. Results We present a three-gene version of "relative expression analysis" (RXA), a rigorous and systematic comparison with earlier approaches in a variety of cancer studies, a clinically relevant application to predicting germline BRCA 1 mutations in breast cancer and a cross-study validation for predicting ER status. In the BRCA 1 study, RXA yields high accuracy with a simple decision rule: in tumors carrying mutations, the expression of a "reference gene" falls between the expression of two differentially expressed genes, PPP 1 CB and RNF 14. An analysis of the protein-protein interactions among the triplet of genes and BRCA 1 suggests that the classifier has a biological foundation. Conclusion RXA has the potential to identify genomic "marker interactions" with plausible biological interpretation and <b>direct</b> clinical <b>applicability.</b> It provides a general framework for understanding the roles of the genes involved in decision rules, as illustrated for the difficult and clinically relevant problem of identifying BRCA 1 mutation carriers. </p...|$|R

40|$|Metabolomic {{fingerprinting}} is a high-throughput technology which mostly uses advanced {{methods to}} characterize and quantify hundreds {{to thousands of}} low molecular weight analytes simultaneously, using targeted or untargeted approaches. In metabolomics studies, mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used being a very effective methodology for identifying, characterizing and quantifying unknowns.

Modern MS offers an array of technologies that differ in operational principles and performance, ranging {{from a wide range}} of ionization techniques, to high resolution and many methods for inducing dissociations of ions. A typical strategy in metabolomics is coupling MS with chromatography. So GC-MS and LC-MS are used for studying mixtures of volatile or polar compounds, respectively. Another approach consists of direct MS analyses of sample crude mixtures without chromatographic separations. This approach, even if less informative, provides a high throughput screening tool and allows a direct comparison between different samples. <b>Direct</b> MS <b>applicability</b> in metabolomics is broadened by advanced instrumentation capable of high resolution, accurate mass measurements, and tandem mass spectrometry methods.
