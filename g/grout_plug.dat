40|$|Engineering {{knowledge}} of bamboo is surprisingly limited and often focuses on {{issues associated with}} 'signature structures' while the behavior of vernacular structures commonly used {{in the developing world}} have gone largely unstudied. This document concentrates on understanding the behavior of one of the simplest and most common types of multi- and single-culm foundation connections, termed 'grouted-bar column bases'. These connections consist of a reinforcing bar embedded in a concrete foundation and then grouted into the bamboo column. The objective of this work is to develop an understanding of the complex behavior of these column bases systems {{in the context of the}} behavior of a prototype bamboo framing system. Full scale tests of single and four-culm grouted bar column bases were conducted. Additional direct tension pull-out tests of grouted bar connections were also performed. All tests were carried out using Tre Gai (Bambusa Stenostachya) bamboo. Test parameters included the bar size and embedment length of the grouted bar. A basic failure mechanism associating longitudinal splitting of the bamboo culm and slip of the <b>grout</b> <b>plug</b> was identified. Effective properties of the column base suitable for modeling were identified and the relationship between effective flexural properties and fundamental material properties was verified...|$|E

40|$|The new C Line of Rome Underground -T 4, T 5 and T 6 A lots- mainly {{runs into}} {{volcanic}} deposits deriving from the Colli Albani apparatus, widely extended in south-eastern areas of Rome. The local hydrogeological framework is very complex {{due to the}} large variations of permeability in function of granulometry, cementation processes and secondary fracturing of pyroclastic strata. The bottom of the excavation of the underground stations lies 25 / 30 meters below the groundwater level. In order to allow dry conditions and to prevent bottom heave during excavation, the groundwater level is lowered by deep wells systems. Some dewatering field tests showed how the local stratigraphy strongly affects the dewatering efficiency. Steady state filtration FEM analyses allowed to compare permeability of soil with Lefranc in situ tests results and to verify the efficiency of <b>grouted</b> <b>plugs.</b> 	Due {{to the presence of}} a densely built urban environment, the selected solution for the construction of the stations consists of a “cut and cover” excavation about 35 - 55 m depth retained by multi-propped diaphragm walls to minimise settlements and prevent damage to the structures. The diaphragm walls were carried out with hydromills and self guided mechanical grab. 	An intense programme of monitoring was set up to control and prevent the effects induced by the excavation during the entire construction progress. The work presents the in situ measurement of ground surface settlement due to lateral diaphragm walls installation of some stations of the new C Line using different construction techniques. Numerical analyses carried out to interpret situ measurements for two different stations of T 4 lot, namely Pigneto and Malatesta, showed the main influence of presence of soft soil on the settlements due to diaphragm wall installation.

40|$|Jet {{grouting}} {{is adopted}} in different geotechnical conditions to ensure provisional earth retaining and waterproofing functions {{at the bottom}} and walls of excavations. Despite careful theoretical models avail-able to predict the mechanical response of these structures, design is often carried out without adequate con-trol, i. e. by assuming ideal effectiveness of ground improvement. On the contrary, adverse effects have been documented by past experiences which {{can be traced back to}} erroneous prediction of treatments effects, inac-curate control of the execution or to unexpected responses of the surrounding environment. All these uncertainties, which become particularly critical when excavation is performed in urbanized areas, can be mini-mized by detailed preliminary field trials, accurate controls of the execution of treatments and a prompt monitoring of the surrounding area. The present paper describes this methodology applied to the design and the execution of a massive jet <b>grouting</b> bottom <b>plug</b> forming the base of a large excavation in city environment. The results of preliminary field trials are summarized to directly compare the effectiveness of different injection systems and introduced in statistical design analyses of the jet grouted structure. A detailed investigation of the movements induced at ground level by injections is also reported. To this aim, the evolution of displacements recorded around trial columns and on the area surrounding the excavation is mapped to evaluate the effects of the different adopted injection techniques.

40|$|Significant wear in orepasses {{particularly}} in the brow and chute areas {{is proportional to the}} tonnage throughput with increased wear associated with running orepasses empty. During planned shutdowns {{it may be necessary to}} isolate maintenance crews from objects falling from orepasses. In the last 15 years <b>grout</b> orepass <b>plugs</b> that can later be easily removed have been poured above chute maintenance areas. These provide protection from high energy impact and isolating workers from the hazard. Construction and removal methods will be briefly explained. Since it is not feasible to investigate the problem of orepass plug impact response using full-scale experimental studies, this paper presents a combined three-stage approach that includes: 1. High-precision impact testing of reduced-scale models of orepass plugs. 2. High-fidelity physics-based numerical model calibration using experimental data. 3. Full-scale modelling of mine orepass plugs using calibrated material models. To calibrate numerical models, three 1 m diameter steel pipes filled with Tekseal high yield foaming grout were tested with falfing steel projectiles of different shape using the High-Capacity Impact Testing Facility at the University of Wollongong. Impact tests provided data on the depth of penetration and size of the ci 6 ters formed by the projectiles. Numerical models were calibrated by optimiSing the material parameters and modelling techniques to match with the experimental results.. Full-scale numerical models of orepass plugs were de veloped for typical orepass dimensions and subjected to impact events by falling rock projectiles. The proposed approach has allowed investigating energy absorbing characteristics of orepass plugs to further predict and increase understanding of their capacity to withstand high-speed impacts by large fa lling projectiles. This research will enable better understanding of orepass plug performance during high energy events and provide f urther engineering definition to mitigate risk to orepass maintenance personnel...|$|R
