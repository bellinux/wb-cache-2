5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> {{of a desire to}} retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of their growing social status, and they may have needed more room for a greater number of servants.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the storm}} quickly downgraded, and by August 19 {{it was once}} again at minimal {{hurricane}} force. At roughly the same time, it turned more to the west, although it maintained a general northwesterly path. The abrupt weakening may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a seeding experiment carried out on the storm {{in an attempt to}} deteriorate it. By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during the day. At this point, the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120mph (195km/h); shortly thereafter, its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 millibars.|$|E

5|$|In 975, {{not long}} after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was banished from England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles report of his expulsion. Version C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{describes}} the events thus:The valiant Oslac was driven from the country, over the tossing waves, the gannet's bath, the tumult of the waters, the homeland of the whale; a grey-haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his lands The historian Richard Fletcher guesses that Oslac's downfall may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr.|$|E
5|$|In July 1794 he {{and several}} other activists were exiled from Leipzig, and Piattoli was soon arrested by the Austrian authorities. After {{the failure of the}} Kościuszko Insurrection later in 1794, many prisoners were set free, but Piattoli was kept imprisoned, {{together}} with Kołłątaj, as the Russian authorities insisted that the two were “extremely dangerous”. Hence, even after the final Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Piattoli was kept interned in Prague by the Austrian Empire authorities until 1800, despite requests for his release from Poniatowski and even Napoleon Bonaparte. His release in 1800 seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of efforts of the Czartoryski family and Duchess Dorothea.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, {{it is clear that}} Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E
5|$|Thored's {{governorship}} as ealdorman, {{based on}} charter attestations, cannot be securely dated before 979.

It is possible that such appearances represent more than one Thored, though that is not a generally accepted theory. His definite predecessor, Oslac, was expelled from England in 975. The historian Richard Fletcher thought that Oslac's downfall may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr, enemy and brother of Æthelred II.|$|E

5|$|According to the Augustan History, Zenobia's {{descendants}} were Roman nobility {{during the}} reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{a genetic}} {{study found that}} the wolf {{population}} in Europe was divided along a north-south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Dinaric-Balkans, the Carpathians. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster, with wolves from the Carpathians cluster coming from a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.|$|E
5|$|In his {{autobiography}} Belgrano {{declared that he}} did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment took him by surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to make big changes in the social order. One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by April 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers which it did in May. The primary naval opponent {{for the duration of the}} war was the Austro-Hungarian Navy; the Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, planned a distant blockade with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats conducted raids. The heavy ships of the Italian fleet would be preserved for a potential major battle in the Austro-Hungarian fleet should emerge from its bases. As a result, the ship's career during the war was limited. In addition to the cautious Italian strategy, Benedetto Brinlong-since obsolescentwas reduced to a training ship in the 3rd Division, along with her sister ship. On 27 September 1915, Benedetto Brin was destroyed in a huge explosion in the harbor of Brindisi; at the time, it was believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of Austro-Hungarian sabotage. The Italian Navy now believes the explosion to have been accidental. A total of 8 officers and 379 ratings survived but 454 members of the crew, including Rear-Admiral Rubin de Cervin died. Two of the ship's 12-inch guns were salvaged from the wreck and were reused as coastal guns protecting Venice.|$|E
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
