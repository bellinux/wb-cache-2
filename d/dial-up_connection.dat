5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection</b> during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
25|$|Underlying these layers are the {{networking}} {{technologies that}} interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The Internet layer enables computers {{to identify and}} locate each other via Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, {{at the bottom of}} the architecture is the link layer, which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a local area network (LAN) or a <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection.</b> The model, also known as TCP/IP, is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the OSI model, that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation. Yet, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Boxer" [...] was {{directed}} by London-based director duo Ne-o, Jake Knight and Ryoko Tanaka. [...] "Originally we were on holiday in Hong Kong and had an awful situation, as we were in an active pitch for a famous band and we didn't like the music," [...] Knight said. [...] "We were sent a track which had this awful DRM attached and it was frustrating us trying to play it through <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection.</b> Someone else sent us another track which was a simple MP3." [...] Tanaka eventually {{came up with the}} idea of a ball that [...] "connected through things". Knight didn't quite understand the idea at first, but through a process of miscommunication, they wrote the video's treatment about [...] "a crazy basketball" [...] which was the quickest treatment they had ever written at the time.|$|E

Later, the ISP relaunched the promotion, offering 31% of the <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection</b> costs deposited in the subscriber's bank account or twice of that on a prepaid Oi phone. The Oi Internet dial-up dialer can send SMS messages to Oi phones.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1980s, most Internet access was from {{personal}} computers and workstations directly connected to local area networks or from <b>dial-up</b> <b>connections</b> using modems and analog telephone lines. LANs typically operated at 10 Mbit/s, while modem data-rates grew from 1200 bit/s in the early 1980s, to 56 kbit/s by the late 1990s. Initially, <b>dial-up</b> <b>connections</b> were made from terminals or computers running terminal emulation software to terminal servers on LANs. These <b>dial-up</b> <b>connections</b> did not support end-to-end use of the Internet protocols and only provided terminal to host connections. The introduction of network access servers supporting the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and later the point-to-point protocol (PPP) extended the Internet protocols and made {{the full range of}} Internet services available to dial-up users; although slower, due to the lower data rates available using dial-up. Broadband Internet access, often shortened to just broadband, is simply defined as [...] "Internet access that is always on, and faster than the traditional dial-up access" [...] and so covers a wide range of technologies. Broadband connections are typically made using a computer's built in Ethernet networking capabilities, or by using a NIC expansion card.|$|R

5000|$|Computers {{connected}} to BITNET were generally located at universities and government agencies, due to {{limited access to}} computer network bandwidth. It was not uncommon for a university's entire network connection to run over a single leased telephone line or even a 4800 baud <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection.</b> Thus using scarce computing and network resources for [...] "frivolous" [...] purposes, such as chat, was often discouraged.|$|E

50|$|For {{many years}} {{satellite}} phones {{have been able}} to connect to the Internet. Bandwidth varies from about 2400 bit/s for Iridium network satellites and ACeS based phones to 15 kbit/s upstream and 60 kbit/s downstream for Thuraya handsets. Globalstar also provides Internet access at 9600 bit/s—like Iridium and ACeS a <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection</b> is required and is billed per minute, however both Globalstar and Iridium are planning to launch new satellites offering always-on data services at higher rates. With Thuraya phones the 9,600 bit/s <b>dial-up</b> <b>connection</b> is also possible, the 60 kbit/s service is always-on and the user is billed for data transferred (about $5 per megabyte). The phones can be connected to a laptop or other computer using a USB or RS-232 interface. Due to the low bandwidths involved it is extremely slow to browse the web with such a connection, but useful for sending email, Secure Shell data and using other low-bandwidth protocols. Since satellite phones tend to have omnidirectional antennas no alignment is required {{as long as there is}} a line of sight between the phone and the satellite.|$|E

50|$|One {{respected}} Tajik NGO {{estimates that}} 1 {{percent of households}} own personal computers and that most people access the Internet from home by way of <b>dial-up</b> <b>connections.</b> Access with DSL and wireless (Wi-Fi and WiMAX) technologies is limited by relatively high costs, and therefore restricted to {{a small number of}} commercial companies.|$|R
50|$|While typical computers, {{including}} high-end systems, {{tend to use}} wireless {{connections to}} connect to other computers {{as well as a}} router, gaming PCs often use Ethernet cables for the fastest and most reliable connection possible.Also, some companies sell dedicated network cards to reduce lag and increase the performance of multiplayer. A <b>dial-up</b> Internet <b>connection</b> is not an acceptable solution due to the very high latency (~400ms is common). Mobile broadband connections can also cause the same undesirable effects as <b>dial-up</b> <b>connections,</b> but can be considered less substantial, with latencies ranging 150ms and upwards (Less than 100 is recommended for a first-person shooter).|$|R
