40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) tritium {{facilities}} have used 1 st generation (Gen 1) metal hydride storage bed assemblies with process vessels (PVs) fabricated from 3 inch nominal pipe size (NPS) pipe {{to hold up}} to 12. 6 kg of LaNi{sub 4. 25 }Al{sub 0. 75 } metal hydride for tritium gas absorption, storage, and desorption for over 15 years. The 2 nd generation (Gen 2) of the bed design used the same NPS for the PV, but the added internal components produced a bed nominally 1. 2 m long, and presented a significant challenge for <b>heater</b> <b>cartridge</b> replacement in a footprint limited glove-box. A prototype 3 rd generation (Gen 3) metal hydride storage bed has been designed and fabricated as a replacement candidate for the Gen 2 storage bed. The prototype Gen 3 bed uses a PV pipe diameter of 4 inch NPS so the bed length can be reduced below 0. 7 m to facilitate <b>heater</b> <b>cartridge</b> replacement. For the Gen 3 prototype bed, modeling results show increased absorption rates when using hydrides with lower absorption pressures. To improve absorption performance compared to the Gen 2 beds, a LaNi{sub 4. 15 }Al{sub 0. 85 } material was procured and processed to obtain the desired pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) properties.

40|$|General Topic: Computational fluid {{dynamics}} modelling of physically large and detailed systems necessitates {{some degree of}} simplification to the physical system {{for the sake of}} computational efficiency. This study is part of an experimental and computational analysis of dry cask storage of waste nuclear fuel rods. This study will present simplifications and their justification for the electric <b>cartridge</b> <b>heaters</b> being used to simulate the waste nuclear fuel in the dry cask analysis. Specific Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the simplifications that can be made to the CFD simulation to reduce the computational load while maintaining the integrity and relevance of the simulation to the physical experiment. The heating elements of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>heaters</b> in question are comprised of tightly wound helical coils which are computationally expensive to model in CFD simulation. The desired outcome of the study is to determine if the <b>cartridge</b> <b>heaters</b> can be replaced by a specified heat flux boundary condition in the full CFD models of the dry cask storage system. Method: The approach of this study will be to make a series of simplifications to the full model of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>heaters</b> and compare the outer surface temperature and heat flux profiles from each simplification step to determine the validity of the simplifications. Results: Preliminary CFD simulations of both fully detailed and simplified <b>cartridge</b> <b>heater</b> models indicate that the geometric simplifications to the <b>cartridge</b> <b>heater</b> models have a minimal effect on the outer surface temperature and heat flux profiles thereby justifying the elimination of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>heaters</b> from the CFD model of the dry cask storage system. Conclusions: Geometric simplifications to the full <b>cartridge</b> <b>heater</b> model will both reduce the computational load of the CFD simulation and maintain the integrity of the simulation and its approximation of the physical dry cask fuel storage experiment...|$|R

To provide uniform temperature to the metal plate, many factors need to be considered such as choice of heating technology, uniformity of a heat source, a type of control, etc. This paper aims to study {{the temperature}} uniformity of metal plate using closed-loop oscillating heat pipe (CLOHP) as a heat transfer device. The metal plates which were P- 20 with the size of 306 x 130 mm 2 were used. Metal plate was gouged to a depth of 3 mm for installing the CLOHP. Distances from the heating device to the metal plate surface were 5 and 10 mm. The surface temperatures of the metal plate were controlled at 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C.

40|$|As of today, no {{research}} has been performed to study the response of Compounded High Explosive Composite (CHEC) pellet arrays to fast or slow cook off. Cook-off tests are fairly standard tests for homogeneous-fill high explosives (HE?s), but, when using pressed pellet arrays as fill, the results of such cook-off tests are unknown. This research consisted of developing and designing an ?indoor? cook-off test capable of testing pressed Nitrotriazolone (NTO) pellets to assess thermal stability characteristics and critical temperature. The test method designed consists of the main testing vessel?the Petersen Group strand burner IV composed of 17 - 4 PH stainless steel with extreme pressure and temperature capabilities?a sample bolt holder used to hold the NTO pellet, a 400 -W <b>cartridge</b> <b>heater,</b> two type K thermocouples, and an aluminized heat barrier. The <b>cartridge</b> <b>heater</b> was operated using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) temperature controller. The data from the thermocouples used to monitor pellet and surrounding air temperatures were recorded using a USB-interfaced data logger capable of taking measurements {{at a rate of}} 1 sample per second. A series of thermal cook-off tests was conducted revealing critical temperatures for the NTO pellets ranging between 175 and 203 ?C. For slow cook-off tests, the average critical temperature, TC, was determined to be 196 ? 7 ?C. Fast cook-off tests revealed an average TC of 189 ? 1 ?C. Due to these temperatures occurring over such a wide range and evidence of partially burned explosive residue material after each test, it is suggested that the pellets are undergoing premature decomposition, and thus a critical temperature for these NTO pellets cannot be determined to a high accuracy. As such, the thermal stability of NTO pellets in CHEC arrays remains to be verified.
