When a void is compressed its volume decreases and {{the temperature in the}} void increases. The local thermal source due to the void deformation in energetic material forms a temperature load which may initiate combustion and detonation. The temperature-time history in the void was called temperature load in this work. Its peak value and holding time are the necessary and sufficient condition initiating combustion or detonation of energetic material surrounding the void.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detonation}} (knocking) {{in the internal}} combuction engines, especially in the Otto (petrol) engine, that makes some damages, low fuel economy and performance. Until now, the detonation problem has not been solved completely. In this paper, the problem had been studied to discover the new method, how to reject detonation without any changes of engine structure, easy to install and can be activate immediately. The detonation phenomenon have been explained by three theory, that are auto ignition theory, detonation theory and flame vibration, that make noise, detonation (knocking) and damages of some equipments. The detonation can be cause by many things, such as high compression ratio, low grade of fuel, bad combustion camber, low turbulence, large spark advance (timing). For the conventional ignition system, a governor and a vacuum advancer control the ignition timing. It is reliable mechanism, but can not work properly at all conditions. Most of them make detonation occur at low speed and low endurance of the contact breaker. The last technology, electronically device with detonation sensor replace the conventional system. Combination ignition system, the new system, integration of conventional and electronically system, can control the <b>detonation,</b> <b>by</b> making correction of the spark advance (ignition timing) automatically in all condition of speed and load (throttle), using fuzzy logic reasoning (calculation) in the microcontroller. This research also tries to detect <b>detonation</b> <b>by</b> using the vibration pattern {{with the hope of}} <b>detonation</b> detection <b>by</b> this method will be more stable and reliable. Detonation detection with machine vibration recordings was be done by measuring its intensity, but this often happens is unstable. The result of using the new (combination) ignition system in the engine is the rejected detonation, improving performance and efficiency. Another result, the motor vibration pattern can be recorded and the vibration pattern of detonation occurs at high frequency. It has a certain pattern in synch with his ignition. For the further the research will use the Neuro-Fuzzy Adaptive Control for more applicable in the engine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Detonations in {{explosive}} mixtures of ammonium-nitrate-fuel-oil (ANFO) con-fined by aluminum allow for transport of detonation energy {{ahead of the}} detonation front due to the aluminum sound speed exceeding the detonation velocity. The net effect of this energy transport on the detonation is unclear. It could enhance the <b>detonation</b> <b>by</b> precom-pressing the explosive near the wall. Alternatively, it could decrease the explosive per-formance by crushing porosity required for initiation by shock compression or destroying confinement ahead of the detonation. At present, these phenomena are not well understood. But with slowly detonating, non-ideal high explosive (NIHE) systems becoming increas-ingly common, proper understanding and prediction {{of the effects of}} high-sound-speed confiners on NIHE is desirable. Experiments are discussed that measured the effect of this ANFO detonation energy transported upstream of the front by a 76 -mm-inner-diameter alu-minum confining tube. Detonation velocity and front shape were recorded as a function of confiner wall thickness and length. Detonation shape profiles are characteristically differ-ent from records with weak confinement and displayed small curvature near the confining surface. This variation was attributed to energy transported upstream modifying the inter-action between the NIHE and confiner. Average detonation velocities were seen to increase with increasing confiner thickness, while wavefront curvature decreased due to the stiffer, subsonic confinement. Preliminary Dn-κ analysis of the data was performed and required a modified fitting waveform to properly represent the experimental front shapes. It was concluded that the confiner was able to transport energy ahead of the detonation and that this transport has a definite effect on the <b>detonation</b> <b>by</b> modifying its characteristic shape...|$|R
