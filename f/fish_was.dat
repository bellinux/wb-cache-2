5|$|On September 11, 1893 <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> {{buried in}} Garrison at St. Philip's Church-in-the-Highlands Cemetery under waving {{trees on the}} hills along the Hudson River shoreline. He was buried next {{to his wife and}} oldest daughter. <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> buried near the grave of Edwards Pierrepont, President Grant's U.S. Attorney General. Many notable persons {{attended}} Fish's funeral, while Bishop Potter conducted services. Julia Grant, widowed wife of Ulysses S. Grant, attended Fish's funeral.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> a {{founding}} member of Kokoromi, a collective that explores experimental gameplay ideas, and organized Montreal's annual GAMMA games events. While Fez was in development, Fish worked on other unreleased games at Polytron including SuperHyperCube and Power Pill.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> born on August 3, 1808 {{at what is}} {{now known}} as the Stuyvesant–Fish House in Greenwich Village, New York City, to Nicholas Fish and Elizabeth Stuyvesant (a {{descendant}} of New Amsterdam's Peter Stuyvesant), and his parents named him after their friend Alexander Hamilton. Nicholas Fish (1758–1833) was a leading Federalist politician and notable figure of the American Revolutionary War. Col. <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> active in the Yorktown Campaign that resulted in the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. Peter Stuyvesant was a prominent founder of New York, then a Dutch Colony, and his family owned much property in Manhattan.|$|E
50|$|Recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for {{pleasure}} or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for economic profit, or subsistence <b>fishing,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>fishing</b> for survival.|$|R
50|$|Bait <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} forage <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used {{particularly}} by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, {{and is used}} in that context. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can <b>be</b> other larger <b>fish,</b> seabirds and marine mammals. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms also overlap {{in the sense that}} most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and most forage <b>fish</b> can also <b>be</b> used as bait fish.|$|R
50|$|Game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> {{pursued by}} {{recreational}} anglers. They can be freshwater or saltwater fish. Game <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> eaten after being caught. Some game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also targeted commercially, particularly salmon.|$|R
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> also eaten.|$|E
5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E
50|$|Standard size of male <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> 3.2″ (8cm) {{and female}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> 4.8″ (12cm).|$|R
50|$|Hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>are</b> {{popular among}} the {{residents}} of the town. Hunters chiefly pursue white-tailed deer, pheasant, quail, and raccoon. Local <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> focused on catfish. Other game animals and <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also found in the area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>is</b> popular on the island. Until {{the late}} 1980s, skate <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> a growing industry.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{theme of}} {{reconciliation}} between a dying {{father and his}} son had special significance for Burton, as his father had died in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct. Big <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> shot on location in Alabama {{in a series of}} fairy tale vignettes evoking the tone of a Southern Gothic fantasy. The film received award nominations in multiple film categories, including four Golden Globe Award nominations, seven nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, two Saturn Award nominations, and an Oscar and a Grammy Award nomination for Danny Elfman's original score.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{described as}} Raja laevis by Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1818. The scientific name was later changed to the currently valid name Dipturus laevis. It {{has also been}} misidentified as Raia granulata by Theodore Gill, an American ichthyologist, in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, {{is derived from the}} Greek words di, meaning two, and pteryx, meaning wing. Raja, the original genus which was coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a valid subgenus.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5000|$|Fishing - Catch {{some fish}} for points. Small <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 100 points, medium <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 200 points, and big <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> worth 300 points. Careful! Do not catch the shark, {{if you catch}} it, you'll lose 1000 points. 1 ...|$|R
5000|$|A game <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> any {{species of}} fish pursued for sport by recreationalists (anglers). The capture of game <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> usually tightly regulated. In comparison, nongame <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all <b>fish</b> not {{considered}} game fish. Game <b>fish</b> may <b>be</b> eaten after being caught, though increasingly anglers are practicing catch-and-release tactics to improve fish populations.|$|R
50|$|Smoked <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> <b>fish</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> cured by smoking. Foods have been smoked by humans {{throughout}} history. Originally {{this was done}} as a preservative. In more recent times <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> readily preserved by refrigeration and freezing and the smoking of <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> generally done for the unique taste and flavour imparted by the smoking process.|$|R
5|$|The {{next step}} was to take an oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|Their diet {{consisted}} of mainly grains and beans and in fishing communities <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> usually substituted for meat. Bread, wine, and olives were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double-baked and dried bread called paximadion (Greek: παξιμάδιον). As in antiquity and modern times, {{the most common}} cultivations in the choraphia (Greek: χωράφια) were olive groves and vineyards. While Liutprand of Cremona, a visitor from Italy, found Greek wine irritating as it was often flavoured with resin (retsina) most other Westerners admired Greek wines, Cretan in particular being famous.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the line}} has since been discontinued, the company's Original Chicken Sandwich is still offered in North America, Europe and other markets. The ham and cheese {{sandwich}} was a regional offering, however it was reintroduced nationally in the United States as the Yumbo Sandwich in November 2014. The Yumbo name refers to a smaller snack based sandwich from the 1970s and early 1980s which was a heated ham and cheese sandwich served on a smaller, hamburger roll. The Long <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> discontinued and the Whaler fish sandwich was reintroduced in 1983, while the Steak Burger sandwich was discontinued altogether.|$|E
25|$|Forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as bait fish or feeder <b>fish.</b> Bait <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. Bait <b>fish,</b> by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most bait <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also forage <b>fish,</b> and vice versa. Feeder <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|R
5000|$|The jellynose fishes or tadpole <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> {{the small}} order Ateleopodiformes. This group of ray-finned <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> monotypic, {{containing}} a single family Ateleopodidae. It has {{about a dozen}} species in four genera, but these enigmatic <b>fishes</b> <b>are</b> in need of taxonomic revision.|$|R
25|$|Like coastal {{demersal}} fish, {{deep sea}} demersal <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> divided into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> negatively buoyant and benthopelagic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> neutrally buoyant.|$|R
5|$|A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, {{it states}} that hairy trout {{were the result}} of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, {{fisherman}} would act as barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{planned to}} start filming in October 2002, but {{principal}} photography in Alabama {{did not begin}} until January 13, 2003. Apart from filming in Paris for one week in May, Big <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> entirely shot in Alabama, mostly in Wetumpka and Montgomery (such as the Cloverdale neighborhood). Brief filming also took place in Tallassee and {{on the campus of}} Huntingdon College. Scenes for the town of Spectre were filmed on a custom set located on an island in Lake Jackson between Montgomery and Millbrook, Alabama, adjacent to the Alabama River. Principal photography for Big Fish in Alabama continued until the first week of April. and is estimated to have generated as much as $25 million for the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Dodd, {{also known}} as Mullawa or Mulla walla (flying <b>fish),</b> <b>was</b> an Arunta or Arrente Indigenous man from central Australia. It is unclear if Dodd was from the Northern Territory or South Australia: one source states {{he was born in}} Alice Springs, and another states he was born at the Hermannsburg Mission, to the town's south-west. However a third source {{suggests}} Oodnadatta, across the border in South Australia, while Dodd himself, in a 2011 interview, stated he was South Australian. A 1953 newspaper report states that he was from Coober Pedy and had been resident at Colebrook Home, which housed Indigenous children from northern South Australia; some residents subsequently identified as members of the Stolen Generation. The only record of a birth date is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' Nominal Roll of Australian Veterans of the Korean War, which gives 1 June 1928.|$|E
50|$|Oily <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} white fish, which contain oil {{only in the}} liver, and much less overall than oily fish. Examples of white <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> cod, haddock and flatfish. White <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> usually {{demersal}} <b>fish</b> which live {{on or near the}} seafloor, whereas oily <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> pelagic, living in the water column away from the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Coarse <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} in the United Kingdom and Ireland for angling for coarse <b>fish.</b> Coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> distinguished from game fish. Freshwater game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all salmonids - most particularly salmon, trout and char - so generally coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> not salmonids. There is disagreement over whether grayling should be classified as a game fish or a coarse <b>fish.</b> Fly <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> the technique usually used for freshwater game fishing, while other angling techniques are usually used for coarse fishing. The sport of coarse fishing and the techniques it uses are particularly popular in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, and {{as well as in}} some former British Commonwealth countries and among British expatriates.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in local}} markets {{as a food}} source and small <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> used in {{preparation}} of prahok.|$|R
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the <b>fish</b> <b>was</b> frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
5|$|In his will, {{written the}} day before he died, Baltimore beseeched his friends Wentworth and Cottington to act as guardians and {{supervisors}} to his first son Cecil, who inherited the title of Lord Baltimore and the imminent grant of Maryland. Baltimore's two colonies in the New World continued under the proprietorship of his family. Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of <b>fish,</b> <b>was</b> expropriated by Sir David Kirke, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754. Although Baltimore's failed Avalon venture marked the end of an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of meat was {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.|$|E
50|$|Commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>was</b> once {{conducted}} {{within the}} inlet but all licences {{have now been}} cancelled and only recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> permitted.|$|R
50|$|Polypterus katangae <b>is</b> a <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> {{found in}} central African lakes and rivers. Another {{name for the}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> P. congicus.|$|R
