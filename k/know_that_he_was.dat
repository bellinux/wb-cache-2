On that day Alberti moved to Azcuénaga's house and from it he observed the events in the plaza, along with many other patriots gathered there. He was there when he came to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> chosen {{as a member of the}} new Junta. The reasons of Alberti's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists, and Alberti in particular may have been elected to serve as chaplain of the government.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E

25|$|James Robertson was a Roman Catholic {{priest who}} was born in Scotland but spent much of his life in a monastery in Regensberg, Germany. He went to England where he took {{employment}} as a tutor to an aristocratic family. While there, he let Wellesley <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> willing to serve the British government in its struggle against Napoleon's empire. Canning contacted Robertson who accepted the mission {{to get in touch with}} La Romana. The spy was introduced into Europe via a smuggling ship that passed from Heligoland to Bremerhaven. Finding that the Spaniards were no longer in the vicinity of the Hanseatic towns, Robertson traveled north into Denmark, posing as a German merchant of chocolate and cigars, which were contraband goods.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, to let them <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live {{for the rest of his}} life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965, has said: [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to leave acoustic.

500|$|On 9 August 1942, {{his orders}} were {{abruptly}} changed. MacArthur, now Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area, had requested that a corps headquarters {{be sent to}} his command. Major General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., had originally been detailed for the assignment, but as Marshall informed MacArthur, [...] "Richardson's intense feelings regarding service under Australian command made his assignment appear unwise." [...] Eichelberger's I Corps headquarters was ready for overseas service and had training in amphibious warfare, and Eichelberger had experience working with MacArthur, so Marshall selected him for the job instead. Eichelberger was {{not happy with the}} assignment, especially when he found out about Richardson, and [...] "knew General MacArthur well enough to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be difficult to get along with".|$|E
500|$|Whereas the {{influence}} of Greek tragedies {{is clear from the}} choice of title, the absent father, and the roles of incest and parricide, Littell makes it clear that he was influenced by more than the structure of The Oresteia. He found that the idea of morality in Ancient Greece is more relevant for making judgments about responsibility for the Holocaust than the Judeo-Christian approach, wherein the idea of sin can be blurred by the concepts such as intentional sin, unintentional sin, sinning by thought, or sinning by deed. For the Greeks it was the commission of the act itself upon which one is judged: Oedipus is guilty of patricide, even if he did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> killing his father.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Ike's backstory as a Canadian child {{adopted by}} the Broflovskis. Ever since the recurring characters Terrance and Phillip were established to be Canadians in the season one finale [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", and the subsequent season two premiere [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus", all Canadian characters on South Park have shared the same simplistic design: having simple beady eyes and a floppy head made up of two halves. While Ike {{had been on the}} show since its first episode, the writers originally did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be Canadian; he was retroactively made one based on his visual similarity to Terrance and Phillip. Ike's backstory would {{play an important role in}} the film , which involves a fictional American–Canadian war, as well as in future episodes of the series, such as the season seven episode, [...] "It's Christmas in Canada", in which Ike's biological parents take him away from the Broflovskis and bring him back to Canada.|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{has also}} criticized a Christian video game {{based on the}} Left Behind series. In , players {{participate}} in [...] "battles raging {{in the streets of}} New York," [...] according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to give them something that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{stories that}} were {{centered}} on scientific inventions and set in the future, in the tradition of Jules Verne, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. [...] The first science fiction (sf) magazine, Amazing Stories, was launched in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback {{at the height of the}} pulp magazine era. [...] It was successful, and helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, but in February 1929 Gernsback lost control of the publisher when it went bankrupt. [...] By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. In the middle of the year he launched three new magazines: a non-sf magazine titled Radio Craft, and two sf pulps titled Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories. [...] These were followed in September 1929 by the first issue of Science Wonder Quarterly, and in October Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought material from, letting them <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seeing more demand for [...] "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good scientific background". [...] He named Arthur B. Reeve's [...] "Craig Kennedy" [...] stories as an example, and also mentioned S.S. Van Dine's [...] "Philo Vance" [...] stories, which were very popular at the time. [...] In the January 1930 issue of both the sf magazines, Gernsback advertised the new magazine that he hoped to populate with these stories: Scientific Detective Monthly.|$|E
500|$|In January 1945, McGovern used R time to {{see every}} sight that he could in Rome, and to {{participate}} in an audience with the Pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to First Lieutenant. On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern. (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the victim of that incident but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been worth the price if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern was greatly relieved.) On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern's 35thmission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force's requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said [...] "Hell can't be any worse than that" [...] – and the Dakota Queen was hit multiple times, resulting in 110holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.|$|E

500|$|... is Ichigo Momomiya's classmate {{and romantic}} interest. He later reveals that he shares her {{feelings}} and they begin dating. Masaya knows Mew Ichigo's real identity, but initially pretends otherwise as he knows Ichigo {{does not want}} him to know. Ichigo describes Masaya as [...] "smart", [...] "cute", [...] "very athletic" [...] and [...] "popular at school". He is also depicted as being a polite and calm person, though he does have moments when he yells at others in anger and acts jealous and possessive regarding Ichigo. Towards the end of the series, Masaya reveals that as an orphan, he began acting like a [...] "perfect child" [...] to be adopted, in reality, however, he felt sick of humans and disgusted by how they treat the planet. He also reveals that Ichigo is the sole exception, and it was only with her that he felt like a [...] "real human being". As the series progresses, it is revealed that Masaya is the Blue Knight, but that Masaya did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the Blue Knight, nor did the Blue Knight appear to have any knowledge that he was Masaya. Once Masaya becomes aware of his transformation, he realizes it was born from his desire to protect Ichigo. Shortly after this revelation, Masaya collapses and reawakens as Deep Blue, the leader of the aliens and the Mew Mew's final enemy. Deep Blue claims that he created Masaya in order to deceive the world until the time was right for his awakening. Masaya sacrifices himself by releasing the final Mew Aqua inside his body in order to stop Deep Blue, and is revived when Ichigo gives her life to save him. In turn, the mew aqua remaining his body then saves her. At the end of the series, Masaya decides to go to England to study the endangered species used for the Mew Project and the Mew Mews hold a mock wedding for Masaya and Ichigo before he leaves. In Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Masaya is the first to sense the new danger to the Mew Mews, and encourages Ichigo to return to help her friends. Towards the end of a la Mode, he also returns to Tokyo.|$|E
