50|$|If {{conditions}} are suitable, the spore will germinate producing microscopic <b>fungal</b> <b>threads</b> called hyphae.|$|R
50|$|The fungus itself infects {{all parts}} of the host plant by invading the ovaries of its host. The {{infection}} causes the corn kernels to swell up into tumor-like galls, whose tissues, texture and developmental pattern are mushroom-like. These galls are made up of hypertrophied cells of the infected plant, along with resulting <b>fungal</b> <b>threads,</b> and blue-black spores. These dark-colored spores give the cob a burned, scorched appearance; these are the intention behind the genera name Ustilago, from the Latin word ustilare (to burn).|$|R
50|$|In {{preferred}} weather conditions, a teliospore {{which has}} successfully {{attached to a}} susceptible host will germinate to produce {{what is known as}} a promycelium. At the apex of this structure, then, can be found 65-180 primary sporidia. Secondary sporidia can then either bud from the primary sporidia or from the <b>fungal</b> <b>threads</b> of the mycelium itself. These secondary sporidia are responsible for infecting young host plants through the ovary wall in the flowering stage. Secondary sporidia accomplish this by penetrating the epidermis of host glumes via germ tubes. Sporidia are then able to enter the maturing kernels and leave vast numbers of teliospores where healthy kernel tissue used to be. During harvest teliospores fall from the kernels to the soil from which point they may be carried elsewhere by wind or tools, thereby restarting the disease cycle.|$|R
500|$|The bulk of Aureoboletus mirabilis is {{typically}} hidden from sight, existing as masses of almost invisible <b>fungal</b> <b>threads</b> called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing {{structures of the}} fungus. The mushrooms, or fruit bodies are created solely {{for the production of}} spores by which the fungus reproduces itself. The caps of the fruit bodies are up to [...] in diameter, red or brownish-red in color, initially convex but flattening out as they develop. The cap is fleshy, with a rough surface that is slippery or slimy in young specimens, or in moist environments. Older specimens generally have dry and velvety cap surfaces. The texture of the cap surface is rough, at first because of flattened-down (...) fibrils, and later with bent-back (...) scales or sometimes with cracked rough patches that resemble dried cracked mud. Young specimens may have a small flap of thin tissue attached to the margin or edge of the cap, remnants of a reduced partial veil. The surface is covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs, and has persistent papillae.|$|R
50|$|Beneficial {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations are}} to be found in many of our edible and flowering crops. Shewell Cooper suggests that these include at least 80% of the brassica and solanum families (including tomatoes and potatoes), as well as the majority of tree species, especially in forest and woodlands. Here the mycorrhizae create a fine underground mesh that extends greatly beyond the limits of the tree's roots, greatly increasing their feeding range and actually causing neighbouring trees to become physically interconnected. The benefits of mycorrhizal relations to their plant partners are not limited to nutrients, but can be essential for plant reproduction: In situations where little light is able to reach the forest floor, such as the North American pine forests, a young seedling cannot obtain sufficient light to photosynthesise for itself and will not grow properly in a sterile soil. But, if the ground is underlain by a mycorrhizal mat, then the developing seedling will throw down roots that can link with the <b>fungal</b> <b>threads</b> and through them obtain the nutrients it needs, often indirectly obtained from its parents or neighbouring trees.|$|R

500|$|Like all mushrooms, {{the fruit}} body of Geastrum triplex is the visible {{part of a}} larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of nearly {{invisible}} <b>fungal</b> <b>threads</b> called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The fruit body—created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal—is designed to produce and disseminate spores. Geastrum triplex has the largest fruit body of the earthstar mushrooms. The immature fruit body is typically [...] in diameter, and up to [...] broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5cm) after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the ostiole, covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is sessile) grayish brown to [...] "wood brown" [...] when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the gleba. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a columella not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited.|$|R
