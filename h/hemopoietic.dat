2500|$|In 1905, Paul Carnot {{proposed}} {{the idea that}} a hormone regulates the production of red blood cells. After conducting experiments on rabbits subject to bloodletting, Carnot and Deflandre attributed an increase in red blood cells in rabbit subjects to a hemotropic factor called hemopoietin. Eva Bonsdorff and Eeva Jalavisto called the <b>hemopoietic</b> substance 'erythropoietin'. K.R. Reissman and Allan J.
