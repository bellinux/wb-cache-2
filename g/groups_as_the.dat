5|$|Before {{this the}} church had {{maintained}} {{a distance from the}} Armenian revolutionary <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health is a priority in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk <b>groups.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E

30|$|For each {{independent}} sample, {{we needed}} to identify one <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> control and one <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> treatment <b>group.</b> Because sunk costs serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> independent variable manipulated at different levels, we defined the zero- or low-sunk-cost-level <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> control <b>group</b> and <b>the</b> high-sunk-cost-level <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> treatment <b>group.</b> The dependent variable of the sunk-cost effect can be operationalized in multiple ways, depending on the respective decision type. In utilization decisions, individuals may use a higher sunk-cost alternative with a higher intensity or just choose to utilize the paid good or service despite other preferences or alternatives. In progress decisions, individuals may commit additional resources to an initially chosen alternative, report an increased probability to allocate funds, or simply choose to continue to invest.|$|R
5|$|The Congress was {{especially}} notable {{for bringing the}} International into much closer contact with Trotskyist groups from across the globe. These included such significant <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Revolutionary Workers' Party of Bolivia and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party {{in what was then}} Ceylon, but the previously large Vietnamese Trotskyist groups had mostly been eliminated or absorbed by the supporters of Ho Chi Minh.|$|E
5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian <b>groups.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine â€“ General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> greatest threat to the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E
