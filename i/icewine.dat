5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for <b>Icewine,</b> where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
25|$|Sparkling <b>icewine</b> in Ontario {{was first}} crafted by Canadian wine writer Konrad Ejbich {{in his home}} cellar in Toronto. Unique to Ontario and {{generally}} referred to as <b>Icewine</b> Dosage, this sparkling wine is produced by topping a Traditional Method, dry sparkling wine with a dosage of <b>Icewine,</b> which is slightly off-dry {{with a hint of}} <b>Icewine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the requirements regarding sources of grapes, VQA wines may be made from Vitis vinifera grape variety and approved hybrid varieties. In British Columbia, VQA wines are made primarily with vinifera grapes, while Ontario uses a range of vinifera varieties and notably permits the use of Vidal, particularly {{in the production of}} some of Canada's <b>icewines.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of some mechanical {{properties of the}} berry skin and pedicel during on-vine drying of wine-grapes was studied, {{in order to assess}} the suitability of two alpine cultivars, Becuét and Fumin, for the production of <b>icewines.</b> This overripening process on the vine, which lasts until complete freezing of the grapes, results in marked changes in the mechanical characteristics of the grapes. During grape dehydration, the skin thickness increased in both cultivars (Becuét + 73 μm, Fumin + 85 μm). The skin hardness also increased, particularly in the Becuét berries, in which the break skin force and break skin energy values increased of 0. 148 N and 0. 823 mJ, respectively. In contrast, the peduncle detachment force decreased during the drying process; in Becuét grapes, this occurred after only 15 days. While the two cultivars have different mechanical properties, both proved to be suitable for the production of <b>icewines</b> ("Vini del ghiaccio"); the changes that occur during on-vine drying do not preclude the resistance of the berries to shattering and of the berry skin to splitting...|$|R

2500|$|Cabernet Franc is {{becoming}} more popular in Canada, being planted in Ontario's Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, {{the north shore of}} Lake Erie, Pelee Island, [...] and the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. [...] While it is most often used in blends, it is gaining some popularity as a single varietal and as <b>icewine.</b> Ripening about two weeks earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon, it often fares better in Canada's cooler climate than other red wine grape varieties. Ontario Cabernet Francs often add a characteristic vegetal, raspberry like flavor to a wine with moderate acidity.|$|E
