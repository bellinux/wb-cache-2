40|$|Some {{northern}} {{varieties of}} Basque possess three series of plosive or oral stop consonants: voiced /b d g/, voiceless unaspirated /p t k/, and voiceless aspirated /ph th kh/. Among {{the languages of}} Europe, Basque seems to be unique in presenting this three-way opposition (although a similar contrast was found in Ancient Greek {{and it is not}} unusual {{in other parts of the}} world). For this reason it is important to document this phonological contrast; even more so since the dialects that maintain this contrast (which is believed to have been much more general in Basque in the past) appear to be in serious danger of extinction. For the study reported here, data were collected from 4 male speakers of Zuberoan or Souletin, the easternmost Basque dialect using a high-quality digital recorder. The data were then analyzed using a computerized speech analysis sytem (Ahotsa, developed by I. <b>Hernaez).</b> Voice Onset Time (VOT) measurements were taken, since this acoustic dimension has been proven to have an excellent correlation with voicing and aspiration in many other languages. The results agree with those that have been reported for other languages with a similar three-way contrast. In utterance-initial position, /b d g/ are prevoiced (negative VOT), /p t k/ have present a short lag (VOT around 20 ms) and the aspirated /ph th kh/ present a much longer lag (average VOT between 60 and 80 ms depending on the place of articulation of the consonant) ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Podocalyxin (gene name PODXL) is a CD 34 -related sialomucin {{implicated in}} the {{regulation}} of cell adhesion, migration and polarity. Upregulated expression of podocalyxin is linked to poor patient survival in epithelial cancers. However, {{it is not known}} if podocalyxin has a functional role in tumor progression. METHODS: We silenced podocalyxin expression in the aggressive basal-like human (MDA-MB- 231) and mouse (4 T 1) breast cancer cell lines and also overexpressed podocalyxin in the more benign human breast cancer cell line, MCF 7. We evaluated how podocalyxin affects tumorsphere formation in vitro and compared the ability of podocalyxin-deficient and podocalyxin-replete cell lines to form tumors and metastasize using xenogenic or syngeneic transplant models in mice. Finally, in an effort to develop therapeutic treatments for systemic cancers, we generated a series of antihuman podocalyxin antibodies and screened these for their ability to inhibit tumor progression in xenografted mice. RESULTS: Although deletion of podocalyxin does not alter gross cell morphology and growth under standard (adherent) culture conditions, expression of PODXL is required for efficient formation of tumorspheres in vitro. Correspondingly, silencing podocalyxin resulted in attenuated primary tumor growth and invasiveness in mice and severely impaired the formation of distant metastases. Likewise, in competitive tumor engraftment assays where we injected a 50 : 50 mixture of control and shPODXL (short-hairpin RNA targeting PODXL) -expressing cells, we found that podocalyxin-deficient cells exhibited a striking decrease in the ability to form clonal tumors in the lung, liver and bone marrow. Finally, to validate podocalyxin as a viable target for immunotherapy, we screened a series of novel antihuman podocalyxin antibodies for their ability to inhibit tumor progression in vivo. One of these antibodies, PODOC 1, potently blocked tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: We show that podocalyxin {{plays a key role in}} the formation of primary tumors and distant tumor metastasis. In addition, we validate podocalyxin as potential target for monoclonal antibody therapy to inhibit primary tumor growth and systemic dissemination.

40|$|Lyle J Palmer is {{a member}} of the GIANT ConsortiumNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) {{clusters}} in families, but the only known common genetic variants influencing risk are near PNPLA 3. We sought to identify additional genetic variants influencing NAFLD using genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of computed tomography (CT) measured hepatic steatosis, a non-invasive measure of NAFLD, in large population based samples. Using variance components methods, we show that CT hepatic steatosis is heritable (∼ 26 %– 27 %) in family-based Amish, Family Heart, and Framingham Heart Studies (n = 880 to 3, 070). By carrying out a fixed-effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) results between CT hepatic steatosis and ∼ 2. 4 million imputed or genotyped SNPs in 7, 176 individuals from the Old Order Amish, Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik study (AGES), Family Heart, and Framingham Heart Studies, we identify variants associated at genome-wide significant levels (p< 5 × 10 − 8) in or near PNPLA 3, NCAN, and PPP 1 R 3 B. We genotype these and 42 other top CT hepatic steatosis-associated SNPs in 592 subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD from the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN). In comparisons with 1, 405 healthy controls from the Myocardial Genetics Consortium (MIGen), we observe significant associations with histologic NAFLD at variants in or near NCAN, GCKR, LYPLAL 1, and PNPLA 3, but not PPP 1 R 3 B. Variants at these five loci exhibit distinct patterns of association with serum lipids, as well as glycemic and anthropometric traits. We identify common genetic variants influencing CT–assessed steatosis and risk of NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis associated variants are not uniformly associated with NASH/fibrosis or result in abnormalities in serum lipids or glycemic and anthropometric traits, suggesting genetic heterogeneity in the pathways influencing these traits.
