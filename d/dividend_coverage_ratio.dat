3000|$|Volatile future {{cash flows}} {{and a high}} {{leverage}} may induce situations in which a firm’s liquidity is insufficient to fully meet its contractually fixed payment obligations (Rawls and Smithson 1990).

Since corporate hedging lowers cash flow volatility and therefore also the default probability, it reduces expected costs of financial distress and adds value to the firm (Brown and Toft 2002; Hahnenstein and Röder 2003; Smith and Stulz 1985; Stulz 1996).

Electronic transport behaviours of rGO samples with coverages of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50  % are obtained together with the properties of intrinsic graphene sheet for comparison. It is exposed that depending on the <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio,</b> rGO structures show different and peculiar electronic transport characteristics such as (i) rGO with 6.25 and 12.5  % coverages show NDR behaviour, (ii) the transmission of the GO sample with 6.25  % <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> diminishes after the NDR voltage range, (iii) the I–V characteristic of the rGO with 25  % coverage is highly linear making it to be suitable for use as interconnects and (iv) while rGO with 50  % coverage shows non-conducting behaviour near zero applied voltage as estimated by previous studies [21], it starts to be conducting beyond a threshold voltage. These different transport characteristics of rGO samples are shown to be originated from the variation of their transmission eigenstates and the localization degree of these eigenstates by the applied voltage. It is concluded that the voltage-dependent transport properties of rGO structures have diverse behaviours depending on the <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> hence their peculiar I–V characteristics can be engineered to achieve specific functions in nanoscale circuits easily since the <b>coverage</b> <b>ratios</b> of rGO structures can be precisely controlled using reduction by laser light.|$|R

DESIGN [...] Pilot study of women eligible for screening but not for personal invitation. The results of this study were compared with the results of routinely screened younger women (aged 50 - 64) from the same general practice. SETTING [...] One group general practice in south Manchester. PATIENTS [...] The 631 women aged 65 - 79 on the practice list. A total of 42 (7 %) were excluded by the general practitioner, and 22 (4 %) invitation letters were returned by the post office. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Response rates to invitation for screening assessed by three indices: crude population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio,</b> crude invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio,</b> and corrected invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> RESULTS [...] 344 Patients aged 65 - 79 (61 % of those invited, excluding those who could not be traced) were screened compared with 77 % of women aged 50 - 64. The three response indices were higher for younger women than older: crude population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> = 66. 5 %, crude invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> = 69. 3 %, corrected invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> = 76. 8 % for women aged 50 - 64, compared with 54. 5 %, 58. 4 %, and 60. 7 % respectively for women aged 65 - 79.

These two figures are often listed in advertisements for plots of land such as 70:400 (where 70 means the building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> is 70% and 400 is the floor area ratio or 400%).

Both maximum values vary according to the location of the land and width of facing roadway, with more built-up areas with wider roads generally allowing greater maximum floorspace, and building coverage dictated by factors such as frontage, nearby roads, and construction materials.
