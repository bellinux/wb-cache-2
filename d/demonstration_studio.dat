50|$|The Fizz-Nik was {{a sponsor}} on The Soupy Sales Show {{in the early}} 1960s.

50|$|Although Southall {{was never}} {{on the staff}} of the Birmingham School of Art, he {{maintained}} close friendships with the core of staff and pupils at the school who would later be identified as the Birmingham Group of Artist-Craftsmen - introducing artists such as Henry Payne, Maxwell Armfield and Arthur Gaskin (a lifelong friend) to his methods during technical <b>demonstrations</b> at his <b>studio</b> in Edgbaston.|$|R
5|$|While Rand Miller stated Cyan {{would not}} make another sequel to Myst, Mattel (then {{the owner of the}} Myst franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} a sequel to several video game companies who created detailed story proposals and technology <b>demonstrations.</b> Presto <b>Studios,</b> makers of the Journeyman Project adventure games, was hired to develop Myst III. Presto spent millions developing the game and used the studio's entire staff to complete the project, which took {{two and a half years}} to develop. Soon after Myst III: Exile was released, Presto was shut down, and Exile publisher Ubisoft developed the sequel, Myst IV: Revelation, internally. Meanwhile, Cyan produced the spinoff title , which included an aborted multiplayer component allowing players to cooperatively solve puzzles.|$|R
2500|$|In {{their book}} on the history and legacy of the Moog synthesizer, Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco cite Harrison's use of Krause's <b>studio</b> <b>demonstration</b> {{as an example of}} the {{difficulties}} faced by [...] "Moogists" [...] such as Beaver and Krause in gaining acceptance for their efforts. The authors write that the perception in the recording industry during the late 1960s was typically that, because of the highly technical aspect of the Moog modular system, these pioneers were simply engineers rather than artists or musicians. Pinch and Trocco highlight Mort Garson's The Wozard of Iz and Mason Williams' The Mason Williams Ear Show as further examples; in the case of the latter album, Beaver was credited as being [...] "in charge of plugging and unplugging".|$|R
50|$|After the {{enormous}} response to Myst, work quickly {{began on the}} next Myst game. Cyan moved from their cramped garage to a new office and hired additional programmers, designers, and artists. The game was to ship in late 1996, but the release was pushed back a year. Development costs were between $5 and $10 million, many times Mysts budget. After the release of Riven, Robyn Miller left the company to pursue other projects, while Rand stayed behind {{to work on a}} Myst franchise.While Rand Miller stated Cyan would not make another sequel to Myst, Mattel (then the owner of the Myst franchise) offered the task of developing a sequel to several video game companies who created detailed story proposals and technology <b>demonstrations.</b> Presto <b>Studios,</b> makers of the Journeyman Project adventure games, was hired to develop Myst III.

25|$|The Cine Club held {{a public}} {{demonstration}} on 12 June, {{which resulted in}} the formation of a joint committee supporting Suzuki against Nikkatsu. The committee was composed mostly of directors, actors, large student film groups and independent filmmakers. This also marked the first time the public became involved in a type of dispute normally confined to the industry. The Cine Club, and other similar groups, mobilized the public, holding panel discussions and leading mass <b>demonstrations</b> against the <b>studio.</b> The public support, garnered at the height of student movement, was based on a wide appreciation of Suzuki's films and the idea that audiences should {{be able to see the}} types of films they wanted to see. This shook the film industry by the fact that the public was making demands rather than passively accepting their product.|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{implementation}} of a comprehensive electronic device laboratory on a chip that significantly enhances the learning experience of our remote laboratory, LAB-on-WEB. This chip contains several device and circuit test structures, all fabricated in CMOS technology. Besides providing a valuable familiarity with the behavior of the building block of modern integrated circuits, the lab is also designed for the extraction of device and processing parameters needed for circuit design. The extracted parameters are suitable for use with circuit simulators such as SPICE, to predict the behavior of more complicated circuits. This experience, provided either as homework or as classroom or <b>studio</b> <b>demonstrations</b> in conjunction with, for example, more theoretical courses on circuit design, is of great value for conveying deeper insight into the practical aspects of electronic circuit engineering...|$|R

[...] "No Time or Space" [...] comprises an edit of a synthesizer demonstration given there by Bernie Krause, an American experimental composer and Moog salesman.

The final series, presented by Adam Hart-Davis, Kate Humble and Roger Black, attempted to revert to the original live format of the show, even using a remix {{of one of the}} theme tunes used during its more successful years, but ratings continued to fall, and with only three million viewers in the last series the BBC decided to axe the show. At the time they said that they would produce a number of science special editions under the Tomorrow's World [...] "brand" [...] from time to time. The [...] "Tomorrow's World Roadshow" [...] appeared in 2004 with Gareth Jones (co-host of CITV's How 2) and Katie Knapman taking the helm as the last presenters of a show bearing the Tomorrow's World name, before a partial return to television in 2007.|$|R

5000|$|The Team One {{advertising}} {{campaign for the}} Lexus launch, including the Balance ad, received a number of advertising awards. Industry publication Adweek named the Balance ad one of its Best Spots of 1990, as listed in a retrospective. [...] The Belding Awards, presented by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles, recognized Team One for their early Lexus campaign. [...] The Balance ad was also challenged by consumer advocate David Horowitz, on his Fight Back! With David Horowitz television program, who suggested that Lexus had staged the advertisement in some way unseen to the audience. [...] In response, Lexus produced a third-party verification videotape, and performed a live <b>demonstration</b> for the <b>studio</b> audience of the same feat, showing that indeed the LS 400 could perform as promised. The stacking of champagne glasses was also used for the formal introduction of the LS 400 at Pebble Beach. In factory, Lexus models use a similar wine glass test.|$|R
50|$|When Dehn {{first began}} her {{undertaking}} {{in the early}} 1930s, she faced a dilemma. To properly frame {{the current state of}} African-American social dance, she needed to record examples of styles from as early as the 1900s. As is true today, social dance progresses quickly and much had changed in the intervening decades. Unable to find the older styles performed in any of the modern venues, Dehn enlisted a group of talented dancers from the Savoy Ballroom to give <b>demonstrations</b> in a <b>studio</b> setting and fill in the gaps. The same format was also used to showcase the modern styles of dance of the 1930s and 1940s. The result is a clean, clear presentation of five decades worth of innovation in social dance that abstracts out everything but the movement of the dancers. Due to the technical limitations of film at the time, a separate soundtrack was added after recording the visuals; It features music of the same style as what was performed to by the dancers, but not necessarily the same songs.|$|R
