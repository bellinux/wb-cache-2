The degree of RSAE stabilization, fast ion density and the volume averaged neutron production (Sn) are highly dependent on ECH deposition location relative to qmin. While <b>discharges</b> <b>with</b> ECH stabilization of RSAEs have higher Sn and more peaked fast ion profiles than <b>discharges</b> <b>with</b> significant RSAE activity, neutron production remains strongly reduced (up to 60 % relative to TRANSP predictions assuming classical fast ion transport) even when RSAEs are stabilized.

40|$|A pulsed atmospheric-pressure {{dielectric}} barrier discharge (DBD) device {{operating in}} air is investigated for medical {{applications such as}} for skin disinfection and promotion of wound healing. The device ignites plasma on objects of high capacitance such as {{the human body and}} with grounded electrodes. Plasma parameters such as electron density and electron distribution function are determined. Plasma chemical kinetics is simulated and the production of biologically-useful molecules namely nitric oxide (NO) and ozone is estimated for use in dermatology. Prior to plasma characterisation on human body, simple materials such as aluminium (flat and spike), buffer solution (PBS) and glass are used as grounded electrodes for plasma characterisation. A single-filamentary <b>discharge</b> <b>with</b> spike, a stochastic-filamentary <b>discharge</b> <b>with</b> aluminium and PBS, and a homogeneous <b>discharge</b> <b>with</b> glass are observed. 2 minute DBD treatment of mouse skin shows no inflammation or any carcinogenic effects...|$|R
40|$|Policy {{makers have}} made several {{attempts}} to limit hospitals upcoding. We investigate {{the impact on}} <b>discharges</b> <b>with</b> and without complications of a law introducing a minimum length of stay to <b>discharges</b> <b>with</b> complications. We implement a DID econometric model {{to assess the impact}} of the law and a logistic multilevel model to estimate whether hospitals reacted strategically to it by varying the patients’ length of stay. We show that the policy has been effective in limiting upcoding, since the number of <b>discharges</b> <b>with</b> complications is significantly lower in 2008. We also show that hospitals have reacted strategically to the law by modifying the distribution of discharges’ length of stay in DRGs with complications, in order to continue practicing upcoding. Furthermore, we provide evidence that upcoding is greater in private for–profit hospitals, that have been more affected by the law. Upcoding, Difference–in–difference, Logistic multilevel...|$|R
