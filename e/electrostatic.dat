5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end <b>electrostatic</b> speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the <b>electrostatic</b> speakers to convey. Infinity's full range <b>electrostatic</b> speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its <b>electrostatic</b> arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated <b>electrostatic</b> machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an <b>electrostatic</b> generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E

40|$|SummaryMost current crystallographic {{structure}} refinements augment the diffraction data with a priori information consisting of bond, angle, dihedral, planarity restraints, and atomic repulsion {{based on the}} Pauli exclusion principle. Yet, <b>electrostatics</b> and van der Waals attraction are physical forces that provide additional a priori information. Here, we assess the inclusion of <b>electrostatics</b> for the force field used for all-atom (including hydrogen) joint neutron/X-ray refinement. Two DNA and a protein crystal structure were refined against joint neutron/X-ray diffraction data sets using force fields without <b>electrostatics</b> or with <b>electrostatics.</b> Hydrogen-bond orientation/geometry favors the inclusion of <b>electrostatics.</b> Refinement of Z-DNA with <b>electrostatics</b> leads to a hypothesis for the entropic stabilization of Z-DNA that may partly explain the thermodynamics of converting the B form of DNA to its Z form. Thus, inclusion of <b>electrostatics</b> assists joint neutron/X-ray refinements, especially for placing and orienting hydrogen atoms...|$|R
40|$|Building up a {{comprehension}} of <b>electrostatics</b> and especially Gauss’s law depends on understanding {{the concept of}} anelectric field. Previous studies demonstrate several learning problems that occur in relation to <b>electrostatics,</b> and theconcept of an electric field is one of them. By eliciting information about a student’s thinking, {{it is possible to}} addressthe common denominators that form the main obstacles to learning the scientific content of <b>electrostatics.</b> Physicstheory at university level is traditionally presented in an abstract and compact form {{as a result of the}} evolution of itstheory. In this study we approach the problems involved in the teaching and learning of <b>electrostatics</b> by applying themethod of educational reconstruction in order to devise more effective teaching. In doing so, we hope to improvestudents’ performance in their adoption of the <b>electrostatics</b> content aimed at in the course...|$|R
25|$|In other words, <b>electrostatics</b> {{does not}} require the absence of {{magnetic}} fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents do exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with time only very slowly. In some problems, both <b>electrostatics</b> and magnetostatics may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. <b>Electrostatics</b> and magnetostatics can both be seen as Galilean limits for electromagnetism.|$|R
5|$|Franklin {{distributed}} {{copies of}} the <b>electrostatic</b> machine to many of his close associates {{to encourage them to}} study electricity. Between 1747 and 1750, Franklin sent many letters to his friend Collinson in London about his experiments with the <b>electrostatic</b> machine and the Leyden jar, including his observations and theories on the principles of electricity. These letters were collected and published in 1751 in a book entitled Experiments and Observations on Electricity.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either <b>electrostatic</b> charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to <b>electrostatic</b> discharges visible from Earth. Finally, <b>electrostatic</b> levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

40|$|The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) {{software}} {{was developed to}} solve the equations of continuum <b>electrostatics</b> for large biomolecular assemblages that has provided impact {{in the study of}} a broad range of chemical, biological, and biomedical applications. APBS addresses three key technology challenges for understanding solvation and <b>electrostatics</b> in biomedical applications: accurate and efficient models for biomolecular solvation and <b>electrostatics,</b> robust and scalable software for applying those theories to biomolecular systems, and mechanisms for sharing and analyzing biomolecular <b>electrostatics</b> data in the scientific community. To address new research applications and advancing computational capabilities, we have continually updated APBS and its suite of accompanying software since its release in 2001. In this manuscript, we discuss the models and capabilities that have recently been implemented within the APBS software package including: a Poisson-Boltzmann analytical and a semi-analytical solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a geometry-based geometric flow solvation model, a graph theory based algorithm for determining p$K_a$ values, and an improved web-based visualization tool for viewing <b>electrostatics...</b>|$|R

The two tensors {{share the}} following feature: both {{account for the}} presence of an inhomogeneity. In <b>electrostatics,</b> the inhomogeneity is the electric charge whereas, in elasticity, is the material ‘defect’ of a body. Despite the close similarity of the two tensors, they definitely differ from one another as they describe distinct physical phenomena. An Eshelby-like tensor is here proposed for <b>electrostatics.</b> This tensor identically vanishes out the body, whereas the Maxwell stress tensor is defined everywhere in the space...|$|R

5|$|The <b>electrostatic</b> {{force was}} first {{described}} in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the <b>electrostatic</b> force were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E
5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of <b>electrostatic</b> repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the <b>electrostatic</b> repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the <b>electrostatic</b> shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an <b>electrostatic</b> detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small <b>electrostatic</b> charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E
5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the <b>electrostatic</b> interaction energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total <b>electrostatic</b> energy {{can be related to}} the <b>electrostatic</b> energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E

5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by <b>electrostatic</b> forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to <b>electrostatic</b> attraction.|$|E

40|$|Continuum {{solvation}} models, such as Poisson–Boltzmann and Generalized Born methods, {{have become}} increasingly popular tools for investigating the influence of <b>electrostatics</b> on biomolecular structure, energetics and dynamics. However, {{the use of such}} methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum <b>electrostatics</b> calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address this problem, we have developed the PDB 2 PQR web service ([URL] This server automates many of the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum <b>electrostatics</b> calculations, including adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules {{in a manner consistent with}} favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating ‘PQR’ output compatible with several popular computational biology packages.
