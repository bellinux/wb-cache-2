5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is <b>explainable</b> only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and <b>explainable</b> manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Host-{{parasite}} mimicry is a {{two species}} system where a parasite mimics its own host. Cuckoos are a canonical example of brood parasitism, {{a form of}} kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, cutting down the biological mother's parental investment in the process. The ability to lay eggs that mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation. The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so-called gentes (gens, singular). Cases of intraspecific brood parasitism, where a female lays in conspecific's nest, {{as illustrated by the}} goldeneye duck (Bucephala clangula), do not represent a case of mimicry. Another example is that of chemical mimicry, in which the parasitic butterfly Phengaris rebeli, which parasitizes the ant species Myrmica schencki by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae, and enable the P. rebeli larvae to be brought directly into the M. schencki nest. Parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees (formerly Psithyrus, now included in Bombus) resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common. However, this is <b>explainable</b> as Müllerian mimicry, rather than requiring the parasite's coloration to deceive the host and thus constitute aggressive mimicry.|$|E

25|$|In a 1974 paper, psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman {{argued that}} a broad family of biases (systematic errors in {{judgment}} and decision) were <b>explainable</b> {{in terms of a}} few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including availability and representativeness. In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and Shane Frederick proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.|$|E

Although it does not show Si II lines neat 6150 Å as is required of a type Ia, SN 2002cx's evolution is <b>explainable</b> using the paradigm of other type Ia observations and so Li et al. consider their classification as a type Ia as secure.|$|E
25|$|According to Hans Wolfgang Schumann, the nidānas are a later {{synthesis}} of Buddhist teachings meant {{to make them}} more comprehensible. Comparison with the five skandhas shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain {{is considered to be a}} later elaboration. This way it is <b>explainable</b> that nāma-rūpa in consciousness in the nine-fold are the beginning or start, while in the twelve-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when nāma-rūpa in consciousness are present.|$|E
25|$|The amount {{inferred}} {{for normal}} abundance of this heavy isotope of hydrogen {{was so small}} (only about 1 atom in 6400 hydrogen atoms in ocean water (156 deuteriums per million hydrogens)) {{that it had not}} noticeably affected previous measurements of (average) hydrogen atomic mass. This explained why it hadn't been experimentally suspected before. Urey was able to concentrate water to show partial enrichment of deuterium. Lewis had prepared the first samples of pure heavy water in 1933. The discovery of deuterium, coming before the discovery of the neutron in 1932, was an experimental shock to theory, but when the neutron was reported, making deuterium's existence more <b>explainable,</b> deuterium won Urey the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934. Lewis was embittered by being passed over for this recognition given to his former student.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Martian {{meteorite}} ALH84001, {{a specimen}} {{that is much}} older than the majority of Martian meteorites that have been recovered so far, received considerable attention {{when a group of}} NASA scientists led by David S. McKay reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay's team cited as evidence of life were found to be <b>explainable</b> by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, before {{enzymology}} was well understood, colloids {{were thought to}} be the key to the operation of enzymes; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter the properties of the water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific substrate, such as a solution of ATPase breaking down ATP. Furthermore, life itself was <b>explainable</b> in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances that make up an organism. As more detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the macromolecular theory, which explains enzymes as a collection of identical huge molecules that act as very tiny machines, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a factory full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple osmotic changes that would be caused by the presence of any solute. In humans, both the thyroid gland and the intermediate lobe (pars intermedia) of the pituitary gland contain colloid follicles.|$|E
25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not <b>explainable</b> with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E
500|$|... {{showed that}} most of the Eocene and {{subsequent}} magmatism from Alaska to Oregon [...] "is <b>explainable</b> in terms of ridge subduction and slab window tectonics." [...] That is, a slab window — and a single subducted ridge can give rise to multiple slab windows — can provide adequate magmatism without having to invoke a hotspot (mantle plume). (So much so that {{it has been suggested that}} the Yellowstone hotspot may have been initiated by a slab window.) Mantle plumes and slab windows both feature voluminous magmatism; the main difference is that slab windows would form only where the spreading ridge is subducted. This implies formation at the continental margin, and then rifting, in the manner of the second class of models.|$|E
500|$|At present, the {{approach}} in Singapore to decisions without legal effect is less liberal {{than that in}} the United Kingdom. It {{has been said that}} the English courts [...] "now take a broad view and it is no longer necessary for a claimant to demonstrate that a decision or action has direct legal consequences upon the claimant". For instance, these courts have expanded the scope of matters that fall within the remit of judicial review challenges to encompass even press releases and policy guidance issued by public authorities. This is illustrated by the case of R. (Axon) v. Secretary of State for Health (2006), in which guidance issued by the Department of Health, alleged to be unlawful and in contravention of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, was amenable to judicial review. Cases of this kind may be <b>explainable</b> on the basis that the actions in question have some indirect legal effect.|$|E
500|$|Besides Divine Providence, Villani {{acknowledged}} {{other events}} {{that he believed}} were <b>explainable</b> via the supernatural. He wrote of many instances where holy men offered prophetic statements that later proved true, such as Pope ClementIV's prophecy on the outcome for the Battle of Tagliacozzo. He believed that certain events were really omens {{of what was to}} come. For instance, when a lion was sent to Florence as a gift by BonifaceVIII, a donkey purportedly killed the lion. He interpreted this as an omen that foretold the Pope's beating and untimely death shortly after fighting PhilipIV at Anagni; Villani wrote: [...] "when the tamed beast kills the King of Beasts, then the dissolution of the Church will begin." [...] He also believed in astrology and changes in the heavens as indication of political changes, the deaths of rulers and popes, and natural calamities. However, he noted that the movement of the heavens would not always predetermine the actions of men and did not trump the divine plan of God.|$|E
500|$|The Orphanage was {{received}} very well by American critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics {{had given the}} film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews. Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be [...] "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills". Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, [...] "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed {{in the context of}} Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even <b>explainable</b> (or not)." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "The year's best horror picture {{is also one of the}} simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors." [...] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying [...] "Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, [...] "Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment. When she looks one way and then the other, while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home, every nerve-wracking whatwasthat? registers, and how. Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating, [...] "The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wallace {{became a}} spiritualist. At {{about the same}} time, he began to {{maintain}} that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in [...] "the unseen universe of Spirit" [...] had interceded {{at least three times}} in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [...] of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not teleological (purpose driven) and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be <b>explainable</b> in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life, which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second part}} of the {{epilogue}} contains Tolstoy's critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century Great Man Theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of [...] "heroes" [...] and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (he compares this to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free-will, necessity being based on reason and therefore <b>explainable</b> by historical analysis, and free-will being based on [...] "consciousness" [...] and therefore inherently unpredictable.|$|E

She tells him the history of vampirism, beginning with Lilith, and much to Moriani's surprise, reveals she believes vampires to be real. She gives him a book, The Lords of Twilight, published by the Thule Society, which says that to become a vampire one must complete The Path of the Dragon, an initiation ritual, something Tepes did in his youth.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics of}} the concept of {{adolescence}} do point at individual differences in brain growth rate, citing that some (though not all) early teens still have infantile undeveloped corpus callosums, concluding that [...] "the adult in *every* adolescent" [...] is too generalizing. These people tend to support the notion that a more interconnected brain makes more precise distinctions (citing Pavlov's comparisons of conditioned reflexes in different species) {{and that there is a}} non-arbitrary threshold at which distinctions become sufficiently precise to correct assumptions afterward as opposed to being ultimately dependent on exterior assumptions for communication. These people argue that this threshold is the one at which an individual is objectively capable of speaking for himself or herself, as opposed to culturally arbitrary measures of [...] "maturity" [...] which often treat this ability as a sign of [...] "immaturity" [...] merely because it leads to questioning of authorities. These people also stress the low probability of the threshold being reached at a birthday, and instead advocate non-chronological emancipation at the threshold of afterward correction of assumptions. They sometimes cite similarities between [...] "adolescent" [...] behavior and KZ syndrome (inmate behavior in adults in prison camps) such as aggression being <b>explainable</b> by oppression and [...] "immature" [...] financial or other risk behavior being <b>explainable</b> by a way out of captivity being more worth to captive people than any incremental improvement in captivity, and argue that this theory successfully predicted remaining [...] "immature" [...] behavior after reaching the age of majority by means of longer-term traumatization. In this context, they refer to the fallibility of official assumptions about what is good or bad for an individual, concluding that paternalistic [...] "rights" [...] may harm the individual. They also argue that since it never took many years to move from one group to another to avoid inbreeding in the paleolithic, evolutionary psychology is unable to account for a long period of [...] "immature" [...] risk behavior.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{scientific}} {{source for}} deep ecology adduced by Devall and Sessions is the [...] "new physics", which they describe as shattering Descartes's and Newton's {{vision of the}} universe as a machine <b>explainable</b> in terms of simple linear cause and effect.

[...] They refer to Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point for their characterisation of how the new physics leads to metaphysical and ecological views of interrelatedness, which, according to Capra, should make deep ecology a framework for future human societies. Devall and Sessions also credit the American poet and social critic Gary Snyder—with his devotion to Buddhism, Native American studies, the outdoors, and alternative social movements—as a major voice of wisdom in the evolution of their ideas.|$|E

At first his troops defended Biberach an der Riss. Around 6 October, Mack ordered Jelačić to move toward Ulm. At this time, Jelačić commanded 15,000 troops organized in 16 infantry battalions, six Jäger companies, and six cavalry squadrons. Emperor Napoleon I of France and his Grande Armée began to envelop the Austrian army. During the Battle of Wertingen on 8 October, the Battle of Günzburg on 9 October, and the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October, the Grande Armée began to close in on its prey. On the 12th, Mack reorganized his army, making Jelačić one of four corps commanders, the others being Johann Sigismund Riesch, Franz von Werneck, and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg.

Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose [...] "tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle."
