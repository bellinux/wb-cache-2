5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|Bond beats Le Chiffre at {{the poker}} table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is {{captured}} whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed {{for the money}} and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.|$|E
5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

5|$|When Constantine {{returned}} to Trinidad in late 1954, {{he found a}} growing desire for independence from Britain. At Trinidad Leaseholds he felt isolated from other, mainly white, senior staff; this drew him towards political involvement. Eric Williams, leader of the newly founded People's National Movement (PNM), was aware of Constantine's popular appeal and recruited him. By January 1956 Constantine, with the full co-operation and blessing of his employers, was party chairman {{and a member of}} its executive committee. Feeling that the PNM's policies were in harmony with his views on improving the lives of black people, and encouraged by his wife, Constantine stood for election in the parliamentary constituency of Tunapuna in 1956. He won a narrow victory, which his colleagues believed few in the party could <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> resigned from Trinidad Leaseholds. The PNM formed a government, in which Constantine became the Minister of Communications, Works and Utilities.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary critics accused Le Jeune {{of violating}} {{some of the}} rules of good melodic writing and counterpoint, for example using the melodic {{interval}} of the major sixth (something Palestrina would never <b>have</b> <b>done),</b> <b>and</b> frequently crossing voices; some of these compositional devices were to become features of the Baroque style, premonitions of which were beginning to appear even in France {{towards the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E

25|$|Shuttleworth's career {{never took}} off {{as it might}} <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> loss of form, plus {{persistent}} injuries, forced him to leave Lancashire in 1975 and join Leicestershire, where he played forty-one matches between 1977 and 1980. In twelve seasons with Lancashire, Shuttleworth played in 177 matches and took 484 wickets {{at a cost of}} 22.92 each. He played in 105 limited-overs matches for the county and took 147 wickets at 18 apiece.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} space between the mean sun gear and {{the front of the}} case and the size of and {{mechanical}} features on the mean sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship. This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and,</b> of course, {{because of the lack of}} evidence many solutions have been put forward.|$|E
25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as he might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> was relieved for it. Lucas believed {{that if he had}} pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit and do nothing is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of his voyages in Antarctic waters, Cook had encircled the world at latitudes {{generally}} above 60°S, and saw nothing but bleak inhospitable islands, without a hint of the fertile continent which some still hoped lay in the south. Cook wrote that if any such continent existed it would be [...] "a country doomed by nature", and that [...] "no man will venture further than I <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> the land to the South will never be explored". He concluded: [...] "Should the impossible be achieved and the land attained, it would be wholly useless and of no benefit to the discoverer or his nation".|$|E

500|$|Littell said {{he wanted}} to focus on the {{thinking}} of an executioner and of origins of state murder, showing how we can take decisions that lead, or not, to a genocide. Littell claims he set out creating the character Max Aue by imagining what he would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> how he would have behaved if he had been born into Nazi Germany. One childhood event that kept Littell interested in the question of being a killer was the Vietnam War. According to him, his childhood terror was that he would be drafted, sent to Vietnam [...] "and made to kill women and children who hadn't done anything to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and,</b> believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E
500|$|The King {{wrote of}} the {{incident}} to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, [...] "If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I {{would have had no}} cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the Government had received their protest—that is what they <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> that I cannot allow." [...] Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens, who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions.|$|E

500|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows by Electronic Arts in late June 1999. Goldsworthy believed Peter Molyneux, {{producer of the}} original game, would be pleased with the sequel. Indeed, Molyneux stated that he [...] "liked what they did with it", but also {{said that it was}} not precisely what he would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> that his focus would have been [...] "expanding that sense of creating the greatest dungeon". A PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled. The first patch, which added levels, fixed bugs, and tweaked gameplay, {{was released}} in August. Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for Dungeon Keeper 3, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as Harry Potter. In August 2000, Bullfrog announced that the development of Dungeon Keeper 3 had been cancelled. Dungeon Keeper 2 is available on gog.com and Origin.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{members of}} the school's faculty were {{involved}} in controversy surrounding the U.S. Republican Party presidential primaries. On October 9, Dean Hill and Associate Dean W.

Hill and Albrecht signed the message with their official BYU titles, sent the e-mail from a BYU e-mail address, and began the message [...] "Dear Marriott School Friend." [...] Both the LDS Church and BYU, as tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations, are prohibited by federal law from endorsing a particular candidate or political party. Albrecht said {{that he should not}} have sent it in his capacity as a BYU dean: [...] "It wasn't something BYU did, it wasn't something I probably should <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> it was bad judgment." ...|$|E
500|$|Down on {{his luck}} and starved for inspiration, Lisa {{recommends}} Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum. But {{none of the}} art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him about the artist Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants (having covered the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so {{that they do not}} drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made [...] "Grand Canals of Springfield" [...] along with the swimming zoo animals. As Marge and Homer kiss each other on the roof of their house Jasper Johns comes on a boat and steals the painting Marge was painting. The song playing in the end of episode is [...] "Arrivederci Roma" [...] performed by Michael Dees.|$|E
