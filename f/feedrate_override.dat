40|$|Continuous sliding mode {{control is}} applied to turning {{processes}} for cutting force regulation. The motivation {{of the use of}} the slide mode control scheme is to solve the nonlinearity problem caused by the <b>feedrate</b> <b>override</b> command element in the commercial CNC machine tool. When the adaptive control algorithm is applied to the commercial CNC machine tool, {{it is one of the}} practical methods that the programmed feedrate is overridden after the control algorithm is carried out. However, most CNC lathe manufacturers offer limited number of data bits for <b>feedrate</b> <b>override,</b> thus resulting in nonlinear behavior of the machine tools. Such nonlinearity brings 'quantized' or discrete effect so that the optimal feedrate is rounded off before being fed into the CNC system. To compensate for this problem, continuous {{sliding mode control}} is applied. Simulation and experimental results are presented in comparison with those obtained from applying adaptive control which is a widely used approach in cutting force regulation. Adaptive control loses its effectiveness in the presence of nonlinearity since it generally requires linear parametrization of the control law or the system dynamics. Experiments are conducted under various machining conditions, subject to changes in spindle speed, material of work-piece, and type of machining process. The suggested slide mode controller shows smoother cutting force fluctuation, which cannot be achieved by the conventional adaptive controller. The experimental set-up reflects the emphasis on the practicality of the sliding mode controller. In order to avoid the use of a dynamometer in the course of measuring the cutting force, the indirect cutting force measuring system is used by means of feed drive servo-motor current sensing. close 142...|$|E
40|$|The {{productivity}} of machining centers is influenced strongly {{by the quality}} of NC programs. To investigate the productivity, an NC program simulator has been developed to analyze and evaluate an NC program by decoding its NC codes. With the simulator, even before the actual machining, the tool paths can be displayed and the operational times occupied in the positioning feed motion and cutting feed motion, etc. can be calculated. The effects of the maximum speed and the acceleration of positioning feed on the productivity have been analyzed. Additionally, the influence of <b>feedrate</b> <b>override</b> function to shorten the operational time has been investigated in the conventional and the high speed cutting, respectively. From the results obtained from analyzing three NC programs, it is found that the effectiveness of the override function depends on the relation among the average moving distance, the commanded feedrate and the acceleration of cutting feed. Especially, {{in the case of the}} NC program for machining dies or molds, the productivity will be hardly improved using faster feedrate, because the actual feedrate hardly increases as expected due to the tiny moving distances of NC blocks. High speed & high precision function, which is an advanced optional function, is much more effective not only to improve the productivity but also to keep the machining accuracy of high speed cutting...|$|E
