40|$|Abstract—Ionospheric scintillations {{are known}} to affect both the {{magnitude}} and the phase of the incoming GNSS signal. These phase variations are typically synchronized with a deep fade of the signal level, {{that could lead to}} the occurrence of cycle slips (phase jumps), errors in the data demodulation and ultimately loss of lock. These effects have an impact not only on accuracy, but also availability, continuity and integrity. This particular aspect is of critical importance since <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> have been identified as one of the causes for integrity faults that need to be detected in safety critical applications. At receiver level, this can be tackled by the use of robust tracking techniques. In particular, the impact on carrier phase tracking is very important as it is more prone to loss of lock, and it is often used to smooth the code measurements, carrier aiding or even Doppler/user dynamics estimation. Moreover, it is through the impact on phase estimation that the data demodulation capability can be assessed, as well as different applications such as ionospheric characterization. This study assesses the behavior of robust carrier phase tracking techniques using both simulated and real data for the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations.</b> Finally, it introduces an innovative technique and discusses its potential benefits.

40|$|As {{the high}} {{latitude}} ionosphere is directly connected with outer space {{by means of}} the field line reconnection of the geomagnetic field through the magnetopause, it is highly sensitive to the enhancement of the electromagnetic radiation and energetic particles coming from the Sun. Under such conditions the ionosphere may become highly turbulent showing the presence of small-scale (from centimetres to meters) structures or irregularities imbedded in the large-scale (tens of kilometres) ambient ionosphere. These irregularities can produce short-term phase and amplitude fluctuations in the carrier frequency of the radio waves which pass through them, commonly called ionospheric amplitude and phase scintillations (see, e. g., Morrissey et al. 2004, and references therein). The high latitude ionosphere encounters significant fading, with the most intense fading depths in the polar cap regions and less intense fading in the auroral regions. Severe amplitude fading and strong phase scintillation affect the reliability of GPS navigational systems and satellite communications. As the scarceness of a continuous and systematic monitoring of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> over polar and auroral regions, the deployment of network(s) of GPS receivers, opportunely configured to observe the ionosphere under quiet and stormy conditions, could represent an important achievement for both space weather purposes and scientific aims. In this paper, a general overview on ISACCO (<b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Scintillations</b> Arctic Campaign Coordinated Observation) is given. ISACCO is an Italian project to monitor <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> at polar regions by means of modified GPS receivers. After some historical and technical notes on the project, the paper presents examples of some of our current investigations based on the data acquired during the almost 3 years of the ISACCO project...|$|R
40|$|The Precise Point Positioning (PPP) {{has become}} a {{powerful}} satellite positioning technique which nearly equals performances provided by advanced relative positioning techniques. Exploiting the growing availability and quality of IGS products (satellite orbit and clock products), the PPP technique can now provide a centimetre level solution in static mode and a decimetre level in kinematic mode. However, the PPP technique still presents some weaknesses. In order to reach a high precision level, it requires a significant convergence period which can typically reach 30 minutes under normal conditions. Moreover, the PPP seems to be especially sensitive to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> effects which involve signal amplitude and phase variations of GNSS signals. These weaknesses still limit {{the use of the}} PPP technique in the frame of some specific and demanding applications (agricultural industry, airborne mapping, etc.). The goal of our research project is to develop new data processing strategies attempting both to make the PPP technique more reliable under <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> and to optimize the PPP convergence time. The project is composed of several workpackages aiming to improve the mentioned current PPP weaknesses with specific strategies. One of the workpackages is devoted to the impact of satellite geometry on PPP performances. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> are susceptible {{to reduce the number of}} tracked satellites which degrades the quality of satellite geometry. Based on an analytical development, we first attempt to figure out what types of satellite geometry can be harmful. Then, we discuss about the improvement of the satellite geometry quality involved by the combined use of GPS and Galileo and its benefits in the frame of the PPP. Another workpackage is related to the weighting scheme. Based on an iterative least-square adjustment, the PPP algorithm requires the definition of a stochastic model composed of an observation covariance matrix. Usually, this matrix is chosen as diagonal with zero covariances assuming that correlations between observations can be neglected. In particular, our project aims to study the validity of this stochastic model for the PPP in order to determine whether tuning the weighting scheme of the stochastic model can improve the PPP performances. By exploiting spatial analysis techniques, we try to characterize the spatial auto-correlation between GNSS observations, considering the signal-to-noise ratio as the main observable. From the results of these experiments, we will discuss about the spatial correlation between GNSS observations both under normal conditions and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIonospheric scintillations {{are created}} by {{diffraction}} when the transmitted propagating waves encounter a medium made of irregular structures with variable refraction indexes. The recombination of the waves after propagation can be constructive or destructive and the resulting signal at output of the receiver antenna may present rapid variations of phase and amplitude. The carrier phase is traditionally tracked in the GNSS receivers using PLL, potentially aided by FLL. Phase Loops {{are known to be}} less robust than code tracking loops, and the GNSS receivers may thus suffer from phase tracking loss. This strongly impacts the positioning service availability, as well as the capability to demodulate the navigation message data, in situations where <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> affect the received signal. One thus has to implement innovative techniques and receiver architectures to provide robust carrier phase tracking. The aim of this paper is therefore to present the development of a GPS L 1 phase tracking technique based on a Kalman Filter PLL [10] improving the tracking robustness in presence of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations,</b> and to present results of its performance using simulations.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{tasks of}} a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver are signal tracking and noise rejection. The essence of this dissertation {{is investigating the}} balance between the aforementioned objectives; {{taking advantage of the}} noise immunity property of external sensors, and designing novel integrated tracking architectures to advance the performance of a GPS receiver under strong interference conditions. Speci cally, the problem of interest is resolving the interference due to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> on the GPS receiver used in aviation navigation. Using GPS for landing aircraft in equatorial regions is more di cult than in other regions because <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> is prevalent. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> causes amplitude fades of 20 dB or more, and an increase in the phase jitter. This research evaluates techniques to enhance a GPS receiver's ability to overcome <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation.</b> To validate the designed GPS receiver, a GPS channel model for aircraft landing in equatorial regions is built based on the use of a high delity GPS constellation simulator, a clock emulator, and real GPS data from the equator that contains an abundance of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{particular}} {{locations where}} the Swarm GPS receivers show a degraded performance {{suggest that the}} receivers are affected by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation.</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> occurs when electromagnetic signals propagate through an irregular ionosphere. GPS signals are vulnerable to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> which can degrade or interrupt GPS receiver operations (Kintner et al. 2007). This is particularly true for semi-codeless tracking of the GPS P(Y)-code signal due to the losses implied by this tracking technique (Woo 2000). The tracking performance of a GPS receiver under <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> conditions depends {{not only on the}} magnitude of the observed scintillation activity, but also on the receiver tracking capabilities (Skone et al. 2001). Differences in receiver performance are due to many factors, such as antenna gain patterns, internal processing algorithms and tracking loop bandwidths (Skone et al. 2001). For receivers in low-Earth orbit (LEO), an adverse impact of scintillation in polar regions and two belts around 15 ° north and south of the geomagnetic equator has, for example, been reported in van den IJssel et al. (2011) and Kramer and Goodman (2005).|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} amount of the data acquired by sun-synchronous space-borne low-frequency synthetic aperture radars (SARs) through the postsunset equatorial sector are distorted by the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> due {{to the presence of}} plasma irregularities and their zonal and vertical drift. In the focused SAR images, the distortions due to the postsunset equatorial <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> appear in the form of amplitude and/or phase ''stripe'' patterns of high spatial frequency aligned to the projection of the geomagnetic field onto the SAR image plane. In this paper, a methodology to estimate the height and the drift velocity of the scintillations from the ''stripe'' patterns detected in the SAR images is proposed. The analysis is {{based on the fact that}} the zonal and vertical drift of the plasma irregularities are, at the equatorial zone, perpendicular to the geomagnetic field which is almost parallel aligned to the orbit. The methodology takes advantage of the time lapse and change of imaging geometry across azimuth subapertures. The obtained height estimates agree well with the reference measurements and independent estimates reported in the literature, while the drift velocities appear slightly overestimated. This can be attributed to a suboptimum geometry configuration but also to a decoupling of the ambient ionosphere and the plasma irregularities...|$|R

Irregularities, such as storm enhanced density (SED), middle-latitude trough and polar cap patches, are clearly identified from the TEC maps. At the edges of these irregularities, clear scintillations appeared but their behaviors were different. Phase scintillations (σsub{φ}) were almost always larger than amplitude scintillations (S 4) {{at the edges of}} these irregularities, associated with bursty flows or flow reversals with large density gradients.

The wider bandwidths of the carrier loops also significantly reduce the large carrier phase residuals close to the geomagnetic poles, and no degradation is visible for GPS observations at midlatitudes.
