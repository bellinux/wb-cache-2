40|$|Introduction: Today {{there are}} {{approximately}} one million people with dementia in Germany. If current demographic trends continue, this number is likely to rise substantially in the coming years. In the older population, dementia is the most frequent reason for long-term care. Because most forms of dementia cannot be cured, the aim of treatment is to delay disease progression and to maintain functioning and quality of life. Research questions: What is the evidence on different approaches to the long-term usual care of patients with dementia in terms of common endpoints such as quality of life, and social behaviour? How is the cost-effectiveness of these concepts to be evaluated? Which ethical, social, or legal issues are discussed in this context? Methods: Based on a systematic literature review, we include randomized, controlled studies that had at least 30 participants and investigated {{one or more of}} the following approaches of dementia care: validation therapy/emotion-oriented usual care, <b>ergotherapy,</b> sensory stimulation, relaxation techniques, reality orientation therapy, and reminiscence therapy. Studies had to be published after 1996 (after 1990 for the economic part) in English or German. Results: A total of 20 studies meet the inclusion criteria. Of these, three focus on validation therapy/emotion-oriented usual care, five on <b>ergotherapy,</b> seven on different kinds of sensory stimulation, two on reality orientation, two on reminiscence therapy, and one on a type of relaxation technique. There are no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in two of the three studies on validation therapy or emotion-oriented usual care, in two of the five studies on <b>ergotherapy,</b> in three of the seven studies on sensory stimulation, in both of the two studies on reminiscence therapy, and in the one study on relaxation. In the remaining ten studies, seven report some positive results in favour of the respective interventions, and three studies (<b>ergotherapy,</b> aroma therapy, and music/massage) report positive effects with respect to all of the endpoints measured. Six publications present economic results for usual-care-concepts. One study reports additional costs of 16 GBP (24. 03 Euro (2006)) per patient per week for occupational therapie. Two publications declare incremental cost of 24. 30 USD (25. 62 Euro (2006)) per mini-mental-state-examination-(MMSE) -point gained per month respectively 1, 380, 000 ITL (506. 21 Euro (2006)) per MMSE-point gained. Two publications focus on mixed interventions. One study reports the additional costs of an activity program (1. 13 USD (1. 39 Euro (2006)) per day per patient) and the other additional time for the usual care for mobile demented patients (average of 45 minutes per day per patient). With respect to ethical and social aspects the discussion focusses on the problem of autonomy: dementia does not necessarily mean inability to decide over the participtation in studies. Legal questions address the financial situation of patients, the organisation of their care and the legal representation of dementia patients. Discussion: Only a few studies on the nursing interventions considered in this report are methodologically robust. Most of the studies have a small number of participants and show substantial differences in terms of their inclusion criteria, implementation, and endpoints. This heterogeneity is reflected in the results: in half of the studies, the interventions have no positive effects compared to the control group. The other half of the studies reports some positive effects with regard to specific endpoints. All of the economic studies are, from a methodologial and a thematic standpoint, not suitable to answer the questions raised. Ethical, social and legal aspects are discussed but not systematically analysed. Conclusion: The studies conducted to date do not provide sufficient evidence of neither efficacy nor cost-effectiveness for any of the nursing interventions considered in the present HTA. However, lack of evidence does not mean lack of efficacy. Instead, more methodologically sound studies are needed. Particullary desireable are studies reflecting the framework of dementia care in Germany. This holds also for the healtheconomic evaluations of the chosen interventions...|$|E

At {{the end of the}} chapter about a present situation of this chosen topic, there is a separate chapter about <b>Ergotherapy.</b> It points out a game, as a first occupation of a child and work therapy that helps individuals with mental disablement to create or improve their own working habits. The aim of this thesis was to introduce new trends in education of people with mental disablement in the area of work therapy. The thesis is focused on an offer of work therapy activities that have been provided by the facilities for people with a physical handicap and the education of work therapists. A qualitative research was used to reach the aim: first a method of questioning and secondly, a technique of semi-structured interviews. The interviews were made with senior executives (mainly the principals) and they were focused on the area of education of work therapists after the validation of Social Service Act No. 108 / 2006 Sb.

Second section characterizes different kinds of activation activities. Third one describes how to correctly communicate with the elderly; {{it is important to know}} how to communicate with the elderly whose hearing or sight are impaired, or with those who suffer from dementia. The last section describes basic types of motivation that affects activity of the elderly. I have chosen qualitative strategy of the research. The research was in-field. Methods used for getting data were extrospective observation and half-structured dialog, method for processing the data was qualitative content analysis. The researched group of people were nine elderly women and three workers from the home for the elderly in the regional town. The research showed that the facility offers wide range of activation activities that may be performed each day - canistherapy, reminiscence, art therapy, psychotherapy, music therapy, <b>ergotherapy</b> - workshops, memory training,, various cultural events, group games, reading and church services. The elderly are content with the available free time activities. It turns out that all of the approached elderly take part in at least one activity per week. One of the most visited and popular activities is <b>ergotherapy</b> - workshops, where larger groups of the elderly meet regularly. The interest in other activation activities is tied to the interests the elderly had before moving into the home for the elderly. Thanks to these activation activities they do not feel alone, they can meet with others and fulfill their needs. The results of this work can be used as feedback and information for specialists who create activation program in home for the elderly...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis are therapheutical techniques {{and the way}} they are used in helping school-age children with disabilities. The theoretical part of this thesis defines the terms "therapy", "therapist" and ?comprehensive rehabilitation system?. Comprehensive rehabilitation system comprises not only occupational, social and pedagogical resources, but primarily also therapeutic resources that include (but are not limited to) therapies (e. g. <b>ergotherapy,</b> animal-assisted therapy, music therapy or drama therapy). Therapies are the prevailing topic of the major part of this thesis, which mainly deals with features of individual therapeutic techniques used in specific therapies. My thesis also describes development stages of school-age children, which are divided into "lower" and "higher" school age. In final conclusion of the theoretical part, I also briefly refer to physical disabilities (etiology, types of disabilities and associated illnesses). The goal of the practical part of my bachelor thesis is to research the type of therapeutic techniques that are currently being used for specific therapies in Arpida therapeutic centre in the town of České Budějovice. To achieve this goal I have set one primary research question: to reseach the types of therapeutic techniques used by therapists for treating children with physical disabilities. My research have demonstrated that in the field of <b>ergotherapy</b> the therapists from Arpida centre primarily practise three basic techniques: activities of daily living ? ADL, hand <b>ergotherapy,</b> that is focusing mainly on developing fine and gross motor skills of children with physical disabilities, and (last but not least) therapeutic games. There are several of them being used and their aim is to develop cognitive skills of the child, his or her imagination and creativity and also to develop the above-mentioned fine and gross motor skills. Another from analysed therapies was animal-assisted therapy. In this centre, it was practised only in the form of canistherapy (therapy aided by dogs) and hippotherapy, in which the main therapeutic resource is a horse. My research has demonstrated that, in the field of canistherapy, therapists mainly practice Animal Assisted Activites, Animal Assisted Therapies and Animal Assisted Education. In the field of hippotherapy, my research showed that the most frequently used techniques are horse-riding for pedagogical-psychological purposes and hippotherapy, during which the most frequently used client positioning is lying on back, leaning on forearms, leaning on palms and sitting position. The third analysed therapy was art therapy. The most frequently used techniques were drawing, painting, mixed-media techniques as well as other graphics techniques or ceramics work. Was focused on another area - music therapy. For school-age kids with physical disabilities, my research showed that therapists practice techniques such as rhythm games, games with objects and tools, music and artistic techniques, music theatre games, improvisation and games with singing. The aim of these techniques is to target kids awareness, memory and thinking training as well as help them to express their then current emotions. Last but not least, it also helps them develop their motor skills. The next analysed therapy (and a last one) is drama therapy. In this area my research demonstrated that it is not all about drama therapy itself...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to introduce and evaluate the short-term outcome of a three-week intensive multidisciplinary outpatient program for patients with back pain and sciatica, measured according to decrease of functional impairment and pain. Methods: The program was designed for patients suffering from chronic back pain to provide intensive interdisciplinary therapy in an outpatient setting, consisting of interventional injection techniques, medication, exercise therapy, back education, <b>ergotherapy,</b> traction, massage therapy, medical training, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, aquatraining, and relaxation. Results: Based on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores, a significant improvement in pain intensity and functionality of 66. 83 % NRS and an ODI of 33. 33 % were achieved by our pain program within 3 weeks. Conclusion: This paper describes the organization and short-term outcome of an intensive multidisciplinary program for chronic back pain on an outpatient basis provided by our orthopedic department, with clinically significant results.

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{describe}} {{the rehabilitation of}} non-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy and to explore adjustability on their individual needs. Material and methodData described are extracted from an on-going national cohort study, following during 10 years 385  children with cerebral palsy, aged from 4 to 10, Gross Motor Function Classification System IV and V. We analysed data from the first 190  patients (mean age 6 years 10 months (SD 2. 0), 111  boys), focusing on physiotherapy, <b>ergotherapy,</b> psychomotility and speech therapy in medico-social and liberal sectors. ResultsIn medico-social sector, duration of paramedical care is significantly more important than in liberal sector (structure of care: median= 4. 25 h/week, liberal sector: median= 2. 00 h/week) (P< 0. 0001). More than 4 different types of care per week are given in medico-social sector, while in liberal sector children benefit from only 2 different types of care a week. In investigators opinion, rehabilitation in structures of care is 71. 65 % adapted as opposed to 18. 75 % in the liberal sector (P< 0. 001). Children level V have less time of rehabilitation than the others (P= 0. 0424). InterpretationRehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy who {{are not able to}} walk, with an objective to improve quality of life, is truly multidisciplinary and suitable in medico-social sector...|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of children incur brain damage that results in lifelong sequelae. Therefore, based on experimental evidence, we explored the therapeutic potential of human cord blood, known to contain stem cells, to examine the functional neuroregeneration in a child with cerebral palsy after cardiac arrest. The boy, whose cord blood was stored at birth, was 2. 5 years old and normally developed when global ischemic brain damage occurred resulting in a persistent vegetative state. Nine weeks later, he received autologous cord blood (91. 7 [*]mL, cryopreserved, 5. 75 × 10 e 8 mononuclear cells) intravenously. Active rehabilitation (physio- and <b>ergotherapy)</b> was provided daily, follow-up at 2, 5, 12, 24, 30, and 40 months. At 2 -months follow-up the boy’s motor control improved, spastic paresis was largely reduced, and eyesight was recovered, as did the electroencephalogram. He smiled when played with, was able to sit and to speak simple words. At 40 months, independent eating, walking in gait trainer, crawling, and moving from prone position to free sitting were possible, and there was significantly improved receptive and expressive speech competence (four-word sentences, 200 words). This remarkable functional neuroregeneration is difficult to explain by intense active rehabilitation alone and suggests that autologous cord blood transplantation may be an additional and causative treatment of pediatric cerebral palsy after brain damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor's work Integration of People with Brain Injury or Damage into Society and its Importance is to {{find out}} what is the {{influence}} of the organization "Dílny tvořivosti" on integration of people with brain injury or damage. Dílny tvořivosti is an organization which focuses on work with people with brain injury or damage. I try to find out at my bachelor thesis how much Dílny tvořivosti are important for people with brain injury or damage in their integration and how they are satisfied with services which Dílny tvořivosti offer them.

40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis {{dealing with}} the topic Physiotherapy after forearm and hand injuries, describes not only the complete anatomy of the forearm and hand, characteristics of the particular injuries and the complications thereof, but also examination methods and possibilities of rehabilitation, by means of which the patients frequently regain former functions of the extremity affected. The thesis aims {{to find out whether}} patients are able to return to their original occupations as well as their original hobbies. The research part, in which the casuistic method and that of a free conversation with patients {{in the course of their}} attendance to rehabilitation procedures were used, contains descriptions of diagnoses and examinations of two patients with a different therapy success. The conclusion of the thesis resulted in the fact that the convalescence success of patients and their return to work largely depends on how complicated their diagnoses are and on the character of their work. In my opinion patients should be provided with a complex care, which includes timely medical help and subsequent physiotherapy and <b>ergotherapy.</b> A very substantial problem that is omitted is the patients mental state, and for that reason the convalescence process should involve possible visits to a psychologist. Another essential thing is to inform the patient systematically on his/her state and future, and his/her motivation for his/her effort of improvement...|$|E
40|$|Cílem práce bylo poukázat na možnosti fyzioterapie na oddělení chronické resuscitační a intenzivní péče. Práce je dělena tak, aby došlo k pochopení principu fungování OCHRIP, skladbě pacientů, možností terapie a k proniknutí do problematiky ventilačních režimů. Péče o pacienta je výsledkem snažení multidisciplinárního týmu, které pracuje na společném cíli - úspěšném odpojení pacienta od ventilátoru. Proto jsou v práci popisovány také kapitoly z ergoterapie a psychologického dopadu dlouhodobé hospitalizace. Praktická část je obsažena v dotaznících, které nazírají na fyzioterapii na oddělení z úhlu pacienta, rodiny, lékaře a samotného fyzioterapeuta. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org) The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} thesis titled "Physiotherapy at Chronic Intensive Care Unit" (CICU) is to describe and analyze the not much known area of physiotherapy at the CICU and the various methods of its utilization. The thesis is structured {{in order to deal}} with the system at CICU, the typology of patients, physiotherapeutic methods and the ventilator modes. The patient should be taken care of by the multidisciplinary team which should cooperate in order to achieve a common goal - consecutive weaning followed by the liberating from the ventilator's support. The chapters about <b>ergotherapy</b> and psychological effects complete the overview of the topic. Practical part of the thesis consists of the survey file which represent the patient-family-doctor-physiotherapist point of view.
