40|$|The {{invasion}} of multiple {{strains of the}} midge-borne bluetongue virus into southern Europe since the late 1990 s provides a rare example of a clear impact of climate change on a vector-borne disease. However, the subsequent dramatic continent-wide spread and burden of this disease has depended largely on altered biotic interactions with vector and host communities <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas.</b> Transmission by Palearctic vectors has facilitated {{the establishment of the}} disease in cooler and wetter areas of both northern and southern Europe.

30|$|The results {{obtained}} regarding the invasion by H. sericea {{in our study}} area demonstrate the kind of insights a modelling approach such as ours can offer for the transboundary management of an invasive species. Alien species with their native range in areas with mild climates, {{as is the case}} of H. sericea (Barker et al. 1999), are often limited <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas</b> by their frost sensitivity, and for that reason are absent at high elevations (Vicente et al. 2010). Under climate change scenarios, this constraint is expected to be relaxed in the future (Walther 2002) which means that these areas may become more susceptible to invasion. At the same time, the importance of landscape composition predictors, at both regional and local scales, suggests that future shifts in land use could further drive expansion (or contraction) of H. sericea’s range in mountainous areas, where {{some of the most important}} protected areas in the region occur.|$|E
40|$|Background: Aedes albopictus is an {{invasive}} species which continues expanding its geographic range {{and involvement in}} mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya and dengue. Host selection patterns by invasive mosquitoes are critically important because they increase endemic disease transmission and drive outbreaks of exotic pathogens. Traditionally, Ae. albopictus has been characterized as an opportunistic feeder, primarily feeding on mammalian hosts but occasionally acquiring blood from avian sources as well. However, limited information is available on their feeding patterns in temperate regions of their expanded range. Because of the increasing expansion and abundance of Ae. albopictus and the escalating diagnoses of exotic pathogens in travelers returning from endemic areas, we investigated the host feeding patterns of this species <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas</b> to further shed light on its role in disease ecology and assess the public health threat of an exotic arbovirus outbreak. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified the vertebrate source of 165 blood meals in Ae. albopictus collected between 2008 and 2011 from urban and suburban areas in northeastern USA. We used a network of Biogents Sentinel traps, which enhance Ae. albopictus capture counts, to conduct our collections of blooded mosquitoes. We also analyzed blooded Culex mosquitoes collected alongside Ae. albopictus {{in order to examine}} the composition of the community of blood sources. We found no evidence of bias since as expected Culex blood meals were predominantly from birds (n = 149, 93. 7 %...|$|E

40|$|The Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii, and the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, are two {{polyphagous}} invasive pests {{native to}} east Asia, recently introduced in Northern Italy.

We compared the results of three years monitoring activity in three areas of Tuscany with the output of two different models, in order to predict adult emergence from air temperature measurements. The best results were achieved with the model that utilized the date of maize planting as starting date for the accumulation of degree-days, con!rming a strict connection between crop and pest phenology. Model output for the predicted day of the year for start and peak of the pest cumulative emergence was mapped over the administrative boundaries of Tuscany with a regression model run with temperatures derived from WorldClim on-line database.

40|$|Drosophila suzukii, or spotted wing {{drosophila}} (SWD), is {{a highly}} polyphagous invasive pest which has recently invaded Europe and the Americas. Its huge economic impact {{is due in part}} to the lack of specialised natural enemies suppressing population outbreaks <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas.</b> By establishing new associations, endemic parasitoid species native to the invaded areas can play an important role in controlling the pest. This study aims to provide a range of baseline information on the developmental parameters and parasitisation efficacy of three Italian populations of D. suzukii parasitoids at different temperatures. The species tested were a larval parasitoid, Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson), and two pupal parasitoids, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) and Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins). Two comparative experiments were set up: the first assessing longevity and the lifetime fecundity of each species at 23 °C, and the second investigating the effect of temperature on parasitisation efficacy, developmental time and sex-ratio. The results revealed different fecundity patterns for the three parasitoids, probably due to a different level of synovigeny. For T. drosophilae and P. vindemiae, the lifetime sex ratio was biased towards an increasing number of males, whereas L. heterotoma showed the opposite trend. Moreover, temperature markedly affected host-parasitoid interaction and was positively correlated with the parasitoid's developmental time, whereas the sex-ratio was not significantly influenced. On the basis of these experiments, T. drosophilae appears to be the best candidate for developing a biological control strategy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{systematically}} investigated differences in performance, morphology and parasitic load of invaders {{at different stages}} of an invasion. This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a fish invasion from initial absence until establishment in the headwater reach of the second largest European river, the Danube. Here, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 73 % of the fish abundance and 58 % of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats after establishment. The time from invasion until establishment was only about two years, indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion front were different from longer established round goby populations in demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load, indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success. Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits rather than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses, specimens at the invasion front had a higher trophic position in the food web and seem to benefit from lower food competition. Somatic performance seems to be more important than investment in reproduction during {{the early stages of the}} invasion process and upstream-directed range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high competition. This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions via drift. Greater abundance and densities of acanthocephalan endoparasites were observed at the invasion front, which contradicts the expectation that invasion success is determined by lower parasitic pressure <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas.</b> Overall, the pronounced changes in fish and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien species suggest invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards a novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby predation. This seems to contribute to overcoming biological resistance and improve rapidity of dispersal...|$|E
30|$|Outside {{its native}} home, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) was {{detected}} {{for the first}} time in Spain in 2006 (Urbaneja et al. 2008), and since then, it has invaded many countries including India (CABI 2018). At present, the pest has spread to almost all the tomato growing parts of India (Sridhar et al. 2014; Ballal et al. 2016 and Sharma and Gavkare 2017). The larvae cause damage by mining into the leaves, shoots, flowers, buds, and fruits (Sharma and Gavkare 2017). Previous reports indicate that <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas,</b> the pest immediately attained the status of a serious pest of tomato causing 100 % crop damage in the absence of control measures (Arturo et al. 2012 and Ballal et al. 2016). The pest is extremely difficult to control with insecticides, and sometimes, as high as 14 rounds of sprays in a growing season were required (Luna et al. 2012). It is, therefore, important to develop sustainable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly alternative management strategies for this pest. Biological control based on the use of trichogrammatids can, therefore, be a viable option (van Lenteren 2012). The possible use of Trichogramma spp. as biological control agents of T. absoluta is currently considered all over the world because of the natural parasitism on the pest by different Trichogramma species (Zappala et al. 2012 and Goda et al. 2015). The effectiveness of a bio-control agent is directly related to its fitness. Survival, fecundity, and development time are the most important parameters that determine the fitness of a natural enemy. The successful use of Trichogramma spp. in biological control depends on knowledge of their biotic potential against the target pest and the thermal requirements (Coelho et al. 2016). Different Trichogramma species and/or strains differ in their efficiency against the target pest, thus, making it necessary to study the performance of different species/strains of Trichogramma on the target pest (Bueno et al. 2009). Implementation of the Nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits under the convention of biological diversity impose restrictions on the importation and release of the effective strains outside their area of origin. Due to these reasons, it is necessary to evaluate first the indigenous species/strains of natural enemies against the invasive pests. In the preliminary evaluation, it is important to study the population growth parameters, especially the intrinsic rate of increase, because not only it does directly represent their biotic potential, but also it determines the releasing strategy (i.e., inoculative, seasonal inoculative, or inundative) (van Lenteren 1986) and compares hosts (Iranipour et al. 2009). Parasitism rate, emergence rate, longevity, developmental time, total fecundity, and sex ratio are the other biological parameters used to evaluate the performance of natural enemies against pests (El-Wakeil 2007).|$|E
40|$|Successful plant invaders {{may have}} {{specific}} morphological and physiological traits that promote invasion {{in a new}} habitat. The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that plants released from natural enemies in the introduced habitats are more competitive and perform better than plants from the native populations. An increased phenotypic plasticity may also favour invasion because it allows plants to function under {{a wider range of}} environments. In this study we used Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae) to test whether introduced plant populations are 1) more competitive and 2) more plastic compared with the native populations. We conducted a common garden experiment using plants from the native range (South Africa, Eastern Cape), an expanded range (South Africa, Western Cape) and two introduced ranges (Australia and Europe) under different conditions of water availability. Contrary to the EICA and the increased plasticity hypotheses, plants from the invasive and expanded populations grew less and responded less to watering than those from their native range. These results may be caused by a depleted competition as well as the presence of genetic bottlenecks <b>in</b> the <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

We found no evidence of bias since as expected Culex blood meals were predominantly from birds (n = 149, 93. 7 %) with only a small proportion feeding on mammals (n = 10, 6. 3 %). In contrast, Aedes albopictus fed exclusively on mammalian hosts with over 90 % of their blood meals derived from humans (n = 96, 58. 2 %) and domesticated pets (n = 38, 23. 0 % cats; and n = 24, 14. 6 % dogs). Aedes albopictus fed from humans significantly more often in suburban than in urban areas (χ(2), p = 0. 004) and cat-derived blood meals were greater in urban habitats (χ(2), p = 0. 022). Avian-derived blood meals were not detected in any of the Ae. albopictus tested. The high mammalian affinity of Ae. albopictus suggests that this species will be an efficient vector of mammal- and human-driven zoonoses such as La Crosse, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. The lack of blood meals obtained from birds by Ae. albopictus suggest that this species may have limited exposure to endemic avian zoonoses such as St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus, which already circulate in the USA. However, growing populations of Ae. albopictus in major metropolitan urban and suburban centers, make a large autochthonous outbreak of an arbovirus such as chikungunya or dengue viruses a clear and present danger. Given the difficulties of Ae. albopictus suppression, we recommend that public health practitioners and policy makers install proactive measures for the imminent mitigation of an exotic pathogen outbreak...|$|E

The hypothesis being tested was that the reproductive success of the insect depend on habitat type and tree suitability. Adult beetles were caged on branches of host and nonhost species, in both urban and forest habitats. Two months later, number and size of feeding patches on plant tissues, eggs laid, and surviving larvae were assessed. Bark concentration of C and N was also measured from the same trees. Results indicated that the mean area of plant tissues consumed by adult feeding was significantly larger on trees growing in forest than in urban habitat, although within the same habitat {{there were no differences}} between susceptible and nonsusceptible trees. ALB tree colonization, in terms of number of eggs laid and young larvae survival, was not affected by habitat while it was higher on susceptible trees. Although trees growing in forests had a lower nitrogen concentration, they allowed colonization rates similar to those of trees growing in the urban habitat. Hence, the amount of carbon and nitrogen did not fully explain tree suitability or habitat selection. We suggest compensatory feeding as a potential mechanism that might explain this peculiar situation, as supported by a more intensive feeding activity recorded on trees in the forest. Suitability of different trees may be due to other factors, such as secondary chemical compounds...|$|R

Since its first introduction in China in 1979, this alien species has spread rapidly and damaged local ecological environments. Research to predict a suitable new area is an important step for management of the species and to prevent a further spread. In this study, Spartina alterniflora’s ecological niche was modeled using the application MAXENT. Analysis was based on species’ current distribution. The investigations of this study were two-fold. First, a large-scale global investigation (outside China) was conducted to predict suitable areas in China by comparing global and Chinese records of the species. In the second set, the combined records were used to predict suitable areas in the Jiangsu Province. The model’s accuracy was evaluated by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC value) were all over 0. 95, which indicated high predictive ability of this model. In the large scale prediction, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangzhou, Guangxi and southern part of Wuhan, Jiangsu and Anhui were all potentially endangered by S. alterniflora invasion. On the smaller scale, the prone to invasion areas were mostly concentrated on southern part and some coastal areas of Jiangsu Province, where the precipitation and temperature were appropriate for this grass. Because of S. alterniflora has high dispersal ability and human induced history, the potential distribution areas in China are considerable and it may <b>invade</b> more <b>areas,</b> in result spreading faster in the future.

30|$|The {{red palm}} weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, belongs to Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae family and {{is native to}} {{tropical}} Asian regions which have become a most threatening pest of palm trees worldwide (Yan et al. 2015). R. ferrugineus is a concealed tissue borer that resides inside {{the trunk of the}} palms with a highly aggregated population distribution pattern and tree injuries are often severe when it is discovered (Abraham et al. 1998). The widespread nature of this pest is due to their ability of adoption to a broader host range, to a wider variety of climates, and practice of shipping the palm trees between different territories (Murphy and Briscoe 1999). <b>In</b> the <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>areas,</b> this pest generally causes serious damage to the trees and significant economic losses are associated by minimizing the production of palms, and increases cost management in eradication of the pest (El-Sabea et al. 2009).

With respect to this, large quantities of insecticides are still applied to prevent and control R. ferrugineus infestations (Llácer et al. 2013). However, trapping systems which include aggregation pheromone, date fruits, bait traps have been effectively and environmentally used to detect and control this pest (Abuagla and Al-Deeb 2012). New management strategies from the aspect of chemical ecology should be developed by understanding the R. ferrugineus olfactory system, which will be efficient in reducing the weevil populations and the usage of pesticides. However, most of the olfactory genes have been deciphered by transcriptome sequencing are fragmental and their expression patterns are not well known (Yan et al. 2015; Antony et al. 2016).

40|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{the success}} of invasive species is reduced pathogen burden, resulting from a release from infections or high immunological fitness (low immunopathology) of invaders. Despite of strong selection exerted on the host, the evolutionary response of invaders to newly acquired pathogens has rarely been considered. The two independent and genetically distinct invasions of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas into the North Sea represent an ideal model system to study fast evolutionary responses of invasive populations. By exposing both invasion sources to ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse pathogens (Vibrio spp.) we demonstrate that within a few generations hosts adapted to sympatric pathogen communities. However, this local adaptation only became apparent in selective environments, i. e. at elevated temperatures reflecting patterns of disease outbreaks in natural populations. Resistance against sympatric and allopatric Vibrio spp. strains was dominantly inherited in crosses between both invasion sources, resulting in an overall higher resistance of admixed individuals than pure lines. Therefore we suggest that a simple genetic resistance mechanism of the host is matched to a common virulence mechanism shared by local Vibrio strains. This combination might have facilitated a fast evolutionary response that can explain another dimension of why invasive species can be so successful <b>in</b> <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> ranges...|$|R

In southern Australia, the native Polistes humilis was the predominant social wasp prior to the arrival of the exotic Vespula germanica (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Both species forage for similar resources (water, pulp, carbohydrate and protein prey), and concerns have arisen about potential competition between them. The aim of this study was to identify the protein foods that these wasps feed on. As many prey items are masticated by these wasps to the degree that they cannot be identified using conventional means, morphological identification was complemented by sequencing fragments of the mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene. GenBank searches using blast and phylogenetic analyses were used to identify prey items to at least order level. The results were used to construct complete prey inventories for the two species. These indicate that while P. humilis is restricted to feeding on lepidopteran larvae, V. germanica collects a variety of prey of invertebrate and vertebrate origin. Calculated values of prey overlap between the two species are used to discuss the implications of V. germanica impacting on P. humilis.

The ability of jack pine trees to defend themselves against mass attack and their suitability for brood success will play a major role in the success of this insect in a putatively new geographic range and host.

In addition, two populations of lodgepole pine (BC) and one population of jack pine (AB) were sampled for levels of induced phloem terpenes.

Constitutive α-pinene levels – a precursor in the biosynthesis of components of the aggregation and antiaggregation pheromones of {{mountain pine}} beetle – were significantly higher in jack pine. However, lower constitutive levels of compounds known to be toxic to bark beetles, e. g., 3 -carene, in jack pine suggests that this species could be poorly defended. Differences in wounding-induced responses for phloem accumulation of five major terpenes were found between the two populations of lodgepole pine and between lodgepole and jack pine.

Phenotypic plasticity can buffer populations from selection thereby allowing them to survive the establishment phase of the invasion. The annual grass Aegilops triuncialis (Poaceae, Triticeae) has become highly invasive in California (USA) and provides an opportunity to investigate the importance of phenotypic plasticity to persistence and spread in new habitats. This species produces dispersal units containing dimorphic caryopses (‘‘seeds’’) with different degrees of dormancy. Germination of the smaller seeds is suppressed by maternal tissues and by the larger sibling, but how this induced dormancy varies across populations is unknown. I used 12 populations from northern California to compare size relationships between seeds and to investigate variation in the strength of the maternal and sibling effects on germination. The larger seeds were never dormant while induced dormancy of the smaller seeds varied across populations and years. Thus, the factors governing induced dormancy were not genetically ﬁxed, but appeared to be environmentally inﬂuenced. For A. triuncialis, reproductive strategies, such as seed-size dimorphism, may facilitate initial invasions into new environments, but variation in the strength of controls over germination may be important for facilitating post-invasion persistence and spread...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this study also suggest that there are other {{ecological}} benefits to areas burned with higher fire severity, such as increased species richness over time. However, as we have elucidated here, increasing fire severity in this region of the southern Appalachians has the potential to increase princess tree in conditions wherein propagule pressure is adequate. We also found that, at least for princess tree, concentrated and timely suppression efforts can be successful <b>in</b> controlling <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> non-native species following disturbance. Armed with this knowledge, land managers may begin to enact prevention measures to minimize the risk of severe fire and non-native species introductions within ecologically sensitive areas, or more quickly pinpoint areas to monitor or target for eradication of non-native species following fire. It would be prudent to allocate resources to these areas to manage non-native, invasive species before they become established and reach reproductive age, in support of maintaining native species richness and supporting dynamic plant communities across the burned landscape.|$|R
40|$|With annual damage {{estimated}} {{at up to}} $ 78 million, the exotic woodwasp, Sirex noctilio Fabricius (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), poses a very serious threat to commercial pine plantations throughout Australia. It has gradually increased its northward range since becoming established in mainland Australia around 1960. Previously restricted to temperate areas, where its host relationshipsare understood, and where effective management and control strategies were developed, it recently reached southern Queensland, close to valuable subtropical pine estates. While climate modelling predicts these regions as suitable for Sirex establishment, subtropical pines represent unstudied hosts, and biocontrol success may be compromised in these conditions; there is an urgent need to determine Sirex host and biocontrol relationships in the subtropics to prepare intervention strategies for its inevitable arrival. We have developed novel surrogate experimental techniques to enable assessments {{in the absence of}} the wasp, and we present the results of these trials here. We also discuss results from the ongoing nematode inoculation biological control program in place in Queensland, and woodwasp phenology <b>in</b> this <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> region...|$|R
40|$|The round goby Neogobius melanostomus has {{successfully}} invaded {{much of the}} Baltic Sea. However, very {{little is known about}} the feeding habits of the species <b>in</b> this <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> environment. Our laboratory experiment showed that the round goby is able to effectively consume a diverse variety of prey when given the choice between dominant benthic invertebrates: bivalves (Macoma balthica, Mytilus trossulus, Cerastoderma glaucum) and amphipods (Gammarus spp.). In contrast consumption of the gastropod (Theodoxus fluviatilis) was very low in all provided combinations. Nevertheless, the round goby had no statistically significant preference towards any of the prey taxa. The round goby exhibited size-specific consumption of M. trossulus, with smaller individuals being consumed at least 25 % more than larger size classes. In addition elevated prey density resulted in higher consumption of prey by the fish. The broad diet suggests that shifting densities of benthic invertebrate prey has little influence on the further dispersal of the round goby in the Baltic Sea as the species is potentially able to switch between several native invertebrate taxa. This opportunistic feeding behaviour has likely favoured this invasion and ensured success of the species in the invaded ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|A sudden {{outbreak}} {{and range}} {{expansion of the}} pine processionary moth Thaumatopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) was reported in 1999 - 2005 for Venosta/Vinschgau, an area of northern Italy where the species generally occurs at low density. The forests of Pinus nigra (introduced) and Pinus sylvestris (native) were attacked on a total area of several hundred hectares, on the southern slope of the valley. Repeated applications of a biological insecticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki were necessary to limit the population growth and the consequent damage to {{the trees and the}} environment. We used a combination of ecological and economic variables to make predictions about the outcome of the present and future outbreaks. The insect is well adapted to cope with the extreme conditions at its range edge, especially because of the possibility to enter extended diapause as a pupa in the soil. The presence of the insect in the pine forests threatens soil stability, landscape value, and tourism use of the area because of the allergenic hairs released by the caterpillars. The high persistence capability of the insects <b>in</b> the <b>newly</b> <b>invaded</b> stands and the generally strongly negative perception of the problem by the local community, make the Integrated Pest management necessary. Profitability of IPM is shown when possible loss of the public functions of forests such as soil protection, carbon fixation and the risk of damage to public health, are taken into account...|$|R
