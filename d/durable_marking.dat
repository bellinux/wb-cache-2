40|$|DE 19822605 A UPAB: 20000112 NOVELTY - To form a <b>durable</b> <b>marking</b> in the {{top layer}} of paper substrates, {{at least one of the}} lower layers is treated with laser energy before the top layer is applied. The top layer is opaque using a {{printing}} and/or at least a varnish and/or at least a metallizing or combinations of them. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A coating is directly under the top paper layer, which has no pigments or contains white or colored pigments. The coating is calendered and can also be varnished. The same process can be used with layers of thicker fiber webs, of natural fibers, to give a cardboard product. The laser energy metallizes the surface to take printing and/or a varnish. The lower layer surface is treated with a carbon dioxide laser. The metallizing process uses copper, aluminum, gold or silver. The marking is a logo, name, trade mark, an image, or a security marking. The paper substrate is in a weight of 40 - 400 g/m 2. USE - The process is for the development of a <b>durable</b> <b>marking</b> in the paper or cardboard material, such as would be provided by a watermark or for the security of the document. ADVANTAGE - The material gives an effective reflection of the marking through the top layer. When the top layer has been applied to the paper substrates, no further processing is required...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in {{previous}} research that greater longitudinal pavement marking retroreflectivity levels increase drivers 2 ̆ 7 visibility and detection distance. However, increased visibility may also cause drivers to feel too comfortable during nighttime conditions and drivers may then pay less attention and/or operate at unsafe speeds. Before-and-after studies have been conducted on pavement marking improvements such as repainting stripes or changing to a more <b>durable</b> <b>marking</b> material. Studies have also used models to estimate the retroreflectivity based on the date of installment, the vehicle exposure, or assumed a linear reduction in retroreflectivity over time. Only two studies have related measured pavement marking retroreflectivity to safety performance (crash) data. This study analyzes the relationship between 3 years of pavement marking retroreflectivity data collected by the Iowa DOT on all state primary roads and corresponding crash and traffic data. This study developed a spatial-temporal database using measured retroreflectivity data to account for the deterioration of pavement markings over time along with a statewide crash data to attempt to quantify a relationship. Three different sets of data were analyzed: the complete database, two-lane roads, and records with low retroreflectivity values (≤ 200 mcd/m 2 /lx) only. The distributions and models of the entire database and the two-lane records did not show that poor pavement marking retroreflectivity correlating to a higher crash probability. When looking at records with low retroreflectivity values only, a statistically significant relationship was determined. However, the correlation was so small it does not have practical significance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteel {{components}} {{have to be}} identifiable and traceable {{during the}} whole manufacturing chain. The choice of the identification method is not specified consistently in international rules and standards. In the European standard for the execution of steel structures EN 1090 - 2 it is specified {{that the use of}} durable marks may not result in producing damages and that hard stamped marks are only permitted for steel grades up to S 355 and only in areas where no effect on the fatigue life is expected. In terms of durability and liability, markings should be resistant against particular manufacturing processes such as sandblasting, hot-dip galvanizing or coating. In detail, these methods are hard stamping, scribing, plasma marking and needling. Nowadays the machinery manufacturers have developed machines in which the marking process is automatically integrated in the manufacturing process. However, the effect of the installed notch due to the marking process on the fatigue strength of the components has not been investigated in detail yet. As a result a classification of the notched details in the European detail categories of EN 1993 - 1 - 9 is in principle not possible. For these reasons the influence of <b>durable</b> <b>marking</b> methods on the fatigue strength of steel components needs to be clarified by experimental fatigue tests and numerical calculations which are actually performed at the Institute for Metal and Lightweight Structures of University of Duisburg-Essen. The tests should determine the influence of several identification methods on the fatigue strength of structural steel details. Within the investigations the different surface conditions hard stamped, scribed, plasma marked and needled are considered. The fatigue tests are carried out considering three different steel plate thicknesses 15 mm, 25 mm and 40 mm and two different steel grades S 355 J 2 and S 460 N...|$|E

40|$|As the new {{millennium}} approaches, signing and marking materials continue to evolve. Recent efforts to increase {{the safety of the}} motoring public include the use of improved delineation materials. PERFORMANCE If the current and future state of the art for signing and marking materials could be summarized in one word, that word would be performance. Quantifiable material performance requirements are relatively new to this industry, which is more than 70 years old. In the {{new millennium}}, performance of signing and marking materials will be measured day and night, and during clear and inclement weather. Improved signing and marking materials will be part of some new Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) initiatives; development is already under way in the ITS arena. Sign performance will be measured by its durability and utility (that is, how easily it is viewed by motorists) in real situations. New marking and signing materials to improve roadway delineation are currently under evaluation. Improvements The use of <b>durable</b> <b>marking</b> materials instead of standard paint and beads has increased recently. Because maintenance funds continue to be squeezed, this trend will extend into {{the new millennium}}. One new concept under development is pavement marking management systems, which allow choice of pavement-marking materials on the basis of field performance and optimal use. Some agencies have moved away from in-house striping to contractors whose materials must meet specified performance criteria. Additionally, at least 10 state departments of transportation require a minimum retroreflective performance on markings newly applied by contractors. Some initial attempts have been made at warrantee contracts for pavement markings, which hold the contractor responsible for the long-term retroreflective performance of the installed material. The Pavement Marking Committee of the American Traffic Safety Services Association is developing a generic warrantee application specification to help agencies develop their own requirements. This generic specification should be finalized by the Pavement Marking Committee’s first meeting in the new millennium...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{aerospace}} industry, {{in order to}} ensure the identification and the traceability of the products, high repeatability, non-invasive and <b>durable</b> <b>marking</b> processes are required. Laser marking {{is one of the most}} advanced marking technologies. Compared to traditional marking processes, like punches, microdot, scribing or electric discharge pencil etcher, laser marking offers several advantages, such us: non-contact working, high repeatability, high scanning speed, mark width comparable to the laser spot dimension, high flexibility and high automation of the process itself. In order to assure the mark visibility for the component lifetime, an appropriate depth of the mark is required. In this way, a stable behaviour is ensured also when the component operates in aggressive environments (i. e. in presence of oxidation, corrosion and wear phenomena). The mark depth is strongly affected by the laser source kind and by the process parameters, such us average power, pulse frequency and scanning speed. Moreover, an excessive mark penetration could cause stress concentrations and reduce the fatigue life of the component. Consequently, an appropriate selection of the process parameters is required in order to assure visibility and to avoid excessive damage. Cold Spray Deposition (CSD) is a relative new technology that allows to produce surface coatings without significant substrate temperature increasing. In aeronautics fields this technology is useful to coat materials sensible to temperature, such as solution tempered aluminum alloy, with a titanium layer. Aim of the work is to characterize the laser marking process on CSD Ti coating, in order to study the influence of the laser marking process parameters (pulse power and scanning speed), on the groove geometry of the marking. The experimental marking tests were carried out through a 30 W MOPA Q-Switched Yb:YAG fibre laser; under different process conditions. The groove geometry was measured through a HIROX HK 9700 optical microscope. The results showed the effectiveness of the laser process to produce high quality marks on the titanium layer. Moreover, a correlation between the process parameters and the mark's geometry was clearly observed...|$|E
40|$|Enzymatic {{oxidation}} of 5 -methylcytosine (5 mC) in DNA by the Tet dioxygenases reprograms genome {{function in}} embryogenesis and postnatal development. Tet-oxidized derivatives of 5 mC such as 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) act as transient intermediates in DNA demethylation or persist as <b>durable</b> <b>marks,</b> yet how these alternative fates are specified at individual CpGs is not understood. Here, {{we report that}} the SOS response-associated peptidase (SRAP) domain protein Srap 1, the mammalian ortholog of an ancient protein superfamily associated with DNA damage response operons in bacteria, binds to Tet-oxidized forms of 5 mC in DNA and catalyzes turnover of these bases to unmodified cytosine by an autopeptidase-coupled nuclease. Biallelic inactivation of murine Srap 1 causes embryonic sublethality associated with widespread accumulation of ectopic 5 hmC.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of an external, non-invasive crayfish marking technique for population or production studies. A general-use oil-based permanent marker suitable for under water use was tested. The marker was applied on the wet carapace of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which were kept for 14 days in open- and closed-top cages in simulated crayfish production ponds. There was no significant degradation of the marks {{at the end of the}} 14 day experimental trial, except from natural fouling and dirt accumulation. Marked and non-marked crayfish averaged less than 4. 5 % and 7. 0 % mortality, respectively, suggesting that this marking technique is not directly harmful to crayfish. An observed 38 % increase in crayfish “missing” from the open-top cages was probably attributable to predation and/or escapism. In closed-top cages, less than 3 % of crayfish were missing, but it was inconclusive whether the bright markings contributed to predation in the open-top trial. This technique appears to be an excellent tool for conveniently marking crayfish for indoor or outdoor studies where moulting is not expected. It produces a <b>durable</b> <b>mark,</b> can be applied directly on wet or dry surfaces, dries in 25 – 35 seconds and there are several different colour and mark combinations possible. This technique also seems promising for marking other aquatic organisms...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{function}} of delineation {{is to provide}} the visual information needed by a driver to operate a vehicle {{in a variety of}} situations. Delineation includes the marking of highways with painted or more <b>durable</b> pavement <b>marking</b> lines and symbols, guideposts, and other devices such as curbs (see Chapter 1140). These devices use retroreflectance, which is the reflecting of light from a vehicle’s headlights back to the driver, to enhance an object’s visibility at nighttime. It is important to maintain an adequate level of retroreflectivity for both traffic signs and traffic markings for motorists during hours of darkness and during adverse weather conditions. Delineation is a required safety item of work and is addressed on all projects. A decision to omit delineation work can only be justified if the existing delineation is unaffected by construction and an evaluation of accident rates clearly shows that delineation is not a contributing factor. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses the latest edition of the MUTCD as a guide for the design, location, and application of delineation. Consult with the region Traffic Office early in the design process to ensure the proposed delineation is compatible with WSDOT policy and region preference. These policies and preferences address both the type of markings and the material selection...|$|R
40|$|Incorporating safety {{performance}} measures into asset management can assist agencies {{to manage their}} aging assets efficiently and improve system-wide safety. Past research has revealed the relationship between individual asset performance and safety, but the relationship between combined measures of operational asset condition and {{safety performance}} has not been explored. This study investigates the effect of pavement marking retroreflectivity and pavement condition on safety in a multi-objective manner. Data on one-mile segments for all Iowa primary roads from 2004 to 2009 period were collected from the Iowa Department of Transportation and integrated by linear referencing. An Asset Condition Index (ACI), {{with a range of}} 1 to 3, was developed for the road segments by scoring and weighting individual components. Statistical models were then developed to estimate the relationship between ACI and expected number of crashes, while controlling for exposure. Finally, alternative treatment strategies for pavements and pavement markings were evaluated by benefit-cost ratio analysis, considering related treatment costs and safety benefits. Results indicated that minor rehabilitation and <b>durable</b> material <b>marking</b> have the highest B/C ratio within one year after implementation. And in terms of five years after treatments, a decision making matrix of ACI ranges versus treatment alternatives was developed. The same recommendation holds for segments with ACI higher than 2. 0.

Due to population growth and growing number of megacities, Green Public Procurements concepts is also becoming an increasing trend in the road infrastructure sector. This study assessed {{the environmental impacts of}} road markings considering the whole life cycle from manufacturing to disposal. For the correctness of the study, an external expert panel reviewed the assessment. By using the LCA-Methodology based on DIN ISO 14040 and 14044, an objective comparison of the following line markings was performed: Solvent-borne paint; Water-based paint; Thermoplastic and Thermo Spray Plastic; Cold Plastic and Cold Spray Plastic. Typical material formulations in characteristic application scenarios have been modelled using the data of corresponding official approval test certificates held by a major local manufacturer of all evaluated technologies. Empirical data was used to determine a typical service life of the various road marking systems at a typical average daily traffic of 10, 000 – 15, 000 vehicles per day. The life cycle assessment results, i. e. considering the whole life cycle from manufacturing to disposal, showed that a global warming potential reduction of more than 50 % can be achieved by a more <b>durable</b> road <b>marking</b> system. The study concluded that in order to access the actual environmental impact of road markings, a lifetime evaluation including, for instance, production, application, transport, service life, and disposal must be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Novel immunotherapies, or {{checkpoint}} inhibitors, targeting programmed {{cell death}} protein- 1 (PD- 1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4) have significantly improved outcomes for patients with numerous different cancer types.

50|$|A {{bench mark}} is a point, at a known {{elevation}} {{above or below}} an adopted datum, <b>marked</b> on a <b>durable</b> object. Bench <b>marks</b> such as an upward-pointing broad arrow symbol (used to denote a government survey from 1852) could be chiselled on a rock - {{as was the case}} at Bessie Point. Alternatively, metal disks could be attached to a rock, or to a concrete block. Often a horizontal line was cut, balanced on the point of the arrow, although only an arrow was cut at Bessie Point. Other examples of broad arrow bench marks cut into rocks exist at Bowen (1887), and at Princess Charlotte Bay in the Flinders group of islands (1899, by HMS Dart). In the case of the Bessie Point 1878 bench mark, which is cut into the largest boulder on the shoreline, the datum was low water ordinary spring tides, calculated as being 12 feet (3.66m) below the broad arrow. All water depths (in feet) on the map of Cairns Harbour made in 1878 thus represented the depth available at low water ordinary spring tides, that water level being 12 feet below the bench mark. The tidal range for spring tides in the bay was 8-10 feet (2.4-3m).|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: This study compares intermediate-term {{outcomes}} of mitral valve reconstruction after either the standard sternotomy approach {{or the new}} minimally invasive approach. Although minimally invasive mitral valve operations appear to offer certain advantages, such as reduced postoperative discomfort and decreased postoperative recovery time, the intermediate-term functional and echocardiographic efficacy {{has not yet been}} documented. Methods: From May 1996 to February 1999, 100 consecutive patients underwent primary mitral reconstruction through a minimally invasive right anterior thoracotomy and peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass and Port-Access technology (Heartport, Inc, Redwood City, Calif). Outcomes were compared with those for our previous 100 patients undergoing primary mitral repair who were operated on with the standard sternotomy approach. Results: Although patients were similar in age, the patients undergoing the minimally invasive approach had a lower preoperative New York Heart Association classification (2. 1 ± 0. 5 vs 2. 6 ± 0. 6, P <. 001). There was one (1. 0 %) hospital mortality with the sternotomy approach and no such case with the minimally invasive approach. Follow-up revealed that residual mitral insufficiency was similar between the minimally invasive and sternotomy approaches (0. 79 ± 0. 06 vs 0. 77 ± 0. 06, P =. 89, 0 - to 3 -point scale); likewise, the cumulative freedom from reoperation was not significantly different (94. 4 % vs 96. 8 %, P =. 38). Follow-up New York Heart Association functional class was significantly better in the patients undergoing the minimally invasive approach (1. 5 ± 0. 05 vs 1. 2 ± 0. 05, P <. 01). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate comparable 1 -year follow-up results after minimally invasive mitral valve reconstruction. Both echocardiographic results and New York Heart Association functional improvements were compatible with results achieved with the standard sternotomy approach. The minimally invasive approach for mitral valve reconstruction provides equally <b>durable</b> results with <b>marked</b> advantages for the patient and should be more widely adopted.
