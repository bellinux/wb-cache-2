In this eschatological text, Melchizedek is seen as a divine being and Hebrew titles such as Elohim are applied to him. According to this text Melchizedek will proclaim the [...] "Day of Atonement" [...] and he will atone <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> predestined to him. He also will judge the peoples.|$|E
2500|$|According to Richard Pipes, {{violence}} was implicit in Marxism itself. He {{has argued that}} terror inevitably resulted from what Lenin saw as a Marxist belief that human lives are expendable {{in the cause of}} building Communism. He quoted Marx: [...] "The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also perish {{in order to make a}} room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> fit for a new world." [...] In 1848 Marx, commenting on a failed Vienna Uprising, wrote: [...] "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror." [...] Edvard Radzinsky noted that Joseph Stalin wrote a nota bene: [...] "Terror is the quickest way to new society" [...] aside of the above quote in Kautsky's book, Terrorism and Communism.|$|E
2500|$|The chaplet may be {{repeated}} {{over a period}} of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's Diary, Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter. The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The last day intention, according to Jesus' message to St. Faustina, is the most difficult of all: to pray <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> lukewarm and indifferent. Jesus described those people as follows:These souls cause Me more suffering than any others; it was from such souls that My soul felt the most revulsion in the Garden of Olives. It was on their account that I said: [...] "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass Me by." [...] The last hope of salvation for them is to flee to My Mercy." ...|$|E

6000|$|One of {{my first}} objects was to inquire <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{accustomed}} to shoot the Paradise birds. They lived at some distance in the jungle, and a man was sent to call them. When they arrived, we had a talk {{by means of the}} [...] "Orang-kaya" [...] as interpreter, and they said they thought they could get some. They explained that they shoot the birds with a bow and arrow, the arrow having a conical wooden cap fitted to the end as large as a teacup, so as to kill the bird by the violence of the blow without making any wound or shedding any blood. The trees frequented by the birds are very lofty; it is therefore necessary to erect a small leafy covering or hut among the branches, to which the hunter mounts before daylight in the morning and remains the whole day, and whenever a bird alights they are almost sure of securing it. (See Frontispiece.) They returned to their homes the same evening, and I never saw anything more of them, owing, as I afterwards found, to its being too early to obtain birds in good plumage.|$|E
