5|$|In the Hawks' {{season opener}} on October 27, 2016, Hardaway scored 21 points {{off the bench}} in a 114–99 win over the Washington Wizards. 12 of his points came in the final quarter as the Hawks {{extended}} their 1-point lead. He exhibited increased production {{in his second year}} with Atlanta and started a pair of games in place of an injured Bazemore in December. On January 1, 2017, he matched his career high with 29 points, including a tying three-pointer with 3.3 seconds remaining in regulation, nine points in overtime and the go-ahead free throw with 10.8 seconds remaining in overtime, to help the Hawks defeat the San Antonio Spurs 114–112. Hardaway contributed 19 points (including 9 in the fourth quarter) as a starter in the quadruple overtime January 29 victory over the New York Knicks, playing 58 minutes. On February 2, Hardaway contributed 23 of his career-high 33 points in the fourth quarter, as he helped his team rally from as many as 20 points <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Houston Rockets to win the contest. On March 3, he made five of nine three-pointers and scored a career-high 36 points in a 135–130 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Hardaway had a career-high 9 rebounds to go along with 21 points on April 9 against Cleveland as part of a week in which Hardaway averaged 22 points in a 30 week for the Hawks.|$|E

Throughout the season, Freeney was only used as a pass rush {{specialist}} coming out only on passing <b>downs.</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> Seattle Seahawks Freeney sacked Russell Wilson, which contributed to a Chargers victory. The next week Freeney got a sack <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Buffalo Bills. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> 49ers, Dwight Freeney and Ricardo Mathews sacked and forced a Colin Kaepernick fumble leading to a Chargers touchdown.

25|$|IMR (Ob'yekt 616) (IMR {{stands for}} Inzhenernaya Mashina Razgrazhdeniya) - T-55 {{converted}} into a combat engineer vehicle. The turret was replaced with a hydraulically operated crane with capacity of 2 tonnes, capable of 360° turn. The crane is operated from an armoured cupola with a visor can also be fitted with a small bucket and used as excavator arm or a pair of pincer type grabs for removing obstacles like trees. Its jib is telescopic and when in traveling position it is folded down and placed on a cradle {{in the rear of}} the hull which is folded <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> engine deck when the crane is in use. A hydraulically operated dozer blade is mounted to the front of the hull; it can be used in a straight or V-configuration only. The vehicle is fitted with a searchlight. The IMR was developed in 1969 and entered service five years later.|$|E

25|$|In free diving (breathhold) {{the weight}} system is almost {{exclusively}} a weight belt with quick release buckle, as the emergency {{release of the}} weights will usually allow the diver to float to the surface even if unconscious, where {{there is at least}} a chance of rescue. The weights are used mainly to neutralise the buoyancy of the exposure suit, as the diver is nearly neutral in most cases, and there is little other equipment carried. The weights required depend almost entirely on the buoyancy of the suit. Most free divers will weight themselves to be positively buoyant at the surface, and use only enough weight to minimise the effort required to swim <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> buoyancy {{at the start of a}} dive, while retaining sufficient buoyancy at maximum depth to not require too much effort to swim back up to where the buoyancy becomes positive again. As a corollary to this practice, freedivers will use as thin a wetsuit as comfortably possible, to minimise buoyancy changes with depth due to suit compression.|$|E
25|$|The {{main drive}} against Elsenborn Ridge was {{launched}} in the forests east of the twin villages on the early morning of 17 December. This attack was begun by tank and Panzergrenadier units of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The 989th Infantry Regiment of the 277th succeeded, after heavy and costly combat in the woods, in overrunning the forward U.S. positions guarding the trails to the villages, capturing {{a large number of}} prisoners and leaving many small units isolated behind the front lines. By 11:00, this attack had driven units of the U.S. 99th Infantry Division back into the area of the twin villages. These units were joined by forces of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division moving into the villages from the north. The German attack swiftly bogged <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> heavy small arms and machine gun fire from prepared positions of the American 99th Infantry Division on their flanks. The 990/277 and 991/277 Infantry Regiments had less success, struggling to get through the dense woods and heavy brush in their path.|$|E
25|$|The final spacewalk of the STS-134 mission, and {{the final}} spacewalk of the Space Shuttle program, was carried out on flight day 12. The EVA was {{conducted}} by Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff, who began the EVA by installing the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) on the Starboard 1 (S1) truss segment. After the OBSS was installed, Fincke and Chamitoff removed the End Effector Grapple Fixture (EFGF) {{and replaced it with}} a spare Power and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The station's Canadarm2 could not grapple the EFGF, so the PDGF was installed on the end. After that task was completed, Fincke and Chamitoff moved to the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3, and released some torque on the bolts that were holding the spare arm for Dextre <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ELC. The EVA saw the total cumulative time spent performing EVAs in support of the ISS pass the 1,000-hour mark. The three STS-134 spacewalkers spent a total time of 28 hours and 44 minutes outside the ISS on this mission. Commander Mark Kelly assisted with documenting the spacewalk by taking photos and video. In the meantime, the rest of the shuttle crew completed more equipment transfers from Endeavour and the Johannes Kepler ATV to the ISS.|$|E

25|$|In the 2013 NBA draft on June 27, the Suns {{selected}} Ukrainian center Alex Len {{from the}} Maryland with their 5th pick and power forward Alex Oriakhi from the Missouri with their 57th pick. In addition, they traded their 30th pick to the Golden State Warriors for shooting guards Archie Goodwin from the Kentucky (who was selected one pick earlier) and Malcolm Lee {{on the same}} day. On July 2, 2013, the Suns agreed to a trade involving the Los Angeles Clippers and the Milwaukee Bucks, in which they gave up Jared Dudley to the Clippers and a 2014 second-round pick to the Bucks in exchange for point guard Eric Bledsoe and small forward Caron Butler, both of whom last played for the Clippers. The Suns also agreed to trade Luis Scola to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, and a 2014 top-14-protected first-round pick on July 27. The Suns later traded Butler to the Bucks for center Viacheslav Kravtsov and point guard Ish Smith on August 29. In addition, the Suns waived one of their biggest signings from last season, Michael Beasley, on September 3, 2013. Finally, before the 2013–14 NBA season began, the Suns traded center Marcin Gortat, along with guards Shannon Brown, Kendall Marshall (whom the team drafted a year earlier), and Malcolm Lee, to the Washington Wizards for veteran forward-center Emeka Okafor and a top-12-protected 2014 first-round draft pick. The Suns were predicted to have a league-worst 16-66 season. The Suns' season proved opposite. Phoenix began the season 16–10. Eric Bledsoe (a main reason to the early success) went <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Clippers with a torn meniscus, which occurred when the Suns were 19–11 on the season. Bledsoe missed 33 games due to the injury and the Suns went 17–16 during his absence. Phoenix went over 0.500 during that period thanks to consistent play from Gerald Green, Markieff and Marcus Morris, Channing Frye and Miles Plumlee. This was being led by a breakout season by Goran Dragić, who led Phoenix to a 36–27 record while Bledsoe was out, which set Phoenix up for a strong playoff push, which nearly had Dragić {{on the brink of}} an All-Star selection. Phoenix was in a tight playoff race with the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks and coincidentally the three teams faced one another in the last week of the regular season. Before these teams faced off, Phoenix was sitting at 47–32 while Dallas and Memphis were both 48–32. Phoenix lost against both Memphis and Dallas and beat Sacramento Kings to finish the season 48–34, Dallas beat Phoenix and lost to Memphis to finish 49–33, and Memphis beat both Phoenix and Dallas to finish 50–32. This resulted in Memphis finishing with the 7th seed, Dallas finishing with the 8th seed and Phoenix finishing with the 9th seed. This was an upset for the Suns, who were making a push for the playoffs in a competitive Western Conference.|$|E

500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and <b>down</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> local {{gravitational}} acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E
