40|$|The {{field of}} {{content-based}} image retrieval {{is an important}} one for two reasons. Practically speaking, the oft-cited growth of image archives in many fields, and the rapid expansion of the Web, mean that successful image retrieval systems are fast becoming a necessity. In addition, database retrieval provides a framework within which the important questions of machine vision are brought into focus. This is firstly because successful retrieval is likely to require true image understanding, and secondly because database retrieval provides a potentially objective testbed for image understanding systems. In view of these points, the development of methods for the evaluation of retrieval systems becomes a matter of priority. There is already a substantial literature evaluating various systems, but little high-level discussion of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies</b> themselves seems to have taken place. This essay proposes a framework within which such issues can be addressed, analyses possible <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies,</b> indicating where they are appropriate and where they are not, and critiques some <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies</b> used in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{e-government}} {{was expected to}} support {{the development of the}} new public sector paradigm and the emerging socio-political trends, endorsing efforts for deliberative and democratic decision-making processes, and advocating the effective, accountable and transparent management of public affairs. In reality, very little of the above- mentioned was achieved, indicating that the current policy-making in the e- government field is inadequate, whereas lacking comprehensive and objective <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies</b> consequently results in poor quality planning and implementation of e-government policies. Despite the growing research interest in the last decade or so, the existing <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies</b> have been often only marginally and superficially targeting and evaluating the notion of the public interest articulated and addressed by the e-government policies. Moreover, the evaluation of the public interest dimensions is fr equently rendered particularly with the evaluation of financial benefits of the e-government policies, additionally reducing the applicability of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies</b> and undermining the legitimacy of the evaluation results used for strategic planning. Paper provides an analysis of more than 50 <b>methodologies</b> for the <b>evaluation</b> of e-government policies, exploring their capacity and extent to which they facilitate the evaluation of the public interest implemented by the e-government policies. Analysis offers an insight into the current evaluation practice enabling detection of its deficiencies, and could facilitate a significant contribution to the inclusion of the public interest concept in the future design of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>methodologies</b> and provide support to more evidence - based policy - making in the e-government field...|$|R

These methodologies allow to obtain quality evaluations or recommendations on the accessed Web documents/sites from linguistic judgements provided by Web visitors. Then, these recommendations can aid other visitors (information or service searchers) to decide which Web recourses to access, that is, to find quality information and services on the Web...|$|R
