5|$|Prior {{to making}} landfall, the storm {{produced}} strong waves on the Florida west coast. Following {{a summer of}} tropical moisture in Florida, Henri brought more heavy rainfall to the saturated state, peaking at 9.09in (230mm) in Hialeah in the southeast portion of the state. Two other areas experienced over 7in (180mm), though most areas received only light rainfall. In Hernando County, a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5in (125mm) of rain in around an hour. It caused a rapid flooding of roads, though quickly retreated. Damage was minor, {{due to lack of}} many homes in the area. A feeder band in Charlotte County dropped 7in (180mm) of rain in three hours, flooding numerous streets and homes. Throughout Florida, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. However, lightning from a feeder band injured a man in Lee County, while an indirect injury occurred from a car crash due to <b>hydroplaning.</b>|$|E

25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} {{emphasize that}} the system is not a performance enhancement nor a replacement for safe driving practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe <b>hydroplaning</b> scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be in contact with the road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{intervenes}} {{only when}} it detects a probable loss of steering control, i.e. when the vehicle is not going where the driver is steering. This may happen, for example, when skidding during emergency evasive swerves, understeer or oversteer during poorly judged turns on slippery roads, or <b>hydroplaning.</b> ESC may also intervene in an unwanted way during high-performance driving, because steering input {{may not always be}} directly indicative of the intended direction of travel (i.e. controlled drifting). ESC estimates the direction of the skid, and then applies the brakes to individual wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle's vertical axis, opposing the skid and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver's commanded direction. Additionally, the system may reduce engine power or operate the transmission to slow the vehicle down.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the approach and landing were normal with natural variations but that the spoilers were not deployed when the pilot pulled the lever. No conclusion to the cause was found, although the commission believed it must either have been a mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism or a fault {{in two of the}} four thrust lever micro switches. The pilots received warning of the failure of deployment and also noticed the lack of sufficient retardation, but failed to connect the two issues, instead focusing on the wheel brakes. This caused the removal of the anti-skid system, which caused <b>hydroplaning</b> and subsequently reduced braking effect. The lack of runway grooving was decisive for the <b>hydroplaning</b> to take place. The aircraft was estimated to travel at [...] {{at the time of the}} overrun.

5000|$|The Union Internationale Motonautique (or [...] "UIM", {{headquartered}} in Europe) sanctions many different <b>hydroplane</b> categories of <b>hydroplane</b> powerboat racing. International UIM F-125, F-250, F-350 and F-500 Circuit powerboat races are {{very popular in}} Europe, Asia, and the United States. UIM's O-series <b>hydroplane</b> Formula Circuit racing events {{are some of the}} most prestigious Professional Racing Outboard (PRO) <b>hydroplane</b> events in the world. National powerboat racing teams compete for national and international titles in these <b>hydroplane</b> racing circuits. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) sanction similar PRO class national title events in the United States. Professional F-series World Cup Title powerboat races are held at Europe, United States, and western Asia race site locations every year. Equivalent APBA PRO classes are 125ccH (UIM O-125), 175ccH (UIM O-175), 250ccH (UIM O-250), 350ccH (UIM O-350), 500ccH (UIM O-500), 750ccH (APBA only), and 1000ccH classes. PRO classes using 500cc and larger displacement racing motors must be equipped with an enclosed re-enforced capsule, a certified racing harness restraint system, and a self-contained oxygen system for the driver. The faster classes of PRO <b>hydroplanes</b> (with straightaway speeds from around 75 to 120 miles per hour) use 2-cycle outboard motors running highly filtered methanol race fuel mixed with a pure castor or synthetic castor-based lubricating oil. All methanol-fueled and gasoline-fueled PRO racing outboard motors are direct drive (no gear reduction) and equipped with high performance, motorcycle racing style magneto ignition and carburetor systems. 125cc through 1000cc PRO series <b>hydroplanes</b> are not entry level classes in outboard powerboat racing. Investment costs are moderately high compared to similar APBA stock and modified outboard racing classes. K-PRO (an APBA entry class) is the only PRO <b>hydroplane</b> class running modified, recreational outboard motors; all other PRO <b>hydroplane</b> classes use 2-stroke outboard motors designed and manufactured specifically for PRO circuit racing purposes. Entry level classes for the PRO series classes are gasoline-fueled K-PRO (APBA sanctions only) and OSY-400 (sanctioned by both UIM and APBA.) International UIM teams have a formal crew that usually consists of family members, motor mechanic, hull builder sponsor, and owner/driver team in order to be successful at racing international F-125 through F-500 Circuit <b>hydroplanes.</b> Some <b>hydroplane</b> hull builders sponsor more than one team in a formula series circuit. PRO outboard <b>hydroplane</b> hulls are constructed with lightweight wood, composite, and hybrid (wood/composite/aluminum) materials. Outboard Performance Craft <b>hydroplanes</b> (sometimes called [...] "tunnel boats") are a different racing series of UIM and APBA outboard powerboat classes. Limited <b>hydroplane</b> racing classes are inboard-engine powered boats that use high performance gasoline fuel.|$|R
2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce <b>hydroplaning</b> and give [...] very short landing runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low.

5000|$|<b>Hydroplaning,</b> {{also known}} as aquaplaning, is the {{condition}} where a layer of water builds up between the tire and road surface. <b>Hydroplaning</b> occurs when the tread pattern cannot channel away enough water at an adequate rate to ensure a semi-dry footprint area. <b>Hydroplaning</b> is more prevalent with wider tires and at higher speeds. When <b>hydroplaning</b> occurs, the tire effectively [...] "floats" [...] above the road surface on a cushion of water - and loses traction, braking and steering, creating a very unsafe driving condition. When <b>hydroplaning</b> occurs, there is considerably less responsiveness of the steering wheel. The correction of this unsafe condition is to gradually reduce speed, by merely lifting off the accelerator/gas pedal.|$|E
40|$|Flutter of sail mounted <b>hydroplanes</b> {{system is}} a {{self-excited}} dynamic hydroelastic phenomenon due to an undesirable coupling occurring between the elastic structure and hydrodynamic flows. The flutter behavior depends on both structure parameters and free-play nonlinearities in the <b>hydroplanes</b> system. The free-play nonlinearity introduces persistent limit cycle oscillations (LCO) which can cause water noise, and it will have an undesirable effect on the concealment capability of marine vehicles. The impact of structure parameters and free-play of the <b>hydroplanes</b> systems on the hydroelastic stability is not fully understood and is an active area of research. In order to explore the fundamental nature of the <b>hydroplanes</b> system, the present paper, Part II of this work, focus on two aspects: (i) {{the analysis of the}} full-scale <b>hydroplanes</b> system hydroelastic response based on Computational Fluid Dynamics/Computational Structure Dynamics (CFD/CSD) two-way coupling method which verified by the AGARD 445. 6 wing standard flutter model. Results show that the <b>hydroplanes</b> system hydroelastic response is completely symmetrical, and it proves Part I work, that is the full-scale system can be simplified as one <b>hydroplane</b> with a torsional spring. Additionally, (ii) the 2 -DOF structural model and the Theodorsen&# 039;s theory of <b>hydroplanes</b> system are used to get {{a better understanding of the}} structure parameters and free-play effect on linear/nonlinear flutter of the <b>hydroplanes</b> system. To validate the accuracy of the modeling predictions, the linear/nonlinear simulation in-home codes are compared with those theoretical and experimental reported in the existing literature, and good results within engineering error margins are obtained. Results show that structural parameters might effect on the classical flutter speed and LCO only occurred in low flow speed due to free-play...|$|R
