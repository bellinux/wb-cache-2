40|$|Ascending infections, {{especially}} those following the rupturing of membranes, have occupied the obstetricians for generations {{because of the}} in-creased risk to mother and infants. With the development of perinatal medicine during the last 15 years this risk has increased because of the introduction of intensive monitoring during labor. Several {{studies have shown that}} the colon-ization of the amniotic fluid <b>increases</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>within</b> a few <b>hours</b> after the rupturing öf mem-branes [4, 11, 19]. The use of intensive monitoring techniques (cardiotocography, fetal bloodsampling, more internal examinations) adds to the intro-duction of organisms [8, 9, 12, 15]. This is demonstrated in Fig. l. While prophylactic use of antibiotics will decrease the immediate risk to mother and infant [17] this is not considered an appropriate solution because of the selection of resistant organisms [19]. Therefore, we have sought a new approach which would allow to combat the ascension of organisms without increasing hospital infections. With initiation of intrapartum monitoring we introduce together with the scalp electrode for fetal heart monitoring a thin plastic catheter attached to the electrode (Fig. 2) through which a suitable dis-infectant solution is slowly pumped throughout the subsequent period of delivery.

40|$|C-reactive protein (CRP) is a liver-derived pattern {{recognition}} molecule that is increased in inflammatory states. It <b>rapidly</b> <b>increases</b> <b>within</b> <b>hours</b> after tissue injury, {{and it is}} suggested that {{it is part of the}} innate immune system and contributes to host defense. Since cardiovascular disease is at least in part an inflammatory process, CRP has been investigated in the context of arteriosclerosis and subsequent vascular disorders. Based on multiple epidemiological and intervention studies, minor CRP elevation [high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) ] has been shown to be associated with future major cardiovascular risk (hsCRP: 10 mg/L = unspecific elevation). It is recommended by the American Heart Association that patients at intermediate or high risk of coronary heart disease may benefit from measurement of hsCRP with regard to their individual risk prediction. Elevation of hsCRP is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes development in patients with all levels of metabolic syndrome. In type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A 1 c significantly correlates with hsCRP levels and future cardiovascular risk. Also, hsCRP levels increase with the stage of ?-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Non-diabetes drugs that have been shown to reduce hsCRP concentrations include aspirin, statins, cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors, and fibrates. Recent intervention studies have also demonstrated the distinct efficacy of different anti-diabetes treatments on a variety of cardiovascular risk markers. Intensive insulin therapy may reduce inflammation, but this effect may be influenced by the degree of weight gain. Treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? has lead to substantial reduction of hsCRP and other cardiovascular risk markers in several comparator studies. Since this effect was shown to be independent of the degree of glycemic improvement, it can be regarded as a classspecific effect. Whether these findings translate into a reduction of overall cardiovascular mortality will soon be shown by the currently running thiazolidinedione outcome studies. Positive results in these trials will further strengthen the value and acceptance of hsCRP, which is recommended as a predictive laboratory marker for cardiovascular disease risk also in patients with diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{human health}} during {{long-term}} space missions is of major concern at any time. It {{is well known}} that space missions influence the immune system of the explorers and that they become more susceptible to bacterial infections. At the same time, bacteria exposed to the space environment have been shown to get more aggressive and more resistant to antibiotics. This particular combination can lead to severe infections and may jeopardise the mission; therefore a strong and uncompromising strategy inhibiting the propagation of bacteria is urgently needed. To achieve this, antimicrobial surfaces may just offer the answer. They provide a promising alternative to conventional cleaning procedures with e. g. disinfectants and contain organic/inorganic substituents or antimicrobial metals such as copper or silver. Copper is an essential metal but toxic at higher concentrations. On the contrary, silver is not essential and therefore toxic even at low concentrations. Due to their antimicrobial properties, both metals were used for medical issues and the storage of drinking water since thousands of years. While the toxicity is well known, the exact mechanisms of the toxicity are still unclear. In this study the antimicrobial effect of pure copper and new, potentially antimicrobial eutectic alloys composed of aluminium, silver and/or copper was investigated under wet contact killing conditions. First, the survival of Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells after contact with antimicrobial materials was examined. Additionally, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and damages of the membrane, DNA and RNA were determined for copper exposed samples. ROS production and membrane damages <b>increased</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>within</b> one <b>hour</b> while the effect on cell survival was negligible even after two hours of exposure. Only longer exposure of up to four hours led to a rapid decrease in cell survival depending on the concentration of exposed cells/cm². Further investigations were conducted with selected strains of the Keio collection. This collection is composed of E. coli strains which exhibit knockouts in one gene whereby each deleted gene was exchanged by a kanamycin cassette. To determine metabolic influences of pure copper and eutectic alloy exposed samples, 21 strains which had either a direct link to copper and/or silver transport mechanisms or a general function in the microorganism were selected. After pre-testing, different survivability’s of E. coli ΔcopA, ΔrecA, ΔcutA, ΔcueR and ΔcueO were obtained. The survival was decreased in absence of CueO compared to ΔcopA strains when exposed to pure copper surfaces. In contrast to this, the survivability was vice versa when exposed to silver containing alloys whereas CueO had no function in silver oxidization. Finally, the release of metal ions and the cell associated metal concentration was determined by taking the example of Staphylococcus cohnii, Escherichia coli K 12 and ΔcopA to identify possible connections between cell associated ions and the survival of cells. These measurements indicated that the higher release of ions after exposure of cells in buffer is caused by an indirect dissolution. Despite a relatively high cell associated ion concentration, the experiments in the current study (with ex vivo and in vivo DNA/RNA and the above mentioned Keio strains) pointed out that these ions were possibly primarily present in the periplasm. Additionally, investigations on ternary, eutectic alloys were conducted. They showed that special casting protocols need to be in progress to obtain antimicrobial effects. Due to the antimicrobial effect and light weight, these materials could be a great opportunity to be applied in hospitals or in spacecraft facilities...|$|R

For the parallelization of Cholesky factorization we utilized various standard linear algebra software packages and present performance results on SMP clusters and shared-memory cc-NUMA machines. Clusters of SMPs can be characterized as hybrid parallel architectures which combine the main architectural features of distributed-memory and shared-memory parallel computers. Although the availability of SMP clusters is <b>increasing</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>within</b> the scientific computing community, currently no generally accepted programming model exists for these machines.
