The <b>inverse</b> <b>time</b> operational matrix of Chebyshev wavelets is introduced and applied for parameterizing state and control terms containing <b>inverse</b> <b>time.</b> The method is also applicable to linear quadratic time-delay systems with combined constraints.

We consider spinning black holes for which the specific spin angular momentum a/M= 1 -ϵ, and we consider values of ϵ≥ 10 ^- 6. We find an effective transient behavior for the quasi-normal ringdown: the early phase of the quasi-normal ringdown is governed by a decay according to <b>inverse</b> <b>time,</b> with frequency equaling twice the black hole's horizon frequency.

40|$|The {{time domain}} {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{has been used for}} the study of dielectric relaxation spectra of pentanenitrile (PN) and chlorobenzene (CBZ) binary mixtures. The frequency range used for the study has been 10 MHz to 20 GHz. The system has been studied at 350 C temperature for 11 different concentrations. The dielectric parameters such as static permittivity (ε 0) and relaxation time (τ) have been obtained by Fourier transform and the least squares fit method. The Excess parameters such as excess permittivity and excess <b>inverse</b> relaxation <b>time</b> of the mixtures have been determined. In the mixtures excess permittivity (E) is found to be both positive and negative. The excess <b>inverse</b> relaxation <b>time</b> (1 /) E is found to be negative for all concentrations.
