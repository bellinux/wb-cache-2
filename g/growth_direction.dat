25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the <b>growth</b> <b>direction,</b> the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E
500|$|The bosses on {{the skull}} of Achelousaurus may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain. In 2009, the {{paleontologist}} Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined {{the skull of}} centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. They proposed that the rugose bosses of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus were covered by thick pads of cornified (or keratinized) skin, similar to the boss of modern muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). The nasal horncore of adult Achelousaurus had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on the sides. A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch {{at the tip of}} the nasal horncore. The <b>growth</b> <b>direction</b> of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of Coronosaurus, as indicated by the orientation of the [...] "fins" [...] or ridges on the bosses. That the supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. In addition, correlates for a rostral scale in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified.|$|E

Intrinsic crystallographic structures and the <b>growth</b> <b>directions</b> of the as-prepared ZnO nanowires were investigated by using {{selected area electron diffraction}} and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. In the present case, Li+ and Cl- ions of molten salts may bind with O 2 - and Zn 2 + ions, respectively, of the { 101 } and { 001 } polar surfaces of the ZnO crystals, resulting in the decrease of their surface energies and tuning the <b>growth</b> <b>directions</b> by blocking the growth on the polar surfaces. A combination of the growth along the,, and directions may lead to the formation of complex tree like ZnO dendrites. Strong green light emission was observed from room-temperature PL spectra of the as-prepared ZnO nanowires.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have attracted}} attention for their remarkable electrical properties and have being explored {{as one of}} the best building blocks in nano-electronics. A key challenge to realize such potential is the control of the nanotube <b>growth</b> <b>directions.</b> Even though both vertical growth and controlled horizontal growth of carbon nanotubes have been realized before, the growth of complex nanotube structures with both vertical and horizontal orientation control on the same substrate has never been achieved. Here, we report a method to grow three-dimensional (3 D) complex nanotube structures made of vertical nanotube forests and horizontal nanotube arrays on a single substrate and from the same catalyst pattern by an orthogonally directed nanotube growth method using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). More importantly, such a capability represents a major advance in controlled growth of carbon nanotubes. It enables researchers to control the <b>growth</b> <b>directions</b> of nanotubes by simply changing the reaction conditions. The high degree of control represented in these experiments will surely make the fabrication of complex nanotube devices a possibility...|$|R
