5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an <b>eluant.</b> However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the <b>eluant</b> being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as <b>eluant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an <b>eluant,</b> reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E

40|$|OPAL A is paw paw pulp {{treated by}} a process {{involving}} heating and alkalinisation. OPALA can improve resolution of wounds that are resistant to standard care therapy (Mitchell, 2008), although the mechanism {{is yet to be}} determined. We hypothesised an anti-inflammatory response to OPALA, and examined this by testing its ability to inhibit 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LOX), an enzyme involved in production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes. 5 -LOX converts linoleic acid to a hydroperoxide, an oxidant in the oxidative coupling of 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone and 3 -(dimethylamino) benzoic acid (Anthon & Barrett, 2001). In the presence of haemoglobin, this reaction produces an indamine dye where development of dye colour (A 598) is used as a measure of 5 -LOX activity. 5 -LOX (630 U/ml) was incubated in the absence (control) or presence of OPALA (7. 6 % solution) 1 linoleic acid (0. 38 mM). 5 -LOX activity was observed in controls, and almost abolished by OPALA. To examine the chemical profile of OPALA bioactivity, OPALA (7 ml) was freeze dried, added to silica gel (5 g pre-wet with ethyl acetate) in a column, and eluted sequentially using ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and water (40 ml each). <b>Eluants</b> were freeze-dried, reconstituted to 0. 5 ml in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer solution, and tested for inhibition of 5 -LOX. 5 -LOX activity was almost abolished by the methanol and water <b>eluants</b> but unaffected by the other <b>eluants.</b> There was no difference in potency of the methanol and water <b>eluants</b> for inhibition of 5 -LOX. In conclusion, OPALA has potential anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5 -LOX. Polar compounds in OPALA are mainly responsible for this effect. Mitchell, G.

40|$|Neutral salts exhibit very marked {{differences}} as <b>eluants</b> of proteins from affinity columns.

Given the concentration of one neutral salt required for elution of a protein of interest from an affinity column, the elution capability of any neutral salt at any temperature can be quantitatively predicted for that protein.

500|$|Praseodymium {{may then}} be {{separated}} from the other lanthanides via ion-exchange chromatography, or by using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate where the solubility of Ln3+ increases as the atomic number increases. If ion-exchange chromatography is used, the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation-exchange resin and Cu2+ or Zn2+ or Fe3+ is loaded into the other.

500|$|Once the nobelium-255 is produced, {{it can be}} {{separated}} out {{in a similar way}} as used to purify the neighboring actinide mendelevium. The recoil momentum of the produced nobelium-255 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum: this is usually combined by trapping the nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and carrying them along with a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters. The thin layer of nobelium collected on the foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving the foil. The nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form the divalent state, unlike the other trivalent actinides: under typically used elution conditions (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as stationary organic phase and 0.05Mhydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase, or using 3Mhydrochloric acid as an <b>eluant</b> from cation-exchange resin columns), nobelium will pass through the column and elute while the other trivalent actinides remain on the column.

500|$|... 1969 {{studies on}} the element showed that {{lawrencium}} reacted with chlorine to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl3. Its volatility {{was found to be}} {{similar to that of the}} chlorides of curium, fermium, and nobelium and much less than that of rutherfordium chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500atoms of the isotope 256Lr, comparing it with divalent (No, Ba, Ra), trivalent (Fm, Cf, Cm, Am, Ac), and tetravalent (Th, Pu) elements. It was found that lawrencium coextracted with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the 256Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it eluted ahead of Md3+ in the elution sequence. Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr3+ ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium(III) fluoride (LrF3) and hydroxide (Lr(OH)3) should both be insoluble in water. Due to the actinide contraction, the ionic radius of Lr3+ should be smaller than that of Md3+, and it should elute ahead of Md3+ when ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate (ammonium α-HIB) is used as an <b>eluant.</b> Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope 260Lr confirmed lawrencium's trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as erbium, and found that lawrencium's ionic radius was (88.6±0.3)pm, larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from periodic trends. Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to (88.1±0.1)pm and calculated an enthalpy of hydration value of −(3685±13)kJ·mol−1. It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.|$|E

The results showed that 400 mmol/L Na 3 PO 4 solution had higher elution efficiency for the adsorbed serum proteins on BCP ceramics than 2 mol/L NaCl or 2 % sodium dodecycl sufonate (SDS) solution. Moreover, the porous structure of BCP ceramics had a strong impact on the elution of the adsorbed serum proteins. The microporous structure could promote the adsorption of serum proteins on BCP ceramics and slowed down their release rate, but the 3 D interconnected macropores were favorable for the elution and release of serum proteins from the BCP surface...|$|R
40|$|Poly(hydroxamic acid) resin (PHA) was {{prepared}} by modification of polyacrylamide (PAAm) prepared through -irradiation technique {{and used for}} the first time in separation of Zr(IV) from Y(III) and Sr(II) as a simulation mode for the purification of 89 Zr from its parents (Y or Sr). The adsorption behaviors of zirconium, yttrium, and strontium on the prepared PHA resin in different media, namely, hydrochloric acid, acetate buffer, and citrate buffer were studied as a function of pH. In addition, in cation-exchange column chromatography experiments using PHA, three different <b>eluants,</b> namely, [*]mol/L HCl, acetate buffer pH 3. 5, and 2 [*]mol/L HCl, were employed for elution of Zr(IV), Y(III) and Sr(II), respectively, where Zr(IV), Y(III) and Sr(II) were eluted in amounts of 80 %, 99. 9 %, and 100 %, respectively. The purification process of Y(III) from Zr(IV) was carried out using regenerated PHA...|$|R
40|$|The binding of {{thirteen}} aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to thirty two immobilised procion dyes has been investigated. Most dyes bind {{one or more}} enzymes. The amino acid substrates are not normally potent <b>eluants,</b> with the notable exception of tryptophan eluting tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from Brown MX- 5 BR. Phosphate is frequently extremely effective, much more than expected by simple considerations of ionic strength, indicating {{that many of the}} dyes are able to mimic the phosphate groups of the phosphodiester backbone of the nucleic acid. Procedures for the purification of methionyl-, tryptophanyl- and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases are presented and compared to the conventional purifications of these enzymes. The results indicate the general applicability of these dye columns to the purification of most enzymes of of nucleic acid metabolism and the necessity of investigating as many different dyes as possible for any individual enzyme...|$|R
