Secondary Information Structuring encompasses a small set of predicates to select and interrelate declarations in document grammars and information items in- possibly multiple- <b>instance</b> <b>documents.</b> The selections are integrated in a conceptual hierarchy, which then can be used to conceptually validate and query <b>document</b> grammars and <b>instance</b> <b>documents,</b> to transform <b>instance</b> <b>documents,</b> and to relate the selected information from Primary Information Structuring to other conceptual resources. An integrated implementation of the approach, using information from document grammars and multiple <b>instance</b> <b>documents,</b> is currently under development.

A foundational component of these standards is the Metadata Description Language (MDL). MDL is an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) -based language for describing requirements, design choices, and configuration parameters of a Telemetry Network System (TmNS). Within a TmNS, MDL guides the exchange of information between applications and the configuration of network devices. Recent initial evaluations assessed MDL {{in terms of the}} expressive power of the language and the level of effort in developing applications that utilize MDL <b>Instance</b> <b>Documents.</b> Performing these initial evaluations required the generation of MDL <b>Instance</b> <b>Documents</b> to describe scenarios representative of both near-term and future telemetry systems that express different levels of iNET interoperability.

5000|$|Element declarations, which define {{properties}} of elements. These include the element name and target namespace. An important property {{is the type}} of the element, which constrains what attributes and children the element can have. In XSD 1.1, the type of the element may be conditional on the values of its attributes. An element may belong to a substitution group; if element E is in the substitution group of element H, then wherever the schema permits H to appear, E may appear in its place. Elements may have integrity constraints: uniqueness constraints determining that particular values must be unique within the subtree rooted at an element, and referential constraints determining that values must match the identifier of some other element. Element declarations may be global or local, allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b>|$|E

40|$|XBRL {{stands for}} {{extensible}} business reporting language. It is an XML based computer language for reporting business information. Starting December 2008, the United States Security and Exchange Commission (US SEC) has a proposal requiring top 500 public companies to file their financial statements with the SEC {{not only in}} the text format (i. e., in ASCII or HTML) but also in the XBRL format. The file created using XRBL language is called an XBRL <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b> Under this requirement, the filers are not required to obtain a third party assurance on the XBRL <b>instance</b> <b>document.</b> The main reason for not requiring a third party independent assurance of XBRL instance documents is to encourage filers to comply with the SEC requirement without incurring much added costs. In addition, to encourage the filers to comply with this requirement, the SEC is not holding filers legally liable of any errors in the filed XBRL instance documents so long as they look similar to the standard reports when viewed using the SEC viewer. Even though the SEC is not currently requiring a third party assurance of the XBRL instance documents of the SEC filings, it {{is in the best interest}} of the public that these documents b...|$|E
