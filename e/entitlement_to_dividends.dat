50|$|In {{corporate}} law, a {{stock certificate}} (also known as certificate of stock or share certificate) {{is a legal}} document that certifies ownership of a specific number of shares or stock in a corporation. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>dividends,</b> with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect {{the transfer of the}} shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a stock exchange. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the share certificate as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a holding statement in lieu of a share certificate for each parcel of shares owned.|$|E

[...] Relying on a retroactive amendment to the California Civil Code, Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. [...] The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. [...] The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. [...] In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as community property under California law.|$|R

5000|$|Saul D Harrison & Sons plc ran a {{business}} that was established in 1891 by the petitioner's great grandfather. It made industrial cleaning and wiping cloths, made from waste textiles. It operated from West Ham and after 1989 from Hackney. The petitioner had [...] "class C" [...] shares, which gave her rights <b>to</b> <b>dividends</b> and capital distribution in a liquidation. But she had no <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> vote, and the company had been running at a loss. She alleged that the directors (who were her cousins) had unfairly kept running the business just so they could pay themselves cushy salaries. Instead, she said, they should have closed down the business and distributed the assets to the shareholders.|$|R

40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} that the witness {{protection}} is a subjective, public right and is a result of protection of fundamental human rights. It is fundamental, public, individual, positive, directly relative and indirectly absolute right. The following entitlements stem from the fundamental right of witness <b>to</b> protection: a) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> be informed about one’s right <b>to</b> protection; b) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> demand or waive one’s right <b>to</b> protection; c) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> withhold one’s personal details, testimony in full or answers to particular questions until the decision is made as to his request for protection; d) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> two-instance decision on one’s request; e) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> have a proxy; f) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> enjoy protection. The analysis of procedural witness protection in the comparative law shows that the witness in some countries does not have certain entitlements. On the other side, some entitlements are generally recognized. Certain differencies are understandable and acceptable, but not all of them. It is necessary to work on the realization of all entitlements that can be derived from subjective right to witness protection.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} investor sentiment on the market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcements. Design/methodology/approach: We use the European Economic Sentiment Indicator data, from Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN), {{as a proxy for}} investor sentiment and focus on the market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcements, using panel data methodology. Findings: Using data from three European markets, our results indicate that the investor sentiment has some influence on the market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcements, for two of the three analysed markets. Globally, we find no evidence of investor sentiment influencing the market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcements for the Portuguese market. However, we find evidence that the positive share price reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> increases enlarges with sentiment, {{in the case of the}} UK markets, whereas the negative share price reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> decreases reduces with sentiment, in the French market. Research limitations/implications: We have no access <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> forecasts, so, our findings are based on naïve dividend changes and not unexpected change dividends. Originality/value: This paper offers some insights on the effect of investor sentiment on the market reaction to firms’ news, a strand of finance that is scarcely developed and contributes to the analysis of European markets that are in need of research. As the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the effect of investor sentiment on the market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> news, in the context of European markets...|$|R
