60|$|The {{message was}} sent {{and an hour}} later {{a dozen of the}} native {{craftsmen}} arrived with their rude tools and a supply of planks cut from a kind of iron-wood or <b>ebony</b> <b>tree.</b> They prostrated themselves to Alan, then the master of them rising, instantly began to measure Jeekie with a marked reed. That worthy sprang back and asked what in the name of Bonsa, Big and Little, they were doing, whereon the man explained with humility that the Asika had said that she thought the white lord wanted the wood to make a box to bury his servant in, as he, the said servant, had offended her that morning, and doubtless the white lord wished to kill him on that account, or perhaps to put him away under ground alive.|$|E

5000|$|... ==History== Like {{other species}} of <b>ebony</b> <b>trees,</b> Mauritian <b>ebony</b> <b>trees</b> yield a dark black ebony wood. In its natural habitat, it was a massive canopy tree - common in the dry and upland wet forests of the island.|$|R
50|$|Though {{persimmon}} trees {{belong to}} the same genus as <b>ebony</b> <b>trees,</b> persimmon tree wood has a limited use in the manufacture of objects requiring hard wood. It is hard, but cracks easily and is somewhat difficult to process. Persimmon wood is used for paneling in traditional Korean and Japanese furniture.|$|R
50|$|Note: For {{many years}} quartersawn ebony boards have been {{unavailable}} because the farms of newly planted <b>ebony</b> <b>trees</b> are still small and {{need time to}} grow. Forest harvesting is greatly restricted.|$|R

50|$|Ceylon ebony wood {{high demand}} caused {{the threat of}} this species extinction. In 1994 the World Conservation Union {{included}} Ceylon <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> into the Red Book. Both India and Sri Lanka have laws prohibiting international trade of the wood.|$|E
50|$|Two {{species of}} the giant Mauritian <b>ebony</b> <b>trees</b> still survive in small numbers - Diospyros melanida and Diospyros egrettarum. They {{previously}} formed {{part of the original}} indigenous forests of the area, together with other surviving endemics such as Sideroxylon boutonianum ("Bois de Fer"). Smaller local plants include critically rare ferns, such as Doryopteris pilosa and the aquatic Acrostichum aureum, as well as the orchid Oeoniella polystachys.|$|R
5000|$|The park {{is known}} for {{impressive}} bird viewing opportunities with 358 species documented within the park boundaries. The 760 acre park was acquired in 1944 {{for the price of}} 1$ U.S. from the Bentsen family with the stipulation that it be used “solely for Public Park purposes.” It was initially preserved from agricultural use by the family due to the presence of beautiful native <b>Ebony</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The endemic {{plants of}} Saint Helena include many notable [...] "insular {{arborescent}} Asteraceae", that is, {{members of the}} daisy family which have evolved a shrubby or tree-like habit on islands. Other notable endemics include the closely related St Helena redwood (Trochetiopsis erythroxylon) and St Helena dwarf ebony (Trochetiopsis ebenus). These are unrelated to the redwood trees of California or to the <b>ebony</b> <b>trees</b> of commerce, being instead in the Mallow family (Malvaceae).|$|R
50|$|The name Camiguin {{is derived}} from the native word Kamagong, a species of the <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> that thrives near Lake Mainit in the {{province}} of Surigao del Norte, the region from which the earlier inhabitants of the islands, the Manobos, came. Kinamigin, the local language of Camiguin, is closely related to the Manobo language.|$|E
50|$|Habitats on {{the reserve}} consist mainly of dry scrubland, {{deciduous}} dry forest with the vegetation {{dominated by the}} plant families, Bombacaceae, Burseraceae and Euphorbiaceae. Some of the species include Adansonia rubrostipa, commonly known as fony baobab, the <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> (Diospyros platycalyx), Euphorbia antso and Hazomalania voyronii which has timber that contains camphor an insect repellent. There are also small seasonal lakes with locally endemic aquatic plants.|$|E
50|$|Two Tanzanian art styles have {{achieved}} international recognition. The Tingatinga school of painting, founded by Edward Said Tingatinga, consists of brightly coloured enamel paintings on canvas, generally depicting people, animals, or daily life. After Tingatinga's death in 1972, other artists adopted and developed his style, with the genre now {{being the most}} important tourist-oriented style in East Africa. Makonde is both a tribe in Tanzania and Mozambique and a sculptural style. It is known for the high Ujamaas (Trees of Life) made of the hard and dark <b>ebony</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1615, the {{shipwreck}} {{and death}} of governor Pieter Both, who was coming back from India with four richly-laden ships in the bay, led Dutch sailors to consider the route as cursed, {{and they tried to}} avoid it as much as possible. In the meantime, the British and the Danes were beginning to make incursions into the Indian Ocean. Those who landed on the island freely cut and took with them the precious heartwood of the <b>ebony</b> <b>trees,</b> then found in profusion all over the island.|$|R
50|$|From 1666 to 1669, Dirk Jansz Smient {{administered}} the new colony at Grand Port, with the cutting down and export of <b>Ebony</b> <b>trees</b> {{as the main}} activity. When Dirk Jansz Smient left, he was replaced by George Frederik Wreeden. The latter died in 1672, drowned with five other colonists during a reconnaissance expedition. His replacement would be Hubert Hugo. The later {{was a man of}} vision and wanted to make the island into an agricultural colony. His vision was not shared by his superiors, and eventually he could not fully develop his vision.|$|R
50|$|Hugo {{left the}} Republic in December 1671 {{with his wife}} Marie, five {{children}} and fifty soldiers. In February 1673 he arrived on Mauritius, unsuccessful in buying slaves on Madagascar. Hugo noticed the vegetable garden was in a deplorable state. On the first night he hardly slept {{because of all the}} rats walking around in the attic. He organized agriculture quickly and a road was built in order to remove the <b>ebony</b> <b>trees.</b> In February 1674 the island was hit by a heavy storm and all the buildings were destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Gorontalo {{province}} mostly {{consists of}} mountains {{that stretches from}} north to south of the province. Gorontalo Mountains has a beautiful panorama [...] The mountains and forests are homes to unique flora and fauna. Dwarf buffalo, Tarsier, maleo and Babirusa are ones of the rare species that can be found here. Maleo, for example, is a species of bird whose eggs are bigger than its own body. While Tarsier is the smallest primate in the world,with its length of about 10 cm. In the forest are to be found Gorontalo <b>Ebony</b> <b>tree,</b> lingua, Nantu, Meranti, and Rattan.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{exhibits}} several artfully carved {{sculptures of}} ebony by Makonde artists. The Dance of the Shetani by Hossein Anangangola, an artwork of intertwined bodies, is especially elaborately and artfully crafted. The Slave Boat, probably a collaboration of unknown artists, {{is no less}} complex and artful. It is carved out of a massive trunk of an <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> and portrays African slaves and their Arabian prison guards on a boat. A similar work {{can be found in}} the collection in the granary of the nunnery of Heiligkreuztal.The excited Man by Clementi Matei is an example of an abstract figure from the field of Makonde art.|$|E
50|$|Mekoro are {{traditionally}} made by digging out {{the trunk of}} a large straight tree, such as an <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> or Kigelia tree. Modern mekoro, however, are increasingly made of fibre-glass, {{one of the advantages of}} which is the preservation of more of the large endangered trees. Mokoro safaris are a popular way for tourists to visit the delta, much of which is in national parks, but the boats are still a practical means of transport for residents to move around the swamp. The boats are very vulnerable to attack by hippopotamus, which can overturn them with ease. Hippopotamus are reputed to have developed this behaviour after the use of mekoro and other boats for hunting.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} this area settled mostly around Krishnapur Matha. Before the 1970s, much of the area was covered with evergreen forests consisting mostly of <b>ebony</b> <b>trees.</b> The government took over land mostly belonging to Krishnapur Matha and handed it over for rehabitation of evacuee's affected by project of new sea port at Panambur. Many residents of this place were relocated from Panambur, when the New Mangalore Port Trust was established. In 1969 the families situated at Baikampady were rehabilitated at Krishnapur and were given house sites {{at the price of}} 12.5 cents each.|$|R
5000|$|Diospyros blancoi (commonly {{known as}} velvet apple, velvet {{persimmon}} or mabola tree) is a tree {{of the genus}} Diospyros of <b>ebony</b> <b>trees</b> and persimmons. Its edible fruit has a skin covered in a fine, velvety fur which is usually reddish-brown, and soft, creamy, pink flesh, with a taste and aroma comparable to fruit cream cheese. It is native to the Philippines, [...] where kamagong usually refers to the entire tree, and mabolo or tálang {{is applied to the}} fruit. Velvet apple trees are found, but rare, in Sri Lanka too.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the water}} are many {{mangrove}} formations. Oak, <b>ebony,</b> silk-cotton <b>trees</b> and balsa are some trees {{found in the}} dry forests. Around most of the park orchids and bromeliads cover the landscape.|$|R
50|$|Since then, Alvarez has {{primarily}} been a researcher, {{known for}} being the director (2004-2010) of the Centro de Biotecnología FEMSA (FEMSA Center for Biotechnology), a biotechnology research facility {{in the city of}} Monterrey, which he founded. The center mainly develops food and pharmaceutical products (and processes) using a wide tool box that includes genetic engineering strategies, bioprocess engineering, and more classical biochemistry concepts. The Centro de Biotecnología-FEMSA is today one of the most productive research organizations of the Tec de Monterrey system. Recent projects in the CBF include the development of treatments for cancer, diabetes and high cholesterol from plants common in Mexico such as the black bean, the seed of the <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> and native strains of corn. The center has a staff of about one hundred scientists, mostly from Latin America and attracts students from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, the United States, Panama and Venezuela.|$|E
5000|$|Tendu patta, or {{the leaves}} of the Diospyros melanoxylon [...] (an <b>ebony</b> <b>tree</b> with date-like fruit) in which tobacco is rolled to make beedis; is for the poor in this impoverished eastern Maharashtra {{district}} a crucial source of livelihood. Summer when temperatures touch 45 degrees Celsius, is peak earning time for the Madia. Tens of thousands of tribal women and children are engaged in collecting tendu leaves every summer. Women and children get up at 4.30 in the morning and walk towards the forests near their village. In no time the forests are transformed into a beehive of activity, with small armies of women and children plucking tendu leaves with assembly-line precision. The plucking session ends around 11 am and the women and children walk back balancing the weight of the leaves on their heads. Back in their villages, the women sort out the leaves and tie them up in bundles, squatting for hours inside their huts. They do the bulk of the work; it is they who bear the brunt of the hot sun and the drudgery. The day's collection of tendu patta is taken to the market or phad at around 4.30 pm and laid out in long, neat rows that stretch for acres in sun-baked fields or dry riverbeds. Men appointed by private contractors count the bundles and record them in their registers for future payments. Interestingly, the names in the register are those of the men. It is the husbands and fathers of the toiling women and children who claim the money. Although the tendu patta season doesn’t last more than two weeks, each healthy family unit can make a significant earning in this time. Tendu patta thus helps the poor earn enough money to survive the two months before the onset of the monsoons.|$|E
40|$|Parentage {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to evaluate pollen dispersal in ebony (Diosphyros celebica Bakh.). The objectives of this research were to evaluate (i) the dispersal of pollen, and (ii) the distance of pollen travel in ebony Lasitae provenances. The finding of this activities should be beneficial to support breeding of this <b>ebony</b> <b>tree.</b> There were 14 progeny arrays were harvested from 3 female parents. There were 32 ebony trees surrounding the female parents were analyses as the potential male parents for the progenies. Ebony tress were mapped according to their GPS position. All samples were genotyped using four SSR marker loci. Parentage analysis was done using CERVUS version 2. 0 software. Results of the analysis indicated the evaluated markers were effective for assigning candidate male parents to all evaluated seedlings. There is no specific direction of donated pollen movement from assigned donor parents to the female ones. The donated pollens could come from assigned male parents in any directions relative to the female parent positions. Pollen dispersal pattern of ebony female parent occured in outcrossing pollination among its different donated trees. Based on the progenies analysis, ebony female parent is a dominantly outcrossing pollination species. Distances of pollen travel reach to 18 until 236 mete...|$|E
