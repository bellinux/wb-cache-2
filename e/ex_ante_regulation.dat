As per TRAI's press release, the regulator had multiple responses soliciting different opinions {{with respect to}} its consultation paper. Considering all the responses, the regulator decided to have an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> instead of a case by case tariff investigation regime. According to the TRAI this decision was reached {{in order to give}} the industry participants the much needed certainty and in view of the high costs of regulation in terms of time and resources that will be required for investigating each case of tariff discrimination. Ruling prohibits any service provider from offering or charging discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content and also prohibits any agreement or contract which might have effect of discriminatory tariffs for data services or may assist the service provider in any manner to evade the regulation. It also specifies financial disincentives for contravention of regulation. However, the ruling does not prescribe a blanket ban on {{differential pricing}} and provides an exception in case of public emergency or for providing emergency services. Discriminatory tariffs are allowed {{in the case of an}} emergency. Lastly, according to TRAI this ruling should not be considered the end of the net neutrality debate. The regulator has promised to keep a close view on the developments in the market and may undertake a review after two years or at an earlier date, as it may deem fit.|$|E

Although proportionate coexistence is best achieved if regulated in a flexible manner, most implemented coexistence regulations merely rely on rigid measures. Flexible coexistence regulations, however, would reduce the regulatory burden on certain agricultural options and avoid jeopardizing economic incentives for coexistence. Flexibility can be integrated at: (i) the regulatory level by relaxing the rigidity of coexistence measures in <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulations,</b> yet without offsetting incentives to implement coexistence measures; (ii) the farm level by recommending the use of pollen barriers instead of large and fixed isolation distances; and (iii) the national/regional level by allowing diversified coexistence measures, which are adapted to the heterogeneity of farming in the EU.

40|$|In the {{literature}} spatial coexistence {{of genetically modified}} (GM) and non-GM crops is often regarded as a technical challenge, depending on spatial pollen dispersal and cross-pollination, temporal and spatial distribution and interaction of crops, separation distances and practical measures, but the interaction between economic incentives and costs of coexistence is poorly studied. Europe is currently struggling to implement coherent coexistence regulations in all EU Member States. Since {{the publication of the}} European Commission's guidelines in 2003, some Member States have developed, and others are still developing, a diversity of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>ex</b> post liability rules on the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops. In this article, our attention is drawn to <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulations.</b> More specifically, we polarize two alternative ways of regulating spatial coexistence, i. e. rigid minimum distance rules, imposed on GM crop production, versus flexible segregation measures such as buffer zones, leaving more freedom of negotiation between neighboring farmers. We conduct simulations with the software ArcView (R) on a GIS dataset of a hypothetical case of GM herbicide tolerant oilseed rape cultivation in Central France. Our findings show that rigid coexistence rules, such as large distance requirements, may impose a severe burden on GM crop production in Europe. These rules are not proportional to the farmers' basic economic incentives for coexistence and hence not consistent with the objectives of the European Commission. More alarming, we show that in densely planted areas a domino-effect may occur, a theoretical possibility ignored in {{the literature}}. This effect raises coexistence costs and even adds to the non-proportionality of rigid coexistence regulations. Instead, we show that flexible measures would be preferable since they are proportional to the economic incentives for coexistence and, hence, less counterproductive for European agriculture.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{addition}} to penalties imposed for breaches of statutory duties {{in the event}} of workplace accidents involving physical harms, New Zealand’s Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 also provides for penalties where accidents have not occurred. Ordinary negligence rules are ex post in that both an accident and harm must occur before liability accrues, whereas <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> liability rules create liability for deficient care per se. This paper examines whether liability for breaches of duty that do not give rise to accidents have a useful incentive-enhancing role for health and safety decisions by employers in the New Zealand context when used in conjunction with ex post liability rules. We argue that ex post rules by themselves are insufficient to induce appropriate levels of precaution due to the combined presence of weak penalties and considerable uncertainty surrounding the Courts’ required standard of care. Merely augmenting ex post liability with <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> liability, however, is unlikely to induce desirable levels of employer precautions. Further, more strict <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> standards than socially optimal precaution levels may be desirable since inspection probabilities, prosecution rates, and penalties for breaches of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> standards are relatively low, providing some justification for the relatively stringent safety regulations and required standard of care observed in New Zealand.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, several {{countries}} have introduced reverse auctions for allocating universal service or public mission subsidies in various industries. Examples include urban transport, air transport and telecommunications. Recently, such mechanisms {{have also been}} envisioned in liberalized postal markets. Issuing an invitation to tender for obligations in otherwise liberalized markets significantly differs from auctioning off a monopolistic provision of services or goods (competition for the market), as is e. g. the case with spectrum auctions in the telecommunications sector. We discuss the rationale for introducing such a regulatory regime as well as conceptual and practical issues concerning its implementation. It turns out that designing an efficient tender for universal service subsidies in liberalized markets is considerably more difficult than tendering e. g. a monopoly franchise. A first {{reason is that the}} cost assessment is more complex in the former case as future competitive market outcomes have to be anticipated; in the case with franchise bidding, at least the number of competitors is given by the tender itself. Hence, revenue effects caused by competitors are easier to calculate. Second, the threat of a winner’s moral hazard requires more detailed <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulations.</b> These raise the social cost of universal service provision.

40|$|Efforts {{to avoid}} {{punishment}} are socially wasteful. Not {{only do they}} limit the deterrent effect of punishment, but they may actually lead to the paradoxical result that more severe punishment for crime induces more crime. The law has therefore constantly attempted to deter avoidance efforts and has designed various enforcement measures for this purpose. This paper examines the effects of such measures on avoidance and crime. It distinguishes between two general policy tools: <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> (e. g., Pigouvian taxes) and ex post punishment of avoidance. The main results of this paper are that (1) <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation,</b> if feasible, reduces the incentives to engage in avoidance and consequently in crime; whereas (2) ex post punishment of avoidance may induce more avoidance and more crime. The intuitive reason for the latter result is twofold: ex post punishment of avoidance increases not only the costs but also the benefits of avoidance; and avoidance and crime are generally complements. As the control of avoidance through regulation or punishment can be designed into the legal system, {{the results of this}} paper can guide policymaking. They suggest, for example, that recent trends to stiffen penalties for substantially obstructive acts might be counter productive, while imposing liability for avoidance efforts on third, economically-related parties such as lawyers and accountants may be productive in curtailing avoidance, since it acts as an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> for the principal offender. ...|$|E
40|$|Genotoxins, both {{radiation}} and chemical, by their nature have great capacity for creating unintended third-party harms (externalities), which {{are difficult to}} control from a policy standpoint. The difficulties presented by genotoxins stem from 1) the long latency between exposure and the resulting harm; 2) the potential {{that the size of}} the harm might be greater than the capitalized value of its generator (e. g., the Johns-Manville asbestosis cases in the U. S. A.); 3) the inability in many cases to determine the population exposed to the genotoxin and the extent of individual exposures. An additional difficulty that plagues environmental control policies in general, not just those targeted at genotoxins, is the inability to monitor without error. To be effective, policies to control genotoxins must deal with the uncertainty created be these difficulties in order to assure that risk generators (generators, users, and possibly disposers of genotoxins) take the proper level of precaution in their activities. A model of the behavior of risk generators is created to analyze the economic efficiency of alternative policies for controlling external effects of genotoxin use under conditions of the uncertainty. The two broad policy categories examined are <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> (e. g., taxes, operational competency tests, and safety standards) and potential ex post exposure to financial liability for harms. A stochastic simulation of this behavioral model was then undertaken. This analysis gives rise to several unique findings. First, that due to uncertainty an economically efficient level of precaution in the use of genotoxins will not be taken by risk generators when only ex post policy of strict liability is employed. This finding holds for the case of probabilistic causation as well. Second, that if either ex post strict liability with punitive damages or ex post strict liability with an uncertain <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> is used the minimum of the firm's costs will occur at the social optimum, but the firm's loss function will have nonconvexities. Third, given simultaneous use of ex post strict liability with the appropriate level of punitive damages and an appropriate uncertain <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> the global minimum of the firm's costs will occur at the social optimum. Fourth, the use of <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> with ex post liability results in marked nonconvexities at the low levels of precaution. This finding may point to the desirability of using punitive damages as a corrective to strict liability. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E

30|$|On the one hand, ex post {{regulation}} is hindered by the autonomous nature of AI systems, which evolve and change constantly {{according to their}} experiences and learning, in an unforeseeable way [38]. On the other hand, <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>regulation</b> is obstructed by AI applications discreetness (their development requires little physical infrastructure), discreteness (their components can be designed by different subjects, for different purposes and without actual coordination), diffuseness (these subjects can be dispersed geographically and yet collaborate on the same project), and opacity (it can be difficult for outside observers to identify and understand all the features of an AI system) [36].|$|E
40|$|A fast-growing {{literature}} on small open economy models with pecuniary externalities {{has provided the}} theoretical grounds for the policy analysis of macro-prudential regulations and bailouts. Benigno, Chen, Otrok, Rebucci, and Young (2012 a) recently showed that the macro-prudential regulations are desirable if the policy instrument is restricted to capital controls. Using the framework of Jeanne and Korinek (2010), we show that this result depends on the functional form of the collateral constraint which households are faced with. If households collateralize their assets that they purchase {{at the same time}} as their borrowing, capital controls in the form of bailout subsidy during crises can be optimal because they can achieve the …rst best allocation. If, on the other hand, the maximum borrowing is constrained by their assets that they have purchased before they borrow, a stronger case can be made for <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> macroprudential <b>regulations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The EU is {{currently}} struggling to implement coherent coexistence regulations on genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops in all member states. While it stresses that any approach {{needs to be}} “proportionate to the aim of achieving coexistence”, very few studies have actually attempted to assess whether the proposed spatial <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> coexistence <b>regulations</b> (SEACERs) satisfy this proportionality condition. In this article, we define proportionality as a functional relationship which is weakly increasing in the incentives for coexistence. We propose a spatial framework based on an existing landscape and introduce the new concept of shadow factor as a measure for the opportunity costs induced by SEACERs. This enables comparing the proportionality of (i) rigid SEACERs {{which are based on}} large isolation distances imposed on GM farmers versus (ii) flexible SEACERs based on pollen barrier agreements between neighboring farmers. Our theoretical and empirical findings argue for flexibility as rigid SEACERs violate the proportionality condition and, hence, are not consistent with the objectives of the EU...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} {{existing}} microprudential and macroprudential early warning systems (EWSs) {{to propose a}} hybrid class of supervisory models for systemic risk incorporating macro‐and micro‐perspectives {{as well as the}} structural characteristics of the financial system and feedback amplification mechanism. From the financial supervisor’s point of view, an early warning system involves an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> approach to <b>regulation,</b> targeting to predict and prevent crises. Forward‐looking supervisory instruments become more important as the speed and amplitude of financial crises increase. An efficient EWS allows timely <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> policy action and can reduce the need for ex post regulation. The model defines systemic stress in the U. S. financial markets as a signal based on continuous index. The SAFE model monitors micro‐prudential information from systemically important institutions to anticipate build‐up of stress in the financial markets at large. Thus, SAFE presents a toolkit of possible institutional supervisory actions {{that can be used to}} diffuse the build‐up of systemic stress in the financial markets. A hazard inherent for all <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> models is that the model uncertainty may lead to wrong policy choices. To mitigate this risk, SAFE develops two perspectives: a medium term advanced warning model specification, suitabl...|$|R
