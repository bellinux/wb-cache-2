5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able to do <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the airport}} opened, {{services}} started with Widerøe-operated twenty-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bodø–Røst–Værøy–Bodø on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, {{there were two}} weekly trips that connected Værøy to Leknes Airport before returning to Bodø. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Widerøe replaced the Twin Otters with 37-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8s in 1995. The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to public service obligation from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, valid from 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001. Helikopter Service operated the route temporarily until Widerøe took <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> the same year.|$|E
25|$|With no {{two-point}} conversion option (that {{would not}} be adopted by the league until 1993), Cleveland needed two scores to come back. Pagel led the Browns 71 yards to score on his 2-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, cutting the score to 24–23 with 31 seconds left. Cleveland attempted an onside kick, which they failed to recover, but got another chance due to an Oilers penalty. Then the Browns recovered, but had to do <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> due to a penalty against them. Finally on the third try, Cleveland was penalized for touching the ball before it went 10 yards, resulting in a penalty that gave Houston the ball and the win.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants {{are likely}} to move to and live in areas {{populated}} by people with similar backgrounds. This phenomenon has held true {{throughout the history of}} immigration to the United States. Seven out of ten immigrants surveyed by Public Agenda in 2009 said they intended to make the U.S. their permanent home, and 71% said if they could do <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> they would still come to the US. In the same study, 76% of immigrants say the government has become stricter on enforcing immigration laws since the September 11, 2001 attacks ("9/11"), and 24% report that they personally have experienced some or a great deal of discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{has many}} {{geological}} attractions, most being along the coastline of the country. The two most famous geologically important destinations {{are both in}} Co. Clare; the Cliffs of Moher and The Burren. The Cliffs of Moher {{are one of the}} most visited sites in the country, with the rocks at the bottom of the cliffs dated as being about 320 million years old, formed when Ireland was under water during the Carboniferous Period. The Burren was also created during this period. When a tropical sea flooded the south of the country, a buildup of coral (Limestone) began, covering many places in Ireland. When the sea shallowed, rocks such as Sandstone and Shale were deposited over the Limestone, effectively covering <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> The Burren is one of the largest karst landscapes in Europe and is one of the few places in the country where the limestone is visible above ground.|$|E
25|$|Authorized by the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 {{and heavily}} {{backed by the}} federal government, the first transcontinental {{railroad}} {{was the culmination of}} a decades-long movement to build such a line {{and was one of the}} crowning achievements of the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, completed four years after his death. The building of the railroad required enormous feats of engineering and labor in the crossing of plains and high mountains by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and Central Pacific Railroad, the two federally chartered enterprises that built the line westward and eastward respectively. The building of the railroad was motivated in part to bind the Union together during the strife of the American Civil War. It substantially accelerated the populating of the West by white homesteaders, led to rapid cultivation of new farm lands. The Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroad combined operations in 1870 and formally merged in 1885; the Union Pacific originally bought the Southern Pacific in 1901 and was forced to divest it in 1913, but took <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> in 1996.|$|E

25|$|Rams {{defensive}} back Aeneas Williams {{opened up the}} scoring by returning an interception from Favre 29 yards for a touchdown. The next time Green Bay had the ball, they turned <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> when safety Kim Herring stripped the ball from Ahman Green and rookie Adam Archuleta recovered it. However, the Rams were unable {{to take advantage of}} this turnover. A few plays later, Warner's pass was intercepted by Darren Sharper on the Packers 35-yard line. Favre then completed a pair of passes to Corey Bradford and Donald Driver for gains of 27 and 16 yards, before tying the game with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman. But the Rams stormed right back with a 15-yard completion to Az-Zahir Hakim and a 38-yard burst from running back Marshall Faulk advancing the ball to the Packers 11-yard line. Two plays later, Warner completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt to put the Rams back in the lead. Then on Green Bay's next drive, Herring intercepted a pass from Favre and returned it 45 yards to the Packers 4-yard line, setting up a 4-yard touchdown catch by fullback James Hodgins early in the second quarter. Allen Rossum returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Torrance Marshall eliminated the score. Green Bay still managed to score with a Ryan Longwell field goal, but Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins responded with a field goal of his own to give the Rams a 24–10 halftime lead.|$|E

After that, I took <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson went on to explain, [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Stevenage, Boyd earned the {{nickname}} [...] "The White Pelé" [...] – this was down to his use of tricks, {{as well as the}} amount of flair Boyd brought to the team at such a young age. Stevenage manager Graham Westley, who gave Boyd his first run of matches in the first-team, described Boyd as a [...] "special talent" [...] following his two goals away at Woking in August 2005. Westley proceeded to call Boyd [...] "gifted", and a player with [...] "fantastic technical ability". He has been labelled a creative and flamboyant midfielder, and described as [...] "a player who will create goalscoring opportunities all game long". Boyd has stated that he considers assisting goals a [...] "big part of his game", and says [...] "I try to create chances for other players and that gives me just as much pleasure as scoring". Boyd's creative nature is emphasised {{by the fact that he}} has assisted over 50 goals for Peterborough during {{his time at}} London Road. Peterborough United manager Darren Ferguson has said that Boyd [...] "has the tendency, and ability, to score goals from long distance", talking after Boyd's 35-yard volley against Boston United. This was further highlighted when Boyd scored from just inside the opposition's half in a win against Huddersfield Town in October 2012. Boyd collected a Saido Berahino knock-down, before hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the centre circle. Manager Darren Ferguson stated — [...] "If Lionel Messi had done it you'd be seeing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> For vision and execution it was one of the best I have seen". Boyd also scored several long range goals during his time at Stevenage, scoring from outside the area on seven different occasions; most notably on the half-volley from 30 yards in a match against Cambridge United in January 2006.|$|E

If I had to do <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> it would be a simple house burglary." [...] Speck's [...] "final thought for the American people" [...] was, [...] "Just tell 'em to keep up their hatred for me. I know it keeps up their morale. And I don't know what I'd do without it." ...|$|E

The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E

2500|$|Verdi's response, {{which came}} right away was quite blunt: in {{addition}} to complaining of his age, his years of service, and raising other objections, he states: [...] "The conclusion is that all this has cast a chill over this Otello, and stiffened the hand that had begun to trace out a few bars!", but, in total contrast, Boito appears to have simply decided to carry on. Albeit [...] "somewhat disquieted", he immediately proposes [...] "a sort of evil Credo [...] I did... for my own comfort and personal satisfaction, because I felt the need of doing it". On 3 May, Verdi wrote back, calming this down: [...] "Most beautiful this Credo; most powerful and wholly Shakespearian.... it would be well to leave this Otello in peace for a bit.... "we shall {{be able to talk}} <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> and by then with the necessary calm". Boito did visit Verdi in September for three days.|$|E
