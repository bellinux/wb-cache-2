5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards women in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding of the character in his original story.|$|E
5|$|When Philip {{began his}} attack in 349 BC, the Olynthians appealed to Athens for aid. In response, Demosthenes gave {{a series of}} speeches, {{now known as the}} Olynthiacs, {{encouraging}} the Athenians to resist Philip. The period from 351 BC to 346 BC marks the gradual ascendancy of Demosthenes in Athenian politics, as he became leader of the Athenian resistance to Philip. However, exactly when Demosthenes became important is disputed; Cawkwell points out that the chance preservation of a good proportion of Demosthenes's speeches may make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> more important than he was. In the end, the Athenians decided to send a force of 2000 lightly armed mercenaries (referred to in the sources as peltasts, even if strictly speaking, they were not), and 38 triremes to aid the Olynthians. Of these triremes, 30 were already in service under Chares, possibly operating in the north Aegean; the other 8 were to be crewed by Athenians citizens. However, {{it is not clear whether}} this force achieved anything.|$|E

25|$|According to Onstad, Roast Beef is one {{of several}} {{important}} foils to the increasingly central character of Ray. Ray's consistent optimism, sexual bravado, unwavering confidence, privileged upbringing, simple attitudes, and good luck makes <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> on the surface a complete antithesis of character to Roast Beef. Regardless, the two have been close friends since childhood, and it may be observed that as the strip progresses, each occasionally adopts the attitudes and perspectives of the other. The two do, of course, have a few points of dissent: Roast Beef is somewhat more sympathetic to Little Nephew than his Uncle Ray, and has taken issue with Ray's alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Lange {{was called}} to the Wannsee Conference by Heydrich in January 1942. Lange (an SS major) was the lowest-ranking officer present. Heydrich viewed Lange's {{first-hand}} experience in conducting the mass murder of deported Jews as valuable for the conference. Instead of Lange, Heydrich could have invited either Karl Jäger or Erich Ehrlinger, who commanded the SiPo and SD in Lithuania and Belarus respectively, and were responsible for similar massacres. He chose Lange because Riga was the main deportation destination, and because Lange's doctorate made <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> more intellectual {{than the other two}} men. Lange's superior, Franz Walter Stahlecker, was not invited, as he was not familiar with the realities of the Jewish deportations and was not located in Riga.|$|E
25|$|Seleucus {{was the son}} of Antiochus. Historian Junianus Justinus {{claims that}} Antiochus was one of Philip II of Macedon's generals, but no such general is {{mentioned}} in any other sources, and nothing is known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus' mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is known of her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents. Seleucus was born in Europos, located {{in the northern part of}} Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Philip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule. Seleucus' year of birth is unclear. Justin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appianus tells us Seleucus was 73 years old during the battle, which means 354 BC would be the year of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. This is most likely propaganda on Seleucus' part to make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> comparable to Alexander.|$|E

Hoshino drew Allen with longer hair, and {{found it difficult to}} decide on a hairstyle. In the end, she parted his hair in the center to emphasize his facial expressions. According to Hoshino's first editor, Allen was originally going to be a modified Akuma who looked like a boy. She was advised by her editor to make Allen cry to make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> more vulnerable.|$|E

[...] Not only Presley's achievements, but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus: ...|$|E
500|$|After Naughty Dog {{presented}} Crash Bandicoot to Sony's Japanese division, {{the executives}} of Sony Computer Entertainment Japan stated their dislike {{of the character}} and were unimpressed by the renderings of the character made specifically for the meeting. During a break following the initial meeting, Andy Gavin approached Charlotte Francis, the artist responsible for the renderings, and gave her fifteen minutes to close Crash's huge, smiling mouth to make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> less aggressive, change his eyes from green to [...] "two small black [...] "Pac-Man" [...] shapes" [...] and make his spike of hair smaller. Sony Japan bought Crash Bandicoot for Japanese distribution after being shown the modified printout.|$|E

Though the Vulture is not a favorite of Elliot's, he commented that the episode made <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> [...] "pretty cool;" [...] he went on to praise the voice cast, including Englund's performance as Vulture. Like Goldman, Elliot commented favorably on the animation style and nods to classic comic stories and said that it had a [...] "bit for every level of Spider-man fan." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2010, composer Hans Zimmer confirmed {{that he would be}} returning to score The Dark Knight Rises. James Newton Howard was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of Inception would make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> like a [...] "third wheel". Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a [...] "completely different direction" [...] for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules—applying his [...] "musical conscience", as he called it. In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov's use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> conservative compared with later composers like Igor Stravinsky, though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.|$|E

Rawson-Jones felt that Mahone {{had turned into a}} [...] "gibbering, sweating wreck most of the time", with only [...] "occasional glimpses" [...] of his brilliance. Robert Bianco of USA Today said that although Fichtner was a welcome addition to the cast, he could not compensate for the [...] "harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show." [...] Dehnart called Mahone the best new character of the second season, but remarked that his ability to move from various locations in {{a short amount of time}} made <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> to possess [...] "the power of super fast transportation." ...|$|E
500|$|Naughty Dog gave Drake a {{very strong}} personality, as {{they did not want}} him to act blandly. He often thinks out loud, and {{comments}} and complains on the absurdity of his situations, a tendency Matt Casamassina of IGN called [...] "lighthearted and amusing". Drake's appearance is generic, usually appearing in a plain shirt and jeans. This was to make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> like an [...] "ordinary guy". Throughout the series, he has various romantic interests. In the first game, there is tension between him and Elena Fisher, a reporter filming a documentary on his findings. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Drake enters an affair with his crime partner Chloe Frazer. However, by the course and end of the game, he has become involved with Elena Fisher again and by [...] he marries her.|$|E
500|$|Stannard {{concludes that}} beneath his public mask, Waugh was [...] "a {{dedicated}} {{artist and a}} man of earnest faith, struggling against the dryness of his soul". Graham Greene, {{in a letter to}} The Times shortly after Waugh's death, acknowledged him as [...] "the greatest novelist of my generation", while Time magazine's obituarist called him [...] "the grand old mandarin of modern British prose" [...] and asserted that his novels [...] "will continue to survive {{as long as there are}} readers who can savor what critic V. S. Pritchett calls 'the beauty of his malice'". Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview, [...] "What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything.

500|$|Lars Larson, {{the first}} {{interview}} subject, was infuriated after seeing the finished program. He had {{been led to believe}} that the episode would present a far more positive picture of American gay life. Larson, whose interview had been altered to make <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had some rather nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I had no problem with Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. But obviously others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality. They saw it {{as a threat to the}} human race and were out to kill as best they could." [...] Jack Nichols was fired from his job as a hotel sales manager the day after the program aired.|$|E
500|$|Cheryl Caira, Rosemary Goring and Anne Johnstone {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The Herald, and describe Halperin's experiences in the book as [...] "certainly entertaining, and at times scandalous". Ben Widdicombe of New York Daily News notes Halperin [...] "received the most offensive response imaginable" [...] when he asked a Scientology official who Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard would have voted for in the 2008 United States presidential election; according to Halperin, he asserted he spoke with a recruiter for Scientology, [...] "He said, 'I can tell you who shouldn't be President - Barack Obama, Condoleezza Rice and the Rev. Al Sharpton. They {{should not be allowed}} to run for office, they should be sweeping the office.'" [...] A review of the book in The Independent comments that the YouTube links provided throughout the book [...] "have the effect of making virtually everyone who tries to help <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> nice while presenting Halperin as an unscrupulous creep".|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{watched the}} episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010, and {{also found that}} the {{character}} of Jameson was [...] "thoroughly unlikable". He described Rohner as [...] "acting like a Muppet when he's supposed to be elderly and weak, then laying on the over-heated angst once his youth is restored". Overall he felt that the main characters were sidelined in the episode, and so it was difficult to be involved in what went on. He gave the episode a grade of C+. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation in June 2007. She said that the plot seen in [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] involving an [...] "Evil Admiral" [...] was one which had been more commonly seen on The Original Series such as Commodore Decker in [...] "". She too criticised the makeup used on Rohner, but said that his acting became more [...] "modulated, but then both Karnas and the actor playing <b>him</b> <b>seem</b> over-the-top by comparison".|$|E
