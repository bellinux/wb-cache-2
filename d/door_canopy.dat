5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "Federal Hill," [...] John Keim house, 504 Hanover Street, Fredericksburg, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, ca. 1927. Rupert Brooke, {{governor}} of Vigirnia, 1794-1796 {{and founder of}} the national Federal party, purchased this house and named it [...] "Federal Hill." [...] Today is a private residence with door and <b>door</b> <b>canopy</b> replaced ...|$|E
50|$|They {{are built}} of Pennant stone {{in an early}} Georgian style. The pantile hipped roof has lateral and ridge stacks. There is an oculus over the central doorway, however most of the windows are 20th century replacements. It has scroll-bracketed <b>door</b> <b>canopies</b> at {{irregular}} angles.|$|R
50|$|Important {{features}} include the exterior <b>canopy,</b> windows and <b>doors.</b> The <b>canopy</b> is concrete with a brick support column, while {{the windows are}} large plate glass with aluminum frames, placed in several groupings.|$|R

50|$|The Herman Coors House {{was once}} the home of Herman Frederick Coors. It was {{originally}} built as a modest bungalow in 1915 by Elmer Johnson, a builder who later in 1934 built the brewhouse of the Coors Brewery. In 1917 the house was purchased by Coors, a younger son of Adolph Coors, who hired noted area architect Jacques Benedict to transform it into a beautiful and artistic Tudor Revival style home, with a wooden arch front <b>door</b> <b>canopy</b> and stone terracing around. Coors was {{an officer of the}} Coors Porcelain Company, and in 1921 moved away to Inglewood, California where he established the H.F. Coors Company to manufacture porcelain there. The house was then purchased by banker Edward A. Phinney, who owned the Rubey National Bank in downtown Golden. He built a companion cottage and barn behind the house in 1928. His fortunes took a tragic turn, however, during the Bank Holiday of the Great Depression, when he lost much of his fortune trying to save the bank. Since that time the home has remained very well and artistically preserved.|$|E
50|$|Various {{models of}} the Batmobile used in the {{production}} of the Batman films make use of the <b>canopy</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of the Cyclone's stylistic features, {{the bubble}} top canopy {{was the most}} prominent. Silver coated for UV protection, the canopy {{automatically}} opened along with the sliding electrically operated <b>doors.</b> The <b>canopy</b> could also be stowed in the rear compartment, where it rested on a special air-bag base.|$|R
50|$|The concept Volkswagen 1-litre car, VW 1L, uses a <b>canopy</b> <b>door.</b> The 2013 {{production}} {{version of}} this concept used butterfly doors.|$|R
50|$|It {{was further}} {{developed}} into the production Sports 800 {{but without the}} sliding canopy. The concept featured 1 <b>canopy</b> <b>door</b> that slides backward.|$|R
50|$|A <b>canopy</b> <b>door</b> {{is a type}} of {{door that}} sits on top of a car and lifts up in some way, to provide access for passengers. It is similar to an {{aircraft}} canopy. There are no set standards to canopies, so they can be hinged at the front, side or back - although hinging at the front is most common. <b>Canopy</b> <b>doors</b> are rarely used on production cars, but are frequently used on the 'closed' variants of Le Mans Prototype endurance race cars. They are also sometimes used on concept cars.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle canopy is a {{rarely used}} type of door for cars. It has no {{official}} name {{so it is}} also known as an articulated canopy, bubble canopy, cockpit <b>canopy,</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>door,</b> or simply a canopy. A canopy is a type of door which sits on top of a car and lifts up in some way, to provide access for passengers. It is similar to an aircraft canopy. There are no established sub-types of canopies, so they can be hinged at the front, side, or back, although hinging at the front is most common. <b>Canopy</b> <b>doors</b> are rarely used on production cars, and are sometimes used on concept cars.|$|R
25|$|Dog {{handlers}} have {{fully enclosed}} utility or station wagon vehicles, {{which may be}} liveried or unmarked, with cages in the rear and remotely operated <b>canopy</b> <b>doors</b> to allow the handler to release their dog if away from the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The Lamborghini Egoista has {{a unique}} one-seat cockpit, {{which is similar to}} that of a modern fighter jet, and has a <b>canopy</b> <b>door</b> that is {{completely}} removable. The steering wheel must be removed to enter and exit the vehicle like F1.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, smaller {{personal}} luxury cars were a growing trend, following {{the success of}} the Cadillac Seville. Pursuing this idea, the Lambda / Sapporo featured frameless <b>door</b> glass, <b>canopy</b> vinyl roofs, velour interiors, [...] "luxury" [...] wheel covers with whitewall tires, and every possible power accessory inside. A common color combination was bright burgundy with white vinyl. A thick stainless steel targa band {{at the rear of the}} roof completed the look, influenced by the Ford Thunderbird.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than the}} Purvis Eureka (a {{licensed}} {{copy of the}} Nova) and the Bond Bug, the Nova is the only production car to date to use a front-hinged <b>canopy</b> <b>door.</b> The windscreen has small A-pillars {{so it looks like}} a conventional car when the canopy is closed.|$|R
50|$|Glass-reinforced {{plastics}} {{are also}} used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate, <b>door</b> surrounds, over-door <b>canopies,</b> window canopies and dormers, chimneys, coping systems, and heads with keystones and sills. The material's reduced weight and easier handling, compared to wood or metal, allows faster installation. Mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels {{can be used in}} the construction of composite housing, and can include insulation to reduce heat loss.|$|R
5000|$|Rabari made by Rabaris of the Giri region, with {{prominent}} patterns {{adopted from}} mythology {{are made in}} several shapes embroidered with [...] "square chain interlaced with buttonhole" [...] stitches fixed with mirrors, it is unlike another any other embroidery of Kutch. Khadi material in maroon colour is used as the fabric to make <b>door</b> hangings, <b>canopies,</b> wall decorations, etc. It is also said that Rabaris of Kutch reportedly migrated from Sindh in the 14th century and brought their traditional style with them and developed a regional style which was a composite style unlike other types then in vogue in Kutch. The mochi embroidery style with [...] "chin stitch and parrot circle" [...] patterns influenced their styles.|$|R
25|$|The XP-47B was of {{all-metal}} construction (except for the fabric-covered {{tail control}} surfaces) with elliptical wings, {{with a straight}} leading edge that was slightly swept back. The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy and the pilot's seat was comfortableâ€”"like a lounge chair", as one pilot later put it. The <b>canopy</b> <b>doors</b> hinged upward. Main and auxiliary self-sealing fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of 305U.S. gal (1,155L).|$|R
5000|$|Seen {{from the}} front, the middle {{part of the}} {{building}} is taller, with the two sides spreading symmetrically; the design emphasizes vertical lines with simplicity and modernism. In addition, cornices, <b>doors</b> and windows, <b>canopies</b> and hallway are decorated with simplified traditional Chinese patterns. There are more than 3,400 seats in the hall, which is equipped with automatic voting systems and translation devices. The hall is fully air conditioned, a very modern feature {{at the time it was}} built.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{moisture}} damages {{have been}} noticed in rendered, undrained stud walls. The design {{is built on}} the principle one-stage tightening which {{means that there is}} no air gap in the construction. The damages have occurred when water has permeated through the rendering in leaking connections and fittings for windows, <b>doors,</b> <b>canopies,</b> balconies, terraces and awnings. Behind the plaster carrier, which consists of either polystyrene or rigid mineral wool, plasterboard has often been used as a wind protection barrier. In many cases the wind protection barrier and the underlying wooden studs have been exposed to mould and in some cases even rot. It has been shown that damp in the structure is difficult to dry out. The aim of the thesis has been to examine how the energy consumption is affected when this type of construction is damp, partly because energy is required to dry up damp, partly because the insulation ability for a material decreases when it is affected by moisture. Previous research and relevant literature has been used in this thesis, to provide: A comprehensive picture of the problem, an explanation for the calculations used and an understanding of the conclusions drawn. The energy consumption has been calculated for 1 m 2 wall area on two types of wall designs. The calculations have been performed in both dry and damp condition. To calculate the energy consumption in damp condition, three different types of calculation models have been used in three different ways. Since no measurements have been made, the calculations are to some extent based on assumed values. The amount of damp that have entered the structure has, according to the calculation models used, been shown to produce small differences in energy consumption compared to the dry structure. The main problem for these types of walls seems instead to be the growth of microorganisms. Nevertheless, the microorganisms seem not to have affected the indoor environment in any significant manner...|$|R

50|$|Pininfarina was {{inspired}} for this design by the French made Matra Bagheera {{from the early}} 1970s. One of the particularly unusual details about this car is the cockpit door, which bears resemblance to the cockpit doors of fighter aircraft. The conventional two doors, windscreen and {{the better part of}} the roof found on an average car, have been transformed into a single opening <b>canopy</b> <b>door.</b> Another feature is the complete lack of driving mirrors, there is an LCD screen mounted behind the steering wheel, which shows the driver a rear view from inside the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Church of St. Walfroy. The {{church was}} rebuilt in 1957 (architect M. Poirier), while {{incorporating}} the apse {{of the old}} church. Its exterior shape reminds the pilgrim of a shelter-tent. The interior pillars and frames evoke the Ardennes forest. Above the <b>door,</b> a large <b>canopy</b> of Gaudin: it symbolizes the struggle between good and evil, of the faith against 'Idol Arduina, Marais' highest Church in the storm. It contains the tombstone of Canon Couvert. A broken slab is {{all that remains of}} the location of the tomb of St Walfroy, destroyed by war and lost.|$|R
