50|$|The {{internal}} space charge field, via the <b>electro-optic</b> <b>effect,</b> causes the refractive {{index of the}} crystal {{to change in the}} regions where the field is strongest.

50|$|The <b>electro-optic</b> <b>effect</b> is {{a change}} of the optical {{properties}} of a given material {{in response to an}} electric field. There are many different occurrences, all of which are in the subgroup of the <b>electro-optic</b> <b>effect,</b> and Pockels effect is one of these occurrences. Essentially, the Pockels effect is the change of the material’s refractive index induced by an applied electric field.The refractive index of a material is the factor by which the phase velocity is decreased relative to the velocity of light in vacuum. At a microscale, such a decrease occurs because of a disturbance in the charges of each atom after being subjected to the electromagnetic field of the incident light. As the electrons move around energy levels, some energy is released as an electromagnetic wave at the same frequency but with a phase delay. The apparent light in a medium is a superposition of all of the waves released in such way, and so the resulting light wave has shorter wavelength but the same frequency and the light wave’s phase speed is slowed down.|$|E
