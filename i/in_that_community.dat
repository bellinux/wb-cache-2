5|$|In 1966, {{before a}} tour by the New Zealand rugby team, the South African {{government}} asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding Māori players); the New Zealand Rugby Football Union refused and cancelled the tour. As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>community.</b> The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, {{by then the}} secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances. Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket. Efforts to put pressure on the International Cricket Conference (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.|$|E

The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51%of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed {{in part to a}} snowstorm that kept people inside and in part to the large African American population <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>community.</b> Of the top 10media markets in terms of viewership, four were in North Carolina, two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland, with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership.

The highway returns to its northerly course when it turns to run along Clarwin Road, which runs along the Clare–Gladwin county line. The roadway angles to the northwest briefly, cutting across the extreme northeast corner of Clare County as the highway crosses into Roscommon County. Through the southern portion of the county, the road runs through the Roscommon forest management unit of the Au Sable State Forest as it approaches Prudenville. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>community,</b> M-18 turns northeasterly and runs along M-55 along the eastern shore of Houghton Lake. The two highways separate on the eastern edge of town, and M-18 turns northward, intersecting the northern end of M-157.

East of the naval lab, the two roadways split for the parkway's six-ramp interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway). There is no direct access from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound I-495 or from southbound I-495 to the eastbound parkway. The parkway roadways come together in Cabin John just west of parking areas accessible from the eastbound direction to C Canal Lock 10 and C Canal Lock 8 and River Center.

[...] His support of the Quaker exemption brought him a potent support base <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>community</b> in London. [...] In 1735 Belcher presided over a meeting in Deerfield at which the Stockbridge Indians agreed to accept Congregationalist missionaries and authorized the erection of a mission house.

[...] Individuals who lack immunity, primarily those who choose not to vaccinate, free ride off the herd immunity created {{by those who are}} immune. [...] As the number of free riders in a population increases, outbreaks of preventable diseases become more common and more severe. Individuals may choose to free ride for a variety of reasons, including bandwagoning or groupthinking, social norms or peer pressure, religious beliefs, the perceived effectiveness of a vaccine, mistrust of vaccines or public health officials, and believing that the risks associated with vaccines are greater than those associated with infection. Individuals are more likely to free ride if vaccination rates are high enough so as to convince a person that he or she may not need to be immune since a sufficient number of others already are. If large numbers of people in a community free ride, herd immunity <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>community</b> is lost.|$|E
