Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards.

5|$|The assault started around 16:00. The left column {{suffered}} significant casualties, but reached Fort 74, {{only to be}} met by Polish reinforcements dispatched by General Antoni Wroniecki, {{the commanding}} officer of this sector. Two thousand Russians clashed with less than 850 Poles inside the fort, but were defeated in a bayonet charge and had to retreat. As the attack failed and the Polish artillery batteries were still active, von Toll decided to use his cavalry reserves. Two regiments of the 3rd Cuirassier Division (1,200 cavalry) followed a road linking Szczęśliwice and Czyste, and were ordered to charge the Polish artillery from behind. The Poles had full visibility of the battlefield and <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> {{to prepare for the}} attack, as the Russian advance slowed down due to swampy terrain. When the Russian cavalry switched from columns to battle line, Polish artillery opened canister shot fire on the Russians, dispersing them. The Russian commander reorganised his forces and repeated the charge, but the Russians were again repelled before reaching the Polish artillery emplacements. The Novgorod Cuirassier Regiment alone lost over 200 men out of 450 taking part in the charge.|$|E

It is a matter of debate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if he was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he would not have <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to undertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his secondment.|$|E

30|$|Also in Table  4, we {{summarize}} teachers’ self-report {{data from}} the survey on prompts related to <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to plan for all their content areas, to plan for mathematics or science instruction, to investigate additional resources, and to meet with other teachers about mathematics or science instruction. The first of these factors is significant for both mathematics and science, such that specialists {{are more likely to}} report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to plan for all of the subjects they teach. It is important to recognize that, even for these specialists, the mean is low, less than 3 for both content areas on a 1 – 6 scale. In mathematics, EMS are significantly more likely to report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to plan for their mathematics instruction. Although not statistically significant, specialists also are more likely to report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to investigate additional resources related to their mathematics or science instruction. Thus, the specialists’ indications of having more specialized content-focused planning time and the affordances that this provides are supported by the self-report survey data.|$|R
25|$|With {{the series}} at 2–1 {{leading into the}} Fifth Test in Sydney, Lawry struck 151 in the first innings after Australia were sent in to bat. The hosts made 619 and took a 340-run first innings lead, but their {{cautious}} captain let his team bat until they reached 8/394 to declare with a lead of 734, making 17 runs himself.

Lawry had expected a pace onslaught after Australia's last trip to the Caribbean had ended in defeat, but Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith had begun to slow down, taking their wickets at an average over 40.|$|E
25|$|Nearly half {{a century}} after Elagabalus, Aurelian came to power. He was a reformer, {{strengthening}} {{the position of the}} sun-god as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon; he even built a brand new temple, in Rome, dedicated to the deity. It's also thought likely that he may have been responsible for establishing the festival of the day of the birth of the unconquered sun (Dies Natalis Solis Invicti), which was celebrated on December 25, the day when the sun appears to start rising again - four days after having previously reached its lowest point, though the earliest surviving reference to the festival is in the Chronography of 354. He followed the principle of one god, one empire; his intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they could believe in without betraying their own gods. Lactantius argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time,</b> but Aurelian only managed {{to hold on to the}} position of Emperor for five years.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of recuperating from Eylau, Napoleon ordered the Grande Armée on the move once again. Learning that the Russians had encamped at their {{operational}} base {{in the town of}} Heilsberg, by the Alle River, Napoleon decided to conduct a general assault in the hopes of dislodging what he thought was the rearguard of the Russian army. In fact, the French ran into the entire Russian army of over 50,000 men and 150 artillery guns. Repeated and determined attacks by the French failed to dislocate the Russians, who were fighting inside elaborate earthworks designed to prevent precisely the kind of river crossing Napoleon was attempting. French casualties soared to 10,000 while the Russians lost about 6,000. The Russians eventually withdrew from Heilsberg as their position became untenable, prompting Napoleon to chase after them once again. The French headed in the direction of Königsberg to gain additional supplies and provisions. On June 13, the advance guard of Marshal Lannes reported seeing large numbers of Russian troops at the town of Friedland. Both sides engaged one another {{for the remainder of the}} day with no result. Crucially, Bennigsen believed he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to cross the Alle the following day, to destroy the isolated units of Lannes, and to withdraw back across the river without ever encountering the main French army.|$|E

25|$|As {{the network}} had {{thirteen}} months until its contract with KDFW ended—on July 1, 1995—to {{find a new}} affiliate in the Metroplex, CBS <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to seek other stations {{to reach an agreement}} with. The network first approached NBC affiliate KXAS-TV; however, its then-owner LIN Broadcasting ultimately declined CBS's offer. WFAA was eliminated as an option as its owner during that time, Belo, would reach a new long-term agreement with ABC for its Dallas flagship station and other ABC-affiliated stations that the group owned. This left KTVT, an independent station, as CBS's only viable option in the Dallas–Fort Worth market for it to affiliate with a VHF television station. The two parties would come to a deal on September 14, 1994, when Gaylord Broadcasting reached a ten-year affiliation agreement with CBS to transfer the network to KTVT (Gaylord and CBS also signed an affiliation agreement in which KSTW in Tacoma, Washington, also an independent station, would replace KIRO-TV as the CBS affiliate for the Seattle market). Time Warner, majority owner of The WB, filed several lawsuits in attempts to block the Gaylord-CBS affiliation deal and enforce an alleged contract with Gaylord to affiliate with The WB. The WB later reached an agreement with KDAF, which Fox Television Stations had announced it would sell in order to affiliate KDFW with the Fox network; KXTX-TV, in the meantime, agreed to serve as The WB's Metroplex charter affiliate in a temporary arrangement until the sale of KDAF to Renaissance Broadcasting and Fox's subsequent move to KDFW was finalized.|$|E

One of the collaborators was French DJ and producer Martin Solveig, who was invited to a writing session by Madonna in London in July 2011. Originally, Madonna wanted to work with Solveig on one song, but eventually it turned into three tracks—"Give Me All Your Luvin", [...] "I Don't Give A", and [...] "Turn Up the Radio". In an interview with Billboard, Solveig explained that Madonna <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> for the project, hence after working on one song, they continued recording.

500|$|Post-production was {{severely}} delayed when Gilliam {{disagreed with the}} Weinsteins over the final cut privilege. In the meantime, the conflict lasted so long that Gilliam <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to shoot another feature film, Tideland. To create the visual effects, Gilliam awarded the shots to Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio he founded in the late-1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston. However, two months into filming, Houston said that Peerless [...] "ran {{into a number of}} major issues with The Brothers Grimm and with the Weinstein Brothers". He continued that [...] "the main problem {{was the fact that the}} number of effects shots had dramatically increased, mainly because of issues that arose during shooting with the physical effects." [...] Meanwhile, the Queen's chamber inside the tower was actually built by the Art Department as 2 sets. One set was resplendent and new while the other was old and decrepit. The sets were joined to each other by the central mirror, a piece of transparent glass giving the illusion that a single set was reflected and used to create the effect.|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie.

The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.|$|E
500|$|The Tour {{came down}} to the stage 20 time trial in Grenoble. While Evans was {{certainly}} the stronger of the two in the event, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial in the 2010 Tour de France and there was speculation as to whether the Luxembourger <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> in hand to win the Tour with his 57-second cushion. They were the last two riders on the course, and rode diametrically different time trials. About an hour earlier, Tony Martin had set a dominant best time, finishing more than a minute better than any other rider in the field. Evans rode one of the best time trials of his life, seconds off Martin's pace at each time check and only seven seconds the lesser of him at the finish line. Schleck's ride was unremarkable, ceding two and a half minutes to Evans by finishing 17th on the day. What had been speculated to be a close challenge ended up being no challenge at all [...] Evans took the race lead by over a minute and a half. Since the Tour's final stage is largely ceremonial and not competitive for the overall classification, the time trial clinched the Tour for Evans, the first Grand Tour win in Evans' long top-level career that had featured three previous podiums and six previous top-tens. All nine BMC riders reached the Tour's finish. Evans' triumph meant that Hincapie set a new record as the only man ever to ride on nine Tour-winning squads.|$|E
500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I knew {{that it was going to}} be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I think that may have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E

500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E
