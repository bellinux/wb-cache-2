60|$|Yet {{nothing could}} keep off the dreaded subject, {{and even at}} table, Lance's disappointing {{deficiency}} in schoolboy voracity became {{the cause of a}} lamentation over his brother's small appetite, and an examination of Robina, resulting in her allowing that Felix seldom gave himself time to do more than snatch a crust of bread {{in the middle of the}} day, and did not always make up for it at tea-time. Mr. Froggatt shook his head and looked distressed, and his good lady went on discoursing about the basin of soup she always used to keep prepared for him, evidently longing, though not quite daring, to send a lecture to Wilmet on taking care of her brother. But what made more impression on both the children was, that after they had been into Mr. Froggatt's little conservatory with him, and had received into their charge a basket of camellias, violets, and calycanthus, with a pot of jonquils in the middle for Geraldine, the old gentleman said, as he bade them good-bye, 'Tell your sister, that if she thinks a day or two of laying by would be good for your brother, I should be ready and glad to change places with him. A little change might take away his cough; and I don't like his looks--no, <b>I</b> <b>don</b> <b>t.</b> He ought to be careful;' this to himself, with a long sigh.|$|R
40|$|The {{struggle}} that rages just now centers on two ideas: piracy and property. My aim {{in this book}} s next two parts is to explore these two ideas. My method is not the usual method of an academic. <b>I</b> <b>don</b> <b>t</b> want to plunge you into a complex argument, buttressed with references to obscure French theorists however natural that is for the weird sort we academics have become. Instead I begin in each part {{with a collection of}} stories that set a context within which these apparently simple ideas can be more fully understood. The two sections set up the core claim of this book: that while the Internet has indeed produced something fantastic and new, our government, pushed by big media to respond to this something new, is destroying something very old. Rather than understanding the changes the Internet might permit, and rather than taking time to let common sense resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those most threatened by the changes to use their power to change the law and more importantly, to use their power to change something fundamental about who we have always been. We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because most of us really believe in these changes. We allow it because the interests most threatened are among the most powerful players in our depressingly compromised process of making law. This book is the story of one more consequence of this form of corruption a consequence to which most of us remain oblivious...|$|R
40|$|Conducting mediatization {{research}} {{is no easy}} task. Linked with this term {{is not only the}} idea that media have a certain 'specificity', which as such exerts an 'influence' on culture and society: the term also implies a process of change. But how can we find a practical approach to mediatization research when the time we live in is shaped by the 'mediation of everything'? How can we carry out this kind of analysis if the focus is not to be merely on any one single media - the television, the mobile phone, the social web - but all different kinds of media in their entirety? These questions are the departure point of this article, which has the aim to develop a transmedial approach of mediatization research. I start with a short review of two of the main traditions of mediatization research. This builds the foundation for an understanding of mediatization that focuses on the 2 ̆ 2 communicative figurations 2 ̆ 2 through which we construct our 2 ̆ 2 mediatized worlds 2 ̆ 2. Such a conceptualisation makes it possible to re-theorise mediatization research from a diachronous and synchronous perspective. In order to develop this kind of argument, it is necessary to clarify the underlying understanding of 'media'. When I use this term in the following, <b>I</b> <b>don</b> <b>t</b> mean 2 ̆ 2 primary media 2 ̆ 2 like, for example, language or acting theatre. Also I don't have 2 ̆ 2 generalised 2 ̆ 2 media in mind - like money, love or power. In contrast to this, all my arguments refer to technical communication media, i. e. the various kinds of media we use to extend our communication possibilities beyond the here and now: television, the (mobile) phone, the social web, and so forth...|$|R

40|$|SO WHAT IS AN RFI? IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I {{learned about}} back when I started my project {{management}} career {{with my first}} large construction firm. I learned {{how to use these}} forms as a convenient and effective means of documenting the many legitimate clarifications needed on a major project. However, like most other young engineers, I also learned to use the RFI as a weapon in the ongoing battle between owners. or their designer and the construction contractors. Recently, our project team has done a few simple things to greatly reduce the waste and frustration that comes from this type of battle. The RFI form can be a great tool if used properly, and <b>I</b> certainly <b>don</b> <b>t</b> recommend that they be eliminated entirely. The RFI form was created to document the many clarifications that are commonly required on projects. Typically, the contractor uses {{the top half of the}} form to clarify-or request permission to vary from-the contract documents. The bottom half of the form is used to record the answer. But this seemingly simple process is plagued by a number of problems. From the contractor s perspective, RFIs are needed to secure information that should have been in the contract documents in the first place. The missing information keeps their crews from working effectively, and it makes hitting already demanding cost and schedule targets even more difficult. Owners, or their design firms, often view the RFI as a means of harassment. Both sides of the issue have legitimate complaints, and both sides cause most of their own pain...|$|R
40|$|Thanks. This {{is a very}} Interesting paper. In some 20 {{years of}} {{counseling}} undergraduates {{we went through the}} process of trying to give weight to these things. This little paper formalizes the process! Two comments-I. The biggest question in my experience was what special weight should be given to Freshmen for the imponderable of adjustment to college life. a. finding out how to use study time efficiently. b. establishing criteria for value judgments on ~!Household Production$lf as there were so many activities competing for time. II. In the students judgement of the value of better grades or more courses [...] he must consider his over-all educational ob~ectives. It may well be that a part of the value of part-time work is that it contributes to the ob~ectlves in a large way- so, a new criterion for value of work may be needed to arrive at MPP. Example: work on experimental plots by agronomy major, etc. Dlffmences In regressions for lower and upper classmen are interesting. Lldybe the students who failed to adjust credit load m Lower Div. were the ones who pulled down G. P. A. for group and they are highly represented in the numbers missing at U. Div. level.
