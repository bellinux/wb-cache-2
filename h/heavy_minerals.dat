40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> content of Miocene to Pleistocene {{sequences}} drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 174 A on the New Jersey Shelf. Sandy intervals recovered from Holes 1071 A, 1071 F, 1072 A, and 1073 A were sampled for <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> analysis. Because of the low core recovery of the sandy parts of the succession, sampling has been incomplete. In spite of the resulting restriction and because of major variations in <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> assemblages, eight distinct <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> associations could be defined. The data presented thus considerably extend the present knowledge on the lithology of the stratigraphic record as described by Austin, Christie-Blick, Malone, et al. (1998).

Sands with a <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> suite characteristic of the marine province extend more than 11 km into the estuary, suggesting that {{the lower part of}} the estuary is being filled by marine sands. The results of this study suggest that routine <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> analysis of sands in estuaries may have much practical importance to those interested in predicting the long term directions of dispersal of sands that may be dumped in the estuary as a consequence of dredging activity...|$|R
25|$|Being ancient {{stranded}} dune systems, the tonnage of most deposits is {{in excess}} of several {{tens of millions of}} tonnes to several hundred million tonnes.

25|$|Heavy mineral sands are placer {{deposits}} formed most {{usually in}} beach environments by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains.

40|$|Amphorae sherds {{from the}} Laecanius {{workshop}} of Roman Istria (10 – 5 B. C. and 78 A. D.), Croatia, were studied by integrating archaeological and geological techniques including fabric analysis, thin-section petrography, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> analysis. The {{fabric of the}} sherds showed distinctive characteristics, permitting their classification and allocation into nine fabric groupss. Petrography revealed that quartz is the dominant clastic component, whereas carbonate is common as temper; XRD provided information on firing temperatures that ranged between 750 and 900 °C. The sherds contain diverse <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> suites with generally high epidote and garnet proportions; zircon is occasionally important. Garnet/epidote ratios {{and the presence of}} diagnostic species (pyroxene, hornblende) showed systematic variations that coincided with similar variations in fabric characteristics. <b>Heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> signatures of amphorae produced in other workshops proved essential in differentiating them from Laecanius sherds. A comparative <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> analysis of terra rossa samples from the vicinity of the workshop indicated that terra rossa was the major source for the paste. Differences observed in the <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> composition of the sherds and terra rossa were interpreted by the spatial heterogeneity of the latter and the mixing of the paste with sandy temper. Fresh Adriatic sponge spicules in the majority of Laecanius sherds and the temper-derived, generally immature <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> assemblages suggest that sandy deposits from the Adriatic were used for the clastic temper...|$|R

25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because <b>heavy</b> <b>minerals,</b> {{if they are going}} to be too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{exploration}} and mining of modern-Tertiary <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> beach and raised beach sands {{along the west}} coast of South Africa has developed into a major industry. High resolution radiometric techniques have demonstrated their use as a quantitative indicator of total <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> concentration (THM) and also have the ability to discriminate between sediments derived from different provenance terrains. Results indicate {{that it is possible to}} calculate the total <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> concentration from high resolution radiometric measurements, but the ability to quantify the concentration of individual mineral fractions, such as ilmenite, requires further refinement of the method. Radiometric characteristics of the light mineral fraction made it possible to distinguish between sediments from mixed marine-aeolian palaeoplacers and active present beach placers. The effects of in situ alteration of the ilmenite fraction in the palaeoplacers were also reflected by subtle contrasts in the radiometric character of the deposits. Furthermore, the uniform radiometric character of the sample population indicates a common provenance for the <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> suite and supports previous results which indicate the metamorphites of the mid-Proterozoic Namaqua Province as the primary source terrain. The high resolution radiometric techniques discussed offer a broad spectrum of applications in sedimentology and have the potential to aid <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> exploration. With further refinement it can possibly be used quantitatively in grade control during mining and beneficiation of <b>heavy</b> <b>mineral</b> deposits...|$|R
