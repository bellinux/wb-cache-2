The unabridged version can be consulted, on request, at the University of Leicester’s David Wilson Library. The study attempts to define the problems arising from mineral land working in relation to after-use and to record the methods of assessment and treatment. The small Coalbrookdale Coalfield contains examples of most problems likely to be found in areas formerly subjected to intensive mineral working. Furthermore it is now an area of wholesale redevelopment for the new town or Telford. Ensuring the safety or these new developments has involved much documentary research and site investigation and this study records both the general aspects and describes some case histories. The problems involved in the study are concerned with the determination of the geology in detail, both stratigraphically and structurally, in relation to topography, mineral exploitation and industrial history. Other aspects of industrial activity which affect the development potential of the land's surface such as waste heaps, abandoned communication systems, disturbed natural drainage and disused massive structures are also considered. A general survey of the extent of dereliction and of the various definitions of 'derelict land' and of its causes is discussed. Underground mining has been carried out extensively for coal, <b>ironstone,</b> <b>clay</b> (both fireclay and brick and tile clays) and limestone {{and to a lesser extent}} for fullers earth and sandstone. In addition all these minerals have been heavily worked by surface methods as have the igneous and other 'hard' rocks, marl, sand and gravel, and the useful products of the mine waste heaps, shale (both weathered and burnt) and slag. It has also been found necessary to study the much smaller extractive industries of bitumen, pyrites and salt, since their working has produced cavities and shafts in unexpected positions. The geology of each mineral, the extent, methods and age or workings, and the effect of such workings upon the surface are studied together with the special problems associated with each mineral and their possible restraints on future development. A comprehensive study is made of the development restraints which result from past and present mineral working, the methods or assessment and manner of treatment. Past land reclamation activities, which have been applied patchily and with little or no control, can themselves form a restraint to development. The methods used in the past were not sufficiently developed to ensure that all potential causes of instability were removed. Adequate preliminary site investigation is shown to be of paramount importance when considering development and the methods and extent of investigation required and the type and form of reports to be produced are outlined and discussed. The general restraints resulting from mineral working are described under the following headings: Shafts, wells and gas emission; Shallow mineworkings, adits and subsidence: Opencast mining, quarries and ground settlement; Spoilheaps, lagoons and fires; Drainage, water supply, soughs and other tunnels. Examples or each are given as case histories and site investigation and treatment methods outlined. Special consideration is given to the methods used in dealing with disused mineshafts, or the use of opencast mining as a means of land reclamation and of the problems caused by present day quarrying, underground working and general tipping activities. Natural phenomena such as landslips and geological faults also form restraints to development. The occurrences and types of landslip are examined with a view not only of determining their cause and of defining their limits but of determining means by which they can be anticipated and controlled. 	Investigations are also described which have been carried out to locate geological faults and to assess the stability implications due to their presence on development sites. Two special studies carried out include;- (1) the use of geophysical methods as aids to site investigation and their application to mineral evaluation, location of faults, shallow workings and mineshafts; and (2) the policy of preservation of features of geological, industrial and mining interest is discussed. The problems associated with preservation, recording, identifying, selecting and ensuring that retention is compatible with both public safety and future planning are outlined. A number of recommendations are given which it is believed would assist if in the future it is decided to carry out a similar land reclamation/new town development scheme elsewhere...|$|E

5000|$|The {{church was}} {{constructed}} in the Doric style of the period, {{in the form of}} a Greek cross (i.e. legs of equal length), with walls nearly 1.5m (five feet) thick, constructed of unusually large kabok (<b>clay</b> <b>ironstone)</b> with coral and lime plaster. [...] The high roof in the middle of the building resembles a dome and was originally arched with brick and roofed in blue Bangor slate roof tiles surmounted with a brazen lion. This lion had a crown on its head, bearing a sword in one hand and seven arrows in the other, representing the seven united provinces of the Dutch Republic. In 1856, a bolt of lightning destroyed the lion and seriously damaged the dome. The roof was later replaced with an iron covering. The church is capable of seating 1,000 persons.|$|R

Below Neath, a [...] branch left the main line at Court Sart to connect to a tramroad serving the collieries at Eskyn. Although there are no figures for the tonnage carried, apart from a mention of 90,000 tons of coal in 1810, receipts increased from £2,117 in 1800 to £6,677 in 1830. Subscribers had paid a total of £107.50 for their shares, and dividends were paid from 1806, rising from £2 in 1806 to £18 in 1840.

40|$|Predictive linear {{regression}} (LR) modelling between bioaccessible arsenic (B-As) {{and a range}} of total elemental compositions and soil properties was executed in order to assess the potential for developing a national B-As dataset for the UK. LR indicates that total arsenic (As) is the only highly significant independent variable for estimating B-As in urban areas where it explains 75 - 92 % of the variance. The broad compatibility of the London, Glasgow and Swansea regression models suggests that application of these models to estimate bioaccessible As in UK soils impacted by diffuse anthropogenic urban contamination and non-ferrous metal processing should be relatively accurate. In areas dominated by Jurassic <b>ironstones</b> and associated <b>clays</b> and limestones, total As, P and pH are significant, accounting for 53, 14 and 5 %, respectively, of the B-As variance. Models based on total As as the sole predictor in the combined Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary ironstones datasets explain about 40 % of the B-As variance. The median As bioaccessible fraction (%As-BAF) is 19 to 28 % in the anthropogenic contamination impacted urban domains, but much lower (5 - 9 %) in geogenic terrains dominated by ironstones. Results of this study can be used as part of a lines of evidence approach to localised risk assessment but should not be used to replace bioaccessibility testing at individual sites where local conditions may vary considerably from the broad overview presented in this study...|$|R
40|$|This Sheet Description {{provides}} {{an account of}} the geology of the district covered by Geological Sheet 153 Wolverhampton. The district extends {{from the edge of the}} Black Country conurbation in the south-east, to Telford in the west, and includes a large tract of rural Green Belt on the Staffordshire–Shropshire borders. The solid rocks at outcrop range from Precambrian to Triassic in age. The oldest rocks, pyroclastic tuffs, originated in an island-arc setting in south polar latitudes; the youngest are continental red-beds that formed in inland sabkha environments, when Britain lay just north of the equator. Although the geological record spans about 560 Ma, the modern landscape has been shaped largely by geological processes that operated during the last two million years. Successive glaciations have modified the landscape, and the superficial deposits of till and glacial outwash that blanket much of the district are the product of a Late Devensian glaciation. The Ironbridge Gorge and other meltwater channels also date from this period. Since the ice retreated about 13 000 years ago, the postglacial history has been one of drainage development, valley incision and terrace aggradation. The district has a long industrial heritage dependent, until recently, on the mineral wealth of the Carboniferous rocks exposed in the South Staffordshire and Coalbrookdale coalfields. During the 18 th and 19 th centuries, settlements grew and prospered as industries were established, founded on a plentiful supply of coal, <b>clay,</b> <b>ironstone</b> and limestone. The relicts of these industries have left parts of the district with a legacy of difficult ground conditions, aspects of which are described in the applied section of this report. Today, mineral extraction is of less importance but brickclay, fireclay and some opencast coal are still produced, and the Triassic conglomerates are an important source of aggregate. The Permo–Triassic rocks of the Stafford Basin hold important groundwater resources from which large volumes of water are abstracted for public supply...|$|R
