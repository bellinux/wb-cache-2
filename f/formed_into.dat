5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical wave that {{moved across the}} Atlantic, and <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression on October 29. Convection increased, and the system <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, reaching its peak strength as a Category 4. One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of 1942, the ZNDH flew some 4,800 sorties, of which 30% were combat missions, with 35 {{aircraft}} being lost.

By {{the end of the}} year the ZNDH aircraft park consisted of 191 aircraft, <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> 14 squadrons.|$|E

50|$|On August 26 a Tropical {{disturbance}} {{developed in}} the Western Pacific Ocean to the northeast of Saipan and was designated as a minor tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency early that day.

On August 27 the JTWC reassessed the disturbances chances of <b>forming</b> <b>into</b> a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as fair and then later that day upgraded the disturbances chances of <b>forming</b> <b>into</b> a significant tropical cyclone as good and issued a tropical cyclone formation alert.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E

5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E

5|$|Agamemnon {{was part}} of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder's fleet {{cruising}} off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward. The British ships <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> line of battle, with Agamemnon fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. Agamemnon had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her mizzen topmast and the foresail yard. By nightfall, Calder's fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the legions {{underwent}} these transformations, the auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the auxilia had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as turmae (for cavalry alae) and centuriae (for infantry cohortes). Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> either an ala quingenaria of 512 horsemen, or an ala millaria of 1,000 horsemen. Likewise, infantry auxilia could be <b>formed</b> <b>into</b> a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.|$|E
