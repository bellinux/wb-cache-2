40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the rules {{used by the}} Bank of Israel (BoI) to set the interest rate from mid- 1993 {{till the end of}} 2001, after relative price stability had been achieved. Our approach follows the analytical framework developed since the influential contribution of Taylor (1993). We compare three policy type rules: the classic Taylor type, the interest rate parity type and the domestic real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>type.</b> We give a positive answer to the question; can the path of the interest rate in Israel be explained by a well-defined policy rule? And conclude that the BoI followed a strict, forward-looking rule with smoothing based on interest rate parity considerations, including strong reaction to exchange-rate shocks. The success of reducing inflation by applying extremely tight monetary policy is exemplified in the Israeli case although our analysis shows that the disinflation process was not fully completed in the sample period, {{in the sense that the}} rate of interest did not return to a steady state level consistent with low inflation and low real rates of interest.

In the next period mainly internal sources will be taken into consideration, both for the reduction of the costs with the internal debt and for the reduction of the foreign currency course risk belonging to the governmental debt. The main objective of the governmental debt is represented by its maintenance in the sustainable limits and ensuring the sources necessary for the financing the budget deficits and the payment resources of the debt Â´ service at the lowest acceptable risk.

40|$|The CMBS {{market has}} been in {{existence}} since the mid 1980 s; however, {{it was during the}} mid 1990 s that the market began to grow. A combination of favorable interest rate environment, entry of new players in the market and the amount of demand for commercial real estate assets, led to a record US CMBS issuance in 2004, with the 2005 outlook being even better. However, the subordination or credit enhancement level of these securities has been on a downward trend since 1995. The thesis attempts to analyze the risk factors such as loan to value ratio, debt service coverage ratio, floating versus fixed rate, large and conduit deal types, as well as diversification factors (property type and geographic location), and their impact on subordination levels. Finally, market forces such as spreads on CMBS are also analyzed for their influence on subordination levels. For the analysis, data were collected on 430 commercial mortgage backed securities issued from 1995 through mid 2005. The information was obtained from Trepp, which tracks all the commercial mortgage backed securities issued in the market. The trend in subordination levels of each of the tranches or bond classes was analyzed over the period of study and a quantitative regression analysis was performed to analyze the influence of the above mentioned factors on the subordination levels. (cont.) The results indicate that the loan to value ratio, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> (fixed versus floating) and the deal type (conduit and large loans) {{have a significant impact on}} the subordination levels. Also, certain other market factors, including the spread differential between CMBS and corporate bonds, strong property market performance, increased liquidity and increased number of investors may also have influence the subordination levels of these securities. by Romina Padhi.

40|$|This {{article is}} a reprint of a lecture - given in honor of Homer Jones - that {{examines}} {{the causes of the}} Long Boom. John B. Taylor defines the Long Boom from 1982 to the present - as the period of time in which the United States has known unprecedented economic stability. This period includes the first and second-longest peacetime expansions in American history, separated by one relatively short and mild national recession. Taylor explores the internal changes in the structure of our economy, as well as external shocks and economic policy. He also discusses the reasons for the change in monetary policy. Monetary policy, he concludes, deserves most of the credit for the Long Boom because current policymakers have been more aggressive in responding to inflation, thereby keeping inflation low and recessions relatively rare. Taylor shows that the type of monetary research encouraged by Homer Jones at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis placed renewed emphasis on the difference between the real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> This <b>type</b> of research sought numerical guidelines for using monetary statistics to make policy, and was responsible - at least in part - for changing monetary policy.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} possible {{consequences of the}} adoption of a single monetary policy for five European housing markets. It brings together comparative housing research and research on optimum currency areas. The research addresses two issues. First, it assesses whether real house price cycles will become synchronised following the convergence in nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Secondly, it explores the implications of stability in nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and low inflation in the Euro-zone for the stability of real house prices in the member-countries. The existing members of the European Union are grouped according to characteristics of the transmission mechanism by which changes in <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> translate into changes in house prices. These elements comprise monetary policy developments (i. e. the level and volatility of <b>interest</b> <b>rates),</b> <b>type</b> (i. e. fixed or variable) of mortgage rates, house price movements (i. e. volatility of house price cycles) and the degree of countriesâ involvement in such exchange rate arrangements as the âsnake in the tunnelâ and ERM. One the basis of these criteria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and Spain are selected as case studies and time period covers 1972 (when the âsnakeâ was established) up to and including 1999 (the year in which EMU was launched). The approach adopted in the research allows for consideration of the transmission mechanism in the context of structural changes in systems and policies that determine housing demand and supply. Therefore, the thesis investigates macro-level trends drawing on secondary sources, statistics as well as interviews with informed commentators and key actors. The analysis is conducted in the following order: first, for each case study country, the importance of monetary policy for house price changes is examined, and secondly, the possible impact of a single monetary policy on economic convergence and synchronisation of house price cycles across the countries is investigated. The research suggests that the adoption of the single monetary policy per se is unlikely to lead to significant synchronisation of real house price cycles because the relationship between changes in <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and changes in real house prices is likely to continue to differ across the countries. The pursuit of a single monetary policy might not ensure economic convergence between the countries either, and in this case differnces in GDP fluctuations would lead to the divergence of real house price cycles. The study also demonstrates that recent developments in the systems and policies that determine housing demand and supply might lead to an increase in house price volatility in all countries bar Germany. It concludes that countries need to manage their housing markets using non-monetary instruments {{regardless of whether or not}} they are within EMU. These measures might help reduce the likelihood of asymmetry in economic developments in EMU arising from the importance of changes in the housing markets to economic developments.

Of especial importance are liquidity and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk because of the perceived trade-off that exists between them. This complicates the funding of a bank. To manage the liquidity and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risks effectively requires a comprehensive analysis to ensure that they are properly understood. The causes, origins, inter-relationships with other risks and the measurement of risk are investigated thoroughly. The management of these risks is then examined. With regard to risk management, it is especially important not to focus on anyone risk in isolation, but to manage the multiple risk profile bearing in mind their interrelationships. All the risks a bank is exposed to are ultimately reflected in capital risk. Stringent capital requirements are imposed upon banks and these are being phased in over the period to 1995. Consequently capital risk is also investigated. The relationship that exists between liquidity risk and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk is investigated. Ways and means to separate these two risks are examined to try and manage them separately. In this way each of these two risks can be managed within acceptable norms. To achieve this goal, the use of the traditional funding instruments, modified funding instruments and derivatives are examined. Each of these are investigated and applied to the funding of a bank. The yield curve is investigated as one of the ways to explain the term structure of <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The different <b>types</b> of yield curves and the meaning of each are dealt with.

However, this is a significant decrease in automobile loan rates charged by banks participating in within-market mergers, a finding consistent with economies of scale in the origination of automobile loans. The paper also tests for the existence of leader-follower relationships in loan pricing and finds that it is more widespread in markets for automobile loans. <b>Interest</b> <b>rates</b> on both <b>types</b> of loans respond asymmetrically to a change in equivalent maturity Treasury security rates, being more sensitive to a rise than a fall.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stationary}} characteristics of computed real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> with nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation for 22 OECD countries. Using quarterly data over the 2000 â 2010 period, LM unit root test is employed which endogenously determines {{up to two}} structural breaks in level and trend. The empirical findings suggest a combination of stationary and nonstationary results for real <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation. Besides, the internal stationarity or nonstationary interactions of real and nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are investigated by inflation. The results indicate that stationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation cause stationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> At the same time nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation could cause a stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> with respect to cointegration. Stationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> cause to nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> while nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and stationary inflation could cause stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> </p...|$|R

Domestic investors earn negative excess returns on low <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currency portfolios and positive excess returns on high <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currency portfolios. Because high <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currencies depreciate on average when domestic consumption growth is low and low <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currencies appreciate under the same conditions, low <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currencies provide domestic investors with a hedge against domestic aggregate consumption growth risk.
