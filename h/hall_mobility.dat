50|$|Nanosolar and International Solar Electric Technology (ISET) unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to scale up}} this process. ISET uses oxide particles, while Nanosolar did not discuss its ink. The advantages of this process include uniformity over large areas, non-vacuum or low-vacuum equipment and adaptability to roll-to-roll manufacturing. When compared to laminar metal precursor layers, sintered nanoparticles selenize more rapidly. The increased rate {{is a result of}} the greater surface area associated with porosity. Porosity produces rougher absorber surfaces. Use of particulate precursors allows for printing on a large variety of substrates with materials utilization of 90% or more. Little research and development supported this technique. Nanosolar reported a cell (not module) efficiency of 14%, however this was not verified by any national laboratory testing, nor did they allow onsite inspections. In independent testing ISET's absorber had the 2nd lowest efficiency at 8.6%. However, all the modules that beat ISET's module were coevaporated, a process which has manufacturing disadvantages and higher costs. ISET's sample suffered most from low VOC and low fill factor, indicative of a rough surface and/or a high number of defects aiding recombination. Related to these issues, the film had poor transport properties including a low <b>Hall</b> <b>mobility</b> and short carrier lifetime.|$|E
50|$|NREL {{developed}} another {{process that}} involves three deposition steps and produced the current CIGS efficiency record holder at 20.3%. The {{first step in}} NREL's method is codeposition of In, Ga, and Se. This is followed by Cu and Se deposited at a higher temperature to allow for diffusion and intermixing of the elements. In the final stage In, Ga, and Se are again deposited to make the overall composition Cu deficient. Würth Solar began producing CIGS cells using an inline coevaporation system in 2005 with module efficiencies between 11% and 12%. They opened another production facility and continued to improve efficiency and yield. Other companies scaling up coevaporation processes include Global Solar and Ascent Solar. Global Solar used an inline three stage deposition process. In all of the steps Se is supplied in excess in the vapor phase. In and Ga are first evaporated followed by Cu and then by In and Ga to make the film Cu deficient. These films performed quite favorably {{in relation to other}} manufacturers and to absorbers grown at NREL and the Institute for Energy Conversion (IEC). However, modules of Global Solar’s films did not perform as well. The property in which the module most obviously under-performed was a low VOC, which is characteristic of high defect density and high recombination velocities. Global Solar’s absorber layer outperformed the NREL absorber in carrier lifetime and <b>hall</b> <b>mobility.</b> However, as completed cells the NREL sample performed better. This is evidence of a poor CIGS/CdS interface, possibly {{due to the lack of}} an ODC surface layer on the Global Solar film. Disadvantages include uniformity issues over large areas and the related difficulty of coevaporating elements in an inline system. Also, high growth temperatures raise the thermal budget and costs. Additionally, coevaporation is plagued by low material utilization (deposition on chamber walls instead of the substrate, especially for selenium) and expensive vacuum equipment. A way to enhance Se utilisation is via a thermal or plasma-enhanced selenium-cracking process, which can be coupled with an ion beam source for ion beam assisted deposition.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrical}} and Hall effect measurements reveal that all Zn 3 N 2 samples grown at different N 2 /Ar ratios have n-type conductivity. The carrier {{concentration of the}} films increases {{with the increase in}} N 2 flow rate during the deposition from ~ 1018 to 1021  cm− 3. A summary of the carrier concentration and <b>Hall</b> <b>mobility</b> of the grown samples is shown in Table 2. The highest <b>Hall</b> <b>mobility</b> and carrier concentration were found for the sample grown at N 2 /Ar ratio of 0.60. By further increasing the N 2 /Ar ratio, the carrier concentration slightly reduces but the <b>Hall</b> <b>mobility</b> is reduced 300 %.
