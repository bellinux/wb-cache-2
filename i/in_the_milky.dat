5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way.

This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation.

40|$|Abstract. Several {{properties}} of the M 31 disk, namely: opacity, extinction law and gas-to-dust ratio are studied by means of optical and near-infrared photometry of ten globular clusters and galaxies seen through the disk. The individual extinctions of these objects were estimated with respect to several sets of theoretical spectral energy distributions for globulars and galaxies. Seven targets are consistent with reddened globulars, two- with starburst galaxies and one-with an elliptical. The extinction estimates agree with semi-transparent disk (τV � 1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inter-arm regions. The total-to-selective extinction ratio in those regions 2. 75 ± 0. 1 is lower on average than the typical Galactic value of RV = 3. 1. We also obtained a gas-to-dust ratio, similar to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> way. It shows no correlation with {{the distance from the}} M 31 center...|$|R
