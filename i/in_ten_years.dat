5|$|The {{northern}} pintail {{has a large}} range, estimated at , and a population estimated at 5.3–5.4 million individuals. It is therefore not believed to meet the IUCN Red List threshold criterion of a population decline of more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations, and is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|A {{change in}} the {{location}} of his job meant that Headley moved to the Lucas Cricket Club in 1929. He visited America and played some exhibition matches for the Jamaican Athletic Club in New York, scoring a century against a touring team from Bermuda; his parents had moved to America by then, which enabled Headley to combine the cricket with {{his first visit to}} his parents <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, {{he played}} for the Royal High School former pupils team, gaining a {{reputation}} as a fast and courageous forward. He earned selection for Edinburgh, and on 2 December 1899 played in the Inter City game against Glasgow: {{it was the first time}} <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> that Edinburgh beat Glasgow. He was also a keen oarsman, rowing with the East of Scotland Rowing Club of Leith.|$|E
5|$|Both Pyrrhocorax {{species have}} {{extensive}} geographical ranges and large populations; neither {{is thought to}} approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations), and they are therefore evaluated as being of Least Concern. However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.|$|E

It was the club's fourth league title <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> and third under the management of José Mourinho. The other Community Shield place went to Arsenal, who defeated Aston Villa by four goals to win the 2015 FA Cup Final and retain the trophy.

5|$|Construction {{on the new}} ten-floor, $150 million {{building}} {{located in}} Lower Manhattan began in 1989. The new building was designed by the architectural firms of Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Cooper, Robertson & Partners. When it opened in 1992, the building was New York City's first new high school building <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> and, at the time, was the costliest high school building ever built in the city.|$|E
5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> and 80% over 25 years. The output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3% {{during the first year}} of operation.|$|E

5|$|In the sparsely {{populated}} area where Item moved ashore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years,</b> with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5million (1950USD, $ USD). The strong winds sank 20ships, and although there were no reports of casualties, Item caused 15injuries. Communications were disrupted across the region, and downed trees blocked roads. Near Tuxpam, the winds damaged large areas of banana plantations.|$|E
5|$|Kefalas also {{sponsored}} {{legislation to}} create an Economic Opportunity/Poverty Reduction Task Force, which he chaired following the regular session. The committee's objective is to develop plans to reduce Colorado's poverty rate by half <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years,</b> examining {{a broad range of}} issues from economic development to education to transportation to tax policy, and it considered potential legislation on topics ranging from {{the earned income tax credit}} to rent control.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough has an {{extensive}} though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10millionsquare kilometres (0.4–3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat {{if it has a}} small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations). None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The modern city of Ashdod {{city was}} built outside the {{historic}} settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan. The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of {{ten to fifteen}} thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. The original plan also called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|The red-billed chough has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{geographical}} range {{of at least}} 10millionkm2 (3.8millionmi2) and a large population including an estimated 970,000–2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but {{there is evidence of}} an overall increase. This owl is not believed to meet the IUCN Red List criterion of declining more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern. This species has expanded its range in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Ukraine, and populations are stable or increasing in most European countries. Declines have occurred in Finland, Estonia, Italy and Albania.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} has a large, {{currently}} unquantified range; its world population is also unknown, but includes an estimated 52–96 million individuals in Europe. Although population trends {{have not been}} evaluated, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30% <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> or three generations). For these reasons, the species' conservation status is evaluated {{at the global level}} as being of least concern.|$|E
