The paper argues that {{it is precisely the}} extremity of “near death” experiences of full-blown AIDS, and the profound stigma and “social death” associated with the later stages of the disease, that produce the conditions for AIDS survivors’ commitment to “new life” and social activism. It is the activist mediation and re-telling of these traumatic experiences that facilitates AIDS activist commitment and grassroots mobilisation.

Several recurring problems in identifying potential examples of reciprocal altruism are discussed, including the assumption that restraint is an act of altruism and the misclassification of “generational mutualisms, ” in which individuals helping to raise young are “repaid ” one generation later by the offspring they assisted in raising. No definite case of reciprocal altruism is currently known in birds, but examples in which this phenomenon may be involved include helping behavior in a few cooperative breed-ers and communal feeding in several taxa including gulls, jays, and juncos...|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen both a {{significant}} shift in EU state aid policy towards a more sophisticated economic approach and a great enrichment of the economic literature on state aid. This paper examines the control of state aid in the EU {{in the light of}} the new literature. It begins with a discussion of the objectives of state aid control, taking account of the principle of subsidiarity. We discuss whether state aid control should concentrate on limiting the effects of aid on trade and competition (i. e. harm to rivals) or whether the purpose is broader and includes also considerations such as avoiding government failures and encouraging Member States to use state aid more sparingly and target it more efficiently. This leads to a brief analysis of how the appropriate welfare standard to be applied in state aid control would vary according to the weight given to different objectives. The paper then considers the objectives pursued by governments in granting aid with particular emphasis on the concept of market failure. The nature and magnitude of the market failure addressed by a state aid, together with the design of the aid, will strongly influence the extent of any anti-competitive effects. The last two parts (4 and 5) of the paper are devoted to specific problems of assessing anti-competitive effects using the types of information normally available to the aid-granting authorities and the European Commission. Part 4 discusses the problem of assessing the effects on competition of aid schemes and broad classes of aid, when the beneficiaries and even the affected markets are not known. Because Member States grant a vast number of <b>individual</b> <b>aids</b> every year, the Commission has to apply simple criteria to screen out those aids that are unlikely to have significant anti-competitive effects. We survey a range of indicators that can be used for this purpose and conclude that they all have drawbacks. Part 5 deals with the problems of assessing individual awards of aid which have failed the screening test, discussing how the main characteristics of firms (e. g. market share, vertical integration) and markets (such as product differentiation and market growth) may influence a state aid's impact on competition.

40|$|Conveyor belt {{cropping}} is a cropping principal that {{is characterized}} by the plants being placed in one end of the cropping area and then transported along it throughout their development. When they reach the end of the cropping area, they are fully grown and ready for harvesting. Along the cropping area there are areas where work with the plants is done. There are several advantages in using such a system. The work environment is better because the climate can be adjusted to the wishes {{of the people in the}} work areas and because <b>individual</b> <b>aids</b> can be installed. The labour requirement is reduced because work that was done earlier is no longer required and work efficiency increases thanks to the improved climate. The utilization of the cropping area increases when movable tables are installed instead of rolling tables and because there are possibilities to space plants gradually. Since the movable cropping areas with plants is one single unit, the need of transport in the firm is reduced. Some transport inputs can be omitted. The work organization is simplified because there are fewer plants in the same size category and since the batches are more numerous. This enables the usual working peaks, for instance at harvest, to be avoided. A continuous production is achieved which makes the grower less sensitive to temporary price changes in the plants grown and decreases the losses when the crop is changed. The biological advantages are that the cropping area can be split in different climates and that the climate can be adjusted to the stage of plant development. There are some requirements for conveyor belt cropping: - Uniformity in the development of plants. - The harvest time must be quite short. - Cropping areas must be movable and there must be transport equipment to move the areas. To get uniformity in development and a short harvest time the cropping must be close to the biological optimum. Therefore only one kind of plant should be present on the cropping area at the same time. This is because few crops have the same demands on environment. The plants must be genetically defined and free from diseases. During the winter the cropping will be run with inputs of carbon dioxide and illumination. Conveyor belt cropping is especially suited to crops which react uniformly to management inputs, for example in order to initiate flowering. Chrysanthemum belongs to these. Other suitable crops for conveyor belt cropping are plants with only vegetative development, for example lettuce and Hedera. To optimize the use of the cropping area a production plan ought to be prepared which considers the variation in cropping time during the year. Because the plants are moved during the cropping and the cropping time varies with radiation, the empty space after harvest can not always be filled up. A model capable of optimization will calculate how many plants are needed in the cropping area for maximum utilization. Crops with short harvest time and with slight variation in cropping time during the year are the ones best suited to conveyor belt cropping. The report ends with a description of the cropping, equipment and production planning at some growers. When better models of cropping and development are available, the possibilities to controll the crops will increase and more kinds of plants will become suitable for conveyor belt cropping. There are also good opportunities to automate the cropping system to reduce human labour inputs...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which {{incontinence}} aids, used in local authority/municipal nursing homes, were adapted to the resident’s urine-leakage volume and to find out how nurses perceived the current situation concerning individual testing of incontinence aids in municipal nursing homes. The study method was a quantitative empirical study and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was a weighing test, carried out in three nursing homes, whereby the incontinence aids used by 25 residents during a 48 hour period were weighed. The second phase was the completion of a questionnaire by the municipal nurses working in the same local authority. The questionnaire covered: the division of responsibilities; routines for testing incontinence aids, and the level of knowledge concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing. Only 22 % of the pads used during the observation were properly adapted to the patients’ urinary leakage volume, while 76 % of incontinence aids were larger than necessary in relation to the real volume of urinary leakage. The municipal nurses, who have a key role and formal responsibility for <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, considered that there was insufficient knowledge within the organisation concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and that the division of responsibilities in this area was unclear. There were great variations relating to the extent of the nurses’ involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and the nurses stated that increased involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing was dependent on more time being made available for this task.

For <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> workers, findings from the present research can be used to normalise stress and disseminate information on the range of commonly used coping styles.

Sharing common stressors has been beneficial in other sectors including the disclosure of traumatic incidences among health practitioners (Farrington 1995).

40|$|Background: A multidisciplinary, {{evidence-based}} {{care program}} {{to improve the}} management of depression in nursing home residents was implemented and tested using a stepped-wedge design in 23 nursing homes (NHs) : " Act in case of Depression" (AiD). Objective: Before effect analyses, to evaluate AiD process data on sampling quality (recruitment and randomization, reach) and intervention quality (relevance and feasibility, extent to which AiD was performed), {{which can be used}} for understanding internal and external validity. In this article, a model is presented that divides process evaluation data into first- and second-order process data. Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data based on personal files of residents, interviews of nursing home professionals, and a research database were analyzed according to the following process evaluation components: sampling quality and intervention quality. Setting: Nursing home. Results: The pattern of residents' informed consent rates differed for dementia special care units and somatic units during the study. The nursing home staff was satisfied with the AiD program and reported that the program was feasible and relevant. With the exception of the first screening step (nursing staff members using a short observer-based depression scale), AiD components were not performed fully by NH staff as prescribed in the AiD protocol. Conclusion: Although NH staff found the program relevant and feasible and was satisfied with the program content, <b>individual</b> <b>AiD</b> components may have different feasibility. The results on sampling quality implied that statistical analyses of AiD effectiveness should account for the type of unit, whereas the findings on intervention quality implied that, next to the type of unit, analyses should account for the extent to which <b>individual</b> <b>AiD</b> program components were performed. In general, our first-order process data evaluation confirmed internal and external validity of the AiD trial, and this evaluation enabled further statistical fine tuning. The importance of evaluating the first-order process data before executing statistical effect analyses is thus underlined. © 2012 American Medical Directors Association, Inc...|$|R
