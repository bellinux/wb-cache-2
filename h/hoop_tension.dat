When a compressive force is applied in the knee joint, a tensile force is transmitted to the menisci. The femur attempts to spread the menisci anteroposteriorly in extension and mediolaterally in flexion. Shrive et al. further studied {{the effects of a}} radial cut in the peripheral rim of the menisci during loading. In joints with intact menisci, the force was applied through the menisci and articular cartilage; however, a lesion in the peripheral rim disrupted the normal mechanics of the menisci and allowed it to spread when a load was applied. The load now was distributed directly to the articular cartilage. In light of these findings, it is essential to preserve the peripheral rim during partial meniscectomy to avoid irreversible disruption of the structure's <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> capability.|$|E

In this test, a ring {{extracted from the}} tubes is placed over two D-shaped mandrels that are then parted {{with the aid of}} a testing machine. A detailed numerical investigation was performed to establish the validity of this test. In particular, the effect of the friction and of the radial through-thickness stresses that are induced due to the contact between the ring and the die was examined in detail. It was discovered that in a well-controlled test, these effects are comparable or lower to testing of a tube by hydraulic inflation which is a reliable method for obtaining the hoop properties of tubes. After the numerical investigation, a series of ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> tests were performed on Al- 6061 -T 4 tubes. Three-dimensional Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to capture the strain evolution in the gage section of the specimens. By comparing the hoop with the axial response, the material anisotropy of the Al- 6061 -T 4 tubes was established. As a further step, a series of notched ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> test specimens were designed and tested.

Tissue engineered bioscaffolds may be a treatment option for meniscal incompetency, and ideally would possess meniscus-like extracellular matrix (ECM) and withstand meniscal tensile hoop strains. Synovium may be a useful cell source for meniscal tissue engineering because of its natural role in meniscal deficiency and its in vitro chondrogenic potential. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare meniscal-like extracellular matrix content of hyperconfluent synoviocyte cell sheets (“HCS”) and hyperconfluent synoviocyte sheets which have been <b>tensioned</b> over wire <b>hoops</b> (<b>tensioned</b> synoviocyte bioscaffolds, “TSB”) and cultured for 1 month. RESULTS: Long term culture with tension resulted in higher GAG concentration, higher chondrogenic index, higher collagen concentration, and type II collagen immunoreactivity in TSB versus HCS. Both HCS and TSB were immunoreactive for type I collagen, however, HCS had mild, patchy intracellular immunoreactivity while TSB had diffuse moderate immunoreactivity over the entire bisocaffold. The tissue architecture was markedly different between TSB and HCS, with TSB containing collagen organized in bands and sheets. Both HCS and TSB expressed alpha smooth muscle actin and displayed active contractile behavior. Double stranded DNA content was not different between TSB and HCS, while cell viability decreased in TSB. CONCLUSIONS: Long term culture of synoviocytes with tension improved meniscal-like extra cellular matrix components, specifically, the total collagen content, including type I and II collagen, and increased GAG content relative to HCS.

The {{results indicate that}} the initial extrusion texture {{plays an important role in}} the formation of different types of twins and that the twinning behavior also depends on the strain path. Contraction and double twinning are the dominant twinning mechanisms in uniaxial tension, while extension twinning prevails in uniaxial compression and ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> testing. Schmid factor analysis indicates that only components that are favorably oriented (i. e. with the highest SF values) can undergo rapid and complete twinning.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Large-scale {{experiments}} on circular model cell bulkheads {{were conducted to}} define the distribution of hoop stresses, deflections of the cells, distortion of the cell fill, ultimate overturning resistance, and the critical mode of failure. The embedment depth of the model cells was varied to investigate the effect of embedment {{on the behavior of}} circular cells. The model cells were subjected to typical service loading conditions, including backfilling and backfill surcharging and were failed by application of a large lateral load. <b>Hoop</b> <b>tension</b> during initial cell filling was found to be the critical design consideration for sheetpiles along the back of the cell. Maximum interlock tension occurred within the lower third of the exposed height of the sheetpiles. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 6 times the active Rankine value is recommended for design of isolated cells. Maximum <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> and radial bulging should be assumed to occur at an elevation of one-fourth of the distance from the point of sheetpile fixity {{to the top of the}} sheetpile. The depth to fixity may be estimated by theory of elasticity and depends on the quality of the soil in which the cells are embedded. Backfilling and surcharging increased <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> by about 25 and 10 percent, respectively. Crest deflections vary linearly with the magnitude of backfill surcharge. Distortion of the model cells at failure indicates that circular cell bulkheads fail as flexible structures. The critical mode of failure for embedded cells was found to be that of tilting about a point of fixity. A plastic hinge forms in the front sheetpiles at the point of fixity. Failure of the cell fill occurs along roughly vertical planes which extend vertically only to the point of tilting. It is shown that the method of analysis by vertical shear using the Rankine or Krynine coefficient significantly underestimates cell overturning resistance. The method of horizontal shear overestimates the overturning resistance for embedded cells by about 35 percent. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure to be used with the proposed failure model is recommended. It is shown that this coefficient depends on sheetpile embedment and fill characteristics, and is significantly larger than previously suggested values. Available field data on circular cell bulkheads, specifically <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> and deflection data, is presented and discussed. In general, the trends in field data compare favorably with the results from the model study...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of large-scale numerical modeling of cellular mattress-reinforced fly ash beds overlying soft clay using a finite-element program. The cellular mattress was a honeycomb structure consisting of interconnected multiple circular cells. The influence of the height, diameter, and tensile stiffness of the cell and the width of the entire mattress on the pressure-settlement response of footing, surface deformation during footing settlement, and mobilization of <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> in the cell walls are illustrated. Results from the numerical analyses indicate an improvement in footing capacity of approximately 1. 4 times greater over fly ash bed by inclusion of a single geotextile separator representing jute geotextile in between the fly ash bed and underlying clay. The cellular mattress-fly ash composite bed produced an approximately sevenfold increment in the footing capacity compared with the unreinforced fly ash bed both in presence of the jute separator. The mattress-reinforced beds produced better footing capacity with an increase in the height and width of the mattress and the tensile stiffness of the cell wall. It is satisfactory to acquire the optimization for the height and width of mattress and the tensile stiffness of the cell wall. For a particular mattress width and height, the footing capacity increased with a reduction in the cell diameter. The cell at the mattress center mobilized maximum <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> that was lesser in the cells successively toward the mattress periphery. Also, more <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> was mobilized with an increase in the tensile stiffness of cell wall.

The TASTE objectives are to compare existing testing methodologies for claddings and to determine the tensile and creep properties of the 15 - 15 Ti (1. 4970) steel in the final product form.

The Intze tanks prove to be economical for storing medium and large capacities. It is useful to analyze these structures to obtain a cost effective solution. In most of the structures mentioned above have <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> as critical {{in many parts of}} the structures due to the water pressure on the sections.

The model used {{also allows for}} considering a flexible foundation supporting the shell {{in the sense of}} a radial and circumferential distributed stiffness. Furthermore, a circumferential <b>tension</b> (<b>hoop</b> stress) which may be due to pressurisation or centrifugal forces is taken into account. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are determined exactly for both stationary shells and for shells rotating with a constant angular speed around the cylinder axis. Trigonometric functions are assumed for the circumferential mode shape profiles, and a sum of eight weighted exponential functions is assumed for the axial mode shape profiles. The functional form of the axial profiles is shown to greatly vary with the roots of a characteristic bi-quartic polynomial that occurs in the process of satisfying the equations of motion. In the previously published work it has been very often assumed that the roots are two real, two imaginary, and two pairs of complex conjugates. In the present study, a total of eight types of roots are shown to determine the whole set of mode shapes, either for stationary or for rotating shells.

40|$|The classic {{accepted}} {{view of the}} heliosphere is a quiescent, comet-like shape aligned in {{the direction}} of the Sun's travel through the interstellar medium (ISM) extending for 1000 's of AUs (AU: astronomical unit). Here we show, based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, that the <b>tension</b> (<b>hoop)</b> force of the twisted magnetic field of the sun confines the solar wind plasma beyond the termination shock and drives jets to the North and South very much like astrophysical jets. These jets are deflected into the tail region by the motion of the Sun through the ISM similar to bent galactic jets moving through the intergalactic medium. The interstellar wind blows the two jets into the tail but is not strong enough to force the lobes into a single comet-like tail, as happens to some astrophysical jets (Morsony et al. 2013). Instead, the interstellar wind flows around the heliosphere and into equatorial region between the two jets. As in some astrophysical jets that are kink unstable (Porth et al. 2014) we show here that the heliospheric jets are turbulent (due to large-scale MHD instabilities and reconnection) and strongly mix the solar wind with the ISM beyond 400 AU. The resulting turbulence has important implications for particle acceleration in the heliosphere. The two-lobe structure is consistent with the energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) images of the heliotail from IBEX (McComas et al. 2013) where two lobes are visible in the North and South and the suggestion from the CASSINI (Krimigis et al. 2009, Dialynas et al. 2013) ENAs that the heliosphere is "tailless".

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of lateral confining reinforcement on the ductile behaviour of reinforced concrete columns. The contents of the chapters are summarized as follows. In Chapter one, the general problems in seismic design are discussed and earthquake design methods based on the ductile design approach are described. Japanese, New Zealand and United States design codes are compared. Finally, the scope of this research project is outlined. In Chapter two, after reviewing previous research on confined concrete, the factors which affect the effectiveness of lateral confinement are discussed. Especially the effects of the yield strength of transverse reinforcement, the compressive strength of plain concrete and the strain gradient in the column section due to bending are discussed based on tests which were conducted by the author et al at Kyoto University and Akashi Technological College, Japan. In the axial compression tests on spirally reinforced concrete cylinders (150 mm in diameter by 300 mm in height), the yield strength of transverse reinforcement and the compressive strength of plain concrete were varied from 161 MPa to 1352 MPa and from 17 MPa to 60 MPa, respectively, as experimental parameters. It is found that, when high strength spirals are used as confining reinforcement, the strength and ductility of the confined core concrete are remarkably enhanced but need to be estimated assuming several failure modes which could occur. These are based on the observations that concrete cylinders with high strength spirals suddenly failed at a concrete compressive strain of 2 to 3. 5 % due to explosive crushing of the core concrete between the spiral bars or due to bearing failure of the core concrete immediately beneath the spiral bars, while the concrete cylinders with ordinary strength spirals failed in a gentle manner normally observed. In addition, eccentric loading tests were conducted on concrete columns with 200 mm square section confined by square spirals. It is found that the effectiveness of confining reinforcement is reduced by the presence of the strain gradient along the transverse section of column. In Chapter three, the effectiveness of transverse reinforcement with various types of anchorage details which simplify the fabrication of reinforcing cages are investigated. Eight reinforced concrete columns, with either 400 mm or 550 mm square cross sections, were tested subjected to axial compression loading and cyclic lateral loading which simulated a severe earthquake. The transverse reinforcement consisted of arrangements of square perimeter hoops with 135 ° end hooks, cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° or 180 ° end hooks, and 'U' and 'J' shaped cross ties and perimeter <b>hoops</b> with <b>tension</b> splices. Conclusions are reached with regard to the effectiveness of the tested anchorage details in the plastic hinge regions of columns designed for earthquake resistance. In Chapter four, the effectiveness of interlocking spirals as transverse reinforcement is studied. Firstly, the general aspects and the related problems of interlocking spirals to provide adequate ductility in the potential plastic hinge region of columns are discussed, referring to the provisions in the New Zealand code,the CALTRANS (California Transportation Authority) code and other related codes. Secondly, based on those discussions, a design method to securely interlock the spirals is proposed. Thirdly, the effectiveness of interlocking spirals is assessed based on column tests conducted as part of this study. Three columns with interlocking spirals and, for comparison, one rectangular column with rectangular hoopsandcross ties, were tested under cyclic horizontal loading which simulated a severe earthquake. The sections of those columns were 400 mm by 600 mm. In Chapter five, analytical models to investigate the buckling behaviour of longitudinal reinforcement restrained by cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° end hooks and by peripheral hoops are proposed. The analyzed results using the proposed models compare well with the experimental observations described in Chapter three. Using those proposed models, a method to check the effectiveness of cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° end hooks is proposed for practical design purposes. In Chapter six, a theory for the prediction of the ultimate longitudinal compressive concrete strain at the stage of first hoop fracture referred to as the "Energy Balance Theory", which has been developed by Mander, Priestley and Park at University of Canterbury, is introduced. After discussing the problems in the "Energy Balance Theory", a modified theory for the prediction of the ultimate longitudinal compressive concrete strain at the stage of first hoop fracture is proposed. The predictions from the modified theory are found to compare well with previous experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of texture in an AM 30 Mg alloy was examd. after deformation by uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression and ring <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> testing (RHTT). Temps. from ambient to 200 ° were covered at a strain rate of 0. 1 /s. The samples were cut from extruded AM 30 Mg alloy tubes. Specimens deformed to various strain levels were examd. by optical microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The {{results indicate that}} the initial extrusion texture and strain path together play important roles in the formation of different types of twins, which in turn significantly influence the {{evolution of}} the deformation texture. Contraction and double twinning are the dominant twinning mechanisms in uniaxial tension, while extension twinning prevails in uniaxial compression and RHTT. In addn. the deformation textures indicate that the active twinning planes are the ones with the highest Schmid factors. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{inner and}} outer {{surfaces}} of concrete lining in deep alluvium freezing shaft are exposed to different temperatures, taking the hydration heat of cement for pyrogen. Additional stresses are therefore observed in concrete lining, owing to its marked temperature drop at early ages. This paper makes a numerical calculation of the temperature and the thermal stress on freezing shaft lining by finite element methods and engineering monitoring. The results reveal that the concrete of shaft lining has a high heat-release rate in the early age. And the time when shaft lining reaches its maximum temperature is 4 days earlier than it reaches its maximum thermal tension stresses. At the time of {{one day after the}} shaft lining pouring, the {{inner and outer}} surface of shaft lining will crack owing to its <b>hoop</b> <b>tension</b> strain is greater than ultimate tension strain.
