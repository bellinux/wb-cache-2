40|$|The Presented Thesis {{is focused}} on {{exploitation}} of stochastic cyclical networks in project management during project planning. Particularly, it {{is focused on}} the <b>GERT</b> <b>method,</b> which enables to carry out both the probability analysis and the time analysis of projects with stochastic structure. We deal primarily with analysis of such networks where cyclical activities occur. As {{an integral part of the}} Thesis, derivation of simplified computing procedures for cyclical activities is included. We extend the possibilities of the <b>GERT</b> <b>method</b> with stochastic evaluation of time duration of activities using the fuzzy <b>GERT</b> <b>method.</b> This fuzzy <b>GERT</b> <b>method</b> is applied on the real project and its results are compared to results of Monte Carlo simulation...|$|E

GERT provides a visual {{picture of the}} system and helps to analyse the system in a less inductive manner. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is studying the application of project scheduling in agriculture, for operations scheduling of sugarcane production (preserve operations, harvesting and rationing) using classical <b>GERT</b> <b>method</b> in Khuzestan province of Iran. Results showed that the network model was able to answer any statistic all the questions concerning the project. GERT networks are increasingly becoming a powerful tool for modelling, scheduling, planning, controlling and analysing of agricultural mechanization projects...|$|E

It adopts the Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) by translating the remanufacturing operational process into a stochastic network. This stochastic network possesses two characteristics: activities having a {{probability of occurrence}} associated with them; and time to perform an activity. Together with the <b>GERT</b> <b>method,</b> Mason’s rule is applied to calculate the equivalence transfer function of the system, therefore predicting the desired outcomes. A generic eight-step process on how to implement this method in any structure of return products and remanufacturing network is provided. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the result of using GERT on forecasting printer remanufacturing outcomes. The main contribution of this research is: Instead of giving one result such as either return quantity, or time, or probability, our research can forecast three of these outcomes simultaneously, and the algorithm is generalised to be applicable to any product structure and remanufacturing network...|$|E

More precisely, when/nindividuals use credit cards tend to overspend and to underestimate their past expenses. However, there is little research about {{the role that the}} additional services provided by financial institution have in shaping consumption patterns. This paper analyze how one of these services –the text message that banks send to their clients each time they make a payment using a credit card– affects spending control. A review of the previous literature is considered, and an experiment is hold to show support for the proposed theoretical framework. Our findings suggest that the information stated in these SMS are a source of variance in the overall expenses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to calculate the completion time of various network paths according to which project completion time could be calculated. Critical Path Method (CPM) is used to determine project completion time if the time to conduct activities is definite. But if time of conducting activities is probable, Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) method must be used and if occurring activities is possible, Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (<b>GERT)</b> <b>method</b> should be applied. The current project control software usually cannot perform calculations for the last two states. Moreover, using manual methods is impossible if the network is composed of several activities. Thus applying the simulation approach is an appropriate method in such states. Simulation is used as a strong tool to analyze systems because it has a close relationship with real systems and considers many complicated relations in them. It is intended to determine project completion time and critical path in this survey given that time of activities is probable and each activity is the prerequisite to another. ARENA software has been used to do so which is based on simulation method...|$|E
