One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the <b>down</b> <b>pipe</b> and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

Titanium was also used in the front fork (titanium-nitride) to coat the stanchions. An exhaust tuning valve had been mounted inside the exhaust pipe. Using a servo the system dynamically adjusted the exhaust back pressure, according to engine speed, throttle position, and gear selection for increased torque, lower emissions, and decreased noiseâ€”the (stock) exhaust noise of the GSX-R1000 is notably lower than that of the GSX-R600.|$|E
5000|$|Switching from an exhaust {{manifold}} to exhaust headers (also known as extractors in Australia) will optimize the {{exhaust gas flow}} speed and in turn increase the high-end power of the engine. This is done by using an individual pipe for each exhaust port that has smoother bends with a larger turn radius, decreasing airflow resistance, {{as well as a}} calculated pipe diameter to obtain a good scavenging effect for the specific engine capacity. The pipes then merge into a collector and then flow into a larger pipe (<b>down</b> <b>pipe),</b> just before the catalytic converter. With equal length headers, as each exhaust valve in the head of the engine is opened and exhaust gas is forced out, it passes down one of the header pipes and through to the <b>down</b> <b>pipe,</b> where the exhaust gas velocity causes a slight vacuum in another header pipe. This has an effect of scavenging exhaust gas from the cylinder, which is beneficial for performance. In performance engines, which have cam overlap, the scavenging effect will pull air through from the intake manifold as well, further increasing performance. The length of exhaust headers can be tuned to perform best at specific RPM ranges. Stock {{exhaust manifold}}s are usually made of cast iron and can be restrictive. Headers may or may not increase the dB level of the exhaust, depending on the original exhaust manifold it replaces and the engine. However, the pipes do [...] "ring" [...] with the exhaust pulses and increase underhood noise. Headers can be ceramic coated to reduce the heat radiated in the engine compartment, and to increase the temperature of the pipes which increases the velocity of the exhaust gases.|$|E
50|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} (RWH) is {{a practice}} of growing importance in the United Kingdom, particularly in the South East of England where there is less water available per person than in many Mediterranean countries. Rainwater harvesting in the UK is both a traditional and reviving technique for collecting water for domestic uses. This water is generally used for non-hygienic purposes like watering gardens, flushing toilets, and washing clothes. There is a growing demand for larger tank systems collecting between 1000-7500 litres of water. The two main uses for harvested rainwater are botanical uses, like gardening for plant irrigation, and domestic uses, like flushing toilets and running washing machines. Rainwater is almost always collected strictly from the roof, then heavily filtered using either a filter attached to the <b>down</b> <b>pipe,</b> a fine basket filter or for more expensive systems like self-cleaning filters placed in an underground tank. UK homes using some form of rainwater harvesting system can reduce their mains water usage by 50% or more, although a 20-30% saving is more common.|$|E

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} reactor the {{containment}} protects the environment from radioactive emissions. It is separated in two parts, a drywell and a wetwell. The drywell contains the reactor vessel and the steam pipes. If a steam leakage occurs {{in this part of}} the containment the pressure will increase. To reduce the pressure raising the reactor safety system uses the pressure suppression principle. By this principle the steam is condensed in a condensation pool filled with water. This pool is located in the wetwell part of the containment. To connect the drywell and wetwell there are pipes connected between them. These pipes are submerged under the water level in the condensation pool. This means that steam will be blown down into the condensation pool if the pressure in the drywell exceeds the hydrostatic pressure at the pipe outlet in the pool. In this thesis the blow down process has been studied with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The aim was to study the pressure distribution in the condensation pool during a blow down sequence. It is useful to know the pressure distribution and the size of the pressure oscillations to calculate the forces acting on components in the pool and the pool structure. The CFD method has also been compared to the current used method for this type of calculations. The current method at Westinghouse uses a program called SPIEGEL. Simulations have been made on a model of a blow <b>down</b> <b>pipe</b> and a condensation pool. This model is called the PPOOLEX facility and is set up at Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland. The facility has a simplified design compared to a real system. The blow <b>down</b> <b>pipe</b> in the PPOOLEX facility has only opening in the bottom of the pipe while a real blow <b>down</b> <b>pipe</b> has several small holes scattered along the pipe wrap. Â One of the simulations made in this project was based on an experiment performed on the PPOOLEX facility. The results from the simulation were compared to the experimental results. In that experiment only air was blown in to the facility. Another simulation was made where steam was blown into the facility. Two different CFD solvers, CFX and STAR-CCM+, were used to perform the simulations. Because of the great need for computing power, however, mostly STAR-CCM+ was used. The result of the air simulation showed similar values â€‹â€‹of the pressure distribution as in experiment. During the simulation also temperatures were measured and compared to the experiment temperature measurements. In these results there were larger differences between the simulation and the experiment, especially for points located in air. Graphic illustrations of volume fractions and pressures in the facility were produced during the simulation. When steam was used as a source fluid in the simulation some problems appeared in the solution. The CFD software had problems to get a converging solution, probably due to incomplete or incorrect settings for the solver. The conclusions of this thesis are that CFD can be used to simulate an air blow down process through the process and get reliable information about the pressure distribution in the pool. The method needs to be more developed in steam simulations to be able to calculate the blow down process in a real reactor. CFD is a good tool to produce graphics of the blow down process. Different types of physical properties, such as velocities, volume fractions, and pressure distributions can be illustrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An IC reactor volume 6 m 3 {{was used}} to treat the straw-washing water {{produced}} in a pulping and papermaking mill in experiment. When loading rate was 3. 34 ~ 6. 28 kgCOD/(m 3 Â·d) COD average removal rate was 28. 14 %, that was lower than COD average removal rate of sludge waking up stage (47. 30 %) and acclimation stage (51. 14 %), and also lower than COD removal rate (50 ~ 80 %) of IC running well. Gas production rate of the reactor was 1. 53 ~ 32. 17 L/h, and effluent VFA was 746. 0 ~ 1211. 0 mg/L. So hydrolysis-acidification process was more appropriate than anaerobic process when treating the straw-washing water. Due to low concentration of the wastewater and less gas production, the inner circulatory system of the reactor produced discontinuous ascending flow. When gas production rate of the reactor was 12. 00 ~ 54. 55 L/h, flow rate of lifting pipe was 1. 20 ~ 12. 86 L/h, and the ratio of flow rate and gas production rate was 0. 08 ~ 0. 36. <b>Down</b> <b>pipe</b> produced intermittent backflow, backflow rate reached 518. 4 ~ 725. 1 L/h...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{techniques}} for on-line monitoring {{were used to}} study 70 Cu- 30 Ni alloy corrosion in lithium bromide solution under flow operating conditions in an absorption heat pump. The cause of metallic corrosion on the studied alloy is the localized attack of the passive film surface by bromide ions at lower temperatures, and dissolution of the protective film at higher temperatures and flow conditions. Laboratory experiments were performed using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) under dynamic conditions and different temperatures, similar to the operating pump parameters. This was done to understand the corrosion behavior of the copper alloy prior to on-line monitoring assessment. A corrosion probe consisting in three identical copper alloy ring electrodes embedded in Teflon tube sections to isolate them, with the same diameter as the piping to prevent breaking <b>down</b> <b>pipe</b> flow continuity, was designed and installed.

The quality of rainwater collected depends on the cleanliness of the atmosphere, materials used for the catchment surface, gutters and <b>down</b> <b>pipe</b> of the storage tank and the water extraction device. In the hill country and in the north central province acid rain has been recorded and in the western province rainwater has carried high nitrate levels.

This study reviews the quality of rain collected throughout Sri Lanka from different types of storage tanks and roofs. It will compare the traditional rainwater collecting methods with the present available technology of the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project (CWSSP). It looks as the health aspects of drinking rainwater related to biological contamination and indirectly due to disease vectors like mosquito and other insects/pest breeding in the stored water. Recommendations will be given on the different water treatment methods along with some suggestions for improvement.
