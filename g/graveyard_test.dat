50|$|The timber is {{classified}} as naturally durable and is normally very resistant to termite attack and fungal infestation. Under <b>graveyard</b> <b>test</b> conditions, untreated specimens of size 50 mm x 50 mm x 600 mm lasted 9 years. Treated specimen {{of the same size}} and test conditions lasted about 19 years. Untreated railway sleepers of size 238 mm x 125 mm x 1,950 mm laid under severe environmental conditions gave an average service life of 19 years. Termites do not attack the sound timber.|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of fruit woods increased according of increasing human needs. Several weakness of fruit woods were bad dimensional stability and susceptible wood from termite attack. Preservation {{can improve the}} dimensional stability and increase the wood from termite attack. One preservation method of was acetylation. The research purpose were to known the effect of rambutan, cempedak and rambai woods variety and acetic acid concentration to retention value, to evaluated the dimention stability and Weight Percent Gain and to evaluated durability from attack termite based on <b>graveyard</b> <b>test</b> and laboratory test. Some kind of wood such as rambutan, cempedak and rambai woods were treated by soaking during 2 weeks with acetic acid concentration of 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %. The results showed the effective retention on rambai wood with concentration of 20 % was 3. 81 %. The high dimention stability ASE on rambutan wood with concentration of 15 % was 73. 37 %, and the high WPG on rambai wood with concentration of 25 % was 46. 66 %. The increasing of acetid acid concentration caused the increasing retention and wood resistance from termite attack in <b>graveyard</b> <b>test</b> and laboratory test...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} density {{on the natural}} resistanceof ten {{selected}} Nigerian wood species to subterraneantermites was investigated. Wood samples obtainedfrom mixed-conversion boards were used such that thesamples contained both sapwood and the heartwood. They were sawn to 35 × 35 × 450 mm stake and dried at 103 ± 20 C till a constant weight was achieved. Densityof the selected wood species was determined. Basedon the observed average density, the wood specieswere classified into high, medium or low density. <b>Graveyard</b> <b>test</b> method {{was used to assess}} the naturalresistance of the samples on a site dominated byMacrotermes sybhylinus, a family of subterraneantermites. Weekly visual observations of the stakeswere taken as specified in ASTM D 3345 - 80 Standardsfor 24 weeks. The wood samples were withdrawn atthe 24 th week of exposure to termites and weight lossdue to termites’ attack was estimated. Result obtainedshowed the relationship between wood density, weightloss and the ASTM ratings. A strong but negativecorrelation (R 2 = - 0. 70) existed between weight lossand wood density while a strong positive correlation(R 2 = 0. 83) existed between ASTM values and wooddensity. These results indicated that wood species inthe high density class had a better resistance totermites’ attack. The influence of mixed conversion onthe resistance of wood species to subterraneantermites was also reported, since it is the mostcommon method of conversion in the Nigeriansawmills. The sapwood of high density species are notdurable as revealed in the study thus the preservativetreatment is imperative for long service-life...|$|E

40|$|This {{field study}} {{was based on}} the 1993 IUFRO method and {{designed}} as a <b>graveyard</b> (in-ground) <b>test</b> in the tropical region of the Northern Territory to examine the efficacy of novel preservative formulations developed as alternative protection for softwood timber against decay fungi and termites for Hazard Class 3 and 4. This study was supported by the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation (FWPRDC). Timber specimens 500 (longitudinal) × 50 (tangential) × 25 (radial) mm were cut from the sapwood of fast grown Pinus radiata D. Don and treated with trimethylborate (TMB), sodium octoborate, linseed oil and fipronil in various solvents (toluene, linseed oil and deionised water) using a vacuum/pressure treatment method. After 4 years in-ground, the solvent control and fipronil (only) treated stakes were slightly attacked by soft rot, brown rot and white rot fungi. Most of the stakes had surface damage only, while few of the solvent controls had severe damage by only decay fungi. There was slight attack on the treated timber by soft rot fungi. A small number of solvent controls and borate treated stakes were severely attacked by subterranean termites, particularly Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). The fipronil only or fipronil with borate treated stakes were not attacked...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{reinforced with}} wood or non-wood natural fibres {{have the potential}} to be a lighter and lower-cost alternative construction material. Until better availability and properties and a lower cost price of degradable polymers makes their use more prevalent, the application of natural fibre reinforcements in synthetic polymers is an intermediate step towards products that are completely degradable or compostable after their service life. The inherent degradability of natural fibres makes the circumstances of their composite applications, more specifically the moisture conditions, very important regarding potential development of fungal communities and the related damage. For wood and wood-based panels different Use Classes (UC) are defined and for every UC laboratory and field test methods were developed that each determine the (maximum) potential damage caused by the fungi that act in that specific UC. These tests can be used for natural fibre reinforced composites (NFCs) if the specific slower moisture ab- and desorption are taken into account. However the question arises whether the most appropriate way to assess the material resistance is yet developed. Surface stain or mould fungi develop on NFCs when used in high relative humidity conditions (e. g. UC 2). In UC 3 Basidiomycetes can degrade natural fibres as well as derived composites if the natural fibres reach the critical moisture content. In addition to laboratory tests, a 5 year field test showed that fungal growth is not problematic when moisture traps are not present. Finally a <b>graveyard</b> <b>test</b> (UC 4) only revealed superficial softening after 5 years exposure, confirming the good durability of NFCs. Fungal growth thus seems to be mainly an aesthetical problem. Moisture uptake, more than fungal decay, also results in a decrease in mechanical properties, which seems, up to now, relatively unimportant regarding the actual use of such composites. However, if used in structural applications once a better fibre/matrix adhesion leads to enhanced mechanical properties, the damage by moisture and fungi could become critical...|$|E
