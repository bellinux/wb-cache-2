40|$|Presented PhD thesis {{deals with}} {{dissolution}} of amorphous glassy polymers in agitated vessels. Theoretically {{the work is}} based on the description of mass transfer in an agitated vessel, i. e. determination of the relationship for mass-transfer coefficient depending on the respective parameter's in the form of criterial equations. For the description of behaviour of polymers in the process of dissolution a phenomenological model, determining the value of the mutual diffusion coefficient of polymer and solvent depending on the dissolution rate and thickness of the swelling boundary layer in static solvent, is used. The experimental part of work includes determination of the main control mechanism of dissolution of polymeric particles in agitated vessel with baffles and a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>stirrer</b> placed in the vessel axix. For the six pitched-blade stirrer CSV 691020 and tooth stirrer CSV 691038 a dependance of a mass-transfer coefficient on stirrer speed, particles diameter and concentration of solution is determined. Verification of modelling conditions is based on experiments with two different diameters of vessel, D= 0, 15 and 0, 3 m. Universality for the amorphous polymers is verified experimentally with two polymeric materials, polystyrene and polyvinylchloride dissolved in the thermodynamically suitable solvents. Forms of dependence of the mass-transfer coefficient on parameters, obtained in the experimental part of the thesis, corresponds with the form for dissolution of micromolecular materials, for both turbulent and non-turbulent region. Experimental data are thus interpreted in the form of dimensionless criterial equations determining the mass-transfer coefficient value. The equations obtained in this way can be used for universal description of dissolution of the polymeric articles in the vessels with high speed stirrers.

40|$|The auto {{oxidation}} of coal ultimately {{leads to}} spontaneous combustion {{which is the}} major root cause for the disastrous of coal mine. It {{has been a major}} problem in the leading coal producing countries like Australia, India and China. Therefore the assessment for this combustion is very much necessary. It depends upon different characteristics and properties of coal. Once if the combustion of coal has been occurred, {{it is very difficult to}} control which also disturbs the environment of the surroundings of the mine. The spontaneous heating susceptibility of different coals varies over a wide range and it is important to assess their degree of proneness for taking preventive measures against the occurrence of fires to avoid loss of lives and property, sterilization of coal reserves and environmental pollution and raise concerns about safety and economic aspects of mining etc [3]. This project deals with the spontaneous heating tendency of coal using wet oxidation apparatus at various <b>speed</b> of magnetic <b>stirrer.</b> Five coals samples were collected from central Coalfields Limited (CCL) Limited and two coals from Mahanadi coal Limited (MCL) covering some coalfields of India. The collected Indian coals were prepared in a laboratory as per the Indian standards and the susceptibility indices were carried out at low, medium and <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> of magnetic <b>stirrer</b> using wet oxidation apparatus.

30|$|To {{overcome}} all this, {{there is}} one major factor which can help eliminate the mass transfer limitations i.e. <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> The <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> helps to maintain the intra-particle flow by maintaining total flow rate {{and to the extent}} that no shear effect exerts on cells performance as the cells can suffer internal damage during <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> that could be attributed to a weaker cell membrane. The poor velocity also can create problems of the concentration gradient, bridging, and channeling, especially when using alginate beads. The ideal flow pattern in any reactor is not always possible, but we can improve and avoid these problems by recognizing optimum factors. The optimized <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> or efficient mixing in a bioreactor has importance in immobilized cell system as it ensures optimal temperature and concentration gradients at the catalyst surface and all heterogeneous catalysis depend on these transport processes since it helps in elimination of CO 2 and ethanol (Armando Gamarra et al. 1986). The results can be supported by Converti et al. 1985 work where they studied the effect of <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on metabolic activities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> is a major factor that affects the product yield (Converti et al. 1985).|$|R
30|$|By {{increasing}} agitation {{speed to}} 300 and 500  rpm, glucose consumption time decreases significantly in free cells (15 and 10  h, respectively), alginate beads (12 and 8  h, respectively) and sponge (7 and 6  h, respectively). From these data, we can observe that sponges show no much time difference on both agitation speed as compare to free cells and alginate beads. From these results, we {{can conclude that}} the fluid velocity improves the mass transfer of yeast cells immobilized in different matrixes and the magnitude of mass transfer resistance has an inverse relation with <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> This is because the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> controls the internal diffusion of the substrate {{in the case of}} immobilized cells. The sponge-immobilized cells showed less internal diffusion resistance as compare to alginate beads and have less effect at <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> The results in Fig.  3 c support the above observation in which the difference in time of glucose consumption was recorded between free cells (30  h), alginate beads (24  h) and sponges (17  h) at lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (200  rpm) and that tends to decrease (20, 7 and 8  h respectively) at 500  rpm <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> The <b>higher</b> consumption time in case of free cells might be due to the shear effect of <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> Moreover, the time difference between sponges and alginate beads might be due to the effect of internal diffusion resistance that can develop concentration gradient inside and on the outer surface of the alginate beads. The concentration gradient is a major problem that can arise in immobilizing technology and it can be improved by using chemically grafted sponges and optimized <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> as shown in above results.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, {{a set of}} {{experimental}} polypropylene (PP) clay composites containing pristine bentonite clay of Indian origin has been prepared and then characterized. The polymer clay composites are processed by solution mixing of polypropylene with bentonite clay using a solvent xylene and <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> elec-tric <b>stirrer</b> at a temperature around 130 °C and then by compression molding at 170 °C. The mechanical pro-perties of PP–clay composites like tensile strength, hardness and impact resistance have been investigated. Microstructural {{studies were carried out}} using scanning electron microscope and transmission electron mi-croscope and the thermal properties were studied using differential scanning calorimeter. Mechanical proper-ties of the prepared composites showed highest reinforcing and toughening effects of the clay filler at a loading of only 5 mass % in PP matrix. Tensile strength was observed to be highest in case of 5 mass % of clay loading and it was more than 14 % of that of the neat PP, while toughness increased by more than 80 %. Bentonite clay–PP composite (5 mass %) also showed 60 % increase in impact energy value. However, no significant change was observed in case of hardness and tensile modulus. Higher percentages of bentonite clay did not further improve the properties with respect to pristine polypropylene. The study of the microstructure of the prepared polymer layered silicate clay composites showed a mixed morphology with multiple stacks of clay layers and tactoids of different thicknesses...|$|R

The modified resin was then utilized in a Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) process with satin weave carbon fibers to manufacture nanophased composite panels. The nanoparticles were spherical {{in shape and}} about 29 nm in diameter. The loading of nanoparticles into the resin ranged from 1. 5 to 3. 0 percent by weight. The mixing of nanoparticles with Part-A of SC- 15 resin {{was carried out in}} a Sonics Vibra Cell ultrasonic liquid processor at 55 % of the amplitude for about 30 minutes. At this time, the dispersion of nanoparticles seemed uniform through visual observation. In order to avoid rise in the temperature during sonication, cooling was employed by submerging the mixing beaker in a mixture of ice and water. Part-B (hardener) was then added with the mixture at a ratio of 3 : 10 and the mixing was carried out mechanically for about 10 minutes using a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> mechanical <b>stirrer.</b> In the next step, the mixture was used in a VARTM set up with satin weave carbon preforms to fabricate nanophased composite panels. Once cured, test coupons were extracted and subjected to both quasi-static and dynamic loading. Under quasi-static loading tensile and flexural response were of particular interests. Dynamic tests were also carried out at low velocity impact and at high rates of strain. Details of manufacturing, analyses of mechanical tests and enhancements in properties due to nanoparticle infusion are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale human mesenchymal {{stem cell}} {{expansion}} calls for a bioreaction system, that provides a sufficient growth surface. An alternative to static cultivations systems like cell factories are disposable stirred tank reactors. Here, microcarriers provide the required growth surface, but these {{make it difficult to}} achieve a complete homogenization in the bioreactor, while avoiding shear stress. To gain insight into this process, we investigated the impact of different power inputs (0. 02 – 2. 6 W m− 3) on the mixing time (tm). Whereas tm was inversely proportional to agitation in a one-phase-system, aeration resulted in a constant mixing time at 30 – 70 rpm. A high microcarrier concentration (30 g L− 1) and low <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (30 rpm) in the liquid-solid system caused a 50 -fold increase in tm and the formation of a discrete non-mixed upper zone. The effect of the microcarrier concentration on tm became negligible at <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speeds.</b> In the three-phase system, microcarrier settling was prevented by aeration and a minimal specific power input of 0. 6 W m− 3 was sufficient for complete homogenization. We confirmed that a low power input during stem cell expansion leads to inhomogeneity, which has not been investigated in the three-phase system up to date...|$|R
30|$|Figure  3 {{indicate}} {{an effect of}} <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on free and immobilized cells. Glucose consumption time was <b>higher</b> at lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (200  rpm) both free and immobilized cells due to inefficient mass transfer. To make it efficient substrate should reach the yeast cells by diffusion and convection through the external liquid film, liquid–solid interface, and resistance caused by liquid and micro-colonies of yeast within the particle. The <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> alters the diffusion and convection process of the substrate. If <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> is not enough, the substrate concentration {{on the surface and}} within the matrix will be lower than the concentration in the bulk medium. In this case, {{in the center of the}} matrix, a dead necrotic zone can develop, and only cells biomass around the periphery of the matrix will consume substrate. These reasons support our result that at lower <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> cells take a longer time to consume glucose. Yeast cell viability and metabolism is also severely affected by mass transfer properties. Therefore, glucose and other nutrients in fermentation medium must diffuse to the yeast cells and product or other metabolites should diffuse out into the medium otherwise these could be toxic or show inhibition to cells and can decrease cell productivity (Pilkington et al. 1998). While increasing the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> to 300  rpm and 500  rpm, glucose consumption time tends to decrease at all glucose concentration (50, 100, and 200  g/l). The results clearly indicate that there is less concentration gradient, as substrate traveled easily to the reaction site of yeast cells and is consumed as faster as it is provided by the diffusion process. On the other hand, the shear effect of <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (even at 500  rpm) has been observed in Fig.  3 c indicating that the time for glucose consumption is higher in the case of free cells as compare to alginate beads and sponges. The higher consumption time in case of free cells confirmed the shear effect of <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> as well as the glucose. Mechanical stress (shear stress) is one of the factors having an impact on yeast cell wall and its functionality like reduction in viability and vitality. In traditional ethanol fermentation technology, freely suspended yeast cells were used in the batch. Moreover, several drawbacks are found in this technology like more fermentation time and low volumetric productivity, due to continuous changes in the external physical factors and biological activity of yeast. To achieve optimal conditions for metabolic activity, yeast must maintain the intracellular physical and chemical parameters (Bauer and Pretorius).|$|R

30|$|The {{successful}} {{industrial production}} of ethanol and fine chemicals requires {{the development of}} new biocatalytic reactors and support materials to achieve economically viable processes. In this work, a Stirred-Catalytic-Basket-BioReactor using various immobilizing foams as support material and compared to free cells were used, focusing mainly on; (i) effect of mass-transfer on cells physiology and (ii) ethanol productivity. The performance of the reactor was further evaluated by ethanol volumetric productivity, yield and time for process completion and {{it was found that the}} variation of ethanol production and diffusion of the substrate in fermentation process are co-related with the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> and initial glucose concentration. It was also observed that the time difference for glucose consumption between free and immobilized cells (alginate and sponges) tends to increase by increasing the glucose concentration in the medium. We found that at <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (500  rpm) when using higher glucose concentration (200  g/l), ethanol volumetric productivity increased significantly in the sponge (85  g/l) as compared to alginate beads (79  g/l) and free cells (60  g/l). From the data obtained, it can be concluded that sponges are the best support material for attaining higher ethanol productivity. A stirred catalytic basket bioreactor with yeast cells immobilized in polyethylene sponge gives higher ethanol production at a higher glucose consumption rate, and this productivity is due to higher mixing efficiency and reduced external as well as internal mass transfer limitations. The potentials of the reactor rank it as a remarkable ethanol/fine-chemical production approach that needs further investigations.|$|R
30|$|Figure  5 {{shows that}} there is no {{significant}} time difference for consumption of glucose observed between sponges and alginate beads at <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> (500  rpm). The reason might be due to the removal of diffusional limitations in and around the supporting materials. From this, it can be concluded that the magnitude of resistance to the internal diffusion {{is directly related to the}} types of immobilizing matrixes and also on glucose concentration gradient (Galaction et al. 2010; Engasser and Horvath 1973). The consumption time of glucose, i.e., traveling of the substrate from the outer surface to inside the matrix depends upon the <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> and texture of the matrix used for immobilizing cells. The results in Fig.  5 indicate that the sponges take less time to complete one batch process than alginate beads and free cells. This might be because cells immobilized in sponges have very less mass transfer limitations and no diffusional barrier by immobilizing reagent as compared to alginate beads. Although alginate beads are porous, a further disadvantage regarding internal mass transfer is that they do not have convective flow inside and nutrients traveled to the cells only by diffusion (Najafpour et al. 2004; Shafaghat et al. 2011). We observed that a SCBBR with yeast cells immobilized in polyethylene sponge gives higher ethanol production at a higher glucose consumption rate, and this productivity is due to higher mixing efficiency and reduced external as well as internal mass transfer limitations. In the near future, we will focus more on improving the process efficiency and more successive fermentations will be conducted to demonstrate the stability of the immobilization.|$|R
40|$|Water-in-diesel {{emulsion}} fuel is a promising alternative diesel fuel, {{which has the}} potential to promote better performance and emission characteristics in an existing Diesel engine without engine modification and added cost. The key factor that has to be focused with the introduction of such fuel in existing Diesel engine is desired engine-operating conditions. The present study attempts to address the previous issue with two-phases of experiments. In the first phase, stable water-in-diesel {{emulsion fuel}}s (5, 10, 15, and 20 water-in-diesel) are prepared and their stability period and physico-chemical properties are measured. In the second phase, experiments are conducted in a single cylinder, 4 -stroke Diesel engine with pre-pared water-in-diesel emulsion fuel blends based on L 16 orthogonal array suggested in Taguchi’s quality control concept to record the output responses (perormance and emission levels). Based on signal-to-noise ratio and grey relational analysis, optimal level of operating factors are determined to obtain better response and verified through confirmation experiments. A statistical analysis of variance is applied to measure the significance of individual operating parameters on overall engine performance. Results indicate that the emulsion fuel prepared by Sorbitan monolaurate surfactant at <b>high</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> endows with better emulsion stability and acceptable variation in physicochemical properties.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{aeration}} rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on micro-aerobic fermentation is studied at laboratory scale. Result suggests that with Baker’s yeast, {{an increase in}} aeration rates from very low value can improve bioethanol productivity and yield because it can enhance cell viability. At constant <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> of 150 rpm, the increase in aeration rate from 1 to 1. 5 LPM leads to proportional increase in peak Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) from 600 to 1000 mM L - 1 h. This increase coincides {{with the increase in}} yield by 7. 5 %. Interestingly at constant aeration rate of 1. 5 LPM, an increase in <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> from 150 to 250 rpm leads to decrease in peak OUR from 1000 to 457 mM L - 1 h but increase in yield by 64 %. In conclusion, both <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> and aeration rate are important factors which have complex impacts on hydrodynamics and microbial metabolism, which in turn affect productivity and yield. Further study using CFD modeling and simulation method is required to gain better insights into how aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> affect metabolism via the mixing mechanisms in a bioreactor...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} higher glucose {{concentration}} on ethanol productivity {{can be observed}} in Fig.  4 a–c, and it indicates the reduction in ethanol productivity in alginate beads as compare to sponges. This could be the inhibition or reverse of reaction due to a higher rate of reaction upon increasing substrate concentration. Also, (Nikolić et al. 2009) observed a significant decrease in ethanol yield on the addition of sugar concentration in fermentation medium and (Galaction et al. 2010) found intra-phase resistance induces the substrate inhibition which {{is directly related to the}} glucose concentration gradient (Nikolić et al. 2009; Galaction et al. 2010). The lower ethanol yield obtained when using free cells (Figs.  4, 5) might be due to the effect of glucose inhibition that tends to increase upon using higher glucose concentration. The efficiency and physiology of free cells are markedly affected by the use of higher glucose concentration inhibition and the shear effect of <b>higher</b> <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed.</b> As the cells can exhibit different metabolisms which depend upon their microenvironment and reactor operating conditions (Roberts and Fisher 2000). Inhibition of yeast growth and metabolic activities by high initial substrate concentration was also observed by Lee et al. (2012), while (Galaction et al. 2010) showed results depicting that substrate or product inhibition phenomenon could limit the efficiency of ethanol production (Lee et al. 2012; Galaction et al. 2010). Moreover, the productivity difference between sponges and alginate beads shows the presence of internal diffusional resistance that can create a concentration gradient.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} {{variable}} mixing conditions arising from the different sets of aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed</b> on the ethanolic fermentation process, which utilizes the hydrolyzed cassava starch as carbon source.

Additionally over these experimental conditions, the selectivity of ethanol over glycerol varied from 3. 6 to 12. 3. One conclusion that {{can be drawn from}} this experimental study is that, the large variations in yield, selectivity and ethanol formation rate were more likely due to the different mixing conditions resulting from different values of aeration rate and <b>stirrer</b> <b>speed,</b> and less likely due to glucose and growth rates as previously reported...|$|R
