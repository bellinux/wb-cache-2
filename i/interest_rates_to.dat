5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates Marx's {{monetary}} {{analysis of the}} role of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in the distribution of surplus-value. It is argued that Marx allowed the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> directly influence the distribution of surplus-value between enterprise profit and interest. Moreover, he thought the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> be subject to the conflict between industrial and money capitalists. Recent developments in Sraffian and neo-Marxian literature provide the foundations for a Marxian analytical framework that allows intra-capitalist conflict, monetary policy and the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> affect the intra-capitalist and the inter-class income distribution. ...|$|R

5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The US {{interest}} rates were also affected by France's decision {{to raise their}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> attract gold to their vaults. In theory, the U.S. would have two potential responses to that: Allow the exchange rate to adjust, or increase their own <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into francs to buy more French assets, the demand for the U.S. dollar fell, and the exchange rate increased. The only thing the US could do {{to get back into}} equilibrium was increase {{interest rates}}.|$|E

40|$|The authors analyze macrodynamic {{adjustment}} during financial liberalization in Chile and New Zealand. During {{the adjustment}} to more open capital accounts {{in the late}} 1970 s or mid- 1980 s, both countries experienced appreciation of the real exchange rate and a collapse of net exports, while domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> slowly converged <b>to</b> international levels. The authors develop and estimate a two-sector dynamic model using both current and time-varying parameters. They find the domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> be more responsive to shocks under imperfect capital mobility, the real exchange rate more responsive under perfect capital mobility. In short, liberalization of the capital account does not eliminate volatility but rather shifts it from the domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> the real exchange rate.
