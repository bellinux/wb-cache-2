5|$|Church {{and state}} {{maintained}} close {{relations in the}} Anglo-Saxon period, both socially and politically. Churchmen attended royal feasts as well as meetings of the Royal Council. During Æthelstan's reign these relations became <b>even</b> <b>closer,</b> especially as the archbishopric of Canterbury had come under West Saxon jurisdiction since Edward the Elder annexed Mercia, and Æthelstan's conquests brought the northern church {{under the control of}} a southern king for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{observations}} of Mars {{is marked by}} the oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> to Earth.|$|E
5|$|That {{overwhelming}} start {{was just}} the beginning for the Hokies, who won their next seven games, racing to an 8–0 start and a No.3 ranking in the national polls. In their ninth game of the season, however, the Hokies suffered their first loss, falling 21–28 to the Pittsburgh Panthers. The next week, Tech suffered an <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> loss, losing to Syracuse in triple overtime despite a record performance from Tech quarterback Bryan Randall, who accumulated 504passing yards and fivetouchdown passes.|$|E

5|$|The match {{statistics}} {{followed a}} similar pattern to those at the 2008 Wimbledon Final, with Federer having a lower first serve percentage against Nadal (51% vs 64%) and he again couldn't be as clinical on break point opportunities with only 31% break points converted for Federer whereas Nadal converted 43% of his break points. However the total points by each player proved <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> than that at that Wimbledon final, as Federer won 1 more point than Nadal (174 vs 173) yet still lost this final.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} very close to the Coney Island {{amusement}} area. It is close to the Luna Park (formerly Astroland) amusement park; the Scream Zone area, operated by Luna Park; Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park; the Cyclone roller coaster, the Thunderbolt roller coaster; and the amusement area that replaced the former Steeplechase Park. Other nearby attractions include the original Nathan's Famous store and the world-famous Riegelmann Boardwalk. The New York Aquarium is a few blocks to the east, though the neighboring West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station is <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> to the aquarium.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E

5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller {{just as he}} was looking to get his shot away. On 15 minutes, they came <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> to breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass had sent him through.|$|E
5|$|The {{week after}} the Miami game, the Seminoles had an <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> call against the Clemson Tigers—their closest, in fact, of the entire season. Despite the return of Peter Warrick, who was cleared of charges in a Florida courtroom, Florida State fell behind the Tigers in the first half. Trailing in Clemson, South Carolina, 143 at halftime, Florida State cut the gap to 146 with a field goal midway through the third quarter, then tied the game {{at the end of}} the third quarter with a {{touchdown}} and two-point conversion. The Seminoles clinched the victory after a field goal late in the fourth quarter gave them a 1714 lead and cemented the victory when a Clemson attempt to even the score with a field goal fell short. The victory was FSU head coach Bobby Bowden's 300thwin and came against his son, Tommy Bowden, coach of the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In early March, the {{formation}} of the 4th Army was accompanied by the development of <b>even</b> <b>closer</b> coordination and liaison with the two squadrons. Air marker panels began to be used to show the forward line of friendly troops and to identify friendly vehicles, and liaison teams were deployed with the commanders of lower-level formations to communicate directly with supporting aircraft. Operations continued across Bosnia and Dalmatia in March, and were extended to include support to advances in the Lika region and during the capture of Sarajevo and Bihać. As Axis forces withdrew west towards Zagreb, the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron continued to harry them, ambushing convoys and rocketing artillery positions. Between 1 January and 31 March 1945, the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron not only flew from Cannae and Vis, but also from the airfields at Zemunik and Prkos on the mainland. In the same period the squadron lost four aircraft and suffered damage to fifteen others. Of the lost aircraft, two were destroyed {{as a result of a}} collision, one was lost after engine failure, and only one was lost to anti-aircraft fire. Four aircraft were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, the remainder being damaged by fragments from their own rockets.|$|E

5|$|In the men's events, the Korean team shot 12 maximum {{scores of}} 10 {{to win the}} gold medal against Chinese Taipei 251-245. Losing by two points, the United States failed to fend of the Ukraine team to capture the bronze. The event causing the most upset however was the men's individual, the only event that the Korean team has never won and yet again failed to clinch. Defending {{champion}} Simon Fairweather was ousted from the competition in a first round loss due to blustery weather conditions. The wind caused some archers like Fairweather to make one-point shots, and its strength even caused others to miss their targets completely. The final matches of this event also saw competitors coming close in score, with Italian Marco Galiazzo beating the Japanese Hiroshi Yamamoto by only two points to win gold. <b>Even</b> <b>closer</b> still was the bronze medal match, in which Britain's Laurence Godfrey was outshot 112-113 by seventeen-year-old Australian Tim Cuddihy, who himself only managed {{to get into the}} semifinals by one point.|$|E
5|$|Between 1938 and 1940, {{following}} German–Italian mediation in the First and Second Vienna Awards, and the Hungarian {{invasion of}} Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary enlarged its territory. It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia {{and the northern}} part of Transylvania, which the Kingdom of Romania ceded. One of the ethno-cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and Hungary at this time was the Székely Land. The support that Hungary received from Germany for these border revisions meant that {{the relationship between the two}} countries became <b>even</b> <b>closer.</b> On 20 November 1940, Hungary formally joined the Axis Tripartite Pact. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister, Count Pál Teleki, Hungary concluded a friendship and non-aggression treaty with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not, as Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. After the Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941, when the Germans asked the Hungarian Regent, Miklós Horthy, for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory, Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent. Concluding that Hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs, Teleki shot himself. Horthy informed Hitler that evening that Hungary would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia, though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist.|$|E
