5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did all he could do, as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E

2500|$|Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890) vehemently criticised any {{explanations}} {{that the}} caste system was natural and ordained by the Creator in Hindu texts. If Brahma wanted castes, argued Phule, {{he would have}} ordained the same for other creatures. There are no castes in species of animals or birds, so why should there be one among human animals. In his criticism Phule added, [...] "Brahmins cannot claim superior status because of caste, because they hardly bothered with these when wining and dining with Europeans." [...] Professions did not make castes, and castes did not decide one's profession. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>does</b> a job that is dirty, {{it does not make}} them inferior; {{in the same way that}} no mother is inferior because she cleans the excreta of her baby. Ritual occupation or tasks, argued Phule, do not make any human being superior or inferior.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the rapid}} growth of the African American {{community}} in Baltimore, the schools became over crowded. Due to the over crowding of the schools, Baltimore decided to district the schools. (Crain 1968, 74) This means that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> not live in the district of a certain school, they could not attend that school. This was a way for the school system to remain segregated. African Americans and whites still lived in different areas of Baltimore, therefore, African American and white children went to different schools. Obviously desegregation had not taken full effect.|$|R

Guybrush, using a bomb and a clothesline, is able to knock Winslow off the boat. Winslow gives Guybrush the title of Captain, but requests that he be his first mate on the ship.

50|$|According to his followers, Sangjenim {{differed}} from other prophets {{in that he}} not only spoke about the future but, through his spiritual work, actually transformed it. One way of understanding this is the Butterfly Effect in Edward Lorenz's Chaos Theory. According to that theory, a butterfly flapping its wings in America could cause or prevent a tornado in Indonesia. This of course illustrates the improbability of predicting any event in a highly complex system due {{to the difficulty of}} knowing all variables. But, what <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> were enlightened to the point of omnipotence? What <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> know all the variables?

5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>did</b> not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|R
