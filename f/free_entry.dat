40|$|AbstractAn affine column {{independent}} matrix is {{a matrix}} whose entries are polynomials of degree at most 1 {{in a number}} of indeterminates where no indeterminate appears with a nonzero coefficient in two different columns. A completion is a matrix obtained by giving values to each of the indeterminates. Affine column independent matrices are more general than partial matrices where each entry is either a constant or a distinct indeterminate. We determine when the rank of all completions of an affine column independent matrix is bounded by a given number, generalizing known results for partial matrices. We also characterize the square partial matrices over a field all of whose completions are nonsingular. The maximum number of <b>free</b> <b>entries</b> in such matrices of a given order is determined as well as the partial matrices with this maximum number of <b>free</b> <b>entries...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{structural}} reform process {{that started in}} 1992 under the government of President Alberto Fujimori led to the privatization of the electricity sector in a decade in {{which most of the}} countries in the region underwent a similar process. The restructuring process, articulated in the Electricity Concessions Law (LCE) of 1992, unbundled the vertically integrated state monopoly into generation, transmission and distribution and led the basis for the introduction of private operators and competition for generation and commercialization, with transmission and distribution regulated on the basis of <b>free</b> <b>entry</b> and open access. The 1992 Law was modified by Law No. 26876 (Anti-monopoly and Anti-oligopoly Law) in 1997. The process of concessions and transfer of generation assets to private companies was started in 1994 and relaunched in 2002 as it had not been completed yet.|$|E

25|$|The {{survival}} of Alberta's cattle industry was seriously in doubt {{for most of}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At two points during this time, 1887–1900 and 1914–20, the industry enjoyed great prosperity. The latter boom began when the United States enacted the Underwood Tariff of 1913, allowing Canadian cattle <b>free</b> <b>entry.</b> Exporting Alberta cattle to Chicago markets proved highly profitable for the highest quality livestock. By 1915, most stocker and feeder cattle from the Winnipeg stockyards were exported to the United States, harming Canada's domestic beef market. Several factors, including the severe winter of 1919-20, the end of inflated wartime prices for beef, and the reinstitution of the US tariff on Canadian cattle, all contributed to the collapse of the Alberta cattle market. The boom ultimately worked against Alberta's economic interests because the high prices during that period made it unfeasible to establish local cattle finishing practices.|$|E

In the seventies, when methods of Component Analysis on arrays with more than two indices became popular, tensor rank became a much studied topic. The generic rank may be seen as an upper bound to the number of factors that are needed to construct a random tensor. We explain in this paper how to obtain numerically in the complex field the generic rank of tensors of arbitrary dimensions, based on Terracini's lemma, and compare it with the algebraic results already known in the real or complex fields. In particular, we examine the cases of symmetric tensors, tensors with symmetric matrix slices, complex tensors enjoying Hermitian symmetries, or merely tensors with <b>free</b> <b>entries...</b>|$|R
