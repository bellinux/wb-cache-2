Measurements of electric and magnetic field {{fluctuations in the}} range 20 Hz to 200 kHz were made by two 16 -channel spectrum analyzers on board the IMP 6 satellite. It is found that the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> spectra generally consist of three components, which may occur in any combination: a low frequency component which shows a decrease in spectral density with increasing frequency and which {{is associated with the}} bow shock wave, a high frequency component identified with electron plasma oscillations and an intermediate frequency component. The minimum wavelength of electrostatic waves is found to be about 0. 1 km, with intensity of from 0. 01 to 1. 0 mV/m.

By using a quantum hydrodynamic model for the electrons and holes, we obtain the electron and hole number density perturbations, while the ion and dust rod number density perturbations follow the classical expressions.

We studied possibility of the transfer of neutrals motion energy into the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves.</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>waves</b> could damp in the upper layers of the solar atmosphere and their energy could be transformed into the thermal energy of the solar atmosphere plasma. When studying the plasma dynamics in the low altitudes of the solar atmosphere, we investigated hydrodynamics of the plasma which consists of thee components-electrons, ions and neutrals. In order to study evolution of disturbances of high amplitudes the parametric resonance technique is used. The dispersion relation for the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves</b> excited due tot he motion of neutrals is derived. The frequencies of electromagnetic waves which could be excited due to existence of the acoustic wave are found. The increment of excited <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves</b> are determined. The motion of the neutrals in the lower solar atmosphere, where ionization rate is low, could excite <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves.</b> In the upper solar atmosphere the ionization rate increases and motion of the neutrals could not support <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves</b> and these waves could damp due to the collision of the charged particles.

In this Letter, we demonstrate the effect of nonresonant charged-particle acceleration by an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> propagating across the background magnetic field. We show that in the absence of resonance (i. e., when particle velocities are much smaller than the wave phase velocity) particles can be accelerated by electrostatic waves provided that the adiabaticity of particle motion is destroyed by magnetic field fluctuations. Thus, in a system with stochastic particle dynamics the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> should be damped {{even in the absence of}} Landau resonance. The proposed mechanism is responsible for the acceleration of particles that cannot be accelerated via resonant wave-particle interactions. Simplicity of this straightforward acceleration scenario indicates a wide range of possible applications...|$|E
40|$|A model {{based on}} the {{nonlinear}} coupling of <b>electrostatic</b> plasma <b>waves</b> is proposed to explain the emission of the narrow-band Jovian kilometric radiation (nKOM) observed by the Voyager spacecraft.

Plasma waves propagating into a weak density gradient and reflected at the critical layer interact with the incident waves leading to the electromagnetic emission, which is beamed at large angles {{with respect to the}} background magnetic field. In general, both L-O and R-X mode waves can be generated.

Recent observations by Hawkeye 1 and GEOS 1 have verified the existence of loss-cone distributions in association with the intense <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> events, however, other observations by Hawkeye and ISEE have indicated that loss cones are not always observable during the wave events, and in fact other forms of free energy may also be responsible for the instability.

40|$|Particle {{acceleration}} {{by means}} of nonlinear plasma wave interactions is of great topical interest. Accordingly, {{in this paper we}} focus on the electron surfing process. Self-consistent kinetic simulations, using both relativistic Vlasov and particle-in-cell (PIC) approaches, show here that electrons can be accelerated to highly relativistic energies (up to 100 m(e) c(2)) if the phase speed of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> is mildly relativistic (0. 6 c to 0. 9 c for the magnetic field strengths considered). The acceleration is strong because of relativistic stabilization of the nonlinearly saturated <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave,</b> seen in both relativistic Vlasov and PIC simulations. An inverse power law momentum distribution can arise for the most strongly accelerated electrons. These results are. of relevance to observed rapid changes in the radio synchrotron emission intensities from microquasars, gamma ray bursts and other astrophysical objects that require rapid acceleration mechanisms for electrons. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{electron}} beam-plasma {{system is}} ubiquitous {{in the space}} plasma environment. Here, using a Darwin particle-in-cell method, the excitation of electrostatic and whistler instabilities by a gyrating electron beam is studied in support of recent laboratory experiments. It is assumed that the total plasma frequency ω_pe {{is larger than the}} electron cyclotron frequency Ω_e. The fast-growing <b>electrostatic</b> beam-mode <b>waves</b> saturate in a few plasma oscillations by slowing down and relaxing the electron beam parallel to the background magnetic field. Upon their saturation, the finite amplitude <b>electrostatic</b> beam-mode <b>waves</b> can resonate with the tail of the background thermal electrons and accelerate them to the beam parallel velocity. The slower-growing whistler waves are excited in primarily two resonance modes: (a) through Landau resonance due to the inverted slope of the beam electrons in the parallel velocity; (b) through cyclotron resonance by scattering electrons to both lower pitch angles and smaller energies. It is demonstrated that, for a field-aligned beam, the whistler instability can be suppressed by the electrostatic instability due to a faster energy transfer rate between beam electrons and the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves.</b> Such a competition of growth between whistler and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves</b> depends on the ratio of ω_pe/Ω_e. In terms of <b>wave</b> propagation, beam-generated <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves</b> are confined to the beam region whereas beam-generated whistler waves transport energy away from the beam.
