40|$|Various bi- and trimetallic {{associations}} {{have been}} tested as catalysts for the selective oxidation of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> in aqueous phase. All catalysts were supported on carbon and consisted of a noble metal (Pd or Pt) in association with a second (or third) metal acting as promoter (Ru or Bi). Out of all the possible combinations, some families of catalysts were selected as interesting candidates and a detailed kinetic study was undertaken, {{in order to determine}} the rate constant associated with the formation of <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid.</b> In particular, the BiPt/C catalysts gave very high activity, but low selectivity (due to over-oxidation to oxalic acid), the PdRu/C catalysts gave the highest yields in <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid,</b> but with long reaction times and a marked sensitivity to the preparation procedure, while the trimetallic catalysts gave high yields in relatively short periods of time.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of bismuth in carbon-supported Pd-based catalysts {{is shown to}} increase significantly the catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid.</b> Main side products are glycolic acid resulting from Cannizzaro dismutation and oxalic acid, generated by further oxidation of <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid.</b> Catalysts characterized by different Bi/Pd ratios (with Pd + Bi = 10 wt. %) were prepared according to various experimental procedures from two kinds of precursors, containing either inorganic (chloride, nitrate) or organic (acetate) ligands. The fresh and used catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffractometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When comparing the time dependence of the performances of catalysts having the same overall composition (Bi/Pd = 0. 5), bimetallic catalysts prepared from inorganic ligands or from acetate precursors exhibit comparable activities, while the selectivity towards <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> remains higher for the acetate-type catalysts. In addition, the catalytic performances of Pd-Bi/C catalysts {{were found to be}} dependent upon the catalyst composition, those characterized by molar ratios Bi/Pd between 0. 5 and 1. 0 representing the most adequate compromise between high activity and high selectivity. Complementary experiments were also conducted on the second step of the oxidation scheme, i. e. oxidation of <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> to oxalic acid. The behavior of the bimetallic Pd-Bi catalysts is also compared to that of a commercial trimetallic PdPtBi/C catalyst. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Bimetallic Pd-M/C {{catalysts}} (M = Bi, Pb) for {{the selective}} oxidation of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> were prepared either from inorganic salts or from acetate-type precursors. The bimetallic catalysts {{were found to}} be very active, confirming the promoting ability of both bismuth and lead in this reaction. The magnitude of their effect in terms of activity and selectivity was similar, and dependent on the preparation method and on the composition (optimum for ratios Pd:M = 1). The heavy elements could play their promoter role when introduced in solution in combination with a monometallic Pd/C catalyst. A kinetic treatment of the complex reaction scheme was carried out, and the rate constants for each step were determined. This showed that the reaction proceeds through a real heterogeneous mechanism involving the catalyst for the oxidation of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> and then, in a second step, into oxalic acid. The direct formation of oxalic acid from glyoxal could be neglected, and the formation of glycolic acid was confirmed to depend only on the pH. The absence of deactivation with our catalysts was also demonstrated. Correlations between the rate constants and some surface characteristics of the promoted catalysts were evidenced.

40|$|A peptide {{reacts with}} <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> {{resulting}} in transamination of the N-terminal residue {{to form a}} 2 -oxoacyl group. This further reacts with o-phenylenediamine, leading to a quinoxaline derivative of the original N-terminal amino acid, which is cleavable in mild acid [Dixon & Fields (1972) Methods Enzymol. 25, 409 - 419]. The 2 -oxoacyl peptides are weakly fluorescent with emission maxima around 410 nm and excitation maxima at about 320 nm, depending on the nature and length of the peptide. Formation of the quinoxaline derivative results in a marked increase of fluorescence, with emission maximum of 363 nm when excited at 303 nm. The fluorescence properties of these derivatives change with the nature and length of the peptides and {{are affected by the}} presence of organic solvents, NaCl and denaturants.

40|$|AbstractRecently, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) detects conformational changes in the glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain {{that are associated with}} agonist binding. Combined with flash photolysis, this observation offers the prospect of following conformational changes at individual protein and agonist moieties in parallel and with high temporal resolution. Here, we demonstrate that γ(α-carboxy- 2 -nitrobenzyl) glutamate (caged glutamate) does not interact with the protein, and that following photolysis with UV light the FTIR difference spectrum indicated changes in the protein tertiary and secondary interactions. These changes were similar to those observed for the protein upon addition of free glutamate. Thus, caged glutamate and its photolysis by-products are inert in this system, whereas the released glutamate exhibits full activity. Difference spectra of caged glutamate and of reaction analogs permitted identification of and correction for FTIR signals arising from the photolytic reaction and confirmed that its products are indeed glutamate and 2 -nitrosophenyl <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Au-Pd/C {{catalysts}} were prepared on an activated carbon named SX PLUS (SX+) by fixing the pH of impregnation in aqueous phase at an optimal value for maximizing {{the interactions between}} metals and surface. This bimetallic association leads to highly active catalysts in the oxidation of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> and of glucose into gluconic acid, with the activity correlated to high surface Pd/C ratios measured by XPS {{and the presence of}} small metallic Pd particles, even if gold was present as big crystallites. A cooperative effect between the two metals was evidenced on the yield in carboxylic acids in both reactions, which is believed to arise from an interface between the two metals even if they are mostly present as separated phases. The incorporation of Au on Pd rather than the opposite and the concomitant activation of both metals influence positively the catalytic performance. The use of NaBH(4) as activating agent allowed the most active Au-Pd/C catalyst to be obtained, with similar performances to the best bimetallic Bi-Pd/C catalyst so far but without any metal leaching.

40|$|A reduced {{version of}} the complex aqueous phase {{mechanism}} CAPRAM 3. 0 i (C 3. 0 RED) {{was used in the}} regional chemistry transport model COSMO–MUSCAT in a 2 -D application. Besides sulfate and nitrate production, the mechanism treats a complex HOx-chemistry, transition metal ion chemistry and organic species up to C 4. The effects of the cloud chemistry on the chemical composition of air and particles were investigated. Sensitivity studies were conducted for an urban and a rural air mass. For this purpose simulations with C 3. 0 RED were compared to ones with a simple inorganic aqueous phase mechanism (INORG) and without aqueous phase chemistry. A reduction of the gas phase concentrations of major oxidants was observed especially in the urban environment. Compared to INORG, C 3. 0 RED is always more acidic leading to shifts in several chemical subsystems, (e. g. production of sulfate). Using C 3. 0 RED instead of INORG, differences in sulfate mass of 3 % to − 15 % occurred. The modeled O/C-ratio tends to be higher than observations as C 3. 0 RED does not consider the whole population of organics and no insoluble organic mass.

40|$|Pd/C {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} on SX PLUS activated carbon by a controlled adsorption method {{in which the}} interactions between the Pd precursor and the carbonaceous support in aqueous solution were optimized. This strategy involved (i) determining the surface charge state of the carbon support {{as a function of}} the pH, (ii) establishing adsorption curves for Pd on C to identify the pH windows where maximum adsorption occurs, and (iii) determining the distribution of Pd(II) species in solution from the stability constants of the various compounds involving the ligands H 2 O, OH-, and/or Cl-. It was found that the charge of metal species present in solution, which depends on the pH, influences markedly the adsorption of Pd on carbon. The actual catalysts were then prepared by keeping the pH of the impregnating Pd solution within the optimal adsorption range throughout all synthetic steps, followed by chemical or thermal activation. This optimized preparation method led to highly efficient catalysts for the selective oxidation of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid,</b> with activities superior to that of comparable monometallic materials (prepared by other methods or commercial manufacturing) and equivalent to that of bimetallic (promoted) catalysts. The Pd/C catalysts were characterized by XPS, SEM, TEM, and CO chemisorption, and it was found that the catalytic activity could be correlated to high Pd dispersion in the form of very small particles homogeneously dispersed on the support and to an important degree of Pd reduction...|$|E
40|$|A {{model that}} predicts {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) formation {{based on the}} thermodynamic equilibrium partitioning of secondary organic oxidation products has been developed for implementation into atmospheric models. Hydrophobic secondary products are assumed to partition to an absorbing organic aerosol consisting of primary organic aerosol (POA) and other secondary hydrophobic organics according to an equilibrium partitioning coefficient calculated iteratively for each secondary compound present. The hydrophobic module is evaluated by studying the partitioning of octadecanoic acid to surrogate POA species. As expected, the amount of octadecanoic acid predicted {{to be present in}} the aerosol phase increases as the total amount of absorbing material increases or as the total amount of acid present increases. Hydrophilic secondary compounds partition to an aqueous phase via Henry's law; the fraction of each compound's mass that partitions is determined by its Henry's law constant and its acid dissociation constant(s). The available liquid water content (LWC) of the aerosol is determined iteratively between an inorganic aerosol module and the hydrophilic module, which is evaluated by studying the partitioning of glyoxalic and malic acids. While <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> tends to remain in the gas phase, malic acid partitions strongly to the aqueous phase, with ions being the dominant form in the aqueous phase. As expected, an increase in relative humidity increases the amount of water associated with the organics (ΔLWC), and a lower aerosol pH favors molecular solutes over ionized forms. Increasing pH results in higher effective Henry's law constants for the acids, yielding higher organic aerosol concentrations. Results also indicate that increasing ΔLWC induces additional partitioning of inorganics to the aqueous phase...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of the synthesis of carbon-supported catalysts based on Pd, Pt and/or Au, prepared by impregnation in aqueous solution. These catalysts are active and selective in the oxidations of glyoxal into <b>glyoxalic</b> <b>acid</b> and of glucose into gluconic acid. The {{first part of this}} work is organized in three sections. First, we determined the physicochemical characteristics of the two active carbons used as supports, and particularly their isoelectric point and their point of zero charge. Secondly, we identified the pH windows where the metal adsorption on the support in the aqueous phase was maximized. This has been realized for metal precursors differing in their charge and the oxidation state of the metal and with the two carbonaceous supports. Thirdly, we synthesized mono- and bimetallic catalysts by impregnation in aqueous solution by controlling the synthetic pH throughout the synthesis process, in order to keep it within the optimal adsorption range. The main factors varied during the preparation were the impregnation and activation pH values, the nature of the solubilizing agent, the incorporation order of the metals and the oxidation state of the first metal introduced when adsorbing the second one {{in the case of the}} bimetallic systems. Each sample prepared was characterized by physical and chemical techniques, which showed that the preparation method used in this work can produce materials with a homogeneous distribution of small metal particles of Pt and Pd ( 10 nm) on the external surface of carbon. In the case of Pt/C materials, particles were very small but localised inside the carbon pores and the activity is disappointing. All Au/C catalysts were inactive. However, gold has shown a promoter effect on platinum and palladium in both oxidation reactions. (CHIM 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E
