25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Brian Iles. He was assisted by James Purdum and Peter Shin worked as the supervising directors for the episode. Other crew members that collaborated in the animation of the episode included Deborah Cone who directed the retake of the episode and Kenji Ono who was the {{assistant director of the}} episode. Iles sketched out several clothing ideas for Peter to wear. He got ideas by flipping through catalogs. The name of all the horses at the race track are named after canceled Fox shows from May 2005 until this episode aired. It is a tribute to a similar mentioning of canceled shows when Family <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> back on the air in May 2005 in the episode [...] "North by North Quahog". When the episode got close to airing, MacFarlane kept thinking they should remove the cutaway gag with Matt Damon, due to MacFarlane liking Damon's criticism of Sarah Palin.|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock <b>guy</b> <b>came</b> up to me and was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This <b>guy</b> <b>came</b> out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie (a {{member of}} Hines's big band, along with Charlie Parker) wrote, [...] "The piano {{is the basis}} of modern harmony. This little <b>guy</b> <b>came</b> out of Chicago, Earl Hines. He changed the style of the piano. You can find the roots of Bud Powell, Herbie Hancock, all the guys who came after that. If it hadn't been for Earl Hines blazing the path for the next {{generation}} to come, it's no telling where or how they would be playing now. There were individual variations but the style of ... the modern piano came from Earl Hines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Peter was born, {{his mother}} Thelma went to Mexico City {{to have an}} abortion. However, she gave birth during the procedure, and smuggled him home to Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent his childhood. Peter was raised by Francis and Thelma Griffin in the Roman Catholic faith. However, in [...] "Peter's Two Dads", he discovers that his {{biological}} father is an Irishman named Mickey McFinnigan. Peter visits Mickey, who initially rejects him. Mickey later accepts him as his son after beating him in the [...] "game of drink" [...] (the game of drink referring to matching shots until one passes out). Mickey {{is based on the}} friends of MacFarlane's father. MacFarlane said: [...] "When I was growing up, my father had lots of friends: big, vocal, opinionated New England, Irish Catholics. They were all bursting at the seams with personality, and Family <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> out of a lot of those archetypes that I spent years observing." ...|$|E

5000|$|Writer Nick Hornby {{resonated}} with {{the themes of}} the novel on a personal level. His biggest challenge of the book was that its based around a love triangle, but the triangle {{is not in the}} middle of the book, [...] "the first <b>guy</b> <b>comes</b> in half-way through, and the second <b>guy</b> <b>comes</b> in right before the end. So easily the biggest challenge was to create the character of Jim with as much detail as you can so that he is, in the end, a viable alternative for Ellis [...] and you haven't got very much time or movement to do that." ...|$|R
2500|$|In December, Robin {{finds an}} {{apartment}} for Patrick. Though reluctant at first, {{he decides to}} keep the place. What came next for the twosome has become {{to be known as}} [...] "The Couch Chronicles" [...] where Robin bought a leather couch for Patrick (since he was none too eager to buy furniture for himself, and Robin saying she enjoyed that sort of decorating), Patrick taking back the couch (after his friend Pete Marquez scared him believing Robin had ulterior motives), Patrick reordering the couch, Robin insisting he take it back and finally Robin seeing he liked the couch (this and agreeing to move in with him, which was also a source of argument for the two in between the couch fighting). Robin moved in for one day, and by the next Pete was over trying to get Patrick to leave for Vegas to reprogram him. It wasn't until Noah came by offering his congratulations that Patrick felt backed into a corner and left with Pete for Las Vegas. A hurt Robin called on her girlfriends for what hoped to be a roadtrip but was arrested shortly after when a <b>guy</b> <b>came</b> onto her. Patrick had an unpleasant time in Vegas and called Robin only to find out she had been arrested. After each had a talk with wise Uncle Mac (John J. York), Patrick apologized but Robin was too upset.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Edmonstone {{might well}} retain her opinion when, after the quadrille, <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> {{to tell her}} that he had never seen {{anything}} so delightful; and he entertained Mary Ross with his fresh, joyous pleasure, through the next dance.|$|E

60|$|<b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> {{staggering}} {{in under}} a burden {{that brought a}} whoop from the youngsters and bright gleams to {{the eyes of the}} women. Jean lost nothing of this. How glad he was that he had tarried in San Francisco because of a mental picture of this very reception in far-off wild Arizona.|$|E
60|$|<b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> forward, {{and stood}} still, while {{she looked up}} to the outline of his figure against the window. With a kind of effort he said, with forced calmness--'He'll do now! {{and came to the}} bedside. His face was wet with tears, and her eyes were over-flowing. After a few moments he murmured a few low words of deep thanksgivings, and again there was a silence.|$|E
60|$|They {{were just}} turning to go in, {{when they were}} {{interrupted}} by {{the return of the}} carriage; and before Charles had been helped up the steps, their father and <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> in sight. While Guy went to shut up Bustle, who was too wet for the drawing-room, Mr. Edmonstone came up to the others, kicking away the pebbles before him, and fidgeting with his gloves, as he always did when vexed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Guy.</b> <b>Come,</b> Alibech, let us from hence remove. This is a {{night of}} horror, not of love. From every part I hear a dreadful noise, The vanquished crying, and the victor's joys. I'll to my father's aid and country's fly, And succour both, or in their ruin die. [Exeunt.|$|R

6000|$|... 'This {{makes it}} hard on Charlotte,' thought Amy, while the two girls dragged her off to show her the lamps in the conservatory; and the rest {{attacked}} Mrs. Edmonstone for not having brought Charlotte, reproaching her with hardness of heart of which they had never believed her capable--Lady Eveleen, in especial, talking with that exaggeration of her ordinary manner which her dread of Captain Morville made her assume. Little he recked of her; he was absorbed in observing how far Laura's conduct coincided with Charles's hints. On the first opportunity, {{he asked her to}} dance, and was satisfied with her pleased acquiescence; but the next moment <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> up, and in an eager manner made the same request.|$|E
60|$|If Mrs. Edmonstone's {{patience}} {{was tried}} by the {{preparation for the}} hunt in the morning, it was no less her lot to hear {{of it in the}} evening. <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> home in the highest spirits, pouring out his delight to every one, with animation and power of description giving all he said a charm. The pleasure did not lose by repetition; he was more engrossed by it every time; and no one could be more pleased with his ardour than Mr. Edmonstone, who, proud of him and his riding, gave a sigh to past hopes of poor Charles, and promoted the hunting with far more glee that he had promoted the reading.|$|E
6000|$|Charles had not {{over-estimated}} Philip's {{readiness of}} self adaptation. Charlotte {{had been very}} happy with him, talking over the [...] "Lady of the Lake", which she had just read, and being enlightened, partly to her satisfaction, partly to her disappointment, {{as to how much}} was historical. He listened good-naturedly to a fit of rapture, and threw in a few, not too many, discreet words of guidance to the true principles of taste; and next told her about an island, in a pond at Stylehurst, which had been by turns Ellen's isle and Robinson Crusoe's. It was {{at this point in the}} conversation that <b>Guy</b> <b>came</b> in sight, riding slowly, his reins on his horse's neck, whistling a slow, melancholy tune, his eyes fixed on the sky, and so lost in musings, that he did not perceive them till Philip arrested him by calling out, 'That is a very bad plan. No horse is to be trusted in that way, especially such a spirited one.' ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the way to}} jail, <b>Guy</b> <b>comes</b> {{across a}} clue, a {{newspaper}} personal ad from [...] "Half a Dime" [...] asking to be contacted at a certain location.
