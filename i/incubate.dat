5|$|In the 21st century, Silkies {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{ubiquitous}} ornamental breeds of chicken. They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers, and are also commonly used to <b>incubate</b> and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like ducks and geese and game birds such as quail and pheasants.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents <b>incubate</b> {{and care for the}} young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them <b>incubate</b> their eggs.|$|E
50|$|Accumulated thermal {{units are}} used, for example, in {{aquaculture}} {{to track the}} development of <b>incubating</b> salmonid eggs. Eggs <b>incubated</b> at 10 °C develop {{twice as fast as}} eggs <b>incubated</b> at 5 °C.|$|R

We compared artificially <b>incubated</b> and repatriated hatchlings released {{within and outside the}} maternal alligator’s home range with naturally <b>incubated</b> hatchlings captured and released within the maternal alligator’s home range on Lake Apopka, Lake Griffin, and Orange Lake in Florida. We used probability of recapture and total length at approximately nine months after hatching as indices of survival and growth rates. Artificially <b>incubated</b> hatchlings released outside of the maternal alligator’s home range had lower recapture probabilities than either naturally <b>incubated</b> hatchlings or artificially <b>incubated</b> hatchlings released near the original nest site.

5|$|Nests {{are usually}} built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, {{although}} sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may {{be built in}} a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for compactness. Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but these records may reflect confusion with the Spanish sparrow. The average clutch contains three to five eggs. Both sexes <b>incubate</b> the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males <b>incubate</b> for shorter periods and less often. Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and brings it to their nestlings, he less often brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she {{will remain in the}} nest and continuously <b>incubate</b> them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The female {{develops}} a brood patch of bare skin and plays {{the main part}} in incubating the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly <b>incubate</b> them. The female spends the night incubating during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14days, and exceptionally {{for as many as}} 17 or as few as 9. The length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} uninjured and heat-injured Aeromonas hydrophila <b>incubated</b> at 5 degrees C (22 days) and 30 degrees C (31 h) under air, N 2, and CO 2 was investigated. At 30 degrees C, the growth {{patterns}} of cells on {{brain heart infusion}} agar <b>incubated</b> under air and N 2 were similar, although slight differences in the lengths of the lag phases and the final populations were detected. The lag phases of cells <b>incubated</b> under air and N 2 were substantially longer at 5 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. The population of uninjured A. hydrophila <b>incubated</b> at 5 degrees C under air and N 2 remained constant, whereas the number of injured cells declined before the exponential growth phase. Growth at 5 degrees C was enhanced when uninjured and heat-injured A. hydrophila were <b>incubated</b> under N 2. At 30 degrees C, cells <b>incubated</b> under CO 2 exhibited noticeably longer lag phases and lower growth rates than did cells <b>incubated</b> under air and N 2.

30|$|The {{apoptosis}} of {{the cancer}} cell was further determined by Hoechst 33342 staining protocol. Briefly, EC 9706 was seeded in a 12 -well plate and <b>incubated</b> for 24  h. The cells were <b>incubated</b> with free 5 -FU, LY, 5 -FU[*]+[*]LY and FLNP, respectively and further <b>incubated</b> for 24  h (1  μg of equivalent drug concentration). The cells were fixed with 2 % PFA and <b>incubated</b> with Hoechst 33342 (1  μg/ml) for 15  min. The cell apoptosis was then observed under a fluorescence microscope.|$|R
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to <b>incubate,</b> and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest {{within a day or}} so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a {{farmyard}} which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to <b>incubate</b> them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can <b>incubate</b> in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E
30|$|However, {{ultrasound}} irradiation {{resulted in}} a marked increase in DOX uptake in MCF- 7 cells <b>incubated</b> with DOX-NBs; DOX-NBs could deliver more DOX into MCF- 7 cells {{with the help of}} ultrasonic irradiation. In contrast, the DOX uptake in MCF- 7 cells <b>incubated</b> with free DOX was only slightly increased under ultrasonic irradiation. The results suggested that the uptake of DOX in MCF- 7 cells <b>incubated</b> with DOX-NBs was much higher than that of the cells <b>incubated</b> with free DOX under ultrasonic irradiation.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} the active GadB in broth at 50  °C, the sample was <b>incubated</b> at 50  °C for 36  h and GadB activity was measured at different time points, using the sample <b>incubated</b> at 37  °C as control. As shown in Fig.  4 b, GadB activity decreased with time and at all time points, residual GadB activity in the sample <b>incubated</b> at 50  °C was less than the sample <b>incubated</b> at 37  °C. After 6  h incubation, 29.5 and 16.9  % residual GadB activity were remained for samples <b>incubated</b> at 37 and 50  °C, respectively; after 36  h incubation, only 17.3 and 5.9  % residual GadB activity were remained for samples <b>incubated</b> at 37 and 50  °C, respectively. This indicated that extracellular GadB in BL 21 (DE 3)/pET 20 b-torA-gadB was more stable at 37  °C than at 50  °C.|$|R

Blood agar plates containing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (23. 75 and 1. 25 mirograms per ml, respectively) detected only 70 % of group A streptocci when <b>incubated</b> aerobically and 84 % when <b>incubated</b> anaerobically...|$|R
5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes <b>incubate</b> but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munia {{clutches}} usually contain 4 to 6 eggs, but {{can contain}} up to 10. Both sexes build the nest and <b>incubate</b> the eggs, which hatch in 10 to 16 days. Juveniles typically fledge in three weeks. Both sexes may reach sexual maturity {{as early as}} 7 months after birth in captivity. In the wild, however, since maturation may be impacted by variable daylight and humidity, both sexes can take between 12 and 18 months to reach sexual maturity depending {{on the time of}} year. Scaly-breasted munias have a typical life expectancy of 6 to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the Eurasian crag martin to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky crag martin. Both adults <b>incubate</b> the eggs for 13–19 days to hatching, and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the average}} <b>incubated</b> mutual fund outperforms non-incubated funds {{by up to}} 3. 41 % annually, {{a large number of}} {{released}} funds underperform during incubation. We find that launching underperforming <b>incubated</b> mutual funds is associated with objectives that are attracting large inflows and lower relative risk. These findings are consistent with the use of incubation to maximize fee revenue through means other than the flow-to-performance relationship. We also find that underperforming <b>incubated</b> funds are <b>incubated</b> longer, suggesting that families release funds opportunistically to take advantage of outperformance when it is observed...|$|R

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents <b>incubate</b> the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E
5|$|The house martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings, {{constructing}} feather- or grass-lined mud nests. The typical clutch is two {{or three}} white eggs; both parents build the nest, <b>incubate</b> the eggs and feed the chicks. These martins are aerial hunters of small insects such as flies and aphids. Despite their flying skills the Delichon martins are sometimes caught by fast-flying birds of prey. They may carry fleas or internal parasites. None of the species are considered threatened, although widespread reductions in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe. This decline is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays {{a clutch}} of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days for the female to <b>incubate</b> the eggs, and the young fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. It flies with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E
40|$|Leaf litter {{decomposes}} on {{the surface}} of soil in natural systems and element transfers between litter and soil are commonly found. However, how litter and soil organic matter (SOM) interact to influence decomposition rate and nitrogen (N) release remains unclear. Leaf litter and mineral soil of top 0 - 5 cm from six forests were <b>incubated</b> separately, or together with litter on soil surface at 25 A degrees C for 346 days. Litter N remaining and soil respiration rate were repeatedly measured during incubation. Litter carbon (C) and mass losses and mineral N concentrations in litter and soil were measured at the end of incubation. Net N transfer from soil to litter was found in all litters when <b>incubated</b> with soil. Litter <b>incubated</b> with soil lost more C than litter <b>incubated</b> alone after 346 days. For litters with initial C: N ratios lower than 52, net N-min after 346 days was 100 % higher when <b>incubated</b> with soil than when <b>incubated</b> alone. Litter net N-min rate was negatively related to initial C: N ratio when <b>incubated</b> with soil but not when <b>incubated</b> alone. Soil respiration rate and net N-min rate did not differ between soil <b>incubated</b> with litter and soil <b>incubated</b> alone. We conclude that soils may enhance litter decomposition rate by net N transfer from soil to litter. Our results together with studies on litter mixture decomposition suggest that net N transfer between decomposing organic matter with different N status may be common and may significantly influence decomposition and N release. The low net N-min rate during litter decomposition along with the small size of litter N pool compared to soil N pool suggest that SOM rather than decomposing litter is the major contributor to plant mineral N supply...|$|R
40|$|Modified Moore's swabs, {{placed in}} sewers for 5 days, {{were used to}} {{concentrate}} salmonellas from sewage. Duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were <b>incubated</b> at 41 and 37 ° C. respectively. Salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were <b>incubated</b> at 41 ° C. However, when equal portions of the same swabs were <b>incubated</b> at 37 ° C., only 22 % of them yielded Salmonella organisms. These results indicate an advantage in <b>incubating</b> the selenite broths at 41 ° C. rather than 37 ° C. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage...|$|R

5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building a neat half-cup mud nest {{with a soft}} lining. Both adults <b>incubate</b> the two to four eggs and feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large population mean that there are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, <b>incubate</b> the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, <b>incubate</b> the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
40|$|Five-mm {{sections}} of elongation zones which were cut from primary roots or coleoptiles of Zea mays were <b>incubated</b> for designated periods with various concentrations of IAA. In vitro protein phosphorylation in the soluble fractions prepared from these sections was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation of proteins in {{sections of}} primary roots <b>incubated</b> for 20 or 40 min {{in the presence}} of 10 − 7 M IAA was greater than that in the sections <b>incubated</b> in the absence of IAA. The phosphorylation of proteins in sections of primary roots <b>incubated</b> for 20 min or 2 h {{in the presence of}} 10 − 8, 10 − 7 or 10 − 6 M IAA was higher than that in the sections <b>incubated</b> in the absence of IAA. An incuba-tion for 20 min or 2 h with 10 − 4 M IAA inhibited the phosphorylation of proteins in sections of primary roots. The growth of the sections of primary roots <b>incubated</b> for 2 h in the presence of 10 − 7 M IAA or higher concentrations was lower than that of the sections <b>incubated</b> in the absence of IAA. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of proteins which was increased by IAA treatment is independent of an inhibition of the growth induced by IAA in maize primary roots. The phosphorylation of proteins in sections of coleoptiles <b>incubated</b> for 10, 20 or 40 min in the presence of 10 − 7 or 10 − 5 M IAA was equal to that in the sections <b>incubated</b> in the absence of IAA.
