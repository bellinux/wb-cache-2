The yoga postures with breathing and cleansing <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters, wherein the text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body.|$|E
5|$|When {{initially}} established, the F-FDTL land force comprised two light infantry battalions, {{each with}} an authorised strength of 600 personnel. Each battalion has three rifle companies, a support {{company and a}} headquarters company. Although the army is small, the guerrilla tactics employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the Indonesian Armed Forces were effective against overwhelming numbers {{and it has the}} potential to form a credible deterrent against invasion. The Army's current doctrine is focused on low-intensity infantry combat tactics as well as counter-insurgency tasks. Most of the force's training and operations are conducted at the section level, and company or battalion-sized <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> rare.|$|E
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E

5|$|The <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> {{intended}} as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
5|$|The text classifies {{three levels}} of breath regulation, namely Puraka (पूरक, satisfying), Kumbhaka (कुम्भक, prominent) and Rechaka (रेचक, purging). The Puraka {{exercise}} is shortest and counts twelve moments (matras, music beats); the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty-four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty-six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas {{for the purposes of}} energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body, asserting that, when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, asserting that the best <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> those that make one feel lightness in the body and relaxation in the mind.|$|E

40|$|Breathing during <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} physiological function for maintaining homeostasis of blood gases. In general, ventilatory response during <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be}} automatically controlled depending on exercise intensity and the corresponding perturbation of neurohumoral factors. However, in awake humans, the act of performing physical <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> coupled with conscious elements such as motivation, effort, and emotions. This means that ventilatory control during <b>exercise</b> cannot <b>be</b> explained well enough by the automatic control system. In this review article, previous works in which behavioral control of <b>exercise</b> hyperpnea <b>was</b> examined are overviewed...|$|R

25|$|If {{religious}} <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> {{held to be}} an impermissible {{activity in}} schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage....
