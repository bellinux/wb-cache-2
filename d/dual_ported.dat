5000|$|The XT/370 was an IBM Personal Computer XT (System Unit 5160) {{with three}} custom 8-bit cards. The {{processor}} card (370PC-P), contained two modified Motorola 68000 chips (which could emulate most S/370 fixed-point instructions and non-floating-point instructions), and an Intel 8087 coprocessor [...] modified {{to emulate the}} S/370 floating point instructions. The second card (370PC-M), which connected to the first with a unique card back connector contained 512 KiB of memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), was a 3270 terminal emulator required to download system software from the host mainframe. The XT/370 computer booted into DOS, then ran the VM/PC Control Program. The card's memory space added additional system memory, so the first 256 KiB (motherboard) memory {{could be used to}} move data to the 512 KiB expansion card. The expansion memory was <b>dual</b> <b>ported,</b> and provided an additional 384 KiB to the XT Machine bringing the total RAM on the XT side to 640 KiB. The memory arbitrator could bank switch the second 128 KiB bank on the card to other banks, allowing the XT Intel 8088 processor to address all the RAM on the 370PC-M card. Besides the 416 KB of usable RAM for S/370 applications, the XT/370 also supported up to 4 MB of virtual memory using the hard drive as its paging device.|$|E
5000|$|Later P6 {{implementations}} (Pentium M, Yonah) introduced [...] "Shadow Register File Architecture" [...] that {{expanded to}} 2 copies of <b>dual</b> <b>ported</b> integer architectural register file and consist with context switch (between future&retirered file and scaled file {{using the same}} trick that used between integer and floating point). It was in order to solve the register bottleneck that exist in x86 architecture after micro op fusion is introduced, {{but it is still}} have 8 entries 32 bit architectural registers for total 32 bytes in capacity per file (segment register and instruction pointer remain within the file, though they are inaccessible by program) as speculative file. The second file is served as a scaled shadow register file, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently. Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of register file, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another register file with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file. The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP register file (8 entries MM/XMM) shared with three decoder and FP register does not have shadow register file with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function. Processor after P6, the architectural register file are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal register file that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer. However, in Core 2 it is now within a unit called [...] "register alias table" [...] RAT, located with instruction allocator but have same size of register size as retirement. Core 2 increased the inner ring bus to 24 bytes (allow more than 3 instructions to be decoded) and extended its register file from <b>dual</b> <b>ported</b> (one read/one write) to quad ported (two read/two write), register still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and 32 bytes (not including 6 segment register and one instruction pointer as they are unable to be access in the file by any code/instruction) in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128 bytes size per file. From Pentium M as its pipeline port and decoder increased, but they're located with allocator table instead of code buffer. Its FP XMM register file are also increase to quad ported (2 read/2 write), register still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow register file architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions.|$|E

On P6, the instruction independently {{can be stored}} and executed in parallel in early pipeline stages before decoding into micro-operations and renaming in out-of-order execution. Beginning with P6, all register files do not require additional cycle to propagate the data, register files like architectural and floating point are located between code buffer and decoders, called [...] "retire buffer", Reorder buffer and OoOE and connected within the ring bus (16 bytes). The register file itself still remains one x86 register file and one x87 stack and both serve as retirement storing. Its x86 register file increased to <b>dual</b> <b>ported</b> to increase bandwidth for result storage. Registers like debug/condition code/control/unnamed/flag were stripped from the main register file and placed into individual files between the micro-op ROM and instruction sequencer. Only inaccessible registers like the segment register are now separated from the general-purpose register file (except the instruction pointer); they are now located between the scheduler and instruction allocator, {{in order to facilitate}} register renaming and out-of-order execution. The x87 stack was later merged with the floating-point register file after a 128-bit XMM register debuted in Pentium III, but the XMM register file is still located separately from x86 integer register files.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” The memory {{subsystem}} {{is a major}} contributor to the performance, power, and area of complex SoCs used in feature rich multimedia products. Hence, memory architecture of the embedded DSP is complex and usually custom designed with multiple banks of single-ported or <b>dual</b> <b>ported</b> on-chip scratch pad memory and multiple banks of off-chip memory. Building software for such large complex memories with many of the software components as individually optimized software IPs is a big challenge. In order to obtain good performance and a reduction in memory stalls, the data buffers of the application need to be placed carefully in different types of memory. In this paper we present a unified framework (MODLEX) that combines different data layout optimizations to address the complex DSP memory architectures. Our method models the data layout problem as multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) with performance and power being the objectives and presents a set of solution points which is attractive from a platform design viewpoint. While most of the work in the literature assumes that performance and power are non-conflicting objectives, our work demonstrates that there is significant trade-off (up to 70 %) that is possible between power and performance.
