5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from {{independent}} game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and encouragement from Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture <b>editors,</b> model <b>editors,</b> and rival level <b>editors</b> like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, <b>editors</b> of Shakespeare's plays have divided {{them into}} five acts.

Modern <b>editors</b> generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.|$|E
