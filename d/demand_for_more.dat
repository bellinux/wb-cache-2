Transportation agencies in each jurisdiction select {{the location of}} the rental stations, as well as the number of bike docks, depending on planners' estimates of local demand. Most of the system's users live in or near the city center; stations in the poorer eastern portion of the city are comparatively underused.|$|E
5|$|On this tour, Chappell {{clashed with}} cricket administrators over pay and {{conditions}} for the first time. The South African authorities requested that an extra Test {{be added to the}} fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented. Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} trishaw {{services}} although this service is dying fast {{and is not}} as extensive as {{the ones in the}} states of Malacca and Penang. In Kuala Terengganu, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by trishaws (beca in Malay). Trishaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanisation has increased <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling trishaw numbers. Today, trishaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu. The city's only taxi rank stands nearby to the city's bus terminal.|$|E

50|$|The Gravensteengroep is a {{group of}} Flemish artists and intellectuals {{established}} to promote the Flemish <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> autonomy. The group comprises persons of varying political views, who do share basic values such as democracy and human rights. Their main concern is that the Flemish <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> autonomy are often associated with extremism and nationalism, which they argue is not true. The Gravensteengroep's modus operandi consists of publishing manifesto's, which explain why they see the Flemish demands as reasonable and just.|$|R
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company {{managed to survive}} on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{called for}} {{meetings}} between the involved parties {{to work out}} the exact territorial and remunerative details, to be convened at Rastatt. The French <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> territory than originally agreed upon stalled negotiations. Despite their agreement at Campo Formio and the ongoing meetings at Rastatt, the two primary combatants of the First Coalition, France and Austria, were highly suspicious of the other's motives. Several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories and the Rastatt delegates could not, or would not, orchestrate the transfer of agreed upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay tribute to France, followed by the Neapolitan rebellion, invasion by France, and the subsequent establishment of the Parthenopaean Republic. Republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic with military support, led to the establishment of the Helvetic Republic.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E

5|$|Originally a garden, the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in {{the early}} 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E
