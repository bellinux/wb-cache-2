5|$|As {{the houses}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> age, {{and as the}} number of {{students}} wishing to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the properties the university owns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto,</b> there are also student houses located in two other neighborhoods: the Darkside—or North Student Neighborhood, as it is referred to by the university—and Holy Angels. Once considered a single neighborhood and connected by the north-south Alberta Street, the areas were separated when the Thomas J. Frericks Center and a new formal entrance were added. Alberta Street now acts as the main thoroughfare for the Darkside, while the street has been rerouted and renamed College Park Avenue in the Holy Angels neighborhood. It is {{cut off from the}} portion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto,</b> renamed Frericks Way.|$|E
5|$|The general {{opinion was}} {{that we were going to}} remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then {{everything}} would be as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto– it was illusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{new wave}} of {{construction}} brings the university's stock of houses to 328, including several duplexes. Not including these new additions, as of 2005, the university owned 225 houses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto,</b> with the rest on the Darkside, {{the other half of}} the University of Dayton campus. Additionally, 73 houses in the neighborhood were owned by private landlords and rented to UD students.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Germans allowed Gens some {{privileges}} not {{accorded to}} other Vilnius Jews. He {{was not required}} to wear the yellow badge of the Star of David {{on the front and}} back of his clothes; instead he wore a white and blue armband with the Star of David. He was allowed to enter and leave the ghetto at any time, and his daughter was not required to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> even though other half-Jews were confined within the ghetto. Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.|$|E

2500|$|In Poland's {{cities and}} larger towns, the Nazi {{occupiers}} created ghettos {{that were designed}} to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling of food into <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> and smuggling of goods out of <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> organized by Jews and Poles, was {{the only means of}} subsistence of <b>the</b> Jewish population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghettos.</b> <b>The</b> price difference between the Aryan [...] and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers would come <b>in</b> and out <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> usually at night or at dawn, through openings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls, underground tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes.|$|R
5|$|The Jews of the Papal States, {{numbering}} 15,000 {{or so in}} 1858, were {{grateful to}} Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on that week's Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. He had also torn down {{the gates of the}} Roman Ghetto despite the objections of many Christians. However, Jews remained under many restrictions and the vast majority still lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, {{so there was no}} way to create a unified strategy. Few <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
50|$|Holocaust {{scholars}} draw {{a distinction}} between concentration camps (described in this article) and extermination camps, which were established by Nazi Germany for the industrial-scale mass murder of Jews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> by way of gas chambers.|$|R

5|$|Cottilo {{would be}} elected to office from Italian East Harlem between 1912 and 1922. Raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> he was chosen by the largely Italian {{neighborhood}} and continued to depend upon their political support throughout his political career. He {{was a member of}} the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 28th District) in 1913, 1915 and 1916. He drew support from the Citizens Union and was identified for two notable pieces of legislation; pensions for widows and the Workmen's Compensations Law. He advocated for women's suffrage, gun control, the end of the death penalty and school lunch programs.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E

50|$|In 1939, 19% of the town's {{population}} was Jewish. During World War II, the Germans captured the Jews and imprisoned them in 2 different ghettos, where they suffered from starvation, disease and abuse. On April 12, 1942, 1,200 Jews were murdered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghettos.</b>|$|R
50|$|Around {{one million}} Jews {{were killed by}} <b>the</b> Einsatzgruppen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{occupied}} Soviet territories, an approximate figure, since the Einsatzgruppen reports did not always survive the war. Many more died through execution or of disease and malnutrition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> of Poland before they could be deported.|$|R
5|$|Gens and the Judenrat in {{the larger}} ghetto {{were aware of the}} executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when {{survivors}} began returning to the ghetto. The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> by late December 1941 or early January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before {{the formation of}} the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> and believed {{that it was possible to}} save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.|$|E
50|$|Gitterman {{continued}} his activities {{in support of}} Jewish self-help in Warsaw even after funding from the JDC ceased. He was actively involved <b>in</b> operations of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> underground, including clandestine efforts to document <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> experience (code-named Oneg Shabbat). As reports reached <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> of <b>the</b> mass murder of Jews in Poland, Gitterman helped raise funds to purchase weapons for the Jewish Fighting Organization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{pressing}} need for foreign manpower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war industry, the Jewish laborers from Poland were originally spared, and were (for a time) either kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> such as <b>the</b> one <b>in</b> Warsaw (which became {{a concentration camp}} after <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto</b> Uprising), or sent to labor camps such as Majdanek where they worked primarily at the Steyr-Daimler-Puch weapons/munitions factory.|$|R

5|$|While Gens was {{in control}} of the ghetto, he {{continued}} to oversee the sanitary and health efforts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> running that part of the ghetto administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of the ghetto administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took place {{under the supervision of}} German officials, who did not intervene.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
