2500|$|Beginning in the 1950s {{dams and}} {{thousands}} of kilometres of dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thus {{cut off from the}} main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from [...] in the 1950s to [...] in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>water</b> conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable [...] "iron barrier" [...] that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the Baiji Dolphin, finless porpoise and the Yangtze Alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{relationships}} between trophic conditions and viral dynamics have been widely explored in different pelagic environments, {{there have been few}} attempts at independent estimates of both viral production and decay. In this study, we investigated factors controlling the balance between viral production and decay along a trophic gradient in the north Adriatic basin, providing independent estimates of these variables and determining the relative importance of nanoflagellate grazing and viral life strategies. Increasing trophic conditions induced an increase of bacterioplankton growth rates and of the burst sizes. As a result, <b>eutrophic</b> <b>waters</b> displayed highest rates of viral production, which considerably exceeded observed rates of viral decay (up to 2. 9 × 109 VLP liter− 1 h− 1). Viral decay was also higher in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>waters,</b> where it accounted for ca. 40 % of viral production, and dropped significantly to 1. 3 to 10. 7 % in oligotrophic waters. These results suggest that viral production and decay rates may not necessarily be balanced in the short term, resulting in a net increase of viruses in the system. In <b>eutrophic</b> <b>waters</b> nanoflagellate grazing, dissolved-colloidal substances, and lysogenic infection were responsible together for the removal of ca. 66 % of viral production versus 17 % in oligotrophic waters.

5000|$|Another key {{characteristic}} of the habitats, which is influential {{to the survival of}} Gulf killifish, is the amount of dissolved oxygen.

[...] These conditions may last from several hours to several days. [...] Gulf killifish use different ways to cope with low oxygen conditions, including behavioral changes, physiological changes, and changes to biochemical processes. [...] One main threat because it decreases the levels of dissolved oxygen is the Louisiana dead zone, which causes a large number of fish killed every year. [...] This dead zone results from nutrient- and chemical-rich water from the Mississippi River Valley basin entering the Gulf of Mexico. This <b>eutrophic</b> <b>water</b> ultimately leads to no dissolved oxygen remaining within the ecosystem because of increased activities of algae and decomposers.

In this study, we applied a proteomics approach to investigate the protein dynamics of water hyacinth under three eutrophication levels. The results suggested that proteins with various functions, including response to stress, N and P metabolic pathways, synthesis and secretion, photosynthesis, biosynthesis, and energy metabolism, were involved in regulating water hyacinth to endure the excess-nutrient environment, remove N and P, and inhibit algal growth.

Callitriche includes macrophyte species which are widespread and particularly sensitive to environmental cues. High plasticity and morphological variability of these plants have carried to great difficulties in their correct taxonomic determination. Diverse populations of Callitriche of the Po Valley (Northern Italy) have been studied. Plants of Callitriche spp. were collected in Northern Italian rivers with mesotrophic and <b>eutrophic</b> <b>waters</b> and their morphological, karyological, and molecular features were analyzed. Populations with a different chromosome number equal to 10, 18, or 20 were found. Chloroplast rbcL DNA showed the presence of three different sequences.

At ecological level, only one taxon lives in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>waters,</b> while all the others live in mesotrophic ones.

Large extents of <b>eutrophic</b> <b>waters</b> were always accompanied by colder upwelling waters, indicative of the tight coupling of chlorophyll with upwelling activities. The phytoplankton growth lagged the upwelling activities by about 2 days. The temporal changes of upwelling events were found different in the northern and southern Taiwan Strait. A short relaxation of upwelling probably occurred between early and mid-August in the northern portion. One strong upwelling event likely lasted from early through mid-August, peaking before August 13 in the southern portion. It resulted in chlorophyll enhancement but with different timing of chlorophyll reaching maximum values in these two upwelling zones. The duration of one upwelling event in the western Taiwan Strait in August was estimated to be about 12 days. It seems that two distinctive northern and southern upwelling systems in the western Taiwan Strait were connected with, and affected by, the East China Sea and the South China Sea, respectively.
