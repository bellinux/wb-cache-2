5|$|When Kurt Waldheim {{was named}} {{secretary-general}} of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that {{there was no evidence}} that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine Profil published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal all of the facts about his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while {{there was no evidence that}} Waldheim had committed atrocities, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from entering the United States.|$|E

In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying [...] "Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers." ...|$|E
500|$|Flanagan {{promoted}} the Marngrook theory {{in his novel}} The Call (1996), an historical imagining into Wills' life, and argued in an essay addressed to Wills that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> Aboriginal games {{as it was in}} his nature to play: [...] "There's two things about you everybody seems to have agreed on—you'd drink with anyone and you'd play with anyone." [...] He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendent of Horace Wills (Tom's brother), who said a family story had been passed down about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy. Family historian T. S. Wills Cooke disputed that such a story existed, calling the Marngrook link [...] "a bridge too far" [...] and a politically correct attempt to rewrite hsitory. Despite a lack of hard evidence in its favour, the theory is often presented as factual. In Moyston, the self-proclaimed birthplace of Australian football, stands an AFL-endorsed monument, unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills' childhood in the area playing Marngrook.|$|E

500|$|Before {{his home}} crowd at Headingley, Hutton's first match as captain was a success, {{although}} his tactics were cautious. The Wisden correspondent wrote: [...] "For Hutton the match {{was a personal}} triumph. Tradition had been broken... and <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that {{the eyes of the}} world were upon him. He did not falter and his astute leadership earned him many admirers". England won comfortably, although Hutton failed with the bat. In the second Test, Hutton scored 150 out of a total of 537, and although cautious once more, the Wisden editor believed his captaincy helped to secure a win. Following this match, the selectors appointed Hutton captain for the rest of the series. In the final two Tests, Hutton scored 104 and 86 and his bowlers dominated the Indian batsmen. The drawn final Test was ruined by weather, but England won the four match series 3–0, and Hutton scored 399 runs at an average of 79.80; in the whole summer he scored 2,567 first-class runs at an average of 61.11 with eleven centuries.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, for {{his role}} in the Nanking Massacre, he was convicted and sentenced to death under Count 55, {{charging}} defendants with having [...] "deliberately and recklessly disregarded their legal duty to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches" [...] of the laws of war. The IMTFE delivered the following verdict on November 12, 1948.The Tribunal is satisfied that Matsui knew what was happening. He did nothing, or nothing effective to abate these horrors. He did issue orders before the capture of the city enjoining propriety of conduct upon his troops and later he issued further orders to the same purport. These orders were of no effect as is now known, and as <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known...</b> He was in command of the Army responsible for these happenings. He knew of them. He had the power, as he had the duty, to control his troops and to protect the unfortunate citizens of Nanking. He must be held criminally responsible for his failure to discharge this duty.Historian Yuma Totani notes that this verdict represents [...] "one of the earliest precedents for command responsibility in the history of international law." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the European shows, {{critical}} reaction was generally quite favorable. [...] The Irish Times said Springsteen showing {{no signs of}} age as he neared his 60th birthday, despite taking a spill during his stage antics in rainy Dublin, and remarked upon how [...] "a set that features so many songs about the toughness of life ... can be delivered with such extraordinary verve {{that by the time}} you leave, you’re very glad to be alive." [...] The Independent echoed the sentiment in reviewing the Hyde Park show, writing that he showed [...] "the vigour of a frontman a third of his age" [...] and that [...] "Springsteen's intensity was staggering from first powerful vocal to final thrashed-out chord." [...] The Bath Chronicle saluted Springsteen's performance at Glastonbury, saying [...] "As all the tickets were sold before Springsteen was even confirmed on the bill, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> he was facing something very rare for him – the musical equivalent of a sporting 'away match' where not everyone was necessarily a worshipper at the altar of Bruce." [...] They concluded that Springsteen gave [...] "a performance of passion, exuberance, exhilaration and musical majesty" [...] while sticking with his standard tour set list and not resorting to playing many of his better-known hits.|$|E

[...] One thing <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> was that despite living under segregation, other members of the Derricotte family had distinguished themselves as educated professionals. A black newspaper, the Philadelphia Tribune, did a tribute to the family in November 1944, mentioning that Eugene's father was a veteran of World War I where he fought in France before returning to Defiance to open his business, marry and raise a family. [...] Eugene had an uncle (J. Flipper Derricotte) who was an attorney in Washington DC, and an aunt Juliette who had been a dean at Fisk College in Nashville TN before dying tragically after an automobile accident, when the nearby white hospital refused to admit her.

2500|$|He {{passed out}} briefly, {{and his second}} pilot, Flight Sergeant L.A. Hyder, who was also seriously wounded, managed {{to regain control of}} the {{plunging}} plane at 800 feet and drop the bombs, before receiving first aid from the other crew. Middleton regained consciousness in time to help recover control of his stricken bomber. [...] Middleton was in great pain, was barely able to see, was losing blood from wounds all over his body, and could breathe only with difficulty.

[...] During the return flight he frequently said over the intercom [...] "I'll make the English Coast. I'll get you home". After four hours of agony and having been further damaged by flak over France, Middleton reached the coast of England with five minutes of fuel reserves. [...] At this point he turned the aircraft parallel to the coast and ordered his crew to bail out. Five of his crew did so and landed safely, but his front gunner and flight engineer remained with him to try to talk him into a forced landing on the coast, something <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> would have risked extensive civilian casualties. He steered the aircraft out over the sea, off Dymchurch, and ordered the last two crew to bail out. They then too bailed out, but did not survive the night in the English Channel. Middleton stayed with the aircraft, which crashed into the Channel. [...] His body was washed ashore on 1 February 1943.|$|E

As Charles Carmody (the then-assistant ATC director) testified during the investigation, neither flight was legally under the control of ATC when they collided, as both were [...] "off airways".

[...] This he argued {{despite the fact that}} the proclamation for the pirates' capture specifically warned that Every's crew could [...] "probably be known and discovered by the great quantities of Gold and Silver of forreign Coines which they have with them." [...] In the meantime, however, Every's men were free to frequent the town's pubs. Nevertheless, the crew soon found themselves disappointed with the Bahamas; the islands were sparsely populated, meaning that there was virtually no place to spend the money they had pirated. For the next several months the pirates spent most of their time living in relative boredom. By now Trott had stripped the Fancy of everything valuable, and it was lost after being violently driven against some rocks, perhaps deliberately on the orders of Trott who was eager to rid himself of a key piece of evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Hutton's {{first series}} as captain was against India, {{although}} England were far {{too strong for}} the tourists in this series. Hutton was only named as captain for the first Test, rather than the whole series, {{to the surprise of}} many commentators. The Wisden editor approved of his performance as captain, particularly in the improvement in the English fielding. The only reservation was over Hutton's cautious approach. His first Test was before his home crowd of Headingley, and the Wisden correspondent wrote: [...] "For Hutton the match was a personal triumph. Tradition had been broken with his appointment as a professional captain of England and <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that {{the eyes of the world}} were upon him. He did not falter and his astute leadership earned him many admirers and, perhaps, guided future policy." [...] England won by seven wickets, with Fred Trueman reducing India to none for four wickets on his debut. Hutton himself only scored ten runs in each innings. Hutton was more successful with the bat in the second Test, scoring 150 out of a total of 537, although he made a very slow start and possibly caused the other players to bat slowly. However, Wisden believed that England owed much to Hutton's tactics in the match in forcing a win, although it criticised his caution in letting the match go into a fifth day through slow batting in England's second innings. Following this match, the selectors appointed Hutton captain for the rest of the series. In the final two Tests, Hutton scored 104 and 86 and his bowlers dominated the Indian batsmen; the final Test was ruined by weather, but England won the four match series 30. In the series, Hutton scored 399 runs at an average of 79.80.|$|E
