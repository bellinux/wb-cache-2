5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|Despite Putnam's {{rejection}} of functionalism, it {{has continued to}} flourish and has been developed into numerous versions by thinkers as diverse as David Marr, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, and David Lewis.

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, many of Perth's older {{buildings}} {{had been}} demolished {{to make way}} <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> developments, which led to wide criticism of the Perth City Council for approving such redevelopments.|$|E

5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} publication, the Cantiones {{appeared}} {{as part of}} a complete edition of the composer's works by Breitkopf & Härtel, begun by Philipp Spitta, who published a first volume in 1885, and completed by Arnold Schering and Heinrich Spitta in 1927. This edition was faithful to keys and clefs, a problem <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> performers. In 1960, Gottfried Grote published the collection in the Neue Ausgabe, transposing and with modern meter signs. A critical edition was published in 2004 by Bärenreiter, edited by Heide Volckmar-Waschk, who uses modern clefs, but shows the original clefs and retains the keys and note values.|$|E
5|$|Another of Hill's {{concerns}} was {{the availability}} of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on. She {{was one of the}} three founders of the National Trust, set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> social work.

5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> activity around the site.

Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in Bahrain. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the Qur'an. After World War I, Bahrain became open to western influences, and a demand <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> educational institutions appeared. 1919 marked {{the beginning}} of modern public school system in Bahrain when the Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia School for boys opened in Muharraq. In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in Manama, and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq. , there are a total of 126,981 students studying in public schools.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were {{in command}} of {{a large group of}} armed men with a proven ability to {{withstand}} Roman armies. What they intended to do with this force is somewhat difficult <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E

A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. <b>For</b> <b>modern</b> gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E
5|$|During {{research}} on his dissertation, Arrington found a manuscript from 1946 by Feramorz Fox about Mormon communitarianism. Arrington found the manuscript fascinatingly free of Marxist thought and together with Dean L. May, revised and expanded the manuscript {{under the title}} Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons. Deseret Book published the book in 1976. The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book {{was not allowed to}} reprint the book and Church News was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but too willing to give Mormonism credit <b>for</b> <b>modern</b> welfare programs.|$|E
