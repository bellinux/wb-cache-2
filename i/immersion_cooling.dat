Therefore, the isolated effects of accidental hypothermia as part of the lethal triad are essentially uncharacterized by previous models [38]. While induced hypothermia might be used to propose hypotheses on possible mechanism of the effects on coagulation, the definite major underlying pathomechanisms can only be assessed if hypothermia occurs spontaneously after trauma-haemorrhage, e.g. in the context of systemic hypoperfusion.|$|R

Rectal and thigh skin temperature, muscle temperature, thigh and calf skin blood flow and superficial femoral artery blood flow were measured before and after immersion. Indices of vascular conductance were calculated (flux and blood flow/mean arterial pressure). The colder water reduced thigh skin temperature and deep muscle temperature to the greatest extent (P < 0. 001). Reductions in rectal temperature were similar (0. 2 °C- 0. 4 °C) in all three trials (P = 0. 69). Femoral artery conductance was similar after <b>immersion</b> in both <b>cooling</b> conditions, with both conditions significantly lower (55 %) than the control post-immersion (P < 0. 01). Similarly, there was greater thigh and calf cutaneous vasoconstriction (40 - 50 %) after <b>immersion</b> in both <b>cooling</b> conditions, relative to the control (P < 0. 01), with no difference between cooling conditions. These findings suggest that cold and cool water similarly reduce femoral artery and cutaneous blood flow responses but not muscle temperature following resistance exercise...|$|R

40|$|Heat stroke is a {{life-threatening}} disease characterized clinically by {{central nervous system}} dysfunction and severe hyperthermia (core temperature rises to higher than 40 ℃). The unchecked rise of body core temperature overwhelms intrinsic or extrinsic heat generation mechanism, thus overwhelms homoeostatic thermoregulation. Hyperthermia causes cellular and organ dysfunction with progressive exacerbation resulting in multi-organ failure and death. Rapid cooling to reduce core temperature {{as quickly as possible}} is the primary and most effective treatment, as {{it has been shown that}} the major determinant of outcome in heatstroke is the degree and duration of hyperthermia. If suppression of body temperature is delayed, the fatality rate will be elevated. Several cooling methods are available, including physical cooling by conduction, convection and evaporation with ice/cold water <b>immersion,</b> internal <b>cooling</b> by invasive methods such as hemofiltration, intravascular cooling, cold water gastric and rectal lavage, and cooling with drugs.

50|$|Open or semi-open bath <b>immersion</b> <b>cooling</b> is a {{data center}} cooling {{technique}} that implies fully submerging servers in dielectric coolant fluid. It is called open or semi-open bath because servers are placed side-by-side in large tanks that function as baths. These baths operate at atmospheric pressure {{and allow the}} coolant fluid to be moved through the hardware components or servers submerged in it.Open Bath <b>Immersion</b> <b>Cooling</b> uses single-phase dielectric liquids. These liquids always remain in liquid state while operating. They never boil or freeze. The oil is usually pumped to an external heat exchanger where it is cooled thanks to heat exchange with a cooler water-circuit. A different approach uses natural convection as the driving force to circulate the oil through the servers. and a water cooled heat exchanger. This technique uses “open baths“ as there’s little (or no) risk of the coolant evaporating. In semi-open bath <b>Immersion</b> <b>Cooling,</b> a two-phase chemically engineered liquid is the working fluid. It literally boils thanks to its low boiling point and thus exists in both a liquid and gas phase. The system takes advantage of a concept known as “latent heat” which is the heat (thermal energy) required to change the phase of a fluid (in this case two-phase dielectric mineral oil). The oil is only cooled by boiling and thus remains at the boiling point (“saturation temperature”). Energy transferred from the servers into the two-phase oil will cause a portion of it to boil off into a gas (this is {{the second phase of}} the oil). The gas rises above the liquid oil level where it contacts a condenser which is cooler than the saturation temperature. This causes the vapoured oil to condense back into a liquid form and fall (rain) back into the bath.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the validity of tympanic temperature measurements {{as a predictor of}} core temperature on the fireground in different environmental conditions. Fiftyone volunteer firefighters participated in the study across four different conditions, the conditions consisted of; 1) passive (i. e., no intervention) cooling in cold ambient temperatures (0 - 6 °C); 2) <b>cooling</b> (through water <b>immersion)</b> in <b>cool</b> ambient temperatures (10 - 12 ºC); 3) <b>cooling</b> (through water <b>immersion)</b> in warm ambient temperatures (21. 5 °C); and, 4) passive cooling in warm ambient temperatures (22 °C). Firefighters wore full structural personal protective clothing while performing common firefighting duties including search and rescue tasks for 20 - 40 minutes. There was no difference between core and tympanic temperature immediately post-exercise across any condition. However, for all conditions, tympanic temperature dropped significantly faster than core temperature from 0 minutes, and remained significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than core temperature from nine to 20 minutes post-training. The results show that there is no consistent difference between core and tympanic temperature during recovery from a simulated firefighting task across a range of different ambient conditions. Agencies should, accordingly, prioritize investigating other practical markers of core temperature {{as part of a broader}} heat stress management plan for firefighters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The time {{dependence}} of immersion freezing was studied for temperatures between 236 K and 243 K. Droplets with single immersed, size-selected 400 nm and 800 nm kaolinite particles were produced at 300 K, cooled down to supercooled temperatures, and {{the fraction of}} frozen droplets with increasing residence time was detected. To simulate the conditions of immersion freezing in mixed-phase clouds we used the Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (ZINC) and its vertical extension, the <b>Immersion</b> Mode <b>Cooling</b> chAmber (IMCA). We observed that the frozen fraction of droplets in-creased with increasing residence time in the chamber. This {{suggests that there is}} a time {{dependence of}} immersion freez-ing and supports the importance of a stochastic component in the ice nucleation process. The rate at which droplets freeze was observed to decrease towards higher tempera-tures and smaller particle sizes. Comparison of the laboratory data with four different ice nucleation models, three based on classical nucleation theory with different representations of the particle surface properties and one singular, suggest that the classical, stochastic approach combined with a dis-tribution of contact angles is able to reproduce the ice nucle-ation observed in these experiments most accurately. Using the models to calculate the increase in frozen fraction at typi-cal mixed-phase cloud temperatures {{over an extended period of}} time, yields an equivalent effect of− 1 K temperature shift for an increase in times scale by one order of magnitude. This suggests that temperature is more important than time. ...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuations in {{the skin}} {{temperature}} of volunteers in water, of up to +/- 1. 5 degrees C, were induced by circulating water through a tube suit at a fluctuating temperature for 80 min.

Metabolic rate increased. Symmetrical fluctuations, or ramp fluctuations with either slow cooling and rapid warming phases or slow warming and rapid cooling phases, were all effective. Similar but less clear effects on core temperature were usually produced by fluctuating skin temperature in water at 25 and 33 degrees C; metabolic rate tended to increase during fluctuation in the 25 degrees C experiments, {{but not in the}} 33 degrees C experiments.

40|$|Purpose: Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} looking at the effects of water immersion temperatures on the cardiovascular system, but very little work has been done regarding the effects of immersion temperature on factors relating to autonomic nervous system regulation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine several variables relating to the autonomic nervous system effects upon cardioregulation while immersed in cool (88 F), neutral (98 F) and warm (102 F) water. Methods: Sixteen (16) college-age subjects volunteered to be a part of this research study. Subjects completed the study session in one day by sitting in each of the three tubs while being monitored by the Biopac system monitors and Coretemp radiofrequency measurement of core temperature. The study protocol initiated with the subject sitting at poolside, followed by <b>immersion</b> in <b>cool,</b> neutral and warm water with 12 minute rest periods in between immersions. Results: In this population, there appears to be a very significant effect of warm water immersion upon the autonomic nervous system. The changes noted were quite consistent across all of the subjects tested in the study. Heart rates rose during the warm water immersion period, but not during the <b>cool</b> or neutral <b>immersion</b> periods, whereas blood pressures remained quite constant throughout. Conclusions: The data we have analyzed so far indicates that there are a number of important physiologic changes that occur during war water immersion, producing increased sympatho-vagal balance, slight blood pressure drop and slight increase in heart rate, with a dramatic increase in distal superficial circulation.

Systems to circulate and purify fluorocarbon Cerenkov radiator fluids rely on thermodynamic cycles similar to those of modern CFC-free refrigerants. Such new refrigerants - designed to disintegrate under UV in the atmosphere - are radiation-intolerant and cannot be used for direct cooling of particle detectors in demanding radiation environments such as at LHC. However pure saturated fluorocarbon molecules are extremely radiation resistant as well as being non-flammable and non-toxic. Their use as evaporative refrigerants was pioneered for the ATLAS pixel detector, leading to their choice for the cooling of the entire silicon tracker.

40|$|Ice crystal {{formation}} in atmospheric clouds {{has a strong}} effect on precipitation, cloud lifetime, cloud radiative properties, and thus the global energy budget. Primary ice formation above 235  K is initiated by nucleation on seed aerosol particles called ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Instruments that measure the ice-nucleating potential of aerosol particles in the atmosphere {{need to be able}} to accurately quantify ambient INP concentrations. In the last decade several instruments have been developed to investigate the ice-nucleating properties of aerosol particles and to measure ambient INP concentrations. Therefore, there is a need for intercomparisons to ensure instrument differences are not interpreted as scientific findings. In this study, we intercompare the results from parallel measurements using four online ice nucleation chambers. Seven different aerosol types are tested including untreated and acid-treated mineral dusts (microcline, which is a K-feldspar, and kaolinite), as well as birch pollen washing waters. Experiments exploring heterogeneous ice nucleation above and below water saturation are performed to cover the whole range of atmospherically relevant thermodynamic conditions that can be investigated with the intercompared chambers. The Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS) and the Portable <b>Immersion</b> Mode <b>Cooling</b> chAmber coupled to the Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber (PIMCA-PINC) performed measurements in the immersion freezing mode. Additionally, two continuous-flow diffusion chambers (CFDCs) PINC and the Spectrometer for Ice Nuclei (SPIN) are used to perform measurements below and just above water saturation, nominally presenting deposition nucleation and condensation freezing. The results of LACIS and PIMCA-PINC agree well over the whole range of measured frozen fractions (FFs) and temperature. In general PINC and SPIN compare well and the observed differences are explained by the ice crystal growth and different residence times in the chamber. To study the mechanisms responsible for the ice nucleation in the four instruments, the FF (from LACIS and PIMCA-PINC) and the activated fraction, AF (from PINC and SPIN), are compared. Measured FFs are on the order of a factor of 3 higher than AFs, but are not consistent for all aerosol types and temperatures investigated. It is shown that measurements from CFDCs cannot be assumed to produce the same results as those instruments exclusively measuring immersion freezing. Instead, the need to apply a scaling factor to CFDCs operating above water saturation has to be considered to allow comparison with immersion freezing devices. Our results provide further awareness of factors such as the importance of dispersion methods and the quality of particle size selection for intercomparing online INP counters...|$|R

Twelve types of 1 -cm 2 copper heater samples, simulating high heat flux components, featured reference smooth copper surface, fully and patterned hydrophobic surface and fully and patterned hydrophilic surfaces. Hydrophobic samples were prepared by applying a thin Teflon coating following photolithography techniques, while the hydrophilic TiO 2 thin films were made through a two step approach involving layer by layer self assembly and liquid phase deposition processes. Patterned surfaces had circular dots with sizes between 40 – 250 μm. Based on additional data, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces improved nucleate boiling performance that is evaluated in terms of boiling incipience, heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux (CHF) level. The best results, considering the smooth copper surface as the reference, were achieved by the surfaces that have a mixture of hydrophobic/hydrophilic coatings, providing: (a) early transition to boiling regime and with eliminated temperature overshoot phenomena at boiling incipience, (b) up to 58. 5 % higher heat transfer coefficients, and (c) up to 47. 4 % higher CHF levels.

Although these fluids are chemically stable and have low dielectric constants, they are plagued by poor thermal properties. These factors necessitate the development of new heat transfer fluids with improved heat transfer properties and applicability. Computer Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) approach was used in this work to systematically design novel heat transfer fluids that exhibit significantly better properties than those of current high performance electronic coolants. The candidate fluids generated by CAMD were constrained by limiting their boiling points, latent heat of vaporization and thermal conductivity. The selected candidates were further screened using a figure of merit (FOM) analysis.

Compared to a neutral condition, pre-cooling increased the distance run (300 m) by five male and three female subjects during a 30 -min time trial. Moreover, pre-cooling attenuated the exercise-induced rise in core and skin temperature, whilst cardiac frequency was reduced and psychophysical status improved. The influence that pre-treatment immersion has on muscle metabolism and thermoregulation during exercise in the heat was investigated.

Accordingly, muscle high-energy phosphate metabolism, lactate accumulation and triglyceride utilisation were not different, whilst muscle glycogen utilisation and plasma ammonia accumulation were increased at higher core and muscle temperatures. In contrast, the pre-treatments evoked marked differences in thermoregulatory function during exercise in the heat, with greater conductive heat loss and a reduced sweat rate and cardiac frequency for the precooled, compared with the neutral and pre-heated conditions. Following pre-heating, the circulatory strain imposed by exercise and acute heat stress would have been augmented by the 32 and 40 % greater loss of blood and plasma volume, compared to the pre-cooled condition. In this circumstance, cardiovascular instability, as indicated by the marked increase in cardiac frequency when compared with the other conditions, could be a primary factor limiting exercise endurance in a hot environment. These data indicate that following thermal pre-treatment, the changes to muscle metabolism are unlikely to influence endurance during exercise in the heat. Whilst muscle glycogen utilisation and plasma ammonia accumulation were increased by exercise hyperthermia, their role in fatigue during exercise in the heat is unclear. A more likely possibility is that, following water-immersion pre-cooling or preheating, altered thermoregulatory and cardiovascular function, through marked reductions in core and muscle temperatures, might be more important for determining endurance during exercise in the heat...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{molecular}} {{design was}} used to identify new heat transfer fluids for direct <b>immersion</b> phase change <b>cooling</b> of electronic systems. Four group contribution methods for thermophysical properties relevant to heat transfer were critically evaluated and new group contributions were regressed for organosilicon compounds. 52 new heat transfer fluids were identified via computer-aided molecular design and figure of merit analysis. Among these 52 fluids, 9 fluids were selected for experimental evaluation and their thermophysical properties were experimentally measured to validate the group contribution estimates. Two of the 9 fluids (C 6 H 11 F 3 and C 5 H 6 F 6 O) were synthesized in this work. Pool boiling experiments showed that the new fluids identified in this work have superior heat transfer properties than existing coolant HFE 7200. The radiative forcing and global warming potential of new fluids, calculated via a new group contribution method developed in this work and FT-IR analysis, {{were found to be}} significantly lower than those of current coolants. The approach of increasing the thermal conductivity of heat transfer fluids by dispersing nanoparticles was also investigated. A model for the thermal conductivity of nanoparticle dispersions (nanofluids) was developed that incorporates the effect of size on the intrinsic thermal conductivity of nanoparticles. The model was successfully applied to a variety of nanoparticle-fluid systems. Rheological properties of nanofluids were also investigated and it was concluded that the addition of nanoparticles to heat transfer fluids may not be beneficial for electronics cooling due to significantly larger increase in viscosity relative to increase in thermal conductivity.

40|$|Ice {{nucleating}} particles (INPs) in {{the atmosphere}} are responsible for glaciating cloud droplets between 237 and 273  K. Different mechanisms of heterogeneous ice nucleation can compete under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Contact freezing is considered relevant because higher ice nucleation temperatures than for immersion freezing for the same INPs were observed. It has limitations because its efficiency depends {{on the number of}} collisions between cloud droplets and INPs. To date, direct comparisons of contact and immersion freezing with the same INP, for similar residence times and concentrations, are lacking. This study compares immersion and contact freezing efficiencies of three different INPs. The contact freezing data were obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH) using 80  µm diameter droplets, which can interact with INPs for residence times of 2 and 4  s in the chamber. The contact freezing efficiency was calculated by estimating the number of collisions between droplets and particles. Theoretical formulations of collision efficiencies gave too high freezing efficiencies for all investigated INPs, namely AgI particles with 200  nm electrical mobility diameter, 400 and 800  nm diameter Arizona Test Dust (ATD) and kaolinite particles. Comparison of freezing efficiencies by contact and immersion freezing is therefore limited by the accuracy of collision efficiencies. The concentration of particles was 1000  cm − 3 for ATD and kaolinite and 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000  cm − 3 for AgI. For concentrations [*]<[*]  5000  cm − 3, the droplets collect only one particle on average during their time in the chamber. For ATD and kaolinite particles, contact freezing efficiencies at 2  s residence time were smaller than at 4  s, which is in disagreement with a collisional contact freezing process but in accordance with immersion freezing or adhesion freezing. With “adhesion freezing”, we refer to a contact nucleation process that is enhanced compared to immersion freezing due to the position of the INP on the droplet, and we discriminate it from collisional contact freezing, which assumes an enhancement due to the collision of the particle with the droplet. For best comparison with contact freezing results, immersion freezing experiments of the same INPs were performed with the continuous flow diffusion chamber <b>Immersion</b> Mode <b>Cooling</b> chAmber–Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (IMCA–ZINC) for a 3  s residence time. In IMCA–ZINC, each INP is activated into a droplet in IMCA and provides its surface for ice nucleation in the ZINC chamber. The comparison of contact and immersion freezing results did not confirm a general enhancement of freezing efficiency for contact compared with immersion freezing experiments. For AgI particles the onset of heterogeneous freezing in CLINCH was even shifted to lower temperatures compared with IMCA–ZINC. For ATD, freezing efficiencies for contact and immersion freezing experiments were similar. For kaolinite particles, contact freezing became detectable at higher temperatures than immersion freezing. Using contact angle information between water and the INP, it is discussed how the position of the INP in or on the droplets may influence its ice nucleation activity...|$|R
