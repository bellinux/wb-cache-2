5000|$|Cattle called [...] "corn-fed," [...] "grain-fed", or [...] "corn-finished" [...] are {{typically}} fattened on maize, soy, {{and other types}} of feed for several months before slaughter. As a high-starch, high-energy food, corn decreases the time to fatten cattle and increases carcass yield. Some corn-fed cattle are fattened in concentrated animal feeding operations known as <b>feed</b> <b>lots.</b>|$|R

50|$|Energy and {{agriculture}} {{are the main}} economic drivers of the area. Natural resources include oil, natural gas, water, gravel and sand. The beef industry (ranches, <b>feed</b> <b>lots</b> and packing plants) is Liberal's largest source of employment. Hard winter wheat, corn, milo, alfalfa and cotton are common crops. Trucking is a major industry. Dairies and pork processors are a growing business.|$|R
50|$|The IUCN {{lists the}} Arkansas darter as being Near Threatened. It has a limited {{distribution}} and threats to this species include the lowering {{of the water}} level in streams resulting from groundwater pumping {{in the western part}} of its range, and potential development pressures in the eastern part. Drought can also cause water levels to fall and runoff from <b>feed</b> <b>lots</b> may cause pollution.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} the area is based on agriculture, {{especially}} soybean, wheat and corn; cattle farming has been largely displaced to less fertile lands and <b>feed</b> <b>lots</b> by the advance of these crops.

In addition, Casilda produces honey and has received the title of Provincial Capital of Honey.|$|R
50|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, Smith uncovered branding irons from the Hobson Brothers' <b>feed</b> <b>lot</b> {{operations in the}} area in the 1920s, and he used this as the basis for his western theme. He began with the repurposing of surplus Seabee barracks won at auction in Port Hueneme, which he relocated in the typical sweeping U shape of period motels. It was the pre-pool era so the rooms all faced a grassy play area with picnic tables. He cut some of the barracks in half and transformed others into a restaurant and office with a western ranch style.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} improve the base's {{prospects}} to remain open during a round of base closures in the 1970s, Idaho's legislature voted to expand the highway to the base to four lanes, although it was an area noted for gusty winds and tumbling tumbleweeds and little else. The expansion project also realigned the highway to {{go directly to the}} base's main gate. The unexpanded two-lane section of SH-67 that passed {{to the west of the}} base was delisted and unsigned (even though it was still officially maintained by ITD for the Simplot <b>feed</b> <b>lot</b> and the base's recreation area at C. J. Strike Dam just north of the Snake River) prior to its redesignation as SH-167.|$|E
50|$|Many cattle breeders desire {{the traits}} {{of the red}} Hereford cattle, but want black cattle, as black cattle tend to bring more money at market. Angus (black) are known for higher quality carcasses. Breeders like to cross Herefords, also known for good marbling, with Angus, even better quality grading cattle to get better meat quality and black hide if possible. <b>Feed</b> <b>lot</b> buyers will pay a premium for black hided cattle, {{because they have a}} better chance at a higher Quality grade (High Choice or Prime) than other hided cattle. Also, many breeders want to {{introduce}} Hereford type traits into their black cattle while maintaining the black color. The Black Hereford allows breeders to accomplish both of these goals. The Black Hereford is an efficient, docile cattle breed used mainly to produce beef.|$|E

Two property {{owners in the}} area reported collecting more than 150 birds each from their land.|$|R
50|$|Livestock {{operations}} {{can also}} {{use a lot of}} energy depending on how they are run. <b>Feed</b> <b>lots</b> use animal <b>feed</b> made from corn, soybeans, and other crops. Energy must be expended to produce these crops, process, and transport them. Free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on. The farmer may expend energy {{to take care of that}} vegetation, but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops.|$|R

5000|$|The Satellite of Love is {{so large}} that many regions of it go unexplored, at least by Mike, who, during season 10, is {{surprised}} to learn that the SOL is equipped with a squash court, a silo, and a <b>feed</b> <b>lot</b> (to which Crow asks [...] "Do you even live here, Mike?"). The presence of Joel's escape pod in [...] "Docking Bay 14" [...] implies there are at least fourteen docking bays. The Satellite even has its own time machine which is built by the nanites during the episode Terror from the Year 5000 (like the time machine from the movie, this machine looks suspiciously like a water heater). Unfortunately, due to its emitting dangerous radiation, only the bots (specifically Crow and Cambot) may use it, which they do a couple of times.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, Kiki renewed {{her love}} of horses by rescuing a foal from a <b>feed</b> <b>lot</b> where {{it was to be}} {{slaughtered}} for meat. She went to rescue 10 more horses from economic distress. During that time, she formed The Healing Equine Ranch. a 501c3. Using a herd of rescued horses, she teaches the language of horses and how to connect and build relationships from the ground up. Her mission statement is [...] "to empower, enlighten and educate humans through natural interaction with horses." [...] For the past five years, Ebsen has hosted many fund-raising concerts to support her passion. Often, a portion of the proceeds of several of her solo albums has been directed to support the work of T.H.E. Ranch, and others among her talented musician friends have similarly participated in donating their time and talents to ranch concerts to help raise funds for these rescue and educational projects.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of livestock, mainly cattle, there are various pros and cons to castrating or leaving the animal intact. Leaving a bull calf (an intact male {{under the age of}} six months), allows the animal to gain more weight, and have a higher feed {{efficiency}} than compared to a steer (or castrated male calf). Leaving a bull calf intact however, can also have disadvantages. If left intact, bull calves can exhibit aggressive behaviour causing damages to fences, equipment, and handlers leaving an occupational risk for employees. Castrating a bull calf before the age of six months leads to a better performing animal not showing signs of aggression when penned with other males, while intact bulls will tend to fight with male siblings. Castration of bulls is recommended to occur before entering the <b>feed</b> <b>lot</b> as a precaution against infections and the calves are small enough to be handled easily with minimal stress towards the animal.|$|E
