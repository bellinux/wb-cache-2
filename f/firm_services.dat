50|$|Firm service {{cannot be}} {{interrupted}} during adverse conditions, such as periods of high demand. However, firm service may also refer to service that {{is covered by}} a long-term contract, such as a year or more. There are extreme cases when <b>firm</b> <b>services</b> may be interrupted, such as emergencies and when system reliability is threatened. Services to homes and small businesses are usually firm. Some businesses that cannot afford interruptions also have firm service.

50|$|<b>Firm</b> <b>services,</b> {{also called}} {{uninterruptible}} services, are services, such as electricity {{and natural gas}} supplies, that are intended to be available at all times during a period covered by an agreement. Also, the service {{is not subject to}} a prior claim from another customer and receives the same priority as any other firm service. Conditional firm service is similar to firm service in that it is reserved and has priority over interruptible service. However, it can have restrictions, such as times when it would be curtailed before firm service but after interruptible service. The cost per unit with this service is called a firm rate or uninterruptible rate. The opposite of firm service is non-firm service, also called interruptible service or as-available service. The cost per unit for this service is called a non-firm rate or interruptible rate. The interruptible load is the portion of a utility's load that comes from customers with interruptible service.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} {{the critical role}} of employees’ general competencies in the link between career satisfaction and job outcomes (performance) in accounting <b>firm</b> <b>services</b> (accounting offices). Career satisfaction is an internally defined career success outcome. General competencies embrace abilities such as prioritizing, learning new things, coming-up with new ideas and solutions, working productively with others. The discussion arises primarily based on the considerable theoretical vagueness and empirical inconclusiveness in the existing literature concerning general competencies mechanisms and their contribution. As of interest to resolve this controversy, a research framework is developed in which general competencies act as the mediator between career success and employee performance in accounting offices. The empirical findings from a survey of 84 employees in accounting offices in Central Greece confirmed that general competencies exert a mediating effect {{on the relationship between}} career success satisfaction and job performance. The main implication of the findings for accounting managers is that employees in a career advancement environment are more likely to achieve higher job performance and subsequently effectiveness, as a result of strengthened general competencies. Thus, specific directions for managerial action have been derived...|$|E

40|$|Who is Doing the Work? Certified Public Accounting (CPA) {{firms have}} been moving rapidly into new areas of {{services}} due to increased competition {{in the market for}} <b>firm</b> <b>services.</b> The top CPA firms in the United States have announced their intention to expand consulting services to provide their clients with more value-added services. As these firms increase the types of services they offer their clients, they risk moving further away from their core business of accounting and auditing. The greatest growth has been in the area of management advisory services (MAS). This paper examines the composition of total revenue of the top 92 CPA firms providing accounting and auditing services, tax services, and MAS in 1994. Specifically, this paper investigates how the production of revenue and the efficient use of firm resources are related to the percentage of total revenue subdivided into revenue from accounting & auditing, revenue from tax services, and revenue from MAS. This paper finds that the Big Six have greater percentages of their revenues generated by MAS than do other, smaller firms. In addition, this paper finds that other CPA firms that emphasize MAS have a higher percentage of their workforce as non-partner, and non-certified professionals. This “shifting of power ” from partners to highly paid non-CPAs in the firm can distort the focus of the firm as they become seduced by higher margin work not in their core line of business...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that for organisations to truly achieve high and {{consistent}} levels of performance in their dealings with other firms they must move from contract based models predicated on the pursuit of cost efficiencies and the exploitation of bargaining power to more collaborative or partner based models. These new exchange relationships pursue greater organisational value {{through the development of}} cooperative working practices and the nurturing of trusted relationships. It is proposed that this type of approach to other firms can reduce transaction costs and increase productivity as well as improve innovation and learning which, it is further argued, is more important than contract and cost efficiencies in creating sustainable competitive advantage in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This study examines inter-firm relationships from a practitioner’s perspective. The goals of the study were to develop the author’s knowledge of collaborations to assist in his role as Account Director for a major Network Systems Integrator and to add to the academic research on inter-firm collaboration. This thesis documents the findings from the study. It examines the collaborative literature and introduces an integrated model of academic research and theoretical principles which collectively are proposed to predict successful collaborations. The thesis charts a case study of an inter-firm relationship in the UK telecommunications sector over 8 years, recording and analysing the main purchasing and collaborative episodes over that period and providing a unique insight into the dynamics of an inter-firm relationship in a highly competitive and highly uncertain industry. The thesis includes a significant examination of the literature on research methods and services science. The services science review was conducted through a collaborative lens, with the literature analysed in terms of its contribution to collaboration theory and practice. The findings from the study illustrate that the literature on alliances and collaborations is extremely fragmented with no universal theory to guide the practitioner. A pervasive theme from the literature was that firms in a highly competitive and uncertain environment are more likely to seek value through collaborations. The study examines {{the extent to which a}} collaborative approach is being pursued in the case of a firm in the UK telecommunications sector. The case investigates the veracity of the literature and highlights the practical challenges associated with creating value through collaborative initiatives. The findings indicate that inter-firm relationships are extremely complex economic, social and political arrangements requiring significant management effort and consequently attracting significant costs. The case charts the evolution of a relationship from a traditional customer-supplier exchange model to a more complex arrangement characterised by portfolio relationships and competitive collaborations underpinned by reciprocity. Creating collaborative value in this environment is subject to successfully navigating an array of organisational and cultural barriers significantly under represented in the literature with exchange behaviours relating to lack of leadership, moral hazard, opportunism, hold-up and competitive learning being at the core. In the case examined, these behaviours existed within a culture of institutionalised antipathy towards outside firms which ultimately led to the failure of their collaborative initiatives. The implications of this study are significant. The economies of the future are projected to be predominantly knowledge based and services led. Industrial and state competition is predicted to be founded on knowledge management and services innovation. The unit of management for this innovation is said to be the service system as opposed to the <b>firm.</b> <b>Services</b> systems are conceptualised as complex networks of firms, capabilities processes and technologies which are predicated on knowledge collaborations and effective service exchanges. The dominant industrial and academic approaches to explaining and directing management practice in these services collaborations assume an open and productive flow of knowledge across firm and state boundaries. The stated pre-requisite for a firm operating in this environment is that it possesses a collaborative capability, i. e. the ability to work effectively with other firms in a culture of openness and honesty. A capability and culture not found to be prevalent in this study. However, despite the challenges found in case study, the researcher’s closing argument is simple. When competitive performance depends on the firm’s relationships with other firms, managers need to pay attention to the following sets of actions: (1) Building a collaborative intent with the business (i. e. educating stakeholders on the value of collaboration in the context of their business goals and gaining senior management sponsorship and commitment to the process); (2) Developing a collaborative architecture (i. e. a structure (team or function) within the firm which has responsibility for activities at the boundary of the organisation and which is tasked with setting collaborative goals and strategies); (3) Identifying and crafting collaborative arrangements with other firms that support the firm’s strategy (i. e. firm selection, ensuring collaborative fit and developing value propositions in the context of the industry segment); (4) Managing collaborations (i. e. operationalising the relationship, setting joint goals, activities and measures, building relationships, and making joint decisions); and (5) building the appropriate levels of collaborative capital that energise the flow of resources and knowledge across the firm boundaries and create organisational and collaborative value. These activities are proposed to help build a collaborative capability. Although, the findings of this study indicate that the development of this capability and the management of a collaborative environment is a significant challenge and one that potentially requires significant commitment and change on the part of participating firms in order to have any real probability of success. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this work is: “It is possible to operate future Norwegian natural gas transportation systems {{at a level that}} is approximately optimal, technically and economically, with major stakeholders duly attending to requirements specified in the Norwegian statutory framework and in the implemented “Gas Directive. ” In order to test this hypothesis a multidisciplinary systems approach has been applied that includes analyses based on fluidmechanics and thermodynamics, economic theory and constrained by the prevailing and future legislative requirements. Operational experiences and empirical data also support the analyses. It is assumed {{in this work}} that the introduction of the European Union’s Gas Directive will result in some new or altered legal requirements for how to conduct future Norwegian natural gas transport operations. The work has identified these new requirements and the work has suggested realistic solutions for how to conduct future operations. The author therefore concludes that the main hypothesis above is true provided five recommendations are observed. The first recommendation is to implement into the Norwegian legislation provisions that make possible two core requirements of the Gas Directive. The first provision is to allow domestic gas sellers to compete in the downstream market by marketing and selling their gas individually. The second provision is to allow access to the transportation systems for those stakeholders who according to the Gas Directive are defined as “eligible customers” and “natural gas undertakings”, i. e. the future shippers. The second recommendation follows as consequence of the latter provision and it recommends the future Norwegian regulatory regime to incorporate three main features. First, the transportation system is to be operated by an organization unit that has a transparent account on its transportation services or alternatively by an organization (i. e. the operator) that is functionally separated from and does not participate in any gas marketing and sales activities. Secondly, and {{due to the fact that}} the Norwegian natural gas transportation systems are highly physically integrated it is recommended to have one and only one transportation system operator. Only one operator will be in the best position to enhance cost efficiency in daily operations, energy efficiency, resource management in daily operations, optimized utilization and optimized gas blending. Thirdly, new and altered transportation services must be designed to meet the future needs and requirements of the shippers and these services must be offered to all shippers. The latter feature is elaborated in the third recommendation. The third recommendation is to redefine and develop new transportation services that support shippers’ elastic demands for transportation services, both during periods of sufficient capacity as well as during peak load periods. The above recommendation will imply that the future transportation services must comprise <b>firm</b> <b>services</b> i. e. booked and guaranteed transportation, and interruptible services i. e. transportation being interrupted either during off-peak periods or during peak periods as well as peak load services i. e. transportation services offered during peak load periods. The services must be offered to all shippers in an equal and impartial manner and be supported by a transparent and feasible tariff and toll regime. The toll regime must feature several properties that ensure recovery of fixed costs, cost efficiency in operations and maintenance, and rationing efficiency and this work recommends that the future toll regime shall be reasonable and fair and cost-based. This work has identified that the existing toll regime does not feature all of the above properties and this work therefore suggests that the existing toll regime is re-designed and extended to include new elements. The first recommendation is to re-design the existing toll formula so that it acts as a two-part toll for firm capacity. The fixed part of the toll shall act as a booking charge or capacity charge and it shall cover the financial costs based on the historic investment costs for the pipeline systems. It shall also include the fixed (annual) operations and maintenance costs, and any new costs for incremental new investments. The variable part of the toll may be set equal to average marginal costs per unit of gas, or be paid “in kind” as done in the current regime. Further, a unitization of the fixed part of the firm toll is suggested here. The unitization shall include all pipelines that comprise the dry gas system. This means that the fixed part of the firm toll shall be calculated as an average fixed toll based on the historic investment costs for all the pipelines included. The unitization schema shall include the existing ship-or-pay contracts and any new firm contracts in the dry gas system. The unitization will accomplish a possibility for eliminating specific shipper’s preferences for where to physically route gas in the dry gas system. This will subsequently improve rationing efficiency at high levels of utilization of the system when there is a concurrent need for auctioning of spare capacity. This is due to the physical behavior of the integrated system as any “internal” pre-booked routing in the system effectively may reduce the total throughput and thus a rationing efficient utilization of the system. The above recommendations mean that the firm toll shall be charged as a “postage-stamp” toll for all pipeline systems comprising the dry gas systems. This means in practical terms that the dry gas system is to be considered as one zone only and pre-defined entry points and exit points must be established. As a consequence of unitizing the toll for firm capacity either a unitization of the ownership structure must be done or a payment mechanism must be in force that secures the pipeline owners no extra profit or loss due to the introduction of unitization. A new two-part toll formula that in its form is equal to the firm capacity toll is recommended for covering interruptible off-peak services. It is recommended to set the fixed part of the toll lower than the fixed part of the firm toll. A new toll must be developed and be based on auctioning principles for allocation of spare capacity in the system during peak load periods. In order to facilitate the auction a tool is required for predicting the level of spare capacity that is available from time to time. This tool is also needed for optimizing the total throughput based on the different auction bids. In a similar manner as for the firm toll, the auction bids shall refer to a unitized dry gas system and the bids shall refer to transportation requests between any of the pre-defined entry and exits points. No shipper shall thus have a right to specify “internal” routing in the dry gas system. The total revenues for the pipeline system owners shall not yield higher profits than the allowable regulated return and the balance shall be levied – at least in theory – the firm transportation shippers only. It is recommended to conduct such reallocations of revenues periodically. The fourth recommendation is related to the necessity of changing documents and requirements, altering organizational forms and working processes, and how current incentive structures will be affected. All these issues will be influenced by an implementation of the Gas Directive. The work has briefly discussed these issues, but due to the many uncertainties no detailed assessments are conducted or recommendations given. The work has however indicated that a majority of the documents assessed in this work must be revised and updated to reflect the new requirements caused by liberalization. It is recommended here that the governing documents more clearly specify which new responsibilities the independent transportation system operator shall be assigned. A vital area of concern is how the transportation system operator and the shippers’ and sellers’ dispatching representatives shall communicate and perform their duties in the future. To day these functions are highly integrated, but liberalization will make them counterparts. Further, a detailed specification of the future working processes for the independent transportation system operator must be clarified. This applies especially for the how to optimize the operations in a liberalized context. New and carefully designed incentives are needed for enhancing optimal usage of the network during capacity constraints. The last recommendation regards allocative and dynamic efficiency in a liberalized context. In the prevailing regime the individual company acts normally both as shipper and pipeline system owner. This regime ensures proper incentives for cost efficient development of new capacity and cost efficient operations and this regime may continue to exist in a liberalized context. This regime will continue to create proper incentives for allocative and dynamic efficiently in a liberalized context as well. Further, in order to enhance allocative and dynamic efficiency on the Norwegian Continental Shelf a centralized planning and development system must be in force in order to secure resource management and utilization of the significant conditions for economy of scale. The transportation system operator must have a close liaison with these functions in order to share information about operational experiences, capacity constraints and shadow prices on capacity of constraints. Finally, the work has provided several observations that show how a systems approach is quite attractive for finding solutions to complex and multidisciplinary problems as considered in this work. The systems approach applied here consists of two engineering processes comprising well-defined activities. These activities comprise assessment of information, definition of effectiveness measures and creation of information models. Trade-offs are identified between contradicting requirements and the outcome of the processes is accurate descriptions of the systems operations in the prevailing context and to some extent also in a future context. The systems engineering processes have included several methodologies to solve specific tasks. Several analyses based on economic and technical theories are included, as imperative activities required for solving the problems. The ultimate results of a systems approach are solutions that go beyond traditional and non-disciplinary approaches. This is particularly true if the objective is to find concrete and sound solutions applicable in a “real-world” context where specific stakeholders’ needs and legal requirements are present and well defined. Several observations are provided in the work showing how economic analyses are improved by combining them with technical theory, empirical data, operational experiences and last but not least: legal requirements. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
