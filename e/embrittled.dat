25|$|Radiation {{damage to}} nickel alloys - The {{standard}} Hastelloy N alloy {{was found to}} be <b>embrittled</b> by neutron radiation. Neutrons reacted with nickel to form helium. This helium gas concentrated at specific points inside the alloy, where it increased stresses. ORNL addressed this problem by adding 1–2% titanium or niobium to the Hastelloy N. This changed the alloy's internal structure so that the helium would be finely distributed. This relieved the stress and allowed the alloy to withstand considerable neutron flux. However the maximum temperature is limited to about 650°C. Development of other alloys may be required. The outer vessel wall that contains the salt can have neutronic shielding, such as boron carbide, to effectively protect it from neutron damage.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the other}} platinum-family members were not {{discovered}} yet (platinum {{was the first}} in the list), Scheffer and Sickingen made the false assumption that due to its hardness—which is slightly more than for pure iron—platinum would be a relatively non-pliable material, even brittle at times, when in fact its ductility and malleability are close to that of gold. Their assumptions could not be avoided because the platinum they experimented with was highly contaminated with minute amounts of platinum-family elements such as osmium and iridium, amongst others, which <b>embrittled</b> the platinum alloy. Alloying this impure platinum residue called [...] "plyoxen" [...] with gold was the only solution at the time to obtain a pliable compound, but nowadays, very pure platinum is available and extremely long wires can be drawn from pure platinum, very easily, due to its crystalline structure, which {{is similar to that of}} many soft metals.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{embrittlement}} {{is called}} the reduction in cohesive strength resulting from stress-driven diffusion of an <b>embrittling</b> element from a free surface into the grain boundaries of a solid, in a manner analogous to Hull-Rimmer creep-cavity growth. A free surface can be contaminated by an <b>embrittling</b> element originating from a liquid, solid, or gaseous environment, or from {{the bulk of the}} solid itself. Because grain boundaries are paths of rapid diffusion, the phenomenon is usually manifested by intergranular cracking in polycrystals at elevated temperatures. ^ The objective of this thesis is to study dynamic embrittlement in metallic alloys, when the <b>embrittling</b> element segregates to the free surface of the alloy from solid solution.

40|$|Increased {{nitrogen}} {{levels have}} been correlated with decreased ductility and elevated ductile-to-brittle transition temperature in pressure vessel steels [1]. However, the exact {{role played by}} nitrogen in the embrittlement of steels remains unclear. Miller and Burke have reported atom probe ion microscopy findings from neutron-irradiated low-alloy pressure vessel steel showing {{the presence of a}} 1 to 2 ruonolayer thick film of Mo, N, and C at prior austenitic grain boundaries (GB's) [2], suggesting a role for nitrogen as an intergranular <b>embrittler.</b> It is of interest for the development of mitigation strategies whether nitrogen must combine with other impurities to form nitride precipitates in order to exert an <b>embrittling</b> effect. Briant et al [1] have associated the <b>embrittling</b> effect of N in steels exclusively with intergranular nitride formation. This association suggests that high nitrogen levels may be acceptable if nitride precipitation at grain boundaries is suppressed. To address whether precipitate formation is indeed essential to the N embrittlement process in pressure vessel steel, a computational study was undertaken to ascertain whether the presence of interstitial nitrogen alone could <b>embrittle</b> an Fe GB. If so, nitrogen in any form must be kept completely away from the grain boundaries, if not out of the material altogether. The effect of interstitial N on the cohesion of an Fe {Sigma} 3 [110](111) grain boundary (GB) was investigated by ab-initio electronic structure calculations to reveal that free interstitial N produces a large strengthening energy, reduces the magnetic moments of the GB Fe atoms and is <b>embrittling</b> at the GB's...|$|R

Pure zinc electroplating processes, alkaline and acid, {{were found to be}} the most <b>embrittling,</b> owing to the low permeability of zinc.

Non-electrolytic processes, namely phosphating, mechanical galvanising, DacrometRTM and Magni 555 RTM were found to be non-embrittling. Hot dip galvanising was found to be highly <b>embrittling,</b> evidently due to trapped hydrogen being released by the thermal shock of up-quenching upon immersion in molten zinc.

40|$|Two {{forms of}} {{time-dependent}} brittle cracking along grain boundaries are compared here. Both of these involve diffusion-controlled decohesion, {{but in one}} case, the diffusing species is hydrogen {{and in the other}} it is a surface-adsorbed <b>embrittling</b> element. The application of a tensile stress in each case serves both to concentrate the diffusing species at the tip of a sharp crack and to provide the force necessary to overcome the bonding along the grain boundaries. In both cases the cracking rate depends on the structure of individual grain boundaries, {{but in the case of}} hydrogen it appears to be necessary that the grain boundaries be previously contaminated with some level of an <b>embrittling</b> impurity. In the other case, the grain boundaries may be completely uncontaminated prior to the application of stress; here, the <b>embrittling</b> process is inherently dynamic, not only because it is time-dependent but also because it depends on the application of a force (dynamos in Greek) ...|$|R

50|$|Alloying of {{the solid}} metal alters its LME. Some {{alloying}} elements may increase the severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element {{is known to be}} segregation to grain boundaries {{of the solid}} metal and alteration of the grain boundary properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the grain boundaries of the solid metal. The hardness and deformation behaviour of the solid metal affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely <b>embrittled.</b> Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely <b>embrittled</b> and the fracture stress varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to ductile transition temperature is increased by increasing grain size.|$|E

40|$|The paper reviews {{developments}} in liquid-metal embrittlement {{of the past}} 7 years including data on cyclic loading. Embrittlement by solid and liquid metals and by hydrogen has many common features, although the mechanism of <b>embrittler</b> transport differs. Fracture may occur in each type of embrittlement by environmentally assisted shear and by reduced cohesion; embrittlement under cyclic loading has been widely observed, with stress level, temperature, and substrate alloy composition and grain size being the major variables. The degree of embrittlement between any combination of environment (i. e. hydrogen, liquid metal, or solid metal) and substrate depends upon {{the strength of the}} interaction with the substrate, the kinetics of <b>embrittler</b> transport, the mutual solubility of <b>embrittler</b> and substrate, and a large number of test and microstructural conditions.

40|$|Abstract. The present {{paper is}} about dynamic {{embrittlement}} as a generic damage mechanism. It involves grain-boundary diffusion of an <b>embrittling</b> species at elevated temperatures {{under the influence}} of mechanical stress. The <b>embrittling</b> species, either coming from the material itself or from the environment, reduces the grain-boundary cohesion and, hence, causes time-dependent intergranular fracture. Evidence of the technical significance of dynamic embrittlement is given by two examples, stress-relief cracking in steels and hold-time cracking during low-cycle-fatigue loading of nickel-base superalloys. There is an obvious relationship between the grain-boundary structure and the local susceptibility to dynamic embrittlement. This was proven by mechanical experiments on bicrystals and grain-boundary-engineering-type-processed specimens...|$|R

50|$|In brazing copper, a {{reducing}} atmosphere (or even a reducing flame) may react with the oxygen residues in the metal, which are present as cuprous oxide inclusions, and cause hydrogen embrittlement.

The steam bubbles exert high pressure in the metal structure, leading to cracks and joint porosity. Oxygen-free copper is not sensitive to this effect, however the most readily available grades, e.g. electrolytic copper or high-conductivity copper, are.

Degradation from UV light can be effectively inhibited by the addition of exterior gelcoats and sealants, which protect the fiberglass construct through removing UV access to the product's surface thus deflecting UV energy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{importance}} of materials {{design and the}} understanding of grain boundaries was highlighted during the operation of Hinkley point. In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point ‘A’ turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the burst disc and the shaft caused the adjacent disc to burst almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This {{is thought to be}} the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the burst discs were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper <b>embrittled</b> during slow furnace cooling after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the absence of cracks. A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, almost 15 years ago, {{it was not possible to}} quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material’s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions. The reason for the failure was down to transport of phosphor towards the grain boundaries which <b>embrittled</b> the chromium steel causing it to fail ...|$|E
