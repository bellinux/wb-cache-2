But these have only been made some correction of porosity, lithology, borehole conditions, formation water salinity, oil density. So they are not suitable for application in the offshore heavy oil reservoirs of gravel pack. The writer has designed a volumetric model of considering gravel pack, casing size, wellhole liquid and so on. And some correction formulas are deduced with single factor and multiple factors by combining this volume model. While the author use these formulas to establish some theoretical charts. In the case of that the porosity is 0. 3, the author analyzes the C/O value change rule with the same oil saturation in sandstone strata. When the gravel packing volume of 0. 1, the C/O value decreases about 0. 15. When <b>casing</b> <b>diameter</b> increases from 6 inches to 7 inches, the C/O value increases about 0. 2.

To optimize flow conditions we must keep frictional losses to a minimum and prevent undesirable flow regimes from occurring in the well. A mechanistic model has been developed for upward two-phase flow in vertical wells, based on existing correlations for the various flow regimes.

40|$|Noise {{radiated}} by {{a typical}} computer cooling fan is investigated experimentally and analyzed {{within the framework}} of rotor-stator interaction noise using point source formulation. The fan is 9 cm in rotor <b>casing</b> <b>diameter</b> and its design speed is 3000 rpm. The main noise sources are found and quantified; they are (a) the inlet flow distortion caused by the sharp edges of the incomplete bellmouth due to the square outer framework, (b) the interaction of rotor blades with the downstream struts which hold the motor, and (c) the extra size of one strut carrying electrical wiring. Methods are devised to extract the rotor-strut interaction noise, (b) and (c), radiated by the component forces of drag and thrust at the leading and higher order spinning pressure modes, as well as the leading edge noise generated by (a). By re-installing the original fan rotor in various casings, the noises radiated by the three features of the original fan are separated, and details of the directivity are interpreted. It is found that the inlet flow distortion and the unequal set of four struts make about the same amount of noise.

Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the effects of various factors, such as drilling parameters, location of borehole, applied vacuum by exhausters and mining/panel parameters in order to be able to evaluate the performance of GGVs and to predict their effectiveness in controlling methane emissions. However, a practical model for this purpose currently does not exist. In this paper, we analyzed the total gas flow rates and methane percentages from 10 GGVs located on three adjacent panels operated in Pittsburgh coalbed in Southwestern Pennsylvania section of Northern Appalachian basin. The ventholes were drilled from different surface elevations and were located at varying distances from the start-up ends of the panels and from the tailgate entries.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{variability in}} aerodynamic {{performance of a}} compressor rotor due to geometric variation. The performance of the rotor is computed using a meanline model that includes the effect of tip clearance blockage, calculated by assuming the tip leakage behaves like a wake in a pressure gradient and incorporating the effects of double leakage. The model is used to quantify performance variability of the rotor at design flow coefficient and near stall given typical variations in blade profile geometry, hub and <b>casing</b> <b>diameters,</b> and tip clearances. Monte Carlo simulation performed at both operating conditions shows that the coefficient of variation of pressure rise, loss coefficient, axial displacement thickness, and flow angle at the exit of the blade row is similar at high and low loading. Mean shifts are smaller at design than near stall, where the mean pressure rise and loss shift - 0. 4 % and + 0. 6 % from their respective nominal values. A parametric analysis using a response surface showed that near stall, tip clearance variation drives performance variation; the pressure rise and loss coefficient standard deviation drop by 26 % and 20 % when tip clearance variability is removed. At design, tip clearance variability is still important, but leading and trailing edge blade geometries play {{a larger role in}} driving performance variability. by Nathan Andrew Fitzgerald.

As such {{they are the most}} likely pathway for CO 2 to return to the surface in large quantities and present a hazard without adequate management. We surveyed oil industry experience of CO 2 well failures, and separately, calculated the maximal CO 2 flow rate from a 5000  ft depth supercritical CO 2 reservoir. The calculated maximum of 20, 000 tonne/day was set by the sound speed and the seven-inch well <b>casing</b> <b>diameter,</b> and was greater than any observed event. We used this flux to simulate atmospheric releases and the associated hazard utilizing the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (NARAC) tools and real meteorology at a representative location in the High Plains of the United States. Three cases representing a maximum hazard day (quiet winds < 1  m s− 1 near the wellhead) and medium and minimal hazard days (average winds 3  m s− 1 and 7  m s− 1) were assessed. As expected for such large releases, there is a near-well hazard when {{there is little or no}} wind. In all three cases the hazardous Temporary Emergency Exposure Levels (TEEL) 2 or 3 only occurred within the first few hundreds of meters. Because the preliminary 3 -D model runs may not have been run at high enough resolution to accurately simulate very small distances, we also used a simple Gaussian plume model to provide an upper bound on the distance at which hazardous conditions might exist.

Experimental and {{theoretical}} determination of dependencies of strength characteristics of bored micropiles with a pedestal formed by rammed rubble on: <b>casing</b> <b>diameter,</b> fraction, and volume of crushed stone for collapsing macroporous clays.

Laboratory and field experiments were carried out; numerical calculations in two-dimensional and threedimensional arrangement for {{the determination of}} strain-stress analysis of the foundation using a MIDAS GTS_NX software system, implementing the finite element method and developed for complex geotechnical problems; some recommendations for implementation are provided. Results The dependence of the load-bearing capacity of bored micropiles on a broadened base of rammed aggregate with vertical loading is determined. At the maximum broadening diameter of 3. 5 of the micropiles shaft the load-bearing capacity of the subsoil is increased by between 1. 8 and 6 times compared with micropiles without broadening depending on {{the diameter of the}} pile shaft. During the experimental and numerical studies of the dependencies of deformation-strength parameters of the deep foundation works consisting of a bored micropile with a broadened base, namely the pile diameter, aggregate particle size and volume, seal diameter of the subsoil soil half-space, as well as the development of the theory of formation of the end broadening geometry of rammed aggregate {{in the form of an}} ellipsoid of revolution were established. Conclusion The full-scale measurements of the broadening of bored micropiles showed that their shape is close to an ellipsoid of revolution, and the ratio of semi-axes is directly dependent on the characteristics of soil and gravel volume, which was taken into account in the construction of the finite element model in the numerical simulation experiment.

In a joint project of the Nuclear Geophysics Division of the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (NGD/KVI), Groningen, Medusa Explorations B. V. and the Dutch Institute for Applied Geosciences (TNO-NITG) a catalogue of corrections was constructed. Using the Monte Carlo code MCNP, the influence of steel <b>casings,</b> borehole <b>diameter,</b> central axis probe position and the diameter of the gamma-ray detector on the gamma-ray spectra has been investigated for nearly 20 geometries. The calculated gamma-ray spectra are compared qualitatively and quantitatively. In a case study, gamma-ray spectra from a borehole measured in a cased and uncased configuration are analyzed with simulated spectra. When no corrections are used, the activity concentrations deviated by as much as 50 % between the two measurements. Taking into account the specific measurement geometry, the activity concentrations were found to be identical within the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the experiment for the same borehole, with and without casing. These results illustrate the need for borehole-specific corrections and this study demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods are a fast and reliable way to calibrate well-logging tools {{for a wide variety of}} configurations.
