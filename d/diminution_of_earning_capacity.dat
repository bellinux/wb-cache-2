50|$|In {{the absence}} of a cogent reason for a higher or lower outside {{earnings}} level, it is suggested that the new basis for the person’s <b>earning</b> <b>capacity,</b> had there been no injury, should be the National Average Earnings (NAE) {{at the time of the}} review. The NAE figure taken should be the average for the population overall. Separate figures for males and females, and regional fluctuations should not be considered.

40|$|Loss <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{a concept}} that is {{relevant}} to actions in which a wrongdoer is held liable for the detrimental effect of his actions on a claimant’s capacity to generate an income. Take the example of a claimant who had worked as a shift leader in a mine but after a damage-causing event is only capable of working above ground as a clerk. By comparing his salary pre-morbid with his salary post-morbid, it is possible to calculate the difference. This difference, if the former is the greater, constitutes the damage suffered by the claimant and, as such, the amount constitutes what he can claim as compensation. In an instance where a person is {{not in a position to}} furnish evidence about his earnings pre- and post-morbid, nevertheless, the court may award compensation for the claimant’s loss of earnings. Essentially, the compensation is payment for loss <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity</b> and not for loss of earnings. In making such an award, the court recognises that the claimant experiences a partial or total impairment of his capacity to generate an income. Koch states that in such problematic cases the courts often shy away from quantifying a claimant’s estimated annual income. Instead of employing the sum-formula approach,the courts opt for a general assessment using the “some-how-or-other” approach. What seems at first like a straightforward pre- and post-morbid calculation therefore is fraught with intricate theoretical questions. Although this problem is more evident in cases of unemployed claimants and children, it may also occur in other cases where loss <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity</b> is one <b>of</b> the heads of damages.

40|$|The {{preceding}} chapters {{have explored}} {{the determinants of}} income inequality {{at the level of}} the individuals and families who live, work and raise their children within a national economy. We have seen that certain key characteristics of the individuals in the family, most notably the education of the household’s adult members, are important determinants of the household’s decisions about labor force participation, fertility and the education of the children. The household’s decisions interact with the economic environment that surrounds them—wages and employment opportunities—to determine household income and the <b>earning</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the next generation. The message has been that a substantial part of income inequality in the region is attributable to differences across households in educational attainment and in other characteristics that determine household <b>earning</b> <b>capacity.</b> Thus, an important part of the Latin American income inequality story is that education and other determinants <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity</b> are unequally distributed across the population. This is an important part of the story, the policy implications of which are very different from those that would have followed, for example, from a finding that the large differences in household earnings were inexplicable and unrelated to education or other individual characteristics.

40|$|The Australian Federal Productivity Commission {{is proposing}} two new schemes to better support those with major disability. The main National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) will provide {{long-term}} care {{and support for}} the disabled. A smaller scheme, the National Injury Insurance Scheme (NIIS), will provide ‘no-fault ‘support for those following an accident or ‘medical injury’. It is proposed that cerebral palsy (CP) is part of the NIIS. While this brings quicker and more equitable benefits to CP families, the scheme labels CP as a ‘medical accident’ and infers preventability. Obstetricians will fund much of the system. Despite being labelled a ‘no-fault’ system, maternity staff can still be litigated for extensive ‘head of damages’, eg loss <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity.</b> An additional option is for federal/state legislation to introduce a true ‘no-fault’ lifetime pension specifically for all children on CP registers. This pension would be graded by degree of disability and dependent on waiving civil litigation. Savings in medico-legal costs and potentially a 7 % reduction in caesarean delivery would cover the estimated annual cost of $ 50 000 per annum indexed life pension for severe CP cases and the total annual cost of AUD $ 93 million for Australia. This pension and the NDIS would help cover the needs of children with CP without recourse to prolonged litigation and without detriment to the maternity services of Australia, caused by defensive obstetrics and maternity hospital closure because of CP litigation.

5000|$|But, when {{negligence}} {{is followed}} by a natural event of such magnitude that it erases the physical effects of the original negligence, the defendant’s liability ceases at the moment in time when the supervening condition occurs. In Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government, the Carslogie collided with the Heimgar and admitted liability. Temporary repairs were effected with permanent repairs to be carried out later in the United States. After the collision but before crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar was given a certificate of seaworthiness, authorising her to be continued in her present class without fresh record of survey, subject to permanent repairs at the owner's convenience. She was held fit to carry dry and perishable cargoes. While crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar encountered heavy weather and sustained such serious damage as to become unseaworthy and to require immediate dry docking. Thus, prior to encountering the rough weather, the Heimgar was a seaworthy vessel, capable <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> profits for her owners. Repairs due to the collision and to the heavy weather, as well as the owner's repairs were all carried out at the same time. Ten of the fifty days in dry dock were allocated to the repair of the collision damage and the question for the House of Lords was whether the owners of the Carslogie were liable for that ten-day loss <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity.</b> The claim was for damages because a working ship is [...] "a profit-earning machine". If she ceases to earn a profit, it is essential to consider what caused the detention in dry dock at that time. In this case, the Heimgar was a profit-earning vessel before suffering the heavy weather damage. Thus, the loss of earnings at that time was not caused by the collision. Hence, The Oropesa demonstrates that where there are two successive causes of harm, the court may regard the first event as the cause of all the harm, or hold that the second supervening event reduces or eliminates the effect of the initial negligence as in Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government.|$|R

Methods Prospective cohort study with 1 year follow-up among disability claimants (n = 375; response rate: 24. 3 %) conducted in the Netherlands (October 2008 -April 2011). Logistic regression was used to analyze associations between predictors [demographics; outcomes of the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12); 10 -item Kessler Psychological Distress scale; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness; Utrecht Coping List; Social Support Questionnaire for Transactions and Satisfaction; certified International Classification of Diseases 10 th edition (ICD- 10) diagnosis; loss <b>of</b> <b>earning</b> <b>capacity</b> (LEC) ] and outcomes [functional improvement on the World Health Organization Disability Schedule 2. 0 (WHODAS 2. 0) exceeding the standard error of measurement; work status at follow-up].
