5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E

5000|$|Posterolateral corner {{injuries}} (PLC injuries) of <b>the</b> knee are <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> {{a complex}} area {{formed by the}} interaction of multiple structures. <b>Injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> posterolateral corner can be debilitating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person and require recognition and treatment to avoid long term consequences. [...] <b>Injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PLC often occur {{in combination with other}} ligamentous <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee; most commonly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).

5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Gunshot wounds are the commonest form of {{penetrating}} {{trauma that}} cause TBI. Less commonly, knife wounds and shrapnel from motor vehicle accidents can also penetrate the airways. Most injuries to the trachea {{occur in the}} neck, because the airways within the chest are deep and therefore well protected; however, up to a quarter of TBI resulting from penetrating trauma occurs within the chest. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cervical trachea usually affects the anterior (front) part of the trachea.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly.

40|$|Background: The {{nail gun}} is a {{commonly}} utilized tool in carpentry and construction. When used properly with appropriate safety precautions, it can facilitate production and boost efficiency; however, this powerful tool also has <b>the</b> potential <b>to</b> cause serious <b>injury.</b> <b>The</b> most common site of nail-gun injuries in both industrial and nonoccupational settings is the hand. Materials and Methods: We report on two patients with nail-gun <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand. A {{review of the}} literature and discussion of clinical evaluation and treatment of nail-gun <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand are presented. Results: Two patients present with soft tissue <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand with the nail embedded and intact at the injury site. Operative removal of the nail and wound care resulted in successful treatment in both cases. Nailgun <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand vary in severity {{on the basis of the}} extent of structural damage. Treatment is based on the severity of injury and the presence and location of barbs on the penetrating nail. Conclusion: Healthcare providers must understand and educate patients on the prevention mechanics of nail-gun <b>injuries.</b> Nail-gun <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand necessitate appropriate evaluation techniques, understanding of surgical management versus nonsurgical management, and awareness of potential pitfalls in treatment...|$|R
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of his head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, {{as well as some of}} the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E

Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ulnar nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did not throw the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number}} of them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E
