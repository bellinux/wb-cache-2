25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E
500|$|Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and {{the mass}} media of being {{involved}} in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control {{of his or her own}} thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, [...] "Project Monarch") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, [...] "Silent Sound Spread Spectrum", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses.

2500|$|Biblical scholar Gary Habermas adds, [...] "What {{is usually}} meant <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Testament has far more {{manuscript}} evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies {{of most of}} the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that {{it is much easier to}} reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} of modern scholarship <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, but a Thursday or Wednesday crucifixion {{have also been}} proposed. Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a [...] "double sabbath" [...] caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon, ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath. Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday, not Friday, {{on the grounds of}} the mention of [...] "three days and three nights" [...] in [...] before his resurrection, celebrated on Sunday. Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a [...] "day and night" [...] may refer to any part of a 24-hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example is}} Nazarene in : [...] "And {{he came and}} dwelt in a city called Nazareth, {{that it might be}} {{fulfilled}} which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." [...] The website for Jews for Judaism claims that [...] "Since a Nazarene is a resident of the city of Nazareth and this city did not exist during the time period of the Jewish Bible, it is impossible to find this quotation in the Hebrew Scriptures. It was fabricated." [...] However, one common suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Testament verse is based on a passage relating to Nazirites, either because this was a misunderstanding common at the time, or through deliberate re-reading of the term by the early Christians. Another suggestion is [...] "that Matthew was playing on the similarity of the Hebrew word nezer (translated 'Branch' or 'shoot' in [...] and [...] ) with the Greek nazoraios, here translated 'Nazarene.'" [...] Christians also suggest that by using an indirect quotation and the plural term prophets, [...] "Matthew was only saying that by living in Nazareth, Jesus was fulfilling the many Old Testament prophecies that He would be despised and rejected." [...] The background for this is illustrated by Philip's initial response in [...] to the idea that Jesus might be the Messiah: [...] "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Aged around 18, {{he made a}} {{philosophical}} discovery that opened up to him [...] "a new Scene of Thought", which inspired him [...] "to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it". He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations. One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> [...] "scene of thought" [...] was Hume's realization that Francis Hutcheson's [...] "moral sense" [...] theory of morality {{could be applied to}} the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of ten years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a mental breakdown, suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the [...] "Disease of the Learned". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a [...] "Laziness of Temper", that lasted about nine months. Later, some scurvy spots broke out on his fingers. This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he [...] "went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning. His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After eating well for a time, he went from being [...] "tall, lean and raw-bon'd" [...] to being [...] "sturdy, robust [...] healthful-like". Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his [...] "corpulence", and his fondness for good port and cheese.|$|E

60|$|Here we {{may leave}} the {{conditions}} that have made an inquiry as {{to some of the}} limits of compromise, which must always be an interesting and important subject, one of especial interest and importance to ourselves at present. Is any renovation of the sacredness of principle a possible remedy for some of these elements of national deterioration? They will not disappear until the world has grown into possession of a new doctrine. When that comes, all other good things will follow. What we have to remember <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> doctrine itself will never come, except to spirits predisposed to their own liberation.

60|$|Section 49. Now {{the parent}} or parents, since {{they live and}} breed, must be more or less, but sufficiently, adapted to their {{conditions}} of living-- more or less fitted {{to the needs of}} life. The variation in the young animal will be one of three kinds: it will fit the animal still better to the conditions under which its kind live, or it will be a change for the worse, or it is possible to imagine that the variation-- as in the colour variations of domesticated cats-- will affect its prospects in life very little. In the first case, the probability <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> animal will get on in life, and breed, and multiply above the average; in the second, it is probable that, in the competition for food and other amenities of life, the disadvantage, whatever it is, under which the animal suffers will shorten its career, and abbreviate the tale of its offspring; while, in the third case, an average career may be expected. Hence, disregarding accidents, which may be eliminated from the problem by taking many cases, there is a continual tendency among the members of a species of animals in favour of the proportionate increase of the individuals most completely adapted to the conditions under which the species lives. That is, while the conditions remain unchanged, the animals, considered as one group, are continually more highly perfected to live under those conditions. And under changed conditions the specific form will also change.|$|E

I have your promise for three months, but even after that, I ask you to wait. Let the reform come from within the church. The church is something more than either its creeds, its clergy, or its laymen. Look at your cathedral rising out of and dominating Princhester. It stands not simply for Athanasius; it stands but incidentally for Athanasius; it stands for all religion. Within that fabric--let me be as frank here as in our private conversation--doctrine has altered again and again. To-day two distinct religions worship there side by side; one that fades and one that grows brighter. There is the old quasi-materialistic belief of the barbarians, the belief in such things, for example, as that Christ the physical Son of God descended into hell and stayed there, seeing the sights I suppose like any tourist and being treated with diplomatic civilities for three terrestrial days; {{and on the other}} hand there is the truly spiritual belief that you and I share, which is absolutely intolerant of such grotesque ideas. My argument to you <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> faith, the clearer vision, gains ground; that the only thing that can prevent or delay the church from being altogether possessed by what you call and I admit is, the true God, is that such men as yourself, as the light breaks upon you, should be hasty and leave the church. You see my point of view, do you not? It is not one that has been assumed for our discussion; it is one I came to long years ago, that I was already feeling my way to in my St. Matthew's Lenton sermons.|$|E
