25|$|The genomes of HSV-1 and HSV-2 {{are complex}} and contain two unique regions called the long unique region (UL) and the short unique region (US). Of the 74 known ORFs, UL {{contains}} 56 viral genes, whereas US contains only 12. Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II of the infected host. Immediate early genes, which encode proteins that regulate the expression of early and late viral genes, {{are the first to}} be expressed following infection. <b>Early</b> <b>gene</b> expression follows, to allow the synthesis of enzymes involved in DNA replication and the production of certain envelope glycoproteins. Expression of late genes occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encode proteins that form the virion particle.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{admixture}} analyses {{based on}} data of several individuals of modern populations, estimate that the genes of the Bulgarians have two sources and a main admixture event between 1000 and 1600 YBP. The genes that are provisionally or indicatively {{to be associated with}} the Balto-Slavic donor group constitute about 40-45% of the total, i.e. Belarusian-like, of which a Lithuanian-like admixture is estimated at 23.2% and a Polish-like admixture at 19.3%. <b>Early</b> <b>gene</b> flows between southeastern and eastern Europe make it difficult to obtain a correct estimate, although young enough identical by descent segments confirmed such connection and that the East and West Slavs share more identical by descent segments with South Slavs than with Greeks, inter-Slavic populations (a group of Romanians, Gagauz), but less with Balts, while the South Slavs share similar number with East and West Slavs, but fewer with Greeks. Genetically and linguistically the Slavic ancestors of the modern South Slavs had divided mainly into two groups, each of which took a migration stream either through the west or the east of the Carpathian Mountains. The western Balkans was settled with Sclaveni, the east with Antes. Haplogroup R1a, the major haplogroup among Slavic tribes, reveals that the haplogroup of the Serbo-Croat group is mainly constituted by R1a-L1280 or R1a-CTS3402, while the Macedono-Bulgarian is exclusively made up of the R1a-L1029. A pattern of distribution of IBD segments between South Slavs and East and West Slavs suggests a shared ancestry or a modest gene flow.|$|E

40|$|The {{signaling}} {{mechanisms by}} which skeletal muscle electrical activity leads to changes in gene expression remain largely undefined. We have reported that myotubes depolarization induces calcium signals in cytosol and nucleus via inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) and phosphorylation of both ERKs 1 / 2 and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). We now describe the calcium dependence of P-CREB and P-ERKs induction and of the increases in <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> c-fos, c-jun and egr- 1 mRNA. Increased phosphorylation and <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> activation were maintained {{in the absence of}} extracellular calcium, while the increase in intracellular calcium induced by caffeine could mimic the depolarization stimulus. Depolarization performed either {{in the presence of the}} IP 3 inhibitors 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2 -APB) or xestospongin C or on cells loaded with BAPTA-AM, in which slow calcium signals were abolished, resulted in decreased activation of the <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> examined. Both <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> activation and CREB phosphorylation were inhibited by ERKs phosphorylation blockade. These data suggest a role for calcium in the transcription-related events that follow membrane depolarization in muscle cells.

2500|$|The Histone code {{hypothesis}} {{suggests the}} idea that patterns of post-translational modifications on histones, collectively, can direct specific cellular functions. Chemical modifications of histone proteins often occur on particular amino acids. This specific addition of single or multiple modifications on histone cores can be interpreted by transcription factors and complexes which leads to functional implications. This process is facilitated by enzymes such as HATs and HDACs that add or remove modifications on histones, and transcription factors that process and [...] "read" [...] the modification codes. The outcome can be activation of transcription or repression of a gene. For example, the combination of acetylation and phosphorylation have synergistic effects on the chromosomes overall structural condensation level and, hence, induces transcription activation of immediate <b>early</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{therapy is}} a {{technique}} for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. In the future, gene therapy may provide a way to cure genetic disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis or even haemophilia A. Because these diseases result from mutations in the DNA sequence for specific genes, [...] gene therapy trials have used viruses to deliver unmutated copies of these genes to {{the cells of the}} patient's body. There have been a huge number of laboratory successes with gene therapy. However, several problems of viral gene therapy must be overcome before it gains widespread use. Immune response to viruses not only impedes the delivery of genes to target cells but can cause severe complications for the patient. In one of the <b>early</b> <b>gene</b> therapy trials in 1999 this led to the death of Jesse Gelsinger, who was treated using an adenoviral vector.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the possibility of assigning genes of T 4 bacteriophage to their units of transcription (scriptons) by studying gene expression from UV-irradiated DNA templates. Since RNA chains are prematurely terminated on UV-irradiated DNA templates and since the promotor distal part of the RNA chain is deleted, the expression of any gene is inversely proportional to {{the distance between the}} promotor and the promotor distal end of the gene. We find that the <b>early</b> <b>genes,</b> 43, 45 and rIIB, are promotor proximal. Since at least genes 43 and rIIB are classified as delayed <b>early</b> <b>genes,</b> these results suggest that their synthesis may require the recognition of new promotors. Additional <b>early</b> <b>genes</b> (44, 62, 42, 46, 47, 55, and rIIA) and some late genes (34, 37, and 38) have also been assigned positions relative to their promotors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The NF-κB family plays a {{prominent}} role in the innate immune response, cell cycle activation or cell apoptosis. Upon stimulation by pathogen-associated patterns, such as viral RNA a kinase cascade is activated, which strips the NF-κB of its inhibitor IκBα molecule and allows it to translocate into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, it activates transcription of approximately 90 genes whose kinetics of expression differ relative to when NF-κB translocates into the nucleus, referred to as Early, Middle and Late genes. It is not obvious what mechanism is responsible for segregation of the genes’ timing of transcriptional response. Results It is likely that the differences in timing are due, in part, to the number and type of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), required for NF-κB itself {{as well as for the}} putative cofactors, in the <b>Early</b> versus Late <b>genes.</b> We therefore applied an evolutionary analysis of conserved TFBS. We also examined whether transcription dynamic was related to the presence of AU-rich elements (ARE) located in 3 ′UTR of the mRNA because recent studies have shown that the presence of AREs is associated with rapid gene induction. We found that <b>Early</b> <b>genes</b> were significantly enriched in NF-κB binding sites occurring in evolutionarily conserved domains compared to genes in the Late group. We also found that <b>Early</b> <b>genes</b> had significantly greater number of ARE sequences in the 3 ′UTR of the gene. The similarities observed among the <b>Early</b> <b>genes</b> were seen in comparison with distant species, while the Late genes promoter regions were much more diversified. Based on the promoter structure and ARE content, Middle genes can be divided into two subgroups which show similarities to <b>Early</b> and Late <b>genes</b> respectively. Conclusions Our data suggests that the rapid response of the NF-κB dependent <b>Early</b> <b>genes</b> may be due to both increased gene transcription due to NF-κB loading as well as the contribution of mRNA instability to the transcript profiles. Wider phylogenetic analysis of NF-κB dependent genes provides insight into the degree of cross-species similarity found in the <b>Early</b> <b>genes,</b> opposed to many differences in promoter structure that can be found among the Late genes. These data suggest that activation and expression of the Late genes is much more species-specific than of the <b>Early</b> <b>genes.</b> </p...|$|R
