5000|$|Pollination {{is mainly}} by bats, and {{as usual in}} such cases the flowers {{do not have a}} {{pleasant}} smell but produce copious thin nectar. Flowers open in the evening and produce nectar throughout the night, ceasing in the early morning. As it seems, each night's last nectar, produced around dawn, is richer in sugars than that produced in the night, though it is much less in quantity already. Moths, nocturnal wasps and ants also visit the flowers at night; the former two might also do some pollinating but they are not known to be of major importance. During the day, the flowers are visited by bees and wasps which feed on remaining pollen. From dusk to the cessation of nectar production, hummingbirds may visit the flowers. While most of them only do this opportunistically, some species [...] - [...] e.g. the fork-tailed woodnymph (Thalurania furcata) and in particular the glittering-throated emerald (Amazilia fimbriata) [...] - [...] appear to visit pequi tree flowers on a regular base. More significantly, visits by small [...] "tanagers" [...] of the Thraupidae and Cardinalidae families around dusk are noted. In particular species like the <b>guira</b> <b>tanager</b> (Hemithraupis guira), white-lined tanager (Tachyphonus rufus) and the palm (Thraupis palmarum) and sayaca tanagers (T. sayaca) seem to be quite fond of pequi flower nectar and spend considerable time feeding on it when available. But even curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) have been observed to hang about flowering pequi trees at daybreak, though perhaps not just for the nectar, considering many insects attracted by it earlier would still be around on the tree. As the stigmata dry out at daybreak, {{it is not clear whether}} birds, particularly tanagers, play a role in pollination also or are merely making use of an easy early-morning snack, particularly considering that during the flowering season of C. brasiliense, little such food is available.|$|E
