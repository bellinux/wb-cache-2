5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph</b> called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph</b> that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph.</b> To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E

5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph {{can be described}} by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence {{is the same as}} the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge.

5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph</b> with weights on its {{vertices}} and seeks the minimum (or maximum) {{weight of a}} closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph).</b>|$|E
5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph</b> with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{wireline}} two-unicast-Z communication network over <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graphs.</b> The two-unicast-Z network is a two-unicast network where the destination intending to decode the second message has a priori side information {{of the first}} message. We make three contributions in this paper. First, we describe a new linear network coding algorithm for two-unicast-Z networks over the <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graphs.</b> Our approach includes the idea of interference alignment {{as one of its}} key ingredients. For the graphs of a bounded degree, our algorithm has linear complexity {{in terms of the number}} of vertices, and the polynomial complexity in terms of the number of edges. Second, we prove that our algorithm achieves the rate pair (1, 1) whenever it is feasible in the network. Our proof serves as an alternative, albeit restricted to two-unicast-Z networks over the <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graphs,</b> to an earlier result of Wang et al., which studied the necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the rate pair (1, 1) in two-unicast networks. Third, we provide a new proof of the classical max-flow min-cut theorem for the <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graphs...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{result of}} such {{compression}} may look similar to trying to transform the trie into a <b>directed</b> <b>acyclic</b> <b>graph</b> (DAG), because the reverse transform from a DAG to a trie is obvious and always possible. However, {{the shape of the}} DAG is determined by the form of the key chosen to index the nodes, in turn constraining the compression possible.|$|E
25|$|A {{communicating}} {{class is}} closed if {{the probability of}} leaving the class is zero, namely if i is in C but j is not, then j is not accessible fromnbsp&i.
