40|$|As many of {{the dairy}} powders {{manufactured}} have to travel long distances to reach their customers, both domestically and internationally, there is considerable interest among dairy powder manufacturers to maintain {{the quality of their}} products for relatively long storage periods. Dairy powders can have a long shelf life if packaged and stored properly. Vacuum packaging can be an attractive packaging strategy to maintain the quality of dairy powders and provide added value by improving the efficiency of using the storage space; because of the inherent compactness of these products. Vacuum packaged dry dairy ingredients may also have added ease of handling for end users. However, {{little is known about the}} impact of vacuum packaging on the physical properties of dry dairy ingredients. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of vacuum packaging over 12 months storage on particle size, particle density, bulk density, tapped density, flowability, compressibility, color, moisture content, surface morphology, and solubility of six types of dairy powders. In addition, the effect of dairy ingredients type was also assessed. Commercial samples of nonfat dry milk powder, whole milk powder, buttermilk powder, milk protein Isolate, whey protein concentrate# 80, and sweet whey powder were repackaged in duplicate using multi-wall foil side <b>gusseted</b> <b>bags</b> under varying degrees of vacuum (1, 0. 7, 0. 4 bar) and a control with no vacuum, then stored for 3, 6, and 12 months at 25 Â°C and 60...|$|R
5000|$|Gussets {{are also}} used when making three-piece bags, for example in a pattern [...] a bag as a long, wide piece which connects the front piece and back piece. By {{becoming}} the sides {{and bottom of the}} <b>bag,</b> the <b>gusset</b> opens the <b>bag</b> up beyond what simply attaching the front to the back would do. With reference to the dimension of the gusset, the measurements of a flat bottom bag may be quoted as LxWxG.|$|R
40|$|Root growth capacity, shoot height, and {{diameter}} {{growth of}} Cupressus macrocarpa Hartweg seedlings were reduced by 48 {{hours or more}} of cool-storage, regardless of type of packaging. However, seedlings packaged horizontally in either a wax-impregnated kraft cardboard box with polythene liner (DL- 55 planting box) or a 4 -ply <b>gusseted</b> kraft paper <b>bag</b> with polythene liner (Capcote bag) produced greater height growth in the year after planting than those seedlings packaged vertically in the conventional manner. Correlations between root growth capacity and final height and diameter were significant. However, there {{was not the same}} strong relationship with growth increment...|$|R
