Recently, African-American educators have brought the value of cultural perspectives to the forefront of the field of adult education. This case study extends the parameters of adult education to include nonformal and informal education by presenting the learning and teaching methods of African-American adult male baseball players during the era of Negro league baseball, 1920 [...] 1960. For more than 80 years, African-American baseball players were prohibited from obtaining the formal education available to their European-American counterparts. Therefore, these gentlemen developed their own "grassroots" systems of learning and playing the game, demonstrated by the creation of "Black baseball. "This research presents firsthand accounts from eight former Negro leaguers and one former batboy with the teams. The study participants collectively played baseball with more than 12 Negro league teams in efforts to prove that they, too, belonged in major league baseball, enduring sacrifice, maltreatment, and injustice to bring a dream alive. This study employed qualitative research guided by the philosophy of phenomenology, involving sociological, historical, psychological, and ethnographic components. Data were collected through interviews and observation. Two distinct categories, nine themes, and 10 subthemes emerged from this research, uniquely linking the former Negro leaguers with adult education. The first category, Education for Life, was comprised of an elaborate combination of three themes and 10 subthemes: Family Values (<b>Home</b> Training; <b>Apprenticeship,</b> Kinship, and Mentoring); Religion (The Golden Rule, Spirituality, and Mother Wit); and Educational Strategies (Formal Learning, Nonformal and Informal Learning, Orality and Oral Tradition, and Achievement Motivation). The second category, Education for Work, revealed six principal themes: Aptitude, They Brought Game to the Game, Group Dynamics, Solidarity for Survival, the Shifting Environment, and Against All Odds. Findings revealed effective mechanisms used by Negro leaguers to achieve individual and collective goals in life as well as that society and environment {{played a significant role in}} the way they learned from and taught each other for generations. Their unique learning theories and philosophies gave rise to the development of the Theory of Relative Environment, describing the relevance of the interaction between human need and environmental influences as related to nonformal and informal education...|$|R
5000|$|Following a delinquent {{childhood}} and youth, Davies renounced his <b>home</b> and his <b>apprenticeship</b> with a frame-maker. At {{the age of}} twenty-two, having borrowed money from the executor of his grandmother’s estate, he sailed to America. This {{was the first of}} more than a dozen Atlantic crossings, often made by working his passage aboard a cattle boat. Between 1893 and 1899 Davies travelled the highways and railroads, tutored by hardened men of the road. He took advantage of the corrupt system of [...] "boodle jails" [...] in order to pass the winter in Michigan, staying in a series of different jails. These were jails in which a tramp could make an illicit arrangement with a law enforcement officer to stay in the jail without being an actual prisoner. Here, with his fellow tramps, Davies would enjoy the relative comfort of [...] "card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk." [...] Regular work was never an option and Davies subsisted largely by begging. After crossing the Atlantic one last time, from Britain to Canada, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush, Davies fell while hopping a train. His foot was crushed and his leg had to be amputated below the knee. He later wrote of the effect the accident had on his life: [...] "All the wildness had been taken out of me and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of traditional healing systems in understanding, expressing, finding a meaning and treating human suffering and misfortune {{has been one}} of the focuses in medical anthropology. Among the three main sectors of health care delivery in all complex societies, namely the popular, the folk and the professional, the folk healing represents the intermediate position consisting of sacred or secular healers or a mixture of the two. By doing field work in a seemingly sacred folk healing practice in north Kerala, namely Poonkutilmana, and engaging participant observation and non-structured open ended interviews as methods, I have attempted to throw light on the broader aspects of folk healing existing in this part of India. Poonkutilmana is a high caste Nambudiri Brahman family situated in Malappuram a district in Kerala with a predominantly Muslim population. The male members of this family practice the traditional art of healing which they do only inside their old mana, the traditional family house. This house also holds temples for the deities, Devi the Goddess and Ganapathi the elephant headed God, the destroyer of obstacles which they worship. Their clients are mostly from the same district but they also receive clients from far off places these days due to the publicity gained through the print media and internet. The clientele consists of a sizable number of Muslims and the healers declare their openness showing the open gate, which according to them is never closed. They have a specific healing tradition which combines Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine with mantravada (translated often as sorcery or witchcraft but literally the use of mantras). They practice a non-institutionalized form of Ayurveda, because they are trained at their <b>homes</b> by <b>apprenticeship</b> and have not gained qualifications from any teaching institutions. The field work revealed that there are a multitude of afflictions present at this healing practice. The most important of them was Brahmaraksas which has been classically mentioned in Ayurveda as a malevolent graham or possessing agent which could be identified by spontaneous interest in learning Sanskrit scriptures and worshiping. But this affliction is identified today as the spirit of a dead Brahman dwelling on lands causing ill health first to the cattle and poultry and then to the humans, if not contained annually by worship. The other predominant afflictions were petiyilpetuka to get trapped in an insidious fear followed by a visual experience, sathru dosam the wrong doings of an enemy which indicated sorcery and alternately mentioned as kaivisham or hand poison, and sthala virodham a spatial incompatibility. Though spirit possessions (ettukutal) were not suggested or promoted by the healers, few clients, especially women identified themselves as possessed. Both possession and the wrong doings from an enemy were found to be mediated by astrologers. Another important feature of this healing practice was the presence of a large number of pregnant women and infants for the healing ritual as they were vulnerable and thus to be protected. The healing consisted of the ritual called uzhinjumattal, literally to remove by rotating around, chanting of mantras and giving a sacred thread or amulet with holy ash. The ritual treatment was combined with homemade medicines such as handmade pills, ghee for internal use and oil for application on the head and the prescription of certain Ayurvedic formulations including patented capsules. The rituals and the medical work occurred in tandem with their good words full of empathy and motivation. Though this traditional healing practice could be shown as a model of sacred folk healing practice, it has its own secular elements. It does not completely fit into the theoretical framework of Ayurveda, or mantaravada or astrology, but still remains popular. They have adapted their own methods of healing which are unique and indigenous. The possibility of multiple idioms of expressing the illness and multiple therapeutic options in the same practice provide the clients with different meanings for their sufferings and different methods of dealing with them...|$|R
