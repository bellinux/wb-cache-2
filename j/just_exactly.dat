It's a memorably tense pas de deux, and if the movie doesn't pay off on it properly, fault a script that ventures further and further into psychological thriller claptrap, leaving the two stars to rely on their hefty talents to keep it at all believable." ...|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls {{nonetheless}} received widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a rave review for NME, Nick Kent said the band's raunchy style {{of rock and}} roll was vividly recorded by Rundgren on an album that, besides Iggy and the Stooges' Raw Power (1973), served as the only one [...] "so far to fully define <b>just</b> <b>exactly</b> where 1970s rock should be coming from". Trouser Press founder and editor Ira Robbins viewed New York Dolls as an innovative record and found the band's music brilliantly chaotic and well produced by Rundgren. Ellen Willis, writing for The New Yorker, said it was by far the year's most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs were immediate classics, particularly [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] and [...] "Trash", which she called [...] "transcendent". In Newsday, Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as [...] "the best hard rock band in the country and maybe the world right now", writing that their [...] "special genius" [...] was combining the shrewd songwriting savvy of early-1960s popular music with the anarchic sound of late-1960s heavy metal. He believed the record's frenzied approach, various emotions, and wild noise conveyed Manhattan's harsh, deviant thrill better than the Velvet Underground. In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone critic Tony Glover believed the band's impressive live sound was mostly preserved on the album, but he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs, feeling they made some lyrics incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous. Although he was surprised Rundgren's production worked well with the group's raunchy sound on most of the songs, Glover ultimately asked whether or not [...] "the record alone will impress as much as seeing them live (they're a highly watchable group)." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, {{and all of us}} were, intent on one thing and that was to be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged <b>just</b> <b>exactly</b> the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit!

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1989, Lynch had {{finished}} the pilot episode for the successful Twin Peaks television series and tried to rescue two of his projects – Ronnie Rocket and One Saliva Bubble – both involved in contractual complications {{as a result of}} Dino De Laurentiis' bankruptcy, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures. Lynch stated, [...] "I've had a bad time with obstacles... It wasn't Dino's fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that". Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch's and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on. Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write. He let Montgomery read it in pre-published galley form while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it. Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct. Lynch remembers telling him, [...] "That’s great Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?" [...] Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his [...] "kind of thing." [...] Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it. Lynch remembers, [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>exactly</b> the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] Lynch was drawn to what he saw as [...] "a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell," [...] and was also attracted to [...] "a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about.
