5|$|Danzig had {{remained}} practically autonomous and adamant about protecting its status and foreign trade monopoly. The Karnkowski Statutes of 1570 gave Polish kings the control over maritime commerce, {{but not even}} Stephen Báthory, who resorted to an armed intervention against the city, was able to enforce them.

5|$|Péraud's {{position}} <b>held</b> <b>steady</b> for {{the next}} three days, in stages won by sprinters and breakaways. In stage 18, which finished at the Col du Galibier, Péraud finished a modest 16th, but this result moved him into the top ten overall. He dropped back out of the top ten the next day on Alpe d'Huez by finishing 12th and sufficiently behind Pierre Rolland that the younger Frenchman took his place, but regained tenth overall the next day in Grenoble thanks to his super time trial skills. He held tenth the next day to finish as the team's best-placed rider. Roche's final position was 26th.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment levels <b>held</b> <b>steady</b> {{into the}} Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E

5|$|Episode 1 {{averaged}} 7.47 {{million viewers}} over its hour, peaking at 9.2 million {{with a low}} point of 6.9 million. The episode ranked as the thirty-fourth most-watched programme {{of the week and}} the sixth most-watched drama (excluding soap-operas). The second episode dropped seven places and 1.9% on the previous week with 7.33 million viewers. It recovered to 7.46 million the following week but still managed only fortieth place in the Top 70 most-watched programmes. The fourth week <b>held</b> <b>steady</b> at 7.44 million viewers and fortieth position again. It had its best figures with Episode 5, which was seen by 7.91 million, making thirty-second in the Top 70. The final episode of the series suffered from its schedule change, dropping to fifty-ninth and 6.77 million viewers. Over the six weeks, Cold Feet averaged a 34% audience share, which was six points below ITV's Sunday peaktime average.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. <b>held</b> <b>steady</b> despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stage}} 16 {{individual}} time trial being almost fully {{composed of the}} Nevegal climb, Antón finished the stage in 13th, a minute and 21 seconds back of the day's winner Contador while Nieve was 36th, two minutes 19 seconds down. Nieve fell to sixth overall, while Antón moved past David Arroyo for tenth as Arroyo lost even more time than Antón did. While Antón again fell from the top ten {{as a result of}} Kanstantsin Sivtsov's stage 17 breakaway ride gaining him just under three minutes, Nieve's position <b>held</b> <b>steady</b> until stage 20, the Giro's final road race. 's Vasil Kiryienka rode to a dominant stage victory, coming in almost five minutes before the day's second-placed rider and about six minutes ahead of the largest group of the race's top riders. Nieve was a further three minutes down in 17th, and fell to tenth overall. Nieve stood to lose time in the more straightforward stage 21 individual time trial, where he, like most of the team, struggles mightily. He indeed finished well down, in 114th place on the day nearly four minutes slower than the day's winner David Millar. With Sivtsov tenth two and a half minutes better than Nieve, he took the Basque's top-ten overall position, leaving Nieve to finish the Giro 11th overall. Antón, for his part, finished in 18th place, having lost nearly twenty minutes in stage 19.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{steering}} influence of an upper-level ridge to its northeast, BOB03 {{began to take}} a more northwesterly course. The ridge also provided a highly conducive environment for intensification and eventually became positioned atop the strengthening cyclonic storm, slowing the cyclone and allowing it to generate good outflow. With these conditions in place, BOB03 entered a phase of rapid intensification, strengthening faster than climatological rates. BOB03 strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm at 03:00UTC on 27October and attained very severe cyclonic storm intensity just nine hours later with the storm centered 650km (405mi) south of Chittagong, Bangladesh. An eye emerged on visible satellite imagery early on 28October, and at 15:00UTC that day, the IMD classified BOB03 as a super cyclonic storm, the highest rating on the IMD's cyclone scale. Using the Dvorak technique, the IMD estimated that BOB03 reached its peak intensity three hours later with maximum sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 912mbar (hPa; 26.93inHg); this made BOB03 the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean by pressure with sustained winds at the time matched by only two other known cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. At the time, the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone was the only storm in the region of comparable intensity. Although the storm's organization and appearance deteriorated as it neared land, BOB03's intensity <b>held</b> <b>steady</b> up until it made landfall on the Odisha coast between Puri and Kendrapara at 06:00UTC on 29October.|$|E

50|$|The monopod {{allows a}} still camera to be <b>held</b> <b>steadier,</b> {{allowing}} the photographer to take sharp pictures at slower shutter speeds, and/or with longer focal length lenses. In {{the case of}} video, it reduces camera shake, and therefore most of the resulting small random movements. Monopods are easier to transport and quicker to set up than conventional tripods, making them preferable for on-the-go (OTG) photography. An OTG photographer {{is not able to}} carry a heavy, bulky tripod around, and when he or she sees a potential shot, there is no time to bother with setting up a complicated tripod. A simple monopod is easy to carry, easy to set up, and enables the photographer {{to take advantage of the}} situation he or she is presented with, all while providing camera support to capture a clear, sharp image. Examples of situations in which a monopod is preferable include wildlife and sports photography where you can dramatically increase the stability of long lenses, travel photography, particularly around the golden hours and of course outdoor macro photography, especially when trying to photograph insects etc.|$|R
