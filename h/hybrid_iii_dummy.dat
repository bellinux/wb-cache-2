25|$|The <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> for three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, {{and does}} not provide the same {{physical}} outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy,</b> it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When {{using data from the}} real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the head and neck kinetics of three-point belted <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> and Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) in frontal impacts, and compare their responses with data from post mortem human subjects (PMHS). Surrogates were placed on a buck, capable of accommodating different anthropometry with similar initial positioning. Duplicate tests were conducted at low, medium, and high (3. 6, 6. 9, and 15. 8 m/s) velocities. Upper and lower neck forces and moments were determined from load cell measures and its locations with respect to the ends of the neck. Head excursion-time responses were more repeatable in the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> than the THOR dummy. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> response was more rigid in the sagittal plane. Peak THOR motions were closer to PMHS. Based on times of occurrences of peak excursions, THOR was closer to PMHS at all velocities, while <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> showed biofidelity at the medium and high velocities. Controlled positioning and testing with different surrogates provide an evaluation of inter-subject responses. THOR was more likely to “get the head where and when it needs to be” in frontal impacts. With the importance of testing at lower speeds due to recent recognition of real-world injuries, these data suggest that THOR may be an optimal dummy for frontal impacts. Comparisons of head-neck kinetic data with PMHS are valuable in frontal impact injury assessments...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> chest loading in heavy vehicle frontal crashes. In total, eight truck front-to-trailer-type sled tests were performed. The Hybrid III, in driver position, was {{equipped}} with the chest deflection sensor system RibEye and its standard potentiometer sensor was compared with the RibEye deflection data. The chest impact point was established by using Fuji film impression, as well as from video data. Chest-to-steering wheel rim contact occurred in all tests. Differences in chest loading were found between the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> reference test and the load case identified in this study, predominantly impact velocity, direction, distribution and location of loading. The steering wheel rim contact is the major contributor to chest deflection. The chest deformation consists of anterior/posterior compression and upward deflection of the sternal plate. The Hybrid III standard chest deflection sensor is not reliable in this load case due to the modes of sternal displacement and the single-point measurement location. Combining the RibEye system with global dummy kinematic data and accurate contact detection is required to fully assess chest deflection.

In 1997, the European Whiplash project started with the airn to develop passive safety methodologies to reduce the frequency of neck injuries in rear-end impacts.

The objective {{of this paper is}} present the design of this dummy, and to present its performance in comparison with human volunteer and post mortem human subject (PMHS) tests. Also a comparison is made with the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> in similar test conditions. In the comparison with human volunteers in a real car seat, both the RID 2 and the Hybrid III showed realistic kinematics. Lower neck rolation as well as the typical S-shape in the neck were found in the RID 2, but not in the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy.</b> Ramping up was not found in the Hybrid III, while the RID 2 did show limited ramping up. The upper neck forces measured in both dummies were reasonably good in the regular car seat, but upper neck torques were not well predicted in either dummy. Compared to PMHSs placed on a rigid seat without a head restraint, the Hybrid III was found to be less biofidelic than the RID 2, as the kinematics of the human subjects were better approximated by the RID 2 than by the Hybrid III, which was mainly attributed to the stiff spine and neck of the Hybrid III.

However, the poor biofidelity of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy</b> and the evaluation method based on the neck rearward rotational angle of the dummy during rear impact are urgent issues. To solve these issues, a dynamic evaluation of OC-T 1 displacement, corrected for the seat back rearward inclination (hereinafter called “dynamic backset”), using BioRID II which has superior biofidelity, was studied to establish a test method with higher effectiveness, repeatability and reproducibility. From dynamic Backset evaluations by dynamic tests and simulations using IIWPG crash pulse on various types of seats and analysis of real world minor neck injuries involving such seats in Japan, the following new facts were found. (1) Dynamic backset can evaluate the effectiveness of various types of seats with whiplash mitigation features, such as reactive, passive, and WHIPS, more accurately than neck rearward rotation of Hybrid III. Since the seat effectiveness increases as dynamic backset decreases, it is appropriate for a dynamic evaluation parameter as an alternative of static backset tests. (2) By setting each seat back to its design torso angle, instead of 25 degrees for every seat, the variation in BioRID II installation is decreased, resulting in higher repeatability and reproducibility.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the design of the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummy's</b> hip joint can cause high spikes in the chest accelerations. These spikes are {{generated}} when the pelvis rotation is suddenly stopped by the bottoming out of the hip joint. This creates large lumbar shear and tension forces which act to resist forward movement of the dummy's chest. This problem has partly been resolved by the introduction of 'modified femurs'. However, even with modified femurs, high peaks have still been observed in chest accelerations of some front barrier crashes. In order to analyze the load path from upper legs to chest, dynamic experiments have been performed on the hip joint (with modified femurs and with standard femurs), on the isolated lumbar spine and on a partial dummy consisting of upper legs, torso, neck and head. These tests have been used to significantly improve an existing model of the dummy. In the hip joint, a considerable rate-dependency was found and the adjustment of hip friction was found to be an important factor. For different lumbar spines from the same manufacturer, major differences in response were found. These differences between dummy parts are a concern for reproducibility of full dummy tests.

5000|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>III,</b> the 50th {{percentile}} male dummy {{which made}} its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, {{and he is now}} a family man. If he could stand upright, he would be 175 cm (5'9") tall and would have a mass of 77 kg (170 lb). He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 65 km/h (40 mph) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a [...] "big brother", the 95th percentile <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III,</b> at 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) and 100 kg (223 lb). Ms. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152 cm (5 ft) tall and 50 kg (110 lb).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{restrained}} occupants over the age of 50 in frontal crashes have a higher risk of injury in the rear seat than in the front, and have hypothesized that the incorporation of technology such as belt pre-tensioning and force limiting preferentially in the front seat is at least partially responsible for this trend. This study investigates the potential benefits and trade-offs of seat belt pretensioners and force-limiters in the rear seat using a series of frontal impact sled tests at two speeds (48 km/h and 29 km/h ΔV) with a buck representing the interior of the reat seat occupant compartment of a contemporary mid-sized sedan. Four different dummies were tested: the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> six year old (in a booster seat, H 3 6 YO), the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> 5 th percentile female (H 3 AF 05), the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> 50 th percentile male (H 3 AM 50), and the THOR-NT. The restraints consisted of either a standard three point belt, or a 3 -point belt with a retractor pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter (FL+PT). Each test condition was repeated in triplicate. The FL+PT restraints (compared to the standard restraints) resulted in a significant (p≤ 0. 05) decrease in peak internal chest deflection for each of the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>III</b> <b>dummies</b> at both test speeds (48 km/h: 29 % decrease for H 3 6 YO, 38 % decrease for H 3 AF 05, 30 % decrease for H 3 AM 50), and for the THOR-NT at a ΔV of 29 km/h. At 48 km/h, the FL+PT restraint qualitatively decreased the average peak internal chest deflection of the THOR-NT, however this decrease was not statistically significant (p= 0. 06). Furthermore, the FL+PT system allowed little or no increase in forward head excursion, and improved whole-body kinematics for all dummies by restricting pelvic excursion and slightly increasing torso pitch. The results suggest that the FL+PT system studied here may provide injury-reducing benefit to rear seat occupants in moderate to high severity frontal crashes, although more study is needed to evaluate these restraints in other crash scenarios...|$|R
