5|$|Sources {{differ on}} why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was not {{economical}} to own houses anymore.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was time to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and {{on the verge of}} breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought {{it may be necessary to}} break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was the only way forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E

5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was time to use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, the {{military}} {{committee of the}} Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party spent most of its time plannining to take power through a conventional military coup. The military committee <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> had to capture al-Kiswah and Qatana, two military camps, seize control of the 70th Armoured Brigade at al-Kiswah, the Military Academy {{in the city of}} Homs and the Damascus radio station. While the conspirators of {{the military}} committee were all young, the sitting regime had been slowly disintegrating and the traditional elite had lost effective political power.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> {{was in the best}} interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E

5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was important to work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E
5|$|King {{decided to}} appoint two {{additional}} ministers, one {{in charge of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force, the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy. He therefore, asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services. Macdonald, who had fought in World War I as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium, <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was his duty to fight World War II as a political leader in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.|$|E

His parents divorced when he was seven. McAvoy's mother suffered from poor health and subsequently <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> was best that he live with his maternal grandparents, Mary and James Johnstone, a butcher {{who lived in a}} terraced council house in the nearby Drumchapel area of Glasgow. His mother lived with them intermittently. McAvoy has a sister, Joy, and a younger half-brother, Donald. McAvoy has not been in contact with his father since childhood.|$|E
5|$|On several occasions, Park was {{the number}} one {{trending}} topic on Twitter, even topping the Oscars on March 8. Park's fans revealed plans to release a self-produced album in his honor on March 27 to commemorate the 200th day anniversary of his departure from Korea. However, because the album had been in preparation since January and public opinion on 2PM had since changed, the fans <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> {{would be in the}} best interest to not release the CD, and instead, mailed 1020 copies to Seattle, Park's hometown.|$|E
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> {{was better to}} mount an {{aggressive}} defence {{given the lack of}} any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E

5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> would be cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.|$|E
5|$|The band {{were well}} known for their strong stage act, and had privately {{recorded}} several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> {{would be good for}} publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not particularly interested in the album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.|$|E

After the bell was salvaged he <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> did not suit his purposes. A young farmer from Johnsburg purchased the bell, and it was again kept in storage.|$|E
