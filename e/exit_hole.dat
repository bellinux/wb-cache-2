5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} on habitat requirements {{is a key}} to successful conservation actions. The marbled jewel beetle Poecilonota variolosa (Buprestidae) has a wide global distribution but populations are often scarce and typically fragmented. In Sweden it is monophagous on aspen Populus tremula and is classified as near threatened on the Swedish Red List due to its rapid population decline. This study aimed to investigate habitat preferences and regional-scale distribution patterns of P. variolosa in southern Sweden in order to suggest conservation measures. Aspen trees in four study areas in the province of Småland were surveyed for <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> during late summer 2011. The occurrence and number of <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> (both new and old ones) per tree were compared between study areas and habitat types, and were related to the sun exposure and bark thickness of individual trees. Further, the occurrence of new and older <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> was related to tree sun exposure and bark thickness. The most preferred habitat types were aspens on clear-cuts, followed by roadside aspens, aspens in pastures, and aspens in closed forest. Thick bark and high sun exposure were consistently significant as predictors for both occurrence and number of new <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> per tree. The majority of <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> were located towards south. Our results indicate several useful management measures: to retain aspen on clear-cuts, to cut alongside roads and around some selected coarse aspens in closed forests and in pastures...|$|R
500|$|Eggs are {{deposited}} between bark crevices, flakes, or {{cracks and}} hatch {{about two weeks}} later. Eggs are approximately [...] in diameter, and are initially white, but later turn reddish-brown if fertile. After hatching, larvae chew through the bark to the inner phloem, cambium, and outer xylem where they feed and develop. Emerald ash borer has four larval instars. By feeding, larvae create long serpentine galleries. Fully mature fourth-instar larvae are [...] long. In fall, mature fourth-instars excavate chambers about [...] into the sapwood or outer bark where they fold into a J-shape. These J-shaped larvae shorten into prepupae and develop into pupae and adults the following spring. To exit the tree, adults chew holes from their chamber through the bark, which leaves a characteristic D-shaped <b>exit</b> <b>hole.</b> Immature larvae can overwinter in their larval gallery, but can require an additional summer of feeding before overwintering again and emerging as adults the following spring. This two-year life cycle {{is more common in}} cool climates, such as European Russia.|$|E

Then {{he was able to}} sit down on his bed; but when the water sank to a depth of two feet, he again lay on his back and floated. He knew that a thick deposit of mud would be left, and that it was {{essential}} for his plan that he should drift to the <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> of the water, and there be found, with the mud and slime undisturbed by footsteps or movement. Another ten minutes, and he lay on his back on the ground {{in a corner of the}} dungeon to which the water had floated him, having taken care towards the end to sink his head so that his hair floated partly over it, and as the water drained off remained so. He guessed it to be about midday, and he expected to be left undisturbed until night.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Salsola species, {{including}} Salsola australis. Young larvae hatch bore {{directly into}} the leaves {{and then into the}} branches and stems where they feed in the central pith and complete their development. Full-grown larvae cut an <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> in the stem, leaving only a thin layer of epidermis to cover the <b>exit</b> <b>hole.</b> After cutting the <b>exit</b> <b>hole,</b> the larva retreats a short distance into its tunnel and pupates. Full-grown larvae are about 17 mm long and orange.|$|E
2500|$|Tree {{infestation}} can {{be detected}} by looking for <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> 3/8 to 3/4inches in diameter (1–2cm) often in the larger branches of the crowns of infested trees. Sometimes sap can be seen oozing from the <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> with coarse sawdust or [...] "frass" [...] in evidence {{on the ground or}} lower branches. Dead and dying tree limbs or branches and yellowing leaves when there has been no drought also indicate A. glabripennis infestation. Traps can also be used containing a pheromone and a plant kairomone to attract nearby adults. Some acoustic sensors can also differentiate larval feeding within trees. Dogs can also be trained to detect the smell of frass on trees.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} is done similarly to other piercings of the cartilage of the ear. Clamps {{may be used}} but it is usually done freehand. Once the area is cleaned, the piercer and the client will agree on placement, although because of its location {{it can be difficult}} to see exactly where the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> will be. Generally the piercer will advise the client on the best location. The entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> are marked, and a hollow needle is pushed through. Many professional piercers will use either a 14g or 16g needle by default, although it is possible to use even larger gauges. The jewelry is then inserted, and the piercing complete.|$|R

50|$|It overwinters as a larva one and {{sometimes}} two times, after which it stays in its cocoon for another winter. Adults are often found on poplar trees straight after emergence. The females {{lay their eggs}} {{at the base of}} poplar trees, the larval food plant. The larvae hatch and feed mainly just {{beneath the surface of the}} bark, near ground or below it. <b>Exit</b> <b>holes</b> can often be seen near the base of poplar trees and there may be pupal cases nearby. The pupal exuvia may also be seen protruding from the <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> on the trunk of the host tree. Adults are most active in sunshine but are seldom seen. Emergence from the pupa is in early morning and synchronous. Groups of newly emerged moths can be spotted resting on the tree trunk for a few hours before flight.|$|R

50|$|A {{design by}} Yuji Ohya, a {{professor}} at Kyusu University, further modified the diffuser by adding a broad ring around the <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> and an inlet shroud at the entrance. This design amplifies {{the positive effects of}} a normal diffuser shroud to result in a more efficient diffuser. The brimmed <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> creates stronger vortices than a regular diffuser, which means that the pressure difference is greater than it would be with a normal diffuser. As a result, wind is able to reach higher speeds. In addition, the inlet shroud at the entrance makes it easier for air to enter, so air won't be slowed down as much going in.|$|E
50|$|To {{serve as}} habitat, the shrubs {{apparently}} must have stems 2.5 cm (1 in) or greater in diameter at ground level. Use {{of the plants}} by the animal is rarely apparent. Frequently, the only exterior evidence of the shrub's use by the beetle is an <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> created by the larva just before the pupal stage. Field work along the Cosumnes River and in the Folsom Lake area suggests that larval galleries {{can be found in}} elderberry stems with no evidence of exit holes. The larvae either succumb before constructing an <b>exit</b> <b>hole</b> or are not far enough along in the developmental process to construct one.|$|E

40|$|Maize {{stem borer}} (MSB), Chilo partellus Swinhoe, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae {{is one of}} the most {{important}} insect pest of maize in Nepal. Host plant resistance is the cost-effective, ecologically sound and stable approach to reduce damage by stem borers. Forty four maize genotypes were screened for resistance to maize stem borer at the research field of National Maize Research Program, Rampur during spring seasons (March to June) of two consecutive years 2013 and 2014. The maize genotypes were evaluated in randomized complete block design with three replications and data were collected on foliar damage rating, tunnel length and number of <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> made by the borer. The foliar damage and tunnel length damage were significant for genotypes for both the years. The <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> were not significant in 2013 but significant in 2014 ranging from 2 - 6 scale. The foliar rating ranged from 2 to 5. 5 in 2013 and 1. 1 to 4. 5 in 2014 on a 1 - 9 rating scale. The highly resistant genotypes (10 cm scale. The least susceptible genotypes (< 5 cm) were RampurSO 3 F 8, RampurSO 3 FQ 02 and RampurS 10 F 18. The genotypes having least <b>exit</b> <b>holes</b> (2. 0) in 2014 were RampurSO 3 F 8, RampurSO 3 FQ 02, RampurS 10 F 18. Thus less damage parameters were observed in R-POP- 2, RML- 5 /RML- 8, RampurSO 3 F 8, RampurSO 3 FQ 02 and RampurS 10 F 18 and therefore they can be used as parents or as sources of resistance in breeding program...|$|R
