40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aimed {{to find the}} most {{sensitive}} placement of the skull to perceive speech through the bone vibrator in various protection methods while being exposed to noise. Twenty young normal-hearing adults (10 male and 10 female) participated in the study. As stimulus, Korean spondee words were presented via one of five skull locations (i. e., jaw angle, condyle, temple, mastoid, and vertex), while the participants wore one of four protection methods (i. e., ear form, ear plug, <b>ear</b> <b>muff,</b> and ear form and muff together) against white noise in one of four noise directions (i. e., 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees). The results showed: 1) {{there was a significant difference}} among the five skull locations with condyle being the most sensitive placement; 2) there was a significant difference among the four protection methods, with the ear form plus <b>ear</b> <b>muff</b> condition (or dual protection) providing the lowest threshold; 3) when exposed to noise from 90 degrees, the significantly lowest threshold was found; 4) there was no significant difference in results by gender. The pattern of results suggests that the communicative condition via the condyle bone conduction and the dual protection of the air conduction under any noise direction might be ideal for preventing noise-induced hearing loss, although further studies should b...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the bone conduction (BC) part and the air conduction (AC) part of one's own voice has previously not been well determined. This relation is important for hearing impaired subjects as a hearing aid affects these two parts differently and thereby changes the perception of one's own voice. A large ear-muff that minimized the occlusion effect while still attenuating AC sound was designed. During vocalization and wearing the <b>ear</b> <b>muff</b> the ear-canal sound pressure {{could be related to}} the BC component of a person's own voice while the AC component was derived from the sound pressure at the entrance of an open ear-canal. The BC relative to AC sensitivity of one's own voice was defined as the ratio between these two components related to the ear-canal sound pressure at hearing thresholds for BC and AC stimulation. The results of ten phonemes showed that the BC part of one's own voice dominated at frequencies between 1 and 2 kHz for most of the phonemes. The different phonemes gave slightly different results caused by differences during vocalization. However, similarities were seen for phonemes with comparable vocalization.

The hearing level at 4000 Hz was used to indicate the noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS). The lumberjacks were exposed, at their present pace of work, to noise, Leq values 96 - 103 dB(A), and to the vibration of a chain saw (linear acceleration 30 - 70 ms- 2). The chain saws of the early 1960 s were more hazardous, with the average noise level of 111 dB(A) and a variation acceleration of 60 - 180 ms- 2. When classified on the basis of age, the lumberjacks with VWF had about a 10 dB greater NIPTS than subjects without VWF.

With the same duration of ear protection the lumberjacks with VWF consistently had about a 10 dB greater NIPTS than those without VWF. The differences in NIPTS were statistically significant.

The proposed FbAANC headset was effective against wideband industrial noise, with a maximal noise spectrum power reduction of 37. 9 dB. The study also evaluates the effects of FbAANC headset on speech intelligibility on a disyllabic Mandarin word discrimination test (WDT) platform.

40|$|Abstract: The {{incidence}} of collisions between motorcyclists and other vehicles may be significantly reduced by research that improves the acoustic awareness of cyclists, and thus heightens {{the ability of}} cyclists to respond to unexpected incursions from the surrounding traffic. We use our hearing as an early warning system, and hearing swiftly redirects our vision and attention. This shift in gaze is critical to our capacity to assess the location, direction of travel, and velocity of approaching vehicles. The present study was composed of two experiments. In the first experiment a Neumann KU- 100 dummy head with embedded binaural microphones {{was used to measure}} noise levels in a motorcycle helmet as a function of velocity. Noise levels were measured in two helmets, one with active noise reduction technology, and one without. The results showed that noise levels exceeded 100 dB (A) at highway speeds in the absence of noise reduction technology. The helmet with active noise control <b>ear</b> <b>muffs</b> was able to attenuate helmet noise by up to 26 dB. Active noise control technology shows great promise for noise reduction for the motorcycle helmet industry, and the development of “quiet” helmets is important for both hearing conservation and highway safety.

40|$|Jet engines {{designed}} for high-speed aircraft commonly include C-D nozzles to obtain supersonic speeds. The radiated {{noise from the}} jet exhaust reaches acoustic levels which may cause hearing damage to the pilot and the air-field personnel even though {{state of the art}} noise protection such as noise-canceling <b>ear</b> <b>muffs</b> are employed. It is therefore extremely important to keep the noise levels as low as possible. Understanding the noise generation mechanism is of great importance in order to reduce strength of the noise sources. Typical far-field noise spectral characteristics from the supersonic jet exhaust consist of turbulent mixing noise and shock-associated noise. Another noise component named'crackle' is radiated from the jet under certain circumstances. Although it does not appear in the noise spectra due to its characteristics, its rasping character is perceived as a dominant annoyance factor by the human ear. Since it does not appear in the spectrum other measures are needed to identify the existence of'crackle'. Statistical tools like Skewness and Kurtosis applied to the far- and near-field pressure signals and the time derivate of the pressure signal have been shown in literature to be useful for identification of'crackle' events. In this paper the near-field and far-field acoustic radiation from a supersonic jet is analyzed using LES with a code developed at Chalmers University of Technology. The code has previously shown to accurately capture far-field noise spectra of supersonic jets under a variety of moderately cool jet conditions. In the present study we move towards more realistic high-speed aircraft conditions with higher jet exhaust temperatures. The nozzle is operated at slightly underexpanded conditions (NPR = 4. 0) and three different stagnation temperature ratios NTR = 1. 0, NTR = 2. 0 and NTR = 3. 0.
