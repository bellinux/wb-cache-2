40|$|Region-based {{compilation}} repartitions {{a program}} into more desirable compilation units using profiling information and procedure <b>inlining</b> <b>to</b> enable region formation analysis. Heuristics {{play a key}} role in determining when it is most beneficial <b>to</b> <b>inline</b> procedures during region formation. An ILP optimizing compiler using a region-based approach restructures a program to better reflect dynamic behavior and increase interprocedural optimization and scheduling opportunities. This paper presents an interprocedural compilation technique which performs procedure inlining on-demand, rather than as a separate phase, to improve the ability of a region-based optimizer to control code growth, compilation time and memory usage while improving performance. The interprocedural region formation algorithm utilizes a demand-driven, heuristics-guided approach <b>to</b> <b>inlining,</b> restructuring an input program into interprocedural regions. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the impact of the algorithm and several inlining heuristics upon a number of traditional and novel compilation characteristics within a region-based ILP compiler and simulator.

It weighs 10 kg and travels at 6 km/h, a similar speed to the Toyota Winglet. Honda U3-X is a compact experimental device that fits comfortably between the rider's legs, to provide free movement in all directions just as in human walking - forward, backward, side-to-side, and diagonally. It uses Honda Omni-Traction (HOT) drive system to permit it to move in any lateral direction. The system uses multiple small diameter motorised wheels connected <b>inline</b> <b>to</b> form one large diameter wheel. Rotating the large diameter wheel moves the U3-X forward and backward, while rotating the small diameter wheels moves it side-to-side. Combining these movements causes the U3-X to move diagonally.|$|E

The east-facing border boasts 150 m of length and features a curved <b>inline</b> <b>to</b> {{the northern end}} of the wall as it adjoins to the Head Gardeners Cottage. This border is significant in many respects because of its orientation to both the Sun and its immediate environment. Currently this border houses an eclectic mixture of hardy shrubs and delicate flowers with Morello cherries, plums and heritage roses fighting for superiority against the wall. The south-facing border extends {{from the end of the}} old Vinery to the north eastern corner of the gardens. Traditionally this wall is mainly used for growing exotic fruits, including peaches, nectarines, apricots and pears. In 2007 it was extended to border out its full depth, unlike the east-facing border a mixture of flowers and vegetables are grown here. Curiously, the leafy plants that grow against the wall, known as Echium, are native to North Africa and are only known to grow on the extreme south-west tip of Cornwall and nowhere else in the UK.|$|E

Terra's op ed served to justify the nomination.

She is often seen wielding two bokutos and very skilled with it, which she treasures as it was a gift given to her from her brother when she was young. She is also the most protective of Saya, going as far as to dress up [...] "lady-like" [...] to fool Saya's sister, and at practically any moment will come and fight (most of the time it being Tadashi under a misunderstanding). She is displayed as a tomboy to the point some believe she is really a guy, though she has a desire to appear more girly. However she usually attacks anyone nearby out of embarrassment after doing something she considers girly. She has a developed a crush on the Student Council President after he told her that if anyone made fun of her for being more girly he would [...] "purify them", but will try to beat him out of embarrassment, even if she thinks about him in another room she will run over to where he is and beat him. She is considered dumb, as she nearly was able to figure out that Saya and Tadashi were dating, only to stop because her head started to hurt from thinking. She has a brother who is a cross-dresser, where ironically he is mistaken to be a girl, looking like a younger and more feminine version of Yuna, while wearing women's clothing. However, he is much stronger than her and <b>inline</b> <b>to</b> inherit the family Dojo, who wishes to change it to be completely girly. This also shows the reason Yuna first joined up with Saya was because her amazement of her strength and her wish for Saya to train her so she could defeat her brother and this also explains why she is the most battle-hungry member of the gang. She has a habit of grabbing Tadashi to where his head is against her breasts, though she seems to be unaware of this habit. She has also become addicted to mushrooms after eating them, even eating poisonous ones though she appears to be immune to them. She also loves eating chicken, something she likes to keep secret because of Momo's love for birds.|$|E
