Then less than five minutes into the second quarter, Redskins safety Brad Edwards picked off a pass from Salisbury and returned it six yards to the Vikings 33, and Washington cashed <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> turnover with Earnest Byner's 3-yard rushing touchdown, giving them a 10-7 lead.|$|E

25|$|Lakshmi is {{believed}} to roam the earth on Diwali night. On the evening of Diwali, people open their doors and windows to welcome Lakshmi, and place diya lights on their windowsills and balcony ledges to invite her <b>in.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> day, the mothers who work hard all year, are recognized by the family and she is seen to embody a part of Lakshmi, the good fortune and prosperity of the household. Small earthenware lamps filled with oil are lighted and placed in rows by some Hindus along the parapets of temples and houses. Some set diyas adrift on rivers and streams. Important relationships and friendships are also recognized during the day, by visiting relatives and friends, exchanging gifts and sweets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E

In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo [...] defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: [...] "It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject.

500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight.

500|$|Dwarf Fortress {{was praised}} for its depth and complexity. Jonah Weiner from The New York Times stated, [...] "Many {{simulation}} games offer players {{a bag of}} building blocks, but few dangle a bag as deep, or blocks as small and intricately interlocking, as Dwarf Fortress." [...] PC Gamer's Steve Hogarty commented, [...] "Dwarf Fortress's reluctance to expend even a joule of energy in prettying itself results in astonishing hidden complexity." [...] Regarding the open-ended nature and emergent gameplay, Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith found that with its procedurally generated world and characters simulated [...] "down to the most minute detail", the game's results are [...] "often hilarious, occasionally tragic, and always surprising." [...] Mike Rose from Gamasutra said, [...] "...to an outsider looking <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> game so many years into development, with such a wide scope of features and potential play styles, it's {{fair to say that}} getting into Dwarf Fortress is {{perhaps one of the most}} daunting tasks the video game industry as a whole can provide." ...|$|E
500|$|The South African League, a new uitlander movement, {{prepared}} two petitions, {{each with}} more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking {{on the role of}} mediator. [...] "You must make concessions on the franchise issue", Steyn counselled. [...] "Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede... Should you not give <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends." [...] Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was [...] "prepared to do anything"—"but they must not touch my independence", he said.

500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{book is a}} {{response}} to various debates of Darwin's time far more wide-ranging than the questions he raised in Origin. It is often erroneously assumed that the book was controversial {{because it was the first}} to outline the idea of human evolution and common descent. Coming out so late into that particular debate, while it was clearly Darwin's intent to weigh <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> question, his goal was to approach it through a specific theoretical lens (sexual selection), which other commentators at the period had not discussed, and consider the evolution of morality and religion. The theory of sexual selection was also needed to counter the argument that beauty with no obvious utility, such as exotic birds' plumage, proved divine design, which had been put strongly by the Duke of Argyll in his book [...] (1868).|$|E
2500|$|This {{change in}} {{direction}} from the LAJF Board of Directors led some alumni to voice their concerns.

The petition also questioned whether sufficient financial oversight existed, contended that excessive operating expenditures were the cause for LAJF’s current financial difficulties, and also questioned the LAJF Board’s calculations and justifications for the $4–5 million in estimated capital expenditures cited as [...] "needed." [...] SaveCRS later created and circulated a Declaration which over 450 alumni signed seeking fundamental change in how the LAFJ operates and in directing the organization toward maintaining the tradition of operating two single sex 7 week camps in the Red Hook and Clinton locations.|$|E
