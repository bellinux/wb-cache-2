In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and {{played a crucial role}} in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first <b>electric</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E

Kettering invented an easy credit approval system, a precursor to today's credit cards, and the <b>electric</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> which made ringing up sales physically much easier for sales clerks all over the country. Kettering distinguished himself as a practical inventor. As he said, [...] "I didn't hang around much with other inventors and the executive fellows. I lived with the sales gang. They had some real notion of what people wanted." [...] During his five years at NCR, from 1904 to 1909, Charles Kettering secured 23 patents for NCR. He attributed his success to {{a good amount of}} luck but added, [...] "I notice the harder I work, the luckier I get." ...|$|E

GE and IBM planned to integrate COBOL into their own languages, GECOM and COMTRAN, respectively.
