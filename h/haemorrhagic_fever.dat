25|$|Omsk <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> virus {{appears to}} have evolved within the last 1000 years. The viral genomes {{can be divided into}} 2 clades — A and B.

Clade A subsequently underwent division into clade C, D and E 230 years ago. Clade C and E appear to have originated in the Novosibirsk and Omsk Provinces respectively. The muskrat Ondatra zibethicus which is highly susceptible to this virus was introduced into this area in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Transmission to {{vertebrates}} usually occurs via a tick vector. THOV {{persists in}} the tick, {{remaining in the}} organism as it goes through its developmental stages; this is called transstadial transmission. The virus can be transmitted to another host within a day of attachment to the host. THOV can be transmitted between ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, {{in the absence of}} a detectable level of virus in the blood. Such nonviraemic transmission has also been observed with other predominantly tick-transmitted RNA viruses, including bluetongue, Crimean–Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever,</b> louping ill, tick-borne encephalitis, vesicular stomatitis virus and West Nile virus viruses. Transmission of DHOV by respiratory aerosol has also been observed.|$|E

500|$|Conteh {{spent his}} {{professional}} career working with patients suffering from Lassa fever, a viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> endemic to West Africa. [...] Lassa fever was first {{brought to the}} attention of the public in 1969 during an outbreak in Nigeria. Identified in 1972, the disease is known to spread through its host, the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), and infects an estimated 300,000 people and results in 5000 deaths annually in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. In 1976, a nosocomial outbreak in the Panguma Catholic Hospital attracted attention in the United States. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established research programs in Segbwema, Kenema, and Panguma to study the disease.|$|E

2500|$|Australian {{historian}} Gavan McCormack {{argued that}} the claim of US biological warfare use was [...] "far from inherently implausible", pointing out {{that one of the}} POWs who confessed, Walker Mahurin, was in fact associated with Fort Detrick in Maryland, a biological weapons research facility. He also pointed out that, as the deployment of nuclear and chemical weapons was considered, {{there is no reason to}} believe that ethical principles would have overruled the resort to biological warfare. He also suggested that the outbreak in 1951 of viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever,</b> which had previously been unknown in Korea, was linked to biological warfare. A 1988 book on the Korean War, by Western historians Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings also suggested the claims might be true. In 1989 a British study of Unit 731 strongly supported the theory of United States-Japanese biological warfare culpability in Korea. The official Chinese government stance by the mid-1990s was that biological warfare was a real threat at the time and they reacted properly in order to prevent serious epidemics from spreading throughout North Korea and China.|$|E

40|$|Filoviral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (FVHF) {{are caused}} by agents {{belonging}} to Filoviridae family, Ebola and Marburg viruses. They are amongst the most lethal pathogens known to infect humans. Incidence of FVHF outbreaks are increasing, with affected number of patients on the rise. Whilst {{there has been no}} report yet of FVHF in Zambia, its proximity to Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo, which have recorded major outbreaks, as well as the open borders, increased trade and annual migration of bats between these countries, puts Zambia at present and increased risk. Previous studies have indicated bats as potential reservoir hosts for filoviruses. An increasing population with an increasing demand for resources has forced incursion into previously uninhabited land, potentially bringing them into contact with unknown pathogens, reservoir hosts and/or amplifying hosts. The recent discovery of a novel arenavirus, Lujo, highlights the potential that every region, including Zambia, has for being the epicentre or primary focus for emerging and re-emerging infections. It is therefore imperative that surveillance for potential emerging infections, such as viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> be instituted. In order to accomplish this surveillance, rapid detection, identification and monitoring of agents in patients and potential reservoirs is needed. International co-operation is the strategy of choice for the surveillance and fight against emerging infections. Due to the extensive area in which filoviral infections can occur, a regional approach to surveillance activities is required, with regional referral centres. There is a need to adopt shared policies for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. There is also need for optimisation of currently available tests and development of new diagnostic tests, in order to have robust, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests that can be used even where there are inadequate laboratories and diagnostic services...|$|R

Climate modelling and forecasting have not yet reached the stage where confident predictions of regional changes at the level of a virus endemic area can be made. However, in the regions where pathogenic arenaviruses now circulate, significant effects are likely to include increases in surface temperature, changes in the extent and distribution of rainfall, the occurrence of extreme weather events, glacier retreat, and coastal flooding as a result of sea level rise.

40|$|The {{emerging}} and re-emerging {{diseases are}} posing a great health {{risk for the}} last few years. One such category of diseases is viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHFs), which have emerged in the new territories, worldwide. Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) cases, {{for the first time in}} India, were reported from Gujarat, in January 2011.

Nonetheless, with recent experience in control of epidemic diseases, and advances in basic scientific knowledge; the public health community is better prepared for these unexpected events. This review provides information to physicians on CCHF for managing outbreak, and identifies public health measures to prevent emergence and re-emergence of VHFs (including CCHF) in future.

The overall risk to travellers is conservatively estimated at < 1 in 1 million travel episodes to African countries where infection is present, and febrile patients returning from these countries are at least 1000 {{times more likely to}} have malaria than Lassa fever or another VHF. No cases have been reported in fellow travellers exposed to a travelling case and only one asymptomatic seroconversion (to Lassa) has been reported in over 2000 contacts following care of VHF cases in modern Western hospital settings. However, healthcare-associated transmission of infection has been a major problem in some endemic settings. The potential for healthcare-associated infection and the threats posed by unrecognised or new agents necessitate a high index of suspicion and a standardised risk assessment approach to febrile travellers.
