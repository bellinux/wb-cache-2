5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance; my mother was {{stroking}} my sister's fair hair...and I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E
5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of}} the Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a {{particular}} interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E

5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jungle.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

25|$|Simultaneous {{advances}} in early seismic imaging techniques {{in and around}} Wadati–Benioff zones along the trenches bounding many continental margins, together with many other geophysical (e.g. gravimetric) and geological observations, showed how the oceanic crust could <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mantle, providing the mechanism to balance {{the extension of the}} ocean basins with shortening along its margins.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch East Indies had a non egalitarian and patriarchal {{social and}} legal system. Indo {{children}} were for instance only registered as European if the European father decided to acknowledge his children with his indigenous partner.

Elbe was sometimes introduced by Gottlieb as her own sister when she was dressed in female attire. Only her closest friends knew once she had transitioned.|$|E
25|$|Four German cruisers {{survived the}} engagement, {{which they would}} not have done except for the mist. Strassburg nearly {{approached}} the battlecruisers but saw them in time and turned away. She had four funnels, like the British Town-class cruisers, which caused sufficient confusion to allow her time to <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist. The German battlecruisers Moltke and Von der Tann left the Jade at 14:10 and began a cautious search for other ships. Rear Admiral Hipper arrived in Seydlitz at 15:10, but by then the battle was over.|$|E

25|$|Except for the Tobol, Ishim, and Irtysh rivers (the Kazakh {{names for}} which are, respectively, Tobyl, Esil, and Ertis), {{portions}} of which flow through Kazakhstan, all of Kazakhstan's {{rivers and streams}} are part of landlocked systems. They either flow into isolated bodies of water such as the Caspian Sea or simply <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> steppes and deserts of central and southern Kazakhstan. Many rivers, streams, and lakes are seasonal, evaporating in summer. The three largest bodies of water are Lake Balkhash, a partially fresh, partially saline lake in the east, near Almaty, and the Caspian and Aral Seas, both of which lie partially within Kazakhstan.|$|E
25|$|With {{the reason}} for the late arrival of help {{explained}} (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome – he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not relish the prospect of explaining the missing money.

He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss. They depart, with Maurice quietly wishing Rosie the luck she'll need.|$|E
25|$|The River Mole flows nearby. As {{its name}} suggests, {{the river in}} places goes {{underground}} due to the chalk bed being dissolved, forming swallow holes (sinkholes). Ian Middleton tells of his father, sometime in the 1950s, the village police officer P.C. Middleton, looking past his bathroom mirror one morning whilst shaving to see a mature oak tree <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. It {{turned out that the}} river flowing underground had been gradually wearing away the supporting ground under the tree, forming a giant such hole which had collapsed. The subsequent pit was not filled in until about 1968 approx when it was still 30ft deep and 30ft across. P.C. Middleton also reportedly removed parts from an unexploded V2 rocket which fell in the village during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Seven years later, Utah is an FBI agent candidate. He {{attends a}} {{briefing}} on a skyscraper heist, {{in which the}} criminals steal diamonds, escaping by parachute, in Mumbai. A similar heist happens over Mexico where the criminals unload {{millions of dollars in}} bills over Mexico, then <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Cave of Swallows. Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. They have already completed three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah is sent undercover to France under a field agent named Pappas (Ray Winstone). They reach France and Utah gets help from others to surf the tall tube wave.|$|E
25|$|A second work of fiction, {{provisionally}} titled Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after The Realms, {{it takes}} that epic's major characters—the seven Vivian sisters and their companion/secret brother, Penrod—and places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding {{during the same}} years {{as that of the}} earlier book. Begun in 1939, it is a tale of a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many later {{stories of the}} origins of the Delphic Oracle. One late explanation, which is first related by the 1st century BC writer, Diodorus Siculus, tells of a goat herder named Coretas, who noticed one day that one of his goats, who fell into a crack in the earth, was {{behaving}} strangely. On entering the chasm, he found himself filled with a divine presence and could see outside of the present into the past and the future. Excited by his discovery he shared it with nearby villagers. Many started visiting the site to experience the convulsions and inspirational trances, though some were said to <b>disappear</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cleft due to their frenzied state. A shrine was erected at the site, where people began worshiping in the late Bronze Age, by 1600 BC. After the deaths of a number of men, the villagers chose a single young woman as the liaison for the divine inspirations. Eventually she spoke on behalf of gods.|$|E
