500|$|Kostova's {{interest}} in the Dracula legend began with the stories her father {{told her about the}} vampire when she was a child. The family moved from the U.S. to Ljubljana, Slovenia in 1972, while her father was teaching for a year at a local university. During that year, the family traveled across Europe. According to Kostova, [...] "It was the formative experience of my childhood." [...] She [...] "was fascinated by [...] because they were...from history in a way, even though they weren't about real history, but <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> in these beautiful historic places." [...] Kostova's {{interest in}} books and libraries began early as well. Her mother, a librarian, frequently took her and her sisters to the public library– they were each allowed to check out 30 books and had a special shelf for their library books.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{growing up}} in the {{predominantly}} white area of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Dixon's father Melvin would take her to the Notting Hill Carnival in London to allow her to experience some of her Jamaican heritage. The music she would hear influenced her tastes, as she commented: [...] "all the dancehall records I saved up to buy – Shabba Ranks, Buju Banton – <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> at Notting Hill". When asked during an interview who her favourite songwriter was, Dixon replied: [...] "Lauryn Hill. I love Lauryn Hill because she is not scared to talk about real life. She may say things that are slightly controversial but she gets people thinking and gets people talking". Dixon has also named Neneh Cherry as great influence upon her. Cherry, a mixed race singer, inspired her from an early age, with Dixon saying, [...] "I remember seeing Neneh Cherry on the TV when I was little and turning to my mum and saying, 'Mummy, she looks like me'".|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, at {{the urging}} of a friend that worked as a sound {{technician}} at the 550 Blues club in Macon, Walden set up an audition for local rock band September Hase with the intent of giving them pointers about the music industry. [...] Upon seeing them perform, however, he was blown away by their talent and potential and felt that they had everything he'd been looking for in a band for the last 25 years. [...] "The first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> play, I literally cried," [...] Walden later said. [...] "I had tears going down my face." [...] He immediately decided to come out of retirement to manage the band, and signed them at the Red Tomato restaurant in Macon in July 2008. [...] In September 2009, Walden and September Hase amicably parted ways.|$|E

[...] Walden, a retired manager of Otis Redding, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Outlaws, had set up an audition showcase for the band with the intent of giving them a few pointers about the music industry. [...] When he heard them play, however, he was blown away by their talent and potential. [...] "The first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> play, I literally cried," [...] Walden later said. [...] "I had tears going down my face." [...] The band signed a one-year management contract with Walden at The Red Tomato in Macon in July 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Fellow {{musician}} Paul Kelly {{wrote and}} performed [...] "Charlie Owen's Slide Guitar", which {{was released on}} Words and Music (May 1998). Kelly recalled seeing a Tendrils' gig when [...] "Charlie played a strange, harsh run of notes that seemed wrong to me at first. But when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> a second time, a verse or two later, they lifted my head clean off my shoulders". Kelly played the track for Owen backstage in Bendigo after a gig where Owen and Maurice Frawley had performed as a duo {{and they had been}} followed on stage by Kelly and Spencer P. Jones, also as a duo. While Kelly played the newly written song, Owen mistakenly believed they were [...] "just sitting around making up lyrics and stuff ... they're taking the piss out of me, the pricks". Days later Owen had the situation clarified and later acknowledged that he was [...] "flattered and touched" [...] by Kelly's tribute.|$|E
2500|$|Joubert {{was educated}} at Diocesan College in Rondebosch, South Africa, {{which was founded}} by the Anglican Church and {{maintained}} a high standard of music-making. He originally hoped to become a painter, and did {{a fair amount of}} art at school. However, at about the age of 15 years, he gradually became interested in music, though as a composer rather than a performer. [...] "It was always going to be something creative. Oddly enough, the visual arts haven't been as great a stimulus as literature. I was also interested in writing. In fact, I was bored by everything at school except writing, art and music!" [...] In school, he came under the guidance of the musical director Claude Brown, whose teaching he regarded as [...] "an indispensable foundation to my subsequent musical career". According to Joubert, [...] "hrough Brown, I learned all the Elgar choral works ever before <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>them</b> properly in full orchestral performance. Not only that idiom, but the idiom of Anglican church music generally. Parry and Stanford, and all the usual blokes." [...] Through his teacher's encouragement, Joubert was able to participate in choral performances with the Cape Town Municipal Orchestra under William J. Pickerill, and subsequently to hear his works featured in performance.|$|E
