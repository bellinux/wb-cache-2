5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of <b>Dragnet.</b> Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E

5|$|When Seymour later arrives {{that morning}} {{suffering}} a toothache, Mushnick sends Seymour to Dr. Farb, {{who tries to}} remove several of his teeth without anesthetic to get even with Seymour for ruining Farb's flowers. Grabbing a sharp tool, Seymour fights back and accidentally stabs and kills Farb. Seymour is horrified that he has now murdered twice, and after posing as a dentist to avoid the suspicion of Farb's masochistic patient Wilbur Force, Seymour feeds Farb's body to Audrey Jr. The unexplained disappearances {{of the two men}} attract the attention of the police and Mushnick finds himself questioned by Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie (take-offs of <b>Dragnet</b> characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith,). Although Mushnick acts suspiciously nervous, Fink and Stoolie conclude that he knows nothing. Audrey Jr., which has grown several feet tall, is beginning to bud, as is the relationship between Seymour and Audrey (whom Seymour invites on a date).|$|E
40|$|Survey Compared of the Fishing of Minor Tuna by the Double <b>Dragnets</b> and the Dugouts in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Ivory Coast. The both {{units of}} peaches (double <b>dragnets</b> and dugouts) that {{practice}} in Ivory Coast have captured 168, 833. 3 tons of minor tuna. Six {{species have been}} met in the landings of the <b>dragnets</b> pelagic and Scomberomorus tritor (79 %) was the dominant of all (Sarda sarda, Auxis thazard, Euthynnus alletteratus, Scomber japonicus and Acanthocybium solandri). On the other hand, {{the level of the}} dugouts, Auxis thazard (58 %) and Euthynnus alletteratus (40 %) were abounding. The big sizes have been captured by the contraptions netting nets, and the small sizes, by the <b>dragnets</b> pelagic. At the species it is the opposite that is observed itself. The Acanthocybium solandri effort of fishing was pronounced during the cold periods with elevated captures and many varieties of species, the catch per unit effort remained weak. During all the year, the species captured massively in cold season were Euthynnus alletteratus, Auxis thazard, Acanthocybium solandri, Scomber japonicus and Sarda sarda, exploited by the dugouts; while the one in hot season was Scomberomorus tritor captured by the double <b>dragnets...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{devil fish}} has a limited range {{and a low}} rate of reproduction. As a result it is {{sensitive}} to environmental changes. The main threats to this species come from pollution in the Mediterranean and bycatch capture in various fishing equipment including trawls, tuna traps, and <b>dragnets</b> meant for swordfish. The 2004 IUCN Red List listed the devil fish as a vulnerable species. It was reclassified as endangered in 2006 due to low population resilience coupled with continued high bycatch mortality.|$|R
50|$|France {{notes that}} the Sea of Galilee {{at the time was}} known for its prosperous fishing industry. This was mainly based around fishing for sardines, carp, and musht fish. Various methods were used, but nets were common. <b>Dragnets</b> were common, but they {{required}} a large team to use. This verse is thus more likely referring to some form of gill net. Fishing was a common occupation of the region and that the disciples seem to own their own equipment is evidence that they were relatively prosperous.|$|R

50|$|Other {{important}} {{sources of}} nutrients in the Andaman Sea are seagrass and the mud bottoms of lagoons and coastal areas. They also create a habitat or temporal shelter for many burrowing and benthic organisms. Many aquatic species migrate from and to seagrass either daily or at certain stages {{of their life}} cycle. The human activities which damage seagrass beds include waste water discharge from coastal industry, shrimp farms {{and other forms of}} coastal development, as well as trawling and the use of push nets and <b>dragnets.</b> The 2004 tsunami affected 3.5% of seagrass areas along the Andaman Sea via siltation and sand sedimentation and 1.5% suffered total habitat loss.|$|R

5000|$|Long {{before the}} {{appearance}} of Europeans, Native Americans operated a dried salmon industry from the Columbia River, trading salmon to the plains tribes. The Native Americans usually captured salmon by manually hauling seine nets (<b>dragnets).</b> The nets were woven with spruce root fibers or wild grass, and used sticks made of cedar as floats and stones as weights. The movement of the sticks during seining helped keep the fish together. The technique was to [...] "sweep nets during ebb tide from upstream to down, with the net anchored at the beach upstream. A boat then carried the net out and around salmon migrating upstream." ...|$|R
