That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie <b>folks,</b> <b>who</b> care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|In a February 2009 {{interview}} with Jalylah Burrell of Vibe magazine, Gil Scott-Heron discussed the album's concept and title, {{as well as}} the social and political atmosphere at the time of Winter in Americas recording. In retrospect, he stated [...] "We felt as though we had come across something that people did not understand or did not recognize but that's the season that we were going into, not for three months but {{for an extended period of}} time. A lot of the <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was the folks in charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Country Stars Central, Smith {{said that she was}} ill with the stomach flu while recording the album, but, [...] still enjoyed making the record, Produced by country and bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs (White's husband), the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards. The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, for <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> are fans any of these three singers, {{this is kind of a}} treat.|$|E

But there's not much in this edition {{that makes it a}} [...] "must buy" [...] for <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> already own a copy or two of the previous editions".

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Vision of Love" [...] {{is set in}} common time and in the key of C major. Carey's vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high whistle note of C7. The song's lyrics and melody were written and composed by Carey, with Margulies, Miller, Klyce and Rip on the instrumentals. Lawrence and Walden produced the song, which heavily deviated from its original version on Carey's demo. Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly wrote regarding the song's instrumentation and vocals [...] "From those opening sci-fi-esque synths to that signature dog-whistle high note, Mariah's very first single is inspired: Even <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> object to her trademark vocal excesses are hard-pressed to fault this rousing, gospel-tinged song about finding 'the one that I needed.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: [...] "I am a Christian, and I am {{a devout}} Christian. I {{believe in the}} redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be {{cleansed}} of sin and have eternal life." [...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Holmes from Destructoid {{questioned}} {{the controversy over}} the decision by stating [...] "While there are surely plenty of <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> adore seeing their screen filled with frilly thong shots, I imagine there may be even more players out there who'd find the sudden prioritization of arse in their fighting games to be little out of place." [...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E

In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for what ails us {{is going to come}} from the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say {{with all due respect to}} a lot of <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E
500|$|She later {{described}} {{this period of}} her life to Essence saying [...] "People {{need to understand that}} the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that {{for the sake of the}} machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> weren't happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter was {{positive}} {{of all the}} changes made to the original that showcased Raven's considerable efforts, but stated that the game was still at its core one from 2007. He cited the story as an example, saying that the game's campaign was still worth playing despite having been topped by its competition. Carter further noted that the cast were [...] "nothing more than warm bodies at points", but opined that {{the crux of the}} story and the relationship between main protagonist Soap and Captain Price was [...] "worth the price of admission". Alternatively, he found the multiplayer to be timeless, and that the design of each map held up well and felt justified. He compared the multiplayer to those offered by other first-person shooter games, such as the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, stating [...] "There's a nice, comfortable balance between the two philosophies, to the point where it's not too alienating for <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> didn't grow up with twichy FPSes or feel like dedicating the time to learning {{the ins and outs of}} breaching and clearing each and every room, knocking on permadeath's door on every match." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Save the Last One" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us a whole lot to process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs {{to do a better job}} of biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study in the context of a zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> just want brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs. In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case. I have such a place in my heart for Britney".|$|E
