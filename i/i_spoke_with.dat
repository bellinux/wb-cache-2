25|$|Since my retirement, I have {{remained}} {{in close contact with}} many of the staff and players on the Galaxy. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> some of them that week and they jokingly asked if I was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by the injuries and departures.|$|E
2500|$|Ned {{loved the}} Navy {{as a man}} might love his own family. For the Navy was his family, the junior {{officers}} he trained and the enlisted men who did {{so much of the}} hand-labor in the boats. He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his father, would then write about the things he'd seen and done... More than once <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> him about the psychological aspects of combat, and every time he told me what I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E
2500|$|On May 24, 2011, McKinney {{appeared}} on state-run television in Libya {{and stated that}} United States participation in military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war was [...] "...not what {{the people of the}} United States stand for and it's not what African-Americans stand for". Also on Memri-TV, McKinney stated [...] "On a previous visit to Libya, I was able to learn about the Green Book, and the form of direct democracy that is advocated in The Green Book. When I went back to the United States, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> Senator Mike Gravel, who was a presidential candidate, just like me, in 2008, because he too is pushing a form of direct democracy for the United States. That is because the government of the United States fails to represent the interests of the American people now. The government is here, and the people of the US are here." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cuando era pequeño, hablaba español con mi abuela = [...] "When I was young, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> Spanish <b>with</b> my grandmother" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> perhaps, <b>with</b> bitterness, but I {{could not}} help it. Not a word of {{kindness}} had I had all the weary way.|$|R
60|$|Priscilla {{threw me}} an upbraiding glance. But <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> again, <b>with</b> a bitter and revengeful emotion, as if flinging a {{poisoned}} arrow at Hollingsworth's heart.|$|R
60|$|That {{action at}} once {{deprived}} {{me of my}} self-possession. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> the ungovernable rashness of a boy.|$|E
60|$|Emily rewarded me for {{the warmth}} with which <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>with</b> a sweet smile and a slight blush.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> Jerry about it; {{but he had}} no {{suggestion}} to offer, save that I had better refer the matter to Joshua Barney.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> greater sincerity {{than when}} I agreed {{with her that}} it would be deplorable in the highest degree. She took an anxious breath.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> {{recently}} <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a National Transit tenant {{involved in}} the development of the arts (with keys in hand - see photo) who provided the following information: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ben Gunn," [...] he answered, and {{his voice}} sounded hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock. [...] "I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am; and <b>I</b> haven't <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a Christian these three years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly;--can {{you doubt}} it?" [...] I replied, closing my horse nearer to hers as <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>with</b> an {{expression}} of interest which I {{did not attempt to}} disguise.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> warmth, I know; for the {{doctrine}} of Dr. Reasono was new to me; and by this time, my esprit de corps had pretty effectually blinded reflection.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a vehemence, for {{the thought}} carried me beyond myself, that this upstart parson his Lordship had {{but a year}} since sent among us should {{question}} our family reputation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{from the}} moment we met here yesterday--the moment of my first seeing you with Mrs. Server. The look you gave me then was really the {{beginning}} of everything. Everything"--and <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> now <b>with</b> real conviction--"was traceably to spring from it." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus I have {{no doubt}} that Mr. Darwin's {{hypothesis}} will be found competent to explain the majority of the phenomena exhibited by species in nature; but in an earlier lecture <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> cautiously <b>with</b> respect to its power of explaining all the physiological peculiarities of species.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> this <b>with</b> {{a raised}} voice and cheerful countenance, I found it greatly {{encouraged}} him; so we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon the first {{appearance of the}} boat's coming from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and had indeed secured them effectually.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} passed this {{spot in the}} course of my peregrinations, if that is what you mean," [...] I replied. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> studied politeness; my idea was to rebuke his rudeness.|$|E
60|$|They {{say that}} <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a {{distinct}} enunciation, but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry, {{as if in}} dread of interruption before concluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.|$|E
6000|$|Soon Bes and I {{were in our}} chariot {{which by}} command took place in line {{with that of the}} King, but at a {{distance}} of some thirty steps. Bending over the dwarf who drove, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> him, saying, ...|$|E
60|$|Lov. I {{know not}} yet what {{conditions}} he'll propose. <b>I</b> should have <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> him last night, but that a cross chance hindered it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> cheerily, <b>with</b> a view {{to comfort}} Eve, but I confess that great anxiety filled me when I looked at the poor woman's wan face and {{emaciated}} frame. The blood, too, appeared to me a fatal symptom, though I had but a hazy idea of everything relating to disease.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> the horn, <b>with</b> {{a ringing}} scrape, left the carpet, {{and a moment}} later bumped down upon Mrs. Quigg's head. [...] "Oh!" [...] she shrieked, [...] "it hit me!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> {{a little}} heat, {{thinking}} of the bloody dirk he had hidden {{in his pocket and}} designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity.|$|E
6000|$|She {{repeated}} the question. For once Fortune favored us. A timely {{knock at the}} door stopped her just as she was trying to release herself from me. [...] "Somebody coming in," [...] I said. The servant entered, as <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>with</b> a letter from the rectory.|$|E
6000|$|So now, in a {{situation}} threatening to become every moment more scaly, I did not lose my head. I preserved the old sang-froid. Smiling a genial and affectionate smile, and hoping that it wasn't too dark for it to register, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a jolly cordiality: ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. When physic's past, {{what remains}} but to send for the divine? here's little Nicodemus, your father's chaplain: <b>I</b> have <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> him already; for a brace of angels he shall make all sure betwixt you without a license; aye, and prove ten at night a more {{canonical}} hour than ten i'the morning.|$|R
6000|$|Powers {{paused a}} moment. [...] "To Wazuchistan," [...] he said, [...] "yes. But {{it must not}} be known. I shall return in a month--or never. If <b>I</b> fail"--he <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> an assumed lightness--"it is only one more grave among the hills. If I succeed, the Cabinet is saved, {{and with it the}} destiny of England." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was near}} the door, {{on the point of}} leaving me. As <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> she turned <b>with</b> a ghastly stare of horror--felt about her with her hands as if she was groping in darkness--and dropped on the floor.|$|R
60|$|What curious {{people are}} these seafarers! They coast the whole world, and {{know nothing of}} it, being more ignorant and {{helpless}} than children on shore. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> the Yankee mate of a ship one day at Venice, and {{asked him how he}} liked the city.|$|E
6000|$|... "Difficult or not, {{something}} must be done, {{something must}} be said. I could not, and would not, sit silent with all that beauty modestly mute in my presence. I spoke thus, and still <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> calm. Quiet as my words were, I could hear they fell in a tone distinct, round, and deep.|$|E
60|$|Bel. When <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> you, I knew it not: But I {{discovered}} {{it in the}} erecting of my figure. Yet if, instead of his idea, I constrained himself to come, {{in spite of his}} resolution to remain concealed, I think I have shown a greater effect of my art than what I promised.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the Cristobal," [...] replied De Lucco, gesticulating, [...] "it was despatched. Where is the Cristobal? Off Cape Antonio <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> her <b>with</b> {{a broken}} shaft. A tramp coaster was towing {{her back to}} New Orleans. I brought money ashore {{thinking}} your need for it might not withstand delay. In this envelope is one thousand dollars. There is more if you need it, Mr. Maloney." ...|$|R
60|$|I have {{scarcely}} mentioned {{my beloved}} {{mother in the}} whole of this letter; for though little has ever passed between us on this subject through the medium of language, and nothing whatever, I believe, since <b>I</b> last <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> you upon it, yet I have long been well aware of the tendency of her desires, long indeed before my own in any degree coincided with them.|$|R
40|$|This {{news item}} from The New York Times is about: To {{learn more about}} sports {{nutrition}} for dogs, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> recently <b>with</b> Dr. Joseph Wakshlag, a professor of clinical nutrition and sports medicine at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, N. Y., {{and the author of}} a comprehensive new review about nutrition for active dogs, published this month in Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice...|$|R
