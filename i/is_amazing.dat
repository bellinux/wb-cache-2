5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only has}} there been a rapid {{increase}} in the number of commemorative coins issued. Also the ingeniousness and imagination involved <b>is</b> <b>amazing.</b> Non-circulation commemorative coins are now issued in any thinkable shape, size and colour. They are issued with enamel finish, with holograms, with stone inlay, coins made of glass, in the form of jig-saw puzzles, with a countdown ticker built in, and numerous other unusual features.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> {{to think}} that this is the only country in Europe where this form of sport is not permitted... There seems to be the mistaken idea that it would be {{necessary}} to close the roads. This, of course, is entirely wrong... There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport.|$|E

25|$|As one {{contemporary}} points out, {{there were}} economic benefits with the internment of Japanese Canadians. Specifically, white fishermen directly benefited {{due to the}} impounding of all Japanese-Canadian owned fishing boats. Fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half {{of all of the}} licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also that every year thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the Japanese from salmon fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten percent a year, until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. The fact that any Japanese Canadians were still fishing in British Columbia at the outset of World War II <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> due to the pressure they faced from the province, country, and other fishermen. Yet the reason the government gave for impounding the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a horrific coastal attack on British Columbia.|$|E
500|$|Scheyer's {{offensive}} game <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> ... He hits jumpers {{from all}} manner of pogo-stick angles. He can hit runners while shooting back across his body. He can drive and finish in acrobatic ways. His offensive repertoire of ways to score is like a magician's bag of tricks. Offensively, he is a modern-day 'Pistol' Pete Maravich.|$|E

500|$|About {{two thirds}} of Du Fu's 1500 extant works are in this form, and he is {{generally}} considered to be its leading exponent. His best lǜshi use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions.

Ladbrokes experienced its busiest ever 24 hours of gambling on a television series ahead of the episode's transmission, taking £100,000 in bets on 30 different characters, while William Hill took £500,000, surpassing the amount placed on Dallas Who shot J. R.? storyline in 1980. Spokesman Rupert Adams commented: [...] "The BBC were amazing keeping this quiet.

500|$|... "The show is {{extremely}} technical, extremely fast-paced, and {{the variety of}} music <b>is</b> <b>amazing.</b> [...] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance, to Country and Western; there's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front, beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and pennywhistles. Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's a hard worker and she expects everybody else to work as hard or harder. I respect that." ...|$|E
500|$|Zelda Fitzgerald's {{collected}} writings (including Save Me the Waltz), {{edited by}} Matthew J. Bruccoli, {{were published in}} 1991. New York Times literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, [...] "That the novel was written in two months <b>is</b> <b>amazing.</b> That for all its flaws it still manages to charm, amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable. Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded, in this novel, in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed at something of her own, and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer with, as Edmund Wilson once said of her husband, a 'gift for turning language into something iridescent and surprising.'" ...|$|E
500|$|All eight capital {{ships of}} the 1909–1910 Naval Programme {{had the same}} {{arrangement}} of masts and funnels; only the two battlecruisers had their foremast and forward funnel positions exchanged at considerable expense. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> that {{it took so long}} to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the DNO's insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships." ...|$|E

[...] Guetta told Billboard that [...] "the track with Kelly has made him experiment with a more American urban influence. Musically, it's pure pop {{with a lot of}} detail."

500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{considered}} {{to have a good}} chance of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond Phillips said, [...] "The funny thing about the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which <b>is</b> <b>amazing,</b> I mean you don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode. They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues, with Pinkner noting that [...] "we’re sort of in a zone of episodes where each one <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there’s a cliffhanger– several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and {{is also important to}} the overall patchwork of the season. We were very happy this ended up being one before we went on a little break. I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the {{few things}} {{retained}} from earlier ships was the position of the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>amazing</b> that it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)'s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements.
