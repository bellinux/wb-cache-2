40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{comprehensive description}} of a new phenomenon of peer-to-peer in- surance focusing on the classification of its main tendencies. The extended overview is accompanied by the original and unique analysis of the business model of The First Club Insurance Carrier, the only Czech peer-to-peer insurance company. The suitability of the concept developed by The First Club Insurance Carrier is tested using five different scenarios derived from its competitors on the Czech insurance market. The profitability and ability to produce payable bonuses for clients in an appropriate amount as proposed by {{the founders of the}} company are considered on the ground of scenarios simulating the future development of The First Club Insurance Carrier. On the basis of the created prediction scenarios, the research concludes that the company could achieve a positive economic result in next few years. The amount of givebacks (payable bonuses) has not accomplished the expected amount of 15 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>earned</b> <b>premium</b> but it ranges between 9 % and 10 % in most scenarios. This thesis offers also some requirements for more favorable outcomes (such as a better distribution of <b>gross</b> <b>earned</b> <b>premium</b> between reinsurance and claims expenses). The subsequent what-if analysis showed the insignific- ance of the potential [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Should {{incurred}} {{claims and}} <b>earned</b> <b>premiums</b> {{used in the}} calculation of Medical Loss Ratio for rebate calculations be on a direct (no reinsurance) basis? Proposed Resolution: Incurred claims and <b>earned</b> <b>premiums</b> used in the calculation of Medical Loss Ratio for rebate calculations should reflect federal and state programs that provide risk adjustment, risk pooling, and reinsurance. Incurred claims and <b>earned</b> <b>premiums</b> should also reflect commercial stop-loss reinsurance that covers the excess cost of an individual’s claims above a certain high threshold.

5000|$|<b>Earned</b> <b>premium</b> is {{the portion}} of an {{insurance}} written premium which is considered [...] "earned" [...] by the insurer, based {{on the part of}} the policy period that the insurance has been in effect, and during which the insurer has been exposed to loss. For instance, if a 365-day policy with a full premium payment at the beginning of the term has been in effect for 120 days, 120/365 of the <b>premium</b> is considered <b>earned.</b> <b>Earned</b> <b>premium</b> will not be returned to the insured if the policy is cancelled.|$|R

30|$|On average, {{across all}} {{countries}} in the sample, employers and own-account professional workers <b>earn</b> a <b>premium</b> compared to employees, although there are important differences across countries and between men and women. Gender differences are particularly strong when examining earnings premiums for employers and professionals. Overall, male employers and professionals earn an 18 percent premium compared with all employees, while women face a penalty of roughly the same magnitude. In terms of regional differences, earnings premiums for employers and professionals are largest for men in middle income Latin American countries. On the other hand, women employers and professionals do not earn a statistically significant premium compared to employees in any region of the world. In addition, neither male nor female employers and professionals <b>earn</b> <b>premiums</b> in either high income or developing countries in Europe and Central Asia. Conditions appear to be favorable for employers and professionals in Latin America, as they are more numerous and <b>earn</b> greater <b>premiums</b> versus formal employees. In contrast, conditions seem to be less favorable for the same group in Europe and Central Asia, where they are fewer and do not <b>earn</b> <b>premiums</b> vs. formal employees.|$|R

40|$|Should {{incurred}} {{claims and}} <b>earned</b> <b>premiums</b> {{used in the}} calculation of Medical Loss Ratio for rebate calculations be on a net of reinsurance basis? Proposed Resolution: Yes, incurred claims and <b>earned</b> <b>premiums</b> should be on a net of reinsurance basis, {{as reported in the}} Income Statement {{that is part of the}} quarterly financial statutory reports. For example, where a company has entered an assumption reinsurance transaction to transfer 100 % of the premiums and claims for certain policies to a second company, the second company should report the assumed premiums and claims as part of its MLR and rebate calculations. Exceptions: Incurred claims and <b>earned</b> <b>premiums</b> should be adjusted to remove the impact of any quota-share reinsurance that covers a percentage smaller than 100 % of the claims obligations, because quota-share reinsurance can be used to “game the system ” by blending a low MLR from one company with a high MLR from a second company in order to avoid paying rebates based on the low MLR. Neither assumed excess reinsurance sold to an insurer nor stop-loss insurance sold to a self-funded employee welfare plan should enter into the MLR calculation, to the extent that the claim threshold is high enough t...|$|R

40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis aims {{to specify}} and define, {{with respect to}} the Czech legislation, the profit and loss statement of the insurance companies and those items of revenues and expenses that are specific for the insurance companies. The thesis deals with the principal characteristics of the revenues and the expenses of the insurance companies {{as well as with the}} matter whether insurance companies can in any means influence their management result. It also focuses on the field of the insurance security [...] what is the insurance security in the Czech Republic in relation to the European Union, and on the quantity limits of the profit and loss statement, in the Czech insurance sector. It also assesses the efficiency of the local insurance companies in relation to this, what is the share of the <b>earned</b> <b>premium</b> when taking in account the insurance claims, the operating costs and the management result. The graduation thesis came to the conclusion that an insurance company can quite easily influence its accounting management result and therefore it is necessary for the company to respect the relevant accounting measures. Furthermore, the Czech Republic in comparison to the other EU countries indicates relatively low level of insurance security. With respect to the efficiency it is possible to conclude (in relation to the year 2012 and the local insurance companies) that the <b>earned</b> <b>premium</b> comprises of more that 60 % of the claimed damages, 30 % of the operating costs and 10 % of the <b>earned</b> <b>premium</b> represents the net profit...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{summarize}} the main trends in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States using data drawn from the March Current Population Surveys covering the period between 1961 and 2002. We show that inequality started to increase for men in 1974, and for women in 1981, and for both genders inequality continued to increase throughout 2002. During the same period the wage premium of college graduates over non-college workers increased substantially and the ratio of college educated workers to non-college workers also increased. These facts support the popular skill-biased technical change (SBTC) hypothesis. However, other facts raise some doubts about the SBTC hypothesis. First, the college wage premium is mainly due to workers with a postgraduate degree, but their increase in the labor force started much earlier than the spectacular rise in their wages. Also there has been no marked change in recent decades in the occupational distribution of work-ers. However, the <b>earning</b> <b>premium</b> of professional over blue collar workers followed the same trend as the college <b>earning</b> <b>premium.</b> And fi nally, the most dramatic changes in the labor market took place among women.
