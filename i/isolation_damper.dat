The stochastic {{model of the}} El-Centro 1940 earthquake, which preserves the non-stationary evolution of amplitude and frequency content of ground motion, is used as an earthquake excitation. The base isolated structure consists of a linear flexible shear type multi-storey building supported on a base isolation system. The resilient-friction base isolator (R-FBI) is considered as an isolation system. The non-stationary stochastic response {{of the system is}} obtained by the time dependent equivalent linearization technique as the force-deformation behaviour of the R-FBI system is non-linear. The optimum damping of the R-FBI system is obtained under important parametric variations: i. e., the coefficient of friction of the R-FBI system, the period and damping of the superstructure; the effective period of base isolation.

The biaxial force-deformation behaviour of the bearings is considered as bi-linear modelled by coupled non-linear differential equations.

40|$|The KDamper {{is a novel}} passive {{vibration}} <b>isolation</b> and <b>damping</b> concept, based essentially on {{the optimal}} combination of appropriate stiffness elements, which include a negative stiffness element. The KDamper concept does not require any reduction in the overall structural stiffness, thus overcoming the corresponding inherent disadvantage of the ‘‘Quazi Zero Stiffness’’ (QZS) isolators, which require a drastic reduction of the structure load bearing capacity. Compared to the traditional Tuned Mass damper (TMD), the KDamper can achieve better isolation characteristics, without the need of additional heavy masses, {{as in the case}} of the T Tuned Mass damper. Contrary to the TMD and its variants, the KDamper substitutes the necessary high inertial forces of the added mass by the stiffness force of the negative stiffness element. Among others, this can provide comparative advantages in the very low frequency range. The paper proceeds to a systematic analytical approach for the optimal design and selection of the parameters of the KDamper, following exactly the classical approach used for the design of the Tuned Mass damper. It is thus theoretically proven that the KDamper can inherently offer far better <b>isolation</b> and <b>damping</b> properties than the Tuned Mass damper. Moreover, since the <b>isolation</b> and <b>damping</b> properties of the KDamper essentially result from the stiffness elements of the system, further technological advantages can emerge, in terms of weight, complexity and reliability. A simple vertical vibration isolation example is provided, implemented by a set of optimally combined conventional linear springs. The system is designed so that the system presents an adequate static load bearing capacity, whereas the Transfer Function of the system is below unity in the entire frequency range. Further insight is provided to the physical behavior of the system, indicating a proper phase difference between the positive and the negative stiffness elastic forces. This fact ensures that an adequate level of elastic forces exists throughout the entire frequency range, able to counteract the inertial and the external excitation forces, whereas the damping forces and the inertia forces of the additional mass remain minimal in the entire frequency range, including the natural frequencies.

The device, a mass connected to a frame through two SMA wires, is subjected to a series of continuous acceleration functions {{in the form of a}} sine sweep. Frequency responses and transmissibility of the device as well as temperature variations of the SMA wires are analyzed for the case where the SMA wires are pre-strained at 4. 0 % of their original length. Numerical simulations of a one-degree of freedom (1 -DOF) SMA oscillator are also conducted to corroborate the experimental results. The configuration of the SMA oscillator is based on the PVID device. A modified version of the constitutive model proposed by Boyd and Lagoudas, which considers the thermomechanical coupling, is used to predict the behavior of the SMA elements of the oscillator. The second part of this work numerically investigates chaotic responses of a 1 - DOF SMA oscillator composed of a mass and a SMA element. The restitution force of the oscillator is provided by an SMA element described by a rate-independent, hysteretic, thermomechanical constitutive model. This model, which is a new version of the model presented in the first part of this work, allows smooth transitions between the austenitic and the martensitic phases. Chaotic responses of the SMA oscillator are evaluated through the estimation of the Lyapunov exponents. The Lyapunov exponent estimation of the SMA system is done by adapting the algorithm by Wolf and co-workers.
