40|$|The African region {{represents}} the weak {{point of the}} world economy. Many African countries have still not finished the process of transforming their economy. Agriculture represents only a minor portion of their economies’ performance – however {{it is still a}} key sector of the economy (especially considering the number of people working in agriculture or people representing the agricultural population). The agricultural sector in many sub-Saharan countries is extremely sensitive and its stability affects the stability of the whole region. A very good example representing sub-Saharan Africa is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is a country with a lot of potential, but it is classified among the poorest countries in the world. Its economy is extremely weak (despite its significant share in total GDP formation value), and underdeveloped. The share of agriculture in total GDP formation is over 42. 5 %. The number of people living in rural areas represents over 45 million {{out of a total of}} 75 million. The number of people working in agriculture is over 60 % of the total economically active population. The economy of the country is extremely poor and fragile, mainly because of political instability. The aim of this paper is firstly to specify the position of agriculture in the DRC economy, and also to specify the production and trade commodity structure in relation to other African countries. The paper’s ambition is to identify the most perspective commodities (groups of commodities), both for production and also for trade, and to recommend such a production and trade profile which would allow the DRC the possibility of improving its competitiveness - not only in relation to other African countries, but also in relation to the global market. The production and trade commodity structures are analysed through the application of the BCG method and competitiveness analysis. In relation to these objectives, the paper provides the following conclusions. The position of agriculture in the DRC economy is stable one. Furthermore, agriculture probably {{represents the}} most stable part of the DRC economy. According to the portfolio and competitiveness analyses, the most important commodity items for the DRC are the following: Rice paddy, Maize, and Cassava. The most competitive trade items are particularly Coffee, Tea, and Cocoa, and Sugar Raw centrifugal. The most notable weakness of DRC agriculture is the production of Wheat, Beverages, Poultry Meat, and <b>Fixed</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Oils...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used}} for cooking foods in India. Controversies have been created that {{consumption}} of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> cause atherogenesis. A {{little is known about}} the effect of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic conditions. Hypercholesterolaemia, mainly the increased plasma Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) has been implicated in the early development and progression of atherosclerosis and Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD). Current study is designed to assess the effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> such as coconut, sunflower, palm, olive oil and vanaspati on lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters in rats fed on a high-cholesterol diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Hypercholesterolaemia is induced by supplementing cholesterol with the basal diet. Reference dose of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were administered once daily for 90 days. After the treatment period of 90 days, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and oxidative stress parameters are estimated and analysed. RESULTS In the present study, we observed the lipid-lowering effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in rats fed with high-cholesterol diet. Administration of cholesterol showed increased level of lipid profile. Concurrent administration of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> with high-cholesterol diet caused a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol. This conclusion is made based on the observation that the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were able to restore, at least partially, the lipid profile of hypercholesterolaemic rats. A decline of antioxidant status associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in all the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> treated groups. Among the oils, coconut oil showed a mild increase in High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and least increase in lipid peroxidation compared to other <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> treated groups. CONCLUSION Results suggest that the addition of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> showed a positive influence on lipid metabolism in hypercholesterolaemic rats. Among the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> coconut oil was found to be beneficial as it has more antioxidant property. These findings can provide useful information regarding the choice of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic patients in future...|$|R
