5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face <b>death</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hands of the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, {{and there were no}} surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E

5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose {{that he had}} not died, that his funeral was staged, and that he had escaped to Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her. Andrew Forest Muir, writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly, debunked this legend. He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's <b>death.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been four years old. That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Others, such as Professor Dr Liam Delaney, {{said the}} high child <b>death</b> rate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Home cannot be {{explained}} by higher overall child <b>death</b> rates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, nor by the higher death rate among [...] "illegitimate" [...] children. He added: [...] "This points to something serious within these institutions". [...] Kevin Higgins, a solicitor representing former residents, said {{that the number of}} <b>deaths</b> recorded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tuam home over a period of over more than 30 years was [...] "off the scale" [...] compared to the rate of children's <b>deaths</b> elsewhere <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|R

5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's <b>death</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not {{directly involved in the}} ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and <b>death</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
