500|$|On September 21, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). Although they met with Howard Benson and Rob Cavallo, the band's [...] "love of Eric’s work kind of trumped any other meeting we had." [...] Unlike their previous records, the group worked in a large studio (Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California). Warner Bros. told them, [...] "Take your time and it’s done when you’re done with it," [...] and the band re-recorded the demos. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "knew how it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out...</b> was a thorough way to do it." [...] Working in a big studio, according to Lazzara, gave the band the opportunity to [...] "have more than two guitar sounds." ...|$|E

Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on [...] "cartoon gaydar" [...] who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers.

[...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record."

[...] He added, [...] "The Defenders didn’t have a 'D' on their belt buckles and a Defenders Tower.

[...] Loeb also noted that [...] "the sky's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> open up and aliens aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> flying <b>out</b> of it.

[...] Regarding the antagonist, Ramirez said having the Defenders face an alien threat like the Avengers, for example, was [...] "never an option", as the crossover was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a street level New York story. This did prove challenging in choosing an antagonist though, as the four Defenders are shown to be [...] "really powerful people" [...] in their individual series, and the miniseries' villain had to prove a challenge for the four of them together. To form the team-up, Ramirez stated that each Defender begins to investigate a mystery separately, with the four all converging on the same location after [...] "following their own trail of bread crumbs".

60|$|Of course, {{everybody}} asked themselves {{next day}} what this book 'London's Shame' was like, and who on earth its author could be; so much so, indeed, {{that a large}} edition was completely exhausted within a fortnight. It was the great sensational success of that London season. Everybody read it, discussed it, dissected it, corroborated it, refuted it, fought over it, and wrote lengthy letters to all the daily papers about its faults and its merits. Imitators added their sincerest flattery: rivals proclaimed themselves the original discoverers of 'London's Shame': one enterprising author even thought of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> law about it as a question of copyright. Owners of noisome lanes in the East End trembled in their shoes, and sent their agents to inquire into the precise degree of squalor {{to be found in}} the filthy courts and alleys where they didn't care to trust their own sensitive aristocratic noses.

50|$|On August 24, 1981, the {{sentencing}} hearing took place. Two experts gave evidence on Chapman's behalf. Judge Edwards interrupted Dorothy Lewis, a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom, {{indicating that the}} purpose of the hearing was to determine the sentence and that there was no question of Chapman's criminal responsibility. Lewis had maintained that Chapman's decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied that the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment. The district attorney argued that Chapman committed the murder as an easy route to fame. When Chapman was asked if he had anything to say, he rose and read the passage from The Catcher in the Rye, when Holden tells his little sister, Phoebe, what he wants to do with his life:Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.

I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.The judge ordered psychiatric treatment for Chapman during his incarceration and sentenced him to 20-years-to-life, 5 years less than the maximum sentence of 25-years-to-life. Chapman was given five years less than the maximum because he pleaded guilty to second degree murder, thereby avoiding the time and expense of a trial.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, the Red Sox had Dave Henderson {{on second}} with one out. Manager John McNamara sent rookie Mike Greenwell to pinch hit for Roger Clemens in an effort to match Greenwell, a left-handed batter, against the Mets' {{dominant}} short-relief man Roger McDowell even as righty slugger Don Baylor sat on the bench; Greenwell struck out and the Sox scored no runs that inning. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to Bob Costas on an MLB Network program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens [...] "begged out" [...] of the game. Bruce Hurst and Calvin Schiraldi, who also appeared on the program, said that because McNamara had started warming Schiraldi in the bullpen in the previous inning, {{there would have been no}} bearing on the decision whatsoever as Clemens was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> for the bottom of the inning.|$|E
