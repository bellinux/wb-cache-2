500|$|Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston's {{appearance}} as {{the highlight of}} the episode. Entertainment Weekly Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox; [...] "Their interactions were along the lines of what I imagine it would have been like if Rachel's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts, and felt that Aniston's performance reminded the audience of her star power. Fallon wrote: [...] "Aniston's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat—and comedically sharp, a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she's played in the years since Friends <b>ended.</b> <b>Last</b> night's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress—and served as a frustrating reminder of what we've been missing since she has [...] abandoned that niche of acting." [...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself just fine in the small role of Jules' eccentric new therapist. She's likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Aniston's guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo". Schreffler added that Cox overshadowed her, asserting that she [...] "is still way more hilarious".|$|E
2500|$|This rivalry game, unofficially dubbed [...] "The Holy War," [...] is {{typically}} the most anticipated conference game {{for each of}} these two teams.

[...] This was the 83rd game between Utah and BYU with the series going 49-30-4 for Utah since 1922. [...] Utah dominated the series 34-2-4 through 1964. [...] Since that time BYU has led the series 28-15. [...] Utah's 4-game-winning-streak against BYU <b>ended</b> <b>last</b> year with a game-winning, last-second play.

2500|$|Following {{a hugely}} {{successful}} world tour to support Stadium Arcadium, the band {{decided to take}} an extended year long break from music in 2008. According to Kiedis, there was a collective decision [...] "not [...] do anything Red Hot Chili Peppers-related {{for a minimum of}} one year. [...] We started in 1999, with the writing and the recording of Californication, and we didn't really stop until the tour <b>ended</b> <b>last</b> year. We were all emotionally and mentally zapped {{at the end of that}} run." [...] During the break, Frusciante departed amicably with the band in July 2009 (although it wasn't publicly announced until December 2009). Josh Klinghoffer, a touring guitarist for the Chili Peppers and often collaborator with Frusciante was hired as his replacement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first season}} in the second division, Cercle ended 5th of 17 teams. The next season (2016/17), the {{competition}} was renamed to 1B and contained 8 teams.

Tubize, Oud-Heverlee Leuven and Lommel United to secure there place in 1B. Lommel United <b>ended</b> <b>last</b> in the play-downs. During the season it was obvious that Cercle could not compete with other teams anymore due to their financial status and {{the fact that many of}} the other teams had foreign investors. Cercle also began to search for an investor.

2500|$|Said Steve Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally <b>ended</b> <b>last</b> Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this can be tough to distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 14th. Scarlet.--The {{engagement}} <b>ended</b> <b>last</b> {{night by}} the complete evacuation of Grierson. Pipes cleared {{the whole country}} about that town in splendid style, and the army encamped {{on the field of}} battle; sadly reduced indeed, but victorious for the moment. The enemy, since their first appearance at Grierson, have lost 4,400 men, and have been beaten decisively back. There is now not a man on our side of the Sandusky; and our loss of 2,600 is serious indeed, but, seeing how much has been accomplished, not excessive. The enemy's horse was cut to pieces.|$|E
60|$|Since I <b>ended</b> <b>last</b> {{the world}} has turned over on its other side, in order, one must hope, to some happy change in the dream. Our friend, Miss Bayley, in that very kind letter which has just reached me and shall be {{answered}} directly (will you tell her with my thankful love?), asks if Robert and I are communists, and then half draws back her question into a discreet reflection that I, at least, was never much celebrated for acumen on political economy. Most true indeed! And therefore, and on that very ground, is it not the more creditable to me that I don't set up for a communist immediately? In proportion to the ignorance might be the stringency of the embrace of 'la vérité sociale:' so I claim a little credit that it isn't. For really we are not communists, farther than to admit the wisdom of voluntary association in matters of material life among the poorer classes. And to legislate even on such points seems as objectionable as possible; all intermeddlings of government with domesticities, from Lacedaemon to Peru, were and must be objectionable; and {{of the growth of}} absolutism, let us, theorise as we choose. I would have the government educate the people absolutely, and then give room for the individual to develop himself into life freely. Nothing can be more hateful to me than this communist idea of quenching individualities in the mass. As if the hope of the world did not always consist in the eliciting of the individual man from the background of the masses, in the evolvement of individual genius, virtue, magnanimity. Do you know how I love France and the French? Robert laughs at me for the mania of it, or used to laugh long before this revolution. When I was a prisoner, my other mania for imaginative literature used to be ministered to through the prison bars by Balzac, George Sand, and the like immortal improprieties. They kept the colour in my life to some degree and did good service in their time to me, I can assure you, though in dear discreet England women oughtn't to confess to such reading, I believe, or you told me so yourself one day. Well, but through reading the books I grew to love France, in a mania too; and the interest, which all must feel in the late occurrences there, has been with me, and is, quite painful. I read the newspapers as I never did in my life, and hope and fear in paroxysms, yes, and am guilty of thinking far more of Paris than of Lombardy itself, and try to understand financial difficulties and social theories with the best will in the world; much as Flush tries to understand me when I tell him that barking and jumping may be unseasonable things. Both of us open our eyes a good deal, but the comprehension is questionable after all. What, however, I do seem least of all to comprehend, is your hymn of triumph in England, just because you have a lower ideal of liberty than the French people have. See if in Louis Philippe's time France was not in many respects more advanced than England is now, property better divided, hereditary privilege abolished! Are we to blow with the trumpet because we respect the ruts while everywhere else they are mending the roads? I do not comprehend. As to the Chartists, it is only a pity in my mind that you have not more of them. That's their fault. Mine, you will say, is being pert about politics when you would rather have anything else in a letter from Italy. You have heard of my illness, and will have been sorry for me, I am certain; but with blessings edging me round, I need not catch at a thistle in the hedge to make a 'sorrowful complaignte' of. Our plans have floated round and round, in and out of all the bays and creeks of the Happy Islands....|$|E
