40|$|International audienceDouble {{cord blood}} {{transplantation}} extends {{the use of}} cord blood to adults for whom a single unit is not available, but the procedure is limited by its cost. To evaluate outcomes and cost-effectiveness of double compared to single cord blood transplantation, we analyzed 134 transplants in adults with acute leukemia in first remission. Transplants were performed in France with reduced intensity or myeloablative conditioning regimens. Costs were estimated from donor search to 1 year after transplantation. A Markov decision analysis model was used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness ratio within 4 years. The overall survival at 2 years after single and <b>double</b> <b>cord</b> blood transplants was 42 % versus 62 %, respectively (P= 0. 03), while the leukemia-free-survival was 33 % versus 53 %, respectively (P= 0. 03). The relapse rate was 21 % after double transplants and 42 % after a single transplant (P= 0. 006). No difference was observed for non-relapse mortality or chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The estimated costs up to 1 year after reduced intensity conditioning for single and <b>double</b> <b>cord</b> blood transplantation were € 165, 253 and € 191, 827, respectively. The corresponding costs after myeloablative conditioning were € 192, 566 and € 213, 050, respectively.

Human studies carried out in areas with high exposures have proven neurodevelopmental disorders in relation to e. g. lead and PCBs. Whether these chemicals are associated with behavioural problems in childhood at current environmental levels is not well known. Therefore, we assessed the association between prenatal exposure to lead, cadmium, PCBs, dioxin-like compounds, HCB and p,p'-DDE and behavioural problems in 7 - 8 year old children.

When the child reached 7 - 8 years, 270 mothers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire assessing their children's behavioural health. We found that doubling the prenatal lead exposure (cord blood lead levels) was associated with a 3. 43 times higher risk for hyperactivity in both boys and girls.

40|$|Acoustical {{insulation}} and absorption properties of nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically <b>lapped</b> <b>fabrics</b> are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure acoustical insulation in this research.

The mechanism of improved engraftment is, however, still incompletely understood as only one unit survives. In this multicenter phase II study we evaluated engraftment, early chimerism, recovery of different cell lineages and transplant outcome in 53 patients who underwent <b>double</b> <b>cord</b> blood transplantation preceded by a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Primary graft failure occurred in one patient. Engraftment was observed in 92 % of patients with a median time to neutrophil recovery of 36 days (range, 15 - 102). Ultimate single donor chimerism was established in 94 % of patients. Unit predominance occurred by day 11 after transplantation and early CD 4 (+) T-cell chimerism predicted for unit survival. Total nucleated cell viability was also associated with unit survival. With a median follow up of 35 months (range, 10 - 51), the cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality rate at 2 years were 39 % and 19 %, respectively. Progressionfree survival and overall survival rates at 2 years were 42 % (95 % confidence interval, 28 - 56) and 57 % (95 % confidence interval, 43 - 70), respectively. <b>Double</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> blood transplantation preceded by a reduced intensity conditioning regimen using cyclophosphamide/fludarabine/ 4 Gy total body irradiation results in a high engraftment rate with low non-relapse mortality.

40|$|Poster Presentation (Doctor’s Session) Purpose: We {{aimed to}} review the {{outcomes}} of children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in Queen Mary Hospital. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with AML who underwent allogeneic HSCT in the past 20 years (1994 - 2013) and analysed their transplant outcomes. Results: We have performed allogeneic HSCT for 45 children (29 boys and 16 girls) with AML. The median age at HSCT was 9. 1 years (range, 0. 8 to 18. 5 years). Sixteen children were transplanted in first complete remission (CR 1), 20 in second remission (CR 2), 1 in third remission (CR 3), and 8 with non-remission (NR). Donors were matched sibling (MS) (n= 19), 1 -antigen mismatched parent (MP) (n= 2), matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n= 11), or 4 - 6 / 6 HLA-matched unrelated cord blood (UCB) (single CB: n= 10, double CB: n= 3). Five-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 42. 7 % and 33. 6 % respectively. Survivals differed significantly with remission status (OS: 55 % in CR 1, 44. 6 % in CR 2, vs. 14. 3 % in CR 3 / NR; RFS: 55 % in CR 1, 24. 2 % in CR 2, vs. 14. 3 % in CR 3 / NR). OS but not RFS was significantly better in patients who received UCB compared to MS, MUD, or MP (OS: 68. 7 % vs. 34. 4 % vs. 36. 4 % vs. 0 %). OS and RFS were 100 % for patients with <b>double</b> <b>cord</b> blood transplant but the followup was short (median 9 months). Transplant-related mortalities in UCB, MS, MUD, and MP were 7. 7 %, 17. 6 %, 72. 7 % and 50 % respectively. Conclusion: Mortality remains high in children with AML despite stem cell transplantation.

40|$|Umbilical {{cord blood}} (UCB) is an {{alternative}} hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source. It is widely applicable for ameliorating several diseases through HSC transplants.

40|$|Allogeneic haematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} represents a potential life-saving procedure for many patients affected by acute myeloid leukaemia. However, {{in the past}} its application has been limited by {{the availability of a}} HLA matched sibling.

Our results suggest that the two stable cord blood units are different phenotypically and functionally: one unit shows more naive T cells, lower T cell cytokine production and higher frequencies of natural killer cells, the other shows higher frequencies of well-differentiated and functional lymphocytes. Additionally, in comparison with control patients having a single prevailing cord blood unit, the patients with donor–donor chimerism exhibit less overall T cell cytokine production and a smaller fraction of memory T cells.

Integrative models for risk assessment are lacking. We sought to develop a scoring system for prediction of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years following UCBT in AL patients.   Experimental Design: The study cohort included 3, 140 pediatric and adult AL UCBT patients from the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Eurocord registries. Patients received single or <b>double</b> <b>cord</b> blood units. The dataset was geographically split into a derivation (n = 2, 362, 65 %) and validation set (n = 778, 35 %).
