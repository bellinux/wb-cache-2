5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine <b>in</b> <b>moderation,</b> and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine <b>in</b> <b>moderation</b> (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E

25|$|There are few food wastes that {{vermicomposting}} cannot compost, although meat {{waste and}} dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract vermin. Green waste should be added <b>in</b> <b>moderation</b> to avoid heating the bin.|$|E
25|$|Also, serum {{levels of}} C-reactive protein (CRP), {{a marker of}} {{inflammation}} and predictor of CHD (coronary heart disease) risk, are lower in moderate drinkers than in those who abstain from alcohol, suggesting that alcohol consumption <b>in</b> <b>moderation</b> might have anti-inflammatory effects.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{on human health}} has implications for {{the risks and benefits}} of sun exposure and is also implicated in issues such as fluorescent lamps and health.

25|$|Though many {{possible}} remedies and folk cures have been suggested, {{there is no}} compelling {{evidence to suggest that}} any are effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover.

25|$|During {{the early}} modern period (1500–1800), Protestant leaders such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, {{the leaders of the}} Anglican Church, and even the Puritans did not differ {{substantially}} from the teachings of the Catholic Church: alcohol was a gift of God and created to be used <b>in</b> <b>moderation</b> for pleasure, enjoyment and health; drunkenness was viewed as a sin (see Christianity and alcohol).|$|E

25|$|The Hindu Ayurvedic texts {{describe}} {{both the}} beneficent uses of alcoholic beverages {{and the consequences}} of intoxication and alcoholic diseases.

25|$|A 2013 review {{found that}} there is {{insufficient}} {{evidence to suggest that}} replacing dietary sugar with non-caloric sweeteners alone is beneficial for energy balance, weight loss, or diabetes risk factors. The review found that restricting calories is more important than avoidance of sugar for weight management. However, the review concluded that replacing dietary sugar with non-caloric sweeteners is useful for managing blood sugar in diabetes patients. The review recommends that all sweeteners be consumed <b>in</b> <b>moderation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Three {{explanations}} {{have been}} suggested for the <b>moderation</b> <b>in</b> real GDP and inflation that has occurred in industrialized countries since the 1980 s: good luck, better monetary policy, and structural changes in the economy.

25|$|There {{are many}} Hindu {{groups that have}} {{continued}} to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times. Some adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood. Food affects body, mind and spirit in Hindu beliefs. Hindu texts such as Śāṇḍilya Upanishad and Svātmārāma recommend Mitahara (eating <b>in</b> <b>moderation)</b> {{as one of the}} Yamas (virtuous self restraints). The Bhagavad Gita links body and mind to food one consumes in verses 17.8 through 17.10.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine <b>in</b> <b>moderation.</b> He {{was at that time}} considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial. He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E
25|$|Intermittent hypoxia (also {{known as}} episodic hypoxia) is an {{intervention}} {{in which a}} person or animal undergoes alternating periods of normoxia and hypoxia. Normoxia is defined as exposure to oxygen levels normally found in earth's atmosphere (~21% O2) and hypoxia as any oxygen levels lower than those of normoxia. Normally, exposure to hypoxia is negatively associated to physiological changes to the body, such as altitude sickness. However, when used <b>in</b> <b>moderation,</b> intermittent hypoxia may be used clinically as a means to alleviate various pathological conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{most often}} {{mentioned}} Yamas are - Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (non-falsehood, truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Mitahara (non-excess <b>in</b> food, <b>moderation</b> <b>in</b> food), Kșhamā (non-agitation about suffering, forgiveness), Dayā (non-prejudgment, compassion) {{are among the}} widely discussed Yamas. The Yamas apply broadly and include self-restraints in one's actions, words and thoughts.|$|R

25|$|In RBMKs, {{generation}} of steam in the coolant water would then in practice create a void, a bubble that does not absorb neutrons; the reduction <b>in</b> <b>moderation</b> by light water is irrelevant, as graphite is still moderating the neutrons. However, the loss of absorption would dramatically alter the balance of neutron production, causing a runaway condition in which more and more neutrons are produced, and their density grows exponentially fast. Such a condition is called a positive void coefficient, and the RBMK has the highest positive void coefficient of any commercial reactor ever designed.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the UV Index is to help people {{effectively}} protect themselves from UV radiation, which has health benefits <b>in</b> <b>moderation</b> but in excess causes sunburn, skin aging, DNA damage, skin cancer, immunosuppression, and eye damage such as cataracts (see the section Human health-related effects of ultraviolet radiation). Public health organizations recommend that people protect themselves (for example, by applying sunscreen to the skin and wearing a hat and sunglasses) if they spend substantial time outdoors when the UV Index is 3 or higher; see the table below for more-detailed recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{soft drinks}} contain {{ingredients}} that are themselves sources of concern: caffeine {{is linked to}} anxiety and sleep disruption when consumed in excess, and some critics question {{the health effects of}} added sugars and artificial sweeteners. Sodium benzoate has been investigated by researchers at University of Sheffield as a possible cause of DNA damage and hyperactivity. Other substances have negative health effects, but are present in such small quantities that they are unlikely to pose any substantial health risk provided that the beverages are consumed only <b>in</b> <b>moderation.</b>|$|E
