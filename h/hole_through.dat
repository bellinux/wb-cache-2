5|$|In 1994, {{after the}} multi-platinum success of Weezer's self-titled debut album, Weezer {{took a break}} from touring for the Christmas holidays. In {{his home state of}} Connecticut, {{songwriter}} Rivers Cuomo began preparing material for Weezer's next album using an 8-track recorder. His original concept was a science fiction rock opera titled Songs from the Black Hole that expressed his mixed feelings about success. Weezer developed Songs from the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>through</b> intermittent recording sessions throughout 1995.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 1879, a {{post office}} was {{established}} near Hebron Church to serve the adjacent community (then known as Mutton Run). In December 1884, the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue, burning a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the sanctuary's ceiling which was soon repaired. On August 11â€“15, 1886, Hebron Church celebrated its centennial. During the celebration, Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region. The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States.|$|E
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E

50|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began on October 12, 1914, using a {{tunneling}} shield in conjunction with compressed air. The tunnel was designed by civil engineer Clifford Milburn Holland, who would later serve as the first chief engineer of the Holland Tunnel. The north tube {{of the tunnel}} was <b>holed</b> <b>through</b> on June 2, 1917, and the south tube was <b>holed</b> <b>through</b> on June 20, 1917.|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (<b>hole</b> <b>through</b> which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Amiens {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed {{movement}} on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third Army with no armoured support had almost no effect on the line while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. Australian commander John Monash was knighted by King George V in the days following the battle.|$|E
5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E

5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
5|$|He finds Misako {{and they}} go to her apartment.

Afterwards, he finds he cannot as he has {{fallen in love with}} her. In a state of confusion he wanders the streets and passes out {{on the side of the}} road. The next day he finds his wife at Yabuhara's club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara's diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the centre of his forehead.|$|E
5|$|The French {{military}} invaded Antananarivo in September 1894, {{prompting the}} queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> a {{building at the}} Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo, walkways and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive. They chose Antaninarenina as {{the site for the}} French Governor General's Residency; upon independence it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure were introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs {{at the foot of the}} hill, was brought from the Ikopa River.|$|E

5|$|The {{cessation}} of diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar prompted immediate French {{military action in}} a campaign that {{became known as the}} Second Franco-Hova War. The expedition ended eleven months later in September 1895 when a French military column reached Antananarivo and bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, blasting a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> the roof of the queen's quarters and inflicting heavy casualties among the numerous courtiers gathered in the palace courtyard. Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. Forty-five minutes later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted. The following day Queen Ranavalona signed a treaty accepting the French protectorate over Madagascar. She and her court were permitted to remain at the palace and administer the country according to French dictates.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment, but only one shell did any significant damage. It hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> which water flooded in. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and the ship's captain decided to head for the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. Escorted by Charlemagne in case she foundered en route, Gaulois managed to reach the islands. After temporary repairs, the ship was refloated and sailed for Toulon, escorted by Suffren. They encountered heavy weather en route and emergency repairs had {{to be made in the}} Bay of Navarin. She made Toulon without further incident where the ship was refitted and extensively modified to improve her stability, returning to the Dardanelles in July.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
