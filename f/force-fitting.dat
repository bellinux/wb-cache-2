The interconnection is based on plug and socket structures which have been deposited by electroplating on silicon wafers. The plug structure (micro-plug) is a so called mushroom-bump with well-defined overplating. The socket is a barrel-bump structure with an adapted inner diameter. During the bonding process the plug is pressed into the socket to form a <b>force-fitting</b> bond. The process runs with a defined pressure and can be performed at room temperature. The electrical interconnection between temperature sensitive substrates like GaAs, CdTe or bio-functionalized Chips will be possible with the described bonding method...|$|E

Errors in {{calculation}} of radiant fluxes of downwelling underwater photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) from <b>force-fitting</b> statistical values of Kd to vertical broad-band PAR profiles are compounded by vertical heterogeneity in {{such factors as}} turbidity, gilvin (= gelbstoff) and chlorophyll. Examples are given from two Tasmanian meromictic lakes where vertical zonation of gilvin and microorganisms in the mixolimnia and across the chemoclines produces a markedly heterogeneous water column. Localised con-centrations of gilvin produce kinked profiles of downwelling PAR (400 — 700 nm) and microbial plates {{in the vicinity of}} the chemoclines act as false, reflective bottoms, abruptly extinguishing residual PAR by ab-sorption and scattering...|$|E
40|$|In highly dynamic environments, {{characterized}} by changing customer preferences and uncertainty about competitive products, managing {{the development of}} a new product is a complex managerial task. The traditional practice, recommended in the literature, of reaching a sharp definition early in the new product development (NPD) process may not be optimal, desirable or even feasible in such dynamic situations. Under high uncertainty, forcing early finalization of specifications may result in a firm getting locked into a wrong definition due to incorrect assumptions about market conditions at launch. Based on our study of NPD in the high technology industry, we present a model of an approach called real-time definition, in which a firm, instead of <b>force-fitting</b> one particular definition approach to all products, adapts its product definition process to the market and competitive environment as the NPD process unfolds. Uncertainty about product specifications is resolved by frequent, repeated [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{analytical}} {{solutions and}} computer codes for well-test analysis assume a radial flow geometry around a well even though actual flow geometries {{can be quite}} different particularly in fractured media. Accurate estimation of hydraulic parameters requires knowledge of the flow geometry. Flow dimensions, representing the combined effects of flow geometry and variations in hydraulic properties, em be interpreted from the late-time slope of the pressure derivative on a log-log plot. However, the interpreted flow dimensions could be caused by {{an infinite number of}} flow geometry and hydraulic property combinations. Identifying the correct flow geometry so that appropriate hydraulic properties can be calculated is a difficult process, requiring additional information from a variety of sources. Defining a "conservative" model for a system with nonradial flow dimensions is problematic at best. Errors are compounded when hydraulic properties interpreted by <b>force-fitting</b> radial model to tests in nonradial systems are used in flow and transport models that also fail to take proper account of flow geometry. Whatever the flow dimension of a system might be, proper test interpretation and careful model construction, calibration, and testing are required to provide accurate modeling of flow and transport in that system...|$|E
40|$|The subfragment- 1 (S 1) of the {{contractile}} protein myosin is the postulated site {{of energy}} transduction in muscle. It is currently considered {{that a large}} conformational change in this moeity, which forms ‘cross-bridges’ between the thick (myosin based) and thin (actin based) filaments, is the mechanical driving force which leads to mutual sliding of {{the two types of}} filaments, and hence to contraction. We have studied the possibility that S 1 from skeletal myosin can in free solution (and in the absence of actin) be induced to undergo related changes in conformation, {{in the presence of a}} range of effectors whose action mimics stages of the contractile cycle. Analysis of the g(s *) profiles of S 1 under these conditions, displayed after <b>force-fitting</b> of the known monomer mass as conformation spectra (CON-SPECs-[7]), shows that changes of the type associated with the contractile cycle are readily detected. There is full qualitative and extensive quantitative agreement between the magnitude of the changes seen and those predicted on the basis of hydrodynamic bead modeling and high resolution electron microscopy.

40|$|Background: The vast {{computational}} {{resources that}} became available {{during the past}} decade enabled the development and simulation of increasingly complex mathematical models of cancer growth. These models typically involve many free parameters whose determination is a substantial obstacle to model development. Direct measurement of biochemical parameters in vivo is often difficult and sometimes impracticable, while fitting them under data-poor conditions may result in biologically implausible values. Results: We discuss different methodological approaches to estimate parameters in complex biological models. We make use of the high computational power of the Blue Gene technology to perform an extensive study of the parameter space in a model of avascular tumor growth. We explicitly show that the landscape of the cost function used to optimize the model to the data has a very rugged surface in parameter space. This cost function has many local minima with unrealistic solutions, including the global minimum corresponding to the best fit. Conclusions: The case studied in this paper shows one example in which model parameters that optimally fit the data are not necessarily the best ones from a biological point of view. To avoid <b>force-fitting</b> a model to a dataset, we propose that the best model parameters should be found by choosing, among suboptimal parameters, those that match criteria other than the ones used to fit the model. We also conclude that the model, data and optimization approach form a new comple...|$|E
40|$|A floristic and taxonomic {{survey was}} made of the diatom {{communities}} of sediments and microbial mats in 66 freshwater and saline lakes and pools in the Larsemann Hills, Rauer Islands and Bolingen Islands (continental eastern Antarctica). A total of 3 1 taxa were distinguished, 10 of which could not be identified to species (nine) or even generic (one) level, either because they have most probably not yet been described or because they belong to species complexes that are in need of revision. Four new combinations are proposed; three species are reported for the first time from continental Antarctica, while another three are confirmed for eastern Antarctica for the first time. Analysis of literature data on Antarctic lacustrine diatoms shows that taxonomic practice has a profound influence on the assessment of distribution patterns. <b>Force-fitting</b> of European and North American names to Antarctic taxa and erroneous identifications have contributed to an underestimation of endemism in the diatom flora of Antarctic inland waters. In addition, changing concepts on species boundaries during the last decade influence the interpretation of biogeographic patterns. The application of a more fine grained taxonomy will almost certainly reveal a higher degree of endemism in Antarctica, and especially continental Antarctica. The present case study shows that in the Larsemann Hills Antarctic endemics account for about 40 % of all freshwater and brackish taxa, while the biogeographic distribution of about 26 % is unknown, mainly due to their uncertain taxonomic identity. This contradicts the view that cosmopolitanism prevails in Antarctic diatoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{character}} of the ion dynamics in crystalline cryolite, Na(3) AlF(6), a model double perovskite-structured mineral, has been examined in computer simulations using a polarizable ionic potential obtained by <b>force-fitting</b> to ab initio electronic structure calculations. NMR studies, and conductivity measurements, have indicated {{a high degree of}} mobility, in both Na(+) ion diffusion and reorientation of the AlF(6) octahedral units. The simulations reproduce the low-temperature (tilted) crystal structure and the existence of a transition to a cubic structure at elevated temperatures, in agreement with diffraction measurements, though the calculated transition temperature is too low. The reorientational dynamics of the AlF(6) octahedra is shown to consist of a hopping motion between the various tilted positions of the low-temperature form, even above the transition temperature. The rate of reorientation estimated by extrapolation to the temperature régime of the NMR measurements is consistent with the experimental data. In addition, we report a novel cooperative "tilt-swapping" motion of the differently tilted sublattices, just below the transition temperature. The perfect crystals show no Na(+) diffusion, in apparent disagreement with observation. We argue, following previous analyses of the cryolite phase diagram, that the diffusion observed in the experimental studies is a consequence of defects that are intrinsic to the thermodynamically stable form of cryolite. By introducing defects into the simulation cell, we obtain diffusion rates that are consistent with the NMR and conductivity measurements. Finally, we demonstrate a link between diffusion of the Na(+) ions and the reorientation of AlF(6) units, though the correlation between the two is not very strong...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we develop a method to {{estimate}} the spatially averaged rainfall intensity together with associated level of uncertainty using geostatistical upscaling. Rainfall data collected from a cluster of eight paired rain gauges in a 400  m [*]×[*]  200  m urban catchment are used in combination with spatial stochastic simulation to obtain optimal predictions of the spatially averaged rainfall intensity {{at any point in}} time within the urban catchment. The uncertainty in the prediction of catchment average rainfall intensity is obtained for multiple combinations of intensity ranges and temporal averaging intervals. The two main challenges addressed in this study are scarcity of rainfall measurement locations and non-normality of rainfall data, both of which need to be considered when adopting a geostatistical approach. Scarcity of measurement points is dealt with by pooling sample variograms of repeated rainfall measurements with similar characteristics. Normality of rainfall data is achieved through the use of normal score transformation. Geostatistical models in the form of variograms are derived for transformed rainfall intensity. Next spatial stochastic simulation which is robust to nonlinear data transformation is applied to produce realisations of rainfall fields. These realisations in transformed space are first back-transformed and next spatially aggregated to derive a random sample of the spatially averaged rainfall intensity. Results show that the prediction uncertainty comes mainly from two sources: spatial variability of rainfall and measurement error. At smaller temporal averaging intervals both these effects are high, resulting in a relatively high uncertainty in prediction. With longer temporal averaging intervals the uncertainty becomes lower due to stronger spatial correlation of rainfall data and relatively smaller measurement error. Results also show that the measurement error increases with decreasing rainfall intensity resulting in a higher uncertainty at lower intensities. Results from this study can be used for uncertainty analyses of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling of similar-sized urban catchments as it provides information on uncertainty associated with rainfall estimation, which is arguably the most important input in these models. This will help to better interpret model results and avoid false calibration and <b>force-fitting</b> of model parameters...|$|E

40|$|Diatoms {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} algal groups in polar ecosystems, both in number of specimens as in number of species. Their characteristic silica outer shell (the valve) and the significant responses to changes in their physical and chemical environment, make them excellent bio-indicators used in applied environmental, biogeographical and paleo-ecological studies. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the species composition of High Arctic diatom communities and their ecological preferences are only poorly known, mainly due to historic <b>force-fitting</b> and incorrect identifications of the composing species. The diatom flora of Svalbard in particular is only scarcely studied and most studies published so far are only quite summary. The present study attempts to contribute to our knowledge concerning the diversity and ecology of freshwater diatoms in the Petuniabukta region (Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago). Samples of both epilithon and epiphyton of 40 lakes and pools were taken during the polar summer of 2013 and several physico-chemical lake characteristics (pH, conductivity and water temperature) were measured. The diatom communities were studied using light microscopy and, when appropriate, scanning elecktron microscopy. A total of 315 taxa belonging to 58 genera were observed. Of these, 239 taxa were identified up to the species, subspecies, variety or forma level. The identity of the other 76 taxa is uncertain or only known up to the genus level. At least 10 of the unidentified taxa can with certainty be considered new to science. A new Gomphonema species, Gomphonema svalbardense, has recently been described and several other taxa are currently being described which confirms that the diatom flora of Spitsbergen is not well known and many taxa remain to be discovered and described. Cluster analysis and ordination allowed separating the observed diatom communities in four different assemblages. Characterisation of these assemblages based on the measured physico-chemical features proved to be impossible indicating the probable importance of other environmental factors than measured in determining the diatom communities in the study area. Using literature data, it was possible to link the diatom assemblages with differences in environmental characteristics, e. g. presence of streams or currents, vegetation, glacial influence and sea spray...|$|E
40|$|Diatoms {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} algal groups in polar ecosystems, both in number of specimens as in number of species. Their characteristic silica valve and the significant responses to changes in their physical and chemical environment, make them excellent bio-indicators used in applied environmental and paleoecological studies. Despite this, the species composition and ecological preferences of High Arctic diatom communities are poorly known, mainly due to historic <b>force-fitting</b> and incorrect species identifications. The diatom flora of Svalbard in particular is little studied and most studies published so far are very concise. Here we studied the freshwater littoral diatom flora of Petuniabukta (Spitsbergen) on a spatial and temporal scale in order to reduce the taxonomic and ecological uncertainty when applying diatoms as (paleo) environmental indicators in the Arctic. For the spatial scale, the diatom flora of 53 freshwater lakes was analysed using light and scanning electron microscopy. More than 300 taxa belonging to 59 genera have been found, of which one third could not be identified below genus level. Two new species, Gomphonema svalbardense and Achnanthidium petuniabuktianum, have recently been described as new to science and several other taxa are in need of a formal description. Cluster and ordination analyses allowed separating the diatom communities in four main assemblages which were explained by differences in environmental characteristics, such as the presence of streams, mosses and glaciers. For the temporal scale, the diatom succession in a ~ 6000 year old sediment core from Garmaksla Lake was studied. Changes in the relative abundances of the two dominating taxa, Staurosira venter and Amphora affinis, suggest subsequent periods of warming and cooling. Unprecedented changes in the top layers of the core are attributed to climate warming as result of the end of the Little Ice Age, ~ 100 – 150 years ago, and, more recently, human induced environmental changes. In conclusion, the high number of unidentified taxa in this study indicates that a profound revision of the Arctic diatom flora is highly desired, not only to improve our fundamental knowledge concerning the diversity, ecology and biogeography of Arctic diatoms, but also to advance applied (paleo) ecological studies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explicates how an {{international}} literacy testing (ILT) initiative, {{overseen by the}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is put to use to coordinate teaching and learning in adult literacy education programs in Canada, and in Ontario in particular. The testing initiative was conceived to manage and monitor global literacy resources, and promote their development for economic productivity and competitive advantage. Guided by institutional ethnography, the analysis reveals how certain operational and support devices of the testing initiative have been transposed into the context of adult education and training, carrying with them the ideological concerns of the economistic testing project {{and some of its}} methodological procedures. Various devices and technologies of the ILT are reformulated as individual assessments for adult learners, and are also incorporated— as is and with extensions— into a national occupational skills framework, a provincial curriculum reform, and a series of policy persuasion projects. Educators, program coordinators and curriculum developers, concerned with the development of literacy that is responsive to learners and their aspirations, recognize the limitations of the curricular frameworks and assessments. They devote inordinate amounts of time and effort reformulating, translating, <b>force-fitting,</b> and supplementing them. At the same time, a narrowly conceived locating information pedagogy—distinct from both academic literacy needed to access formal education systems and a responsive and situated literacy needed to actively participate in social practices—is developed and widely promoted. Policy entrepreneurs have incorporated the devices into their policy persuasion projects, including a project that profiles adults according to their literacy proficiency, their value in the labour market {{and whether or not they}} are ‘economically efficient’ to educate. Persuasion tactics are aimed at policy-makers and adult educators in order to convince them to shift educational support away from those who already experience limited access to educational opportunities (adults with secondary education or less) to those closest to reaching what is deemed to be an acceptable literacy level (adults with post-secondary education). Attempts to limit and privilege the purpose of adult education and training, in combination with the development of curricula and assessments that do the same, obstruct and contradict efforts to support equitable literacy learning opportunities for Canadian adults...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis research is to develop an adhesive bonding solution in order to remove the classic welding technology exploited nowadays in the automotive steel wheel system. The examined solution is an hybrid joint, based on adhesive boding combined {{with the presence of}} an interference fit. This hybrid joining technology consists in coupling two cylindrical components together by <b>force-fitting</b> one into the other after having placed an adhesive on the mating surfaces. This technique would allow the joining of dissimilar material to enable the design of hybrid lightweight wheels. Moreover, it would provide a better stress distribution in the joint area that could induce fatigue life improvement. The contributions of the adhesive and the interference on the performance of the final hybrid joint is still not completely clear. In particular, the effect of the adhesive nature and of its mechanical and adhesive responses on the performance of the hybrid joint is under concern in this research. A study of the phenomena acting at the interference level is conducted at the laboratory level before industrial case application. An experimental method is set up in order to test the adhesives in a press fit joint. Static and dynamic tests are carried out examining the behavior of different adhesives, including rigid epoxies and flexible polyurethanes, and fractographic analysis are then performed. The second part of the study is focused on the feasibility of the hybrid technology on the wheel system. Exploiting the outcomes of the laboratory analysis, bonded wheel prototypes are assembled and tested statically and dynamically, according to component validation in MW. From the laboratory scale analyses it is found that the adhesive type mainly affects the static resistance of the hybrid joint. In particular the curing technology affects the decoupling behavior and the rheology influences the quantity of adhesive that remains inside the joint despites the interference levels. On the other hand, the interference rules the stiffness of the assembly and strongly affects the fatigue behavior of the cylindrical joint. The study conducted on the wheel component confirms the laboratory scale outcomes. For what concern the feasibility study, the bonded wheel shows similar performances compared to the welded wheel without design modifications of the components. However, the joint geometry has to be redesigned to exploit all the advantages of the adhesive bondin...|$|E
40|$|Interaction {{potentials}} for the double-perovskite cryolite, Na 3 AlF 6, {{have been}} developed for use in classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using a method whereby ionic configurations are generated with empirical pair potentials, the multipoles and forces on the ions and the stress tensor of the cell are extracted from ab initio single-point DFT calculations, and then the multipoles, forces and stresses from the MD simulations are ‘fit’ to the ab initio quantities in a series of steps in which the potential parameters are optimized, for models of varying complexity. Previously, interaction potentials {{have been developed}} empirically by tuning the parameters to reproduce experimentally-derived properties such as structure factors and densities, and so the testing and development of the newer method is necessary in order to standardize a way of obtaining potentials from first principle considerations. A fitted potential was then used to characterize the ion dynamics in crystalline cryolite: a monoclinic to orthorhombic phase transition and the low-temperature-phase tilt-domain structure of the AlF 3 − 6, the dominant structural features, are reproduced. The motional processes, which have been studied indirectly in NMR, conductivity and diffraction experiments, include oscillation of the AlF 3 − 6 and sodium ion diffusion - {{it has been suggested that}} these occur at a remarkably fast rate. The nature of the AlF 3 − 6 oscillatory motion is studied in more depth than accessible to experiment, and its connection with diffusion is investigated. Given the intrinsically defective nature of cryolite and the absence of diffusion in the initial simulations, defects are introduced to observe their effect on the dynamics: they are shown to be necessary for diffusion. This work has been written up in an article accepted for publication in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. The ab initio potentials developed as above involve representing a system with formally charged monatomic ions. We extended the scope of the method significantly with technical developments to allow for the inclusion of molecular ions, such as the hydroxide ion, the sulphate ion or the uranyl ion, where the intraionic bonding has significant covalent character. The appropriate modifications of the MD code were made and a modified <b>force-fitting</b> procedure was developed. The new method was applied to Mg(OH) 2 which is an important mineral (brucite) and to the melts of uranyl chloride which are of interest in nuclear waste reprocessing. Although we found good potentials were harder to obtain for these compounds, we found this arose from their layered structure rather than the molecular nature of the ions, and that our method could achieve a level of success approaching that used in the cryolite work on further iterations of the fitting process...|$|E
