5|$|To promote The Unraveling, Rise Against toured {{extensively}} throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski {{left the}} band due to personal differences with McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because of <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as lead guitarist, and Kevin White was eventually {{hired as a}} replacement. A few months later, White left the band, and Todd Mohney was recruited as the new lead guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E

At this time, Acharya was still unable to decide whether he wished to move to somewhere in Asia or to Europe, finally deciding to head for Colombo, a city he had visited earlier. His savings was a sum of three hundred Rupees, which allowed him money for travel but not any luggage.|$|E

25|$|Pueri delicati {{might be}} {{idealized}} in poetry. In the erotic elegies of Tibullus, the delicatus Marathus wears lavish and expensive clothing. The {{beauty of the}} delicatus was measured by Apollonian standards, especially in regard to <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> {{which was supposed to}} be wavy, fair, and scented with perfume. The mythological type of the delicatus was represented by Ganymede, the Trojan youth abducted by Jove (Greek Zeus) to be his divine companion and cupbearer. In the Satyricon, the tastelessly wealthy freedman Trimalchio says that as a child-slave he had been a puer delicatus servicing both the master and the mistress of the household.|$|E

He is continuously losing his powers as an entire generation was delayed when Oran became incapable of marrying him. The king abducts Charon, who realized his plan to acquire a new body, and changes him into a form of a nine-tailed fox. He then holds a hunting competition for catching Charon in his fox form, then soon loses conscience as he has not married and reincarnated for too long.|$|E

25|$|Back in Venice, Casanova {{started his}} {{clerical}} law career and was admitted as an abbé after being conferred minor orders by the Patriarch of Venice. He shuttled {{back and forth}} to Padua to continue his university studies. By now, he had become something of a dandy—tall and dark, <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> powdered, scented, and elaborately curled. He quickly ingratiated himself with a patron (something he was to do all his life), 76-year-old Venetian senator Alvise Gasparo Malipiero, the owner of Palazzo Malipiero, close to Casanova's home in Venice. Malipiero moved in the best circles and taught young Casanova a great deal about good food and wine, and how to behave in society. However, Casanova was caught dallying with Malipiero's intended object of seduction, actress Teresa Imer, and the senator drove both of them from his house. Casanova's growing curiosity about women led to his first complete sexual experience, with two sisters, Nanetta and Marton Savorgnan, then fourteen and sixteen, who were distant relatives of the Grimanis. Casanova proclaimed that his life avocation was firmly established by this encounter.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, {{she began}} work on Little Lord Fauntleroy with the {{serialization}} beginning in 1885 in St. Nicholas, and the publication in book form in 1886. Little Lord Fauntleroy received good reviews, became a best-seller in the United States and England, was translated into 12 languages, and secured Burnett's reputation as a writer. The story features a boy who dresses in elaborate velvet suits and wears <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> in curls. The central character, Cedric, was modeled on Burnett's younger son Vivian, and the autobiographical aspects of Little Lord Fauntleroy occasionally led to disparaging remarks from the press. After the publication of Little Lord Fauntleroy, Burnett's reputation as a writer of children's books was fully established. In 1888 she won a lawsuit in England over the dramatic rights to Little Lord Fauntleroy, establishing a precedent that was incorporated into British copyright law in 1911. In response to a second incident of pirating her material into a dramatic piece, she wrote The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy, which was produced on stage in London and on Broadway. The play went on to make her {{as much money as}} the book.|$|E

500|$|The police {{suspected}} Kanae {{of socialist}} sympathies {{as he had}} brought the idea from Russia.

[...] After five years the venture went bankrupt.|$|E
500|$|Miles is characterised {{as being}} charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and {{crumpled}} shirts, with <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair,</b> this {{gives him a}} trademark [...] "beachy" [...] look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character trait created by Quong Tart. Some viewers have written to Home and Away to complain about Miles' eating habits.|$|E
500|$|Further {{evidence}} for a 14-16 hand (...) war horse {{is that it was}} a matter of pride to a knight to be able to vault onto his horse in full armour, without touching the stirrup. This arose not from vanity, but necessity: if unhorsed during battle, a knight would remain vulnerable if unable to mount by himself. [...] In reality, of course, a wounded or weary knight might find it difficult, and rely on a vigilant squire to assist him. [...] Incidentally, a knight's armour served in his favour in any fall. With <b>his</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> twisted on his head to form a springy padding under his padded-linen hood, and his helm placed on top, he had head protection not dissimilar to a modern bicycle or equestrian helmet.|$|E
