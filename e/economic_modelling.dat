2500|$|The {{presence}} of natural resource flows in Georgescu's model of production (production function) differentiates the model {{from those of}} both Keynesian macroeconomics, neoclassical economics, as well as classical economics, including most — though not all — variants of Marxism.

2500|$|As {{he brought}} natural {{resource}} flows into <b>economic</b> <b>modelling</b> and analysis, Georgescu-Roegen's work was seminal in establishing ecological economics {{as an independent}} academic subdiscipline in economics in the 1980s. [...] In addition, the degrowth movement that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s recognises Georgescu-Roegen as the main intellectual figure influencing the movement. [...] Taken together, by the 2010s Georgescu-Roegen has educated, influenced and inspired at least three generations of people, including his contemporary economists, younger ecological economists, still younger degrowth organisers and activists, and others throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{findings}} of low–dimensional nonlinearities and the Theorem of Takens (1983) forecasting models of financial time series are often built upon nonparametric, i. e. universal nonlinear, univariate relationships. Empirical investigations, however, are seriously contaminated by {{the problem of}} overfitting. Since statistical model selection theory in the nonlinear case {{is still in its}} infancy we would like to suggest the application of <b>economic</b> <b>model</b> selection criteria. It is a method of combining the flexibility of nonparametric regressions and important structural information in dynamic <b>economic</b> <b>models.</b> Therefore, conditions of <b>economic</b> <b>models</b> are imposed on the embedded nonlinear dynamical system to be estimated nonparametrically. In our empirical investigations we apply an univariate nonparametric forecasting model of stock returns, implemented via the Local Linear Maps of Ritter (1991), by an <b>economic</b> <b>model</b> selection criterion based on a discretized form of a continuous–time dynamic model on the interaction of real activity and asset markets. The dynamic <b>economic</b> <b>model</b> is estimated based on the Maximum Entropy inference since unobservable variables are involved. Results for monthly U. S. data show that nonparametric model selection is improved by this <b>economic</b> <b>model</b> selection criterion. On the other hand this result may be interpreted as support for the <b>economic</b> <b>model.</b> model selection, dynamic model, interaction, nonparametric, stock market, prediction...|$|R
