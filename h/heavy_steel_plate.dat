40|$|Abstract: The {{manufacturing}} process of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> generates some internal residual stresses. During machining {{process at the}} end users, shape defects may be created by these residual stresses. An industrial characterization method of residual stress state in <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with a thickness of several hundreds of millimetres is described here. The measurement principle by acoustical birefringence and the used experimental equipment are presented. The first tests were performed on standard plates representative of the various possible residual stress states. The analysis of ultrasonic signals allowed {{the definition of the}} most suitable measurement configuration and the attainment of satisfactory accuracy. Assessments of the acoustical birefringence coefficient across plate width permits to estimate residual stress profile of these plates and to identify heavy plates where the geometric stability during the machining process will be insufficient. The method is then validated on the heavy industrial plates at different manufacturing steps.

40|$|Abstract. The Effect of intercritical quencing on {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} properties of ultra low carbon <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> were studied by utilizing SEM, TEM, tensile and impact tests. The specimens were firstly subjected to an annealing treatment at 930 o C followed by quenching to ambient temperature, then were repeatedly annealing at the temperatures being varied {{in the range}} of 600 ~ 870 o C, and then repeatedly quenched to ambient temperature in cold water. When the intercritical quenching was just slightly above Ac 1, the strength and low temperature toughness were remarkably deteriorated attributing to the massive grain and some twins in the bainite islands. However, the more when the annealing temperature increased higher than Ac 1 but still below Ac 3, the more regions can be austenized, which cause the average of carbon content in the austenized regions to be relatively low. So it was difficult that these austenite regions changed into twin martensites after interctitical quenched. Then the comprehensive properties including low temperature toughness became good again...|$|E

40|$|SSAB Oxelösund is {{a member}} of the SSAB Svenskt Stål AB Group and is the biggest Nordic {{manufacturer}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate.</b> SSAB Oxelösund’s main products are the hardened wear plate HARDOX and the high strength structural plate WELDOX. The most common processes that are used to cut the steel are the thermal processes oxyfuel, laser and plasma as well as the non-thermal process abrasive water jet. Cutting HARDOX using one of the thermal processes can result in edge cracking. In addition, if a thermal process is used to cut small parts, the hardness of the steel is affected. Therefore, SSAB wishes to have a computer based calculation application that would provide guidance regarding how to best cut SSAB’s different steels, in particular HARDOX. It was found that the main features that users wanted in this application were to be able calculate the cost of a cutting job, to be able to compare the costs of oxyfuel cutting with and without preheating and to see when abrasive water jet cutting is a viable option. It was also found that it is possible to calculate the costs involved in the different cutting processes quite accurately. However, to calculate the costs involved in preheating before cutting with oxyfuel it is recommended to develop a more complex calculation model. The recommendation is for SSAB to continue developing an application to help its customers calculate their cutting costs. It is also to use the application to influence customers to use cutting methods and cutting speeds that does not produce edge cracking. This would benefit both SSAB and its customers as it makes SSAB seem knowledgeable about the problems that the customers face and also help the customers to be more productive.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{accelerated}} cooling of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> is an already standard process {{that increases the}} competitiveness of this product and their users, as it allows {{the adoption of a}} leaner alloy design and the development of new mechanical property combinations with improved weldability. The maximum cooling rate achievable under industrial conditions depends on plate thickness, from 80 °C/s � 10 mm � to about 1 °C/s � 80 mm�, in order to assure minimum temperature gradients along plate thickness and greater uniformity of mechanical properties. The main process variants of this process apply cooling over different temperature ranges: interrupted {{accelerated cooling}}, between 800 and 500 °C, and direct quenching, between 900 and 200 °C. In the first case it is aimed at a microstructural grain refining effect; in the latter one a fully martensitic microstructure is desired.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to an {{optimization}} approach to a problem of statistical modeling of mechanical properties of <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> during a real industrial manufacturing process. The approach enables the manufacturer to attain {{a specific set of}} the final product properties by optimizing the alloying composition within the grade specifications. Because this composition has to stay in the agreement with earlier indicated specifications, it leads to the large system of linear constraints, and the problem itself can be expressed in the form of linear programming (LP) task. It turns out however, that certain of the constraints contain the coefficients which have to be estimated on the base of the data gathered in the production process and as such they are uncertain. Consequently, the initial optimization task should be modeled as so-called Chance Constrained Programming problem (CCP), which is a special class within the stochastic programming problems. The paper presents mathematical models of the optimization problem that result from both approaches and indicates differences which are important for the decision makers in the production practice.

Traditionally, the repair and strengthening of concrete and steel structures have been via <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> mechanically connected to the structure. However, these repair techniques are usually cumbersome, requiring closing the facility for prolonged periods of time with a subsequent loss of production time, which can be costly. In the last 15 years, or so, {{with the advent of}} fibre reinforced plastics (FRPs), new strengthening approaches have come to the fore using external bonding technologies. This approach has shown significant advantages compared to traditional methods, mainly due to the outstanding mechanical properties of the composite materials, their light weight and the simple application to structural members. The use of lightweight fibre reinforced plastics and, in particular, CFRP as an alternative to <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> have been investigated for repair and strengthening applications. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic repair techniques consist of gluing thin strips of CFRP plates or fabric to concrete members to add strength in flexure and/or shear. The lightweight nature of CFRP means easier and speedier repairs are possible with the advantage that the plant can remain in operation during the repair.

Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the flange plate when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the flange plate to a 10 mm depth. This phenomenon shows the advantage of using a T-joint for brittle crack arrest in the flange plates of strength deck structures...|$|R
40|$|Crack {{arrest of}} fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. Crack arrest design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore crack arrest design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and brittle crack propagation in <b>heavy</b> thick shipbuilding <b>steels</b> have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the crack arrest of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The toughness requirement of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For brittle crack arrest, an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale crack arrest tests were carried out in order to investigate the long crack arrestability of heavy-thick shipbuilding <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy toughness requirement for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A brittle crack ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the test weld. A brittle crack in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure arrestability even in the base plate, in case of <b>heavy</b> thick shipbuilding <b>steel.</b> Two crack arrest tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long crack arrest using high arrestability steels. The test results indicated that the crack arrest concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest toughness materials and a special fabrication method which can derive a brittle crack into the base plate of high arrestability plate. The crack arrest design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using <b>heavy</b> thick <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a <b>heavy</b> thick <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> as investigated in this paper.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of area in the through thickness direction is an essential mechanical property of thick <b>steel</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>plates.</b> By a routine control, a very small through thickness {{reduction of}} area was found for tensile specimen of a 90 mm plate. Careful investigations of the fracture and section of specimens cut from the as solidified continuously cast 250 mmthick slab showed that the cause was the presence of coarse particles of niobium carbonitride as constituent of the quasi eutectic Fe-Nb(C, N) that form because of the centerline segregation of niobium...|$|R
