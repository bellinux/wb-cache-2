40|$|BACKGROUND: Assessing the {{retentive}} {{capabilities of}} a new titanium root post (Optipost, Komet-Gebr. Brasseler, GmbH and Co. KG Lemgo, Germany) with a decreasing diameter shape (turret like) and how these can be improved by the choice of fixing cement. METHODS: The tensile strength was assessed {{in relation to the}} type of cement used. The following cements were tested: Compolute composite cement (Espe), C/B Crown & Bridge Luting Composite (Bisco), <b>Diamond</b> <b>Link</b> cement (DRM) with Harvard cement as a control. The cementing procedures laid down by the manufacturers were followed in the case of each cement. The results of the traction tests were analysed and compared statistically and a SEM evaluation of the root/cement and cement/post interface was carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that the highest absolute mean value (best performance) was <b>Diamond</b> <b>Link</b> cement (46. 48 +/- 14. 31 kg) which also came out best in the statistical analysis (Scheffe Test p= 0. 007). Analysis of the samples at the SEM confirmed the results of the traction tests. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic > form of the Optipost root post and the sanding of the surface would appear to be important factors which, together with the adhesive cementing technique, lead to a high decementing resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the marginal microleakage in Class II with different materials in resin composite restorations cured by using "soft start" and standard polymerization techniques. Two adhesive Class II cavities were prepared in 50 human teeth with enamel in-between. Samples were divided into 5 groups and filled with composite resins, compatible flow resin composites and bonding systems. The ocluso-mesial restorations were cured with standard curing technique, and the ocluso-distal restorations were cured with "soft start" curing technique. After thermocycling, the teeth were immersed in silver nitrate solution and sectioned for leakage evaluation. The results pointed out, after "soft start" and standard curing techniques, that the best marginal behavior in Class II restorations was obtained with Tetric Ceram / Tetric Flow composite resins, then with Filtek Z 250 / Filtek Flow, followed by Admira Admira Flow and Point / Revolution composite materials. The deepest dye penetration was found in cavities with Diamond Lite / <b>Diamond</b> <b>Link</b> composite restorations. No statistically significant difference was found in the tested composite resin restorations, whether treated with "soft start" polymerization or with standard polymerization technique, in regard to marginal micro leakage...|$|E

In countries rich in lootable resources, the ability of rulers to achieve political order depends on (1) the availability of nonlootable resources; (2) the mode of extraction of lootable resources, especially whether they are extracted by hard-to-tax artisans or, alternatively, by large, taxable industrial firms; and (3) patterns of state spending. This framework supplements widely used models of civil war that emphasize the state’s capacity to defeat an insurgency yet do not answer the important prior question of why state capacity varies so widely across resource-rich countries...|$|R
