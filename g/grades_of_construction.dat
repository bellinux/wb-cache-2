In the Sultanate of Oman, construction companies are facing great challenges due to many obstacles. This study aims to find out important factors that regarded as obstacles faced by the construction companies in Oman and also this paper highlights important problems exist in the various <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> companies. A quantitative method was used in this study. This paper highlights obstacles to the five grades of companies. Chi-square test was used to presents the significance of obstacles, the result has been analyzed. The findings were the fourth grade facing more obstacles than other grades construction companies. In order to survive market competition, these companies must find solutions to these constraints...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: South Africa’s {{construction}} industry {{plays a key}} role in the development of the economy, not least through creating jobs and wealth. However, currently the distribution of economic benefits being enjoyed by construction companies is highly skewed, with a very small number of large firms being awarded a big stake of public-sector tender awards. It is against this background that government departments and institutions, including the Coega Development Corporation, have developed and implemented SMME-development programmes. They recognise the development of emerging contractors as an engine to alleviate unemployment and poverty in our country, especially among the youth. It can also be seen as a tool to spread the wealth <b>of</b> the <b>construction</b> industry more widely. These efforts resulted in a sharp influx of emerging contractors on the entry-level <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Construction</b> Industry Development Board’s database. The study analyses the current situation of SMMEs in the {{construction industry}} and the challenges hindering their growth and development. Although the study focuses on the Coega Development Corporation’s SMME-Development Programme as implemented by the CDC’s Small Business Unit, the lessons from the sample survey and programme analysis are meant to have broader relevance. This relates in particular to the need to encourage and help dynamic and well-managed SMMEs to advance faster on the road towards highergrade contracts. It also stresses the need to get closer co-operation between the different players in efforts to support small-construction entrepreneurs...|$|R

This study aims to identify the critical risk factors of PPP projects in Pahang and to examine the preferred risk allocations for PPP projects in Pahang. Data were collected by using a set of survey questionnaire among the contractors (one representative) in each company in <b>Grade</b> 7 <b>of</b> <b>Construction</b> Industry Development Board (CIDB) in Pahang.

The relationships were derived by multivariate regression analysis of data sets of a sample of 450 spruce beams. Since the minimum beam length for bending tests according to EN 408 is given by 19 h, all beams were shortened. During these trials, a dependency of impulse velocity of the beam's length was observed. Limiting values for strength classes were determined by comparing the predicted MOR and MOE to the measured values...|$|R
