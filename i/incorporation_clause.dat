40|$|The problem {{dealing with}} the {{inclusion}} of standard terms and conditions in contracts {{is a problem that}} has engaged most legal systems. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Vienna 1980 (CISG) does not expressly deal with this problem. Accordingly the solution to the issue must be found in an interpretation and application of the general principles found in articles 8, 14 and 18. One of the main objects of the CISG is the harmonisation of international trade law. It is generally recognised that in order to achieve harmonisation it is necessary that courts should interpret and apply the convention in a consistent and harmonious manner. Unfortunately a number of approaches have emerged from courts around the world in regard to the inclusion of standard terms. German courts have developed a strict approach which requires that the standard terms be made available to the addressee {{at the time of the}} conclusion of the contract. They also require that the standard terms be couched in the language of the main contract. In stark contrast an American court has used an approach which is very lax in regard to incorporation, even allowing incorporation after the conclusion of the contract. There is, however a more moderate approach set out in decisions of the Austrian Supreme Court where the court adopted an approach which is more akin to that found in most legal systems, namely that a clear <b>incorporation</b> <b>clause</b> in the contract is sufficient for the effective incorporation of standard terms. The author critically examines the case law, the various approaches and the underlying arguments on which they are based, before reaching the conclusion that the two extreme approaches should be rejected in favour of the more moderate approach. This approach is founded on a proper interpretation of the provisions of the CISG as well as being in step with international trade practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract When a ship {{is fixed}} on a voyage charter or time charter, the {{charterer}} may use tonnage {{which has been}} chartered to him to transport goods owned by third-party cargo owners. This thesis will discuss this situation: the charterer entered into the contract of carriage of goods by sea with sender, {{but it is the}} ship-owner who actually performs the carriage of goods as actual carrier. If the cargo is damaged or lost, whether the ship-owner shall be liable to the third party? If it is the case, on what legal basis third-party cargo owners can claim against ship-owners? What is the nature of ship-owner s liability to the third party? How does such ship-owner s liability system apply to business practice? All these questions will be analyzed in this paper. Firstly, I will present the legal relationship between parties involved in the carriage where the charterer uses the chartered vessel to carry third party cargo owner goods. It is known that the ship-owner has no contractual obligations to cargo owners, as the ship-owner is not the contracting party to the head contract of carriage of goods by sea. However Section 286 of NMC imposes statutory liability on ship-owners and Section 285 and 287 of NMC cause ship-owner and charterer jointly and severally liable to third-party cargo claimants. Such mandatory liability system aims to strengthen the economic position of cargo interests, but ship-owners and charterers are still free to insert clauses to allocate risks between them as long as such the clauses do not derogate from mandatory provisions. This paper will discuss two common clauses regarding ship-owner s liability, that is, demise clause and <b>incorporation</b> <b>clause.</b> I will analyze whether these clauses are caught by obligatory provisions and if they are not, how those clauses apply in practical business. Finally I will discuss indemnification claims between ship-owner and charterer. When the ship-owner is found liable under a bill of lading, and if such claim under the charter party would have allowed him to avoid of at least limit liability, the ship-owner has rights to seek indemnity from charterer according to Section 338 of NMC. However Section 338 does not provide cargo claimants with an absolute right to redress and certain requirements must be satisfied, that is, the greater obligations assumed by the ship-owner must result from different terms contained in the bill of lading and there must be contractual basis for indemnity in the charter party. All these issues mentioned above will be discussed mainly under Norwegian maritime law, but some comparison will be made between Norwegian maritime law and Chinese maritime law. Besides that, I will also take relevant international conventions into consideration including the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules...|$|E

Two analysis are considered in this paper for understanding this construction within HPSG. The first, lexical sharing (Kim and Sells, this volume), views the verbs that include incorporated nouns as being single words corresponding to two syntactic atoms. However, this analysis makes incorrect predictions on the transitivity of <b>incorporation</b> <b>clauses.</b> A second analysis, extending Malouf (1999), views these words as verbs, but with some of the combinatorial properties of nouns. This offers both a better account of the data, and preserves the more restrictive theory of the morphology-syntax interface. ...|$|R
40|$|English {{courts have}} held that clear words of {{incorporation}} of the arbitration clause (contained in the charterparty) are indispensable {{in the bill of}} lading, to bind consignees who had never witnessed the charterparty. This approach is for the protection of consignees as third parties. In this article, attention will be paid to the identification of problems relating to the form that a charterparty should have to be appropriate for incorporation. Whether charterparties can be superseded by other types of documents will also be examined. Last but not least, the author will critically assess the rules of construction followed in recent cases where ambiguous language has been used in <b>incorporation</b> <b>clauses</b> in bills of lading. In the last few months, three judgments have been issued which have produced highly controversial outcomes. The author asserts that the method of construction should not be considered as a distinct method from that of <b>incorporation</b> of <b>clauses.</b> Times have changed and, apparently, so has business common sense. However, ‘uncertain certainty’ has been caused because business common sense has been applied differently to judgments that have been issued with a couple of months difference...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} said about the {{unfairness}} of binding bill of lading holders with the charterparty contracts, the copies of which are rarely provided together with the bills of lading. Besides, many people felt strongly that importing the provisions of an unseen contract creates a more risky international trade environment. Yet, it is an undeniable fact that <b>incorporation</b> <b>clauses</b> can make the holders subject to the charterparty provisions, even though the copies of these contracts are not shown to them. Nonetheless, since the early years, the issue of whether the charterparty terms are actually imported into a bill of lading has given rise to a great amount of litigation between the carriers and the holders. After a long line of judicial decisions given in this vein, {{it is now clear that}} for the charterparty clauses to be incorporated, both the bill of lading and the charterparty need to overcome a set of hurdles, which are popularly known as “the rules of incorporation”. It is equally clear that while these rules establish the formulas to incorporate, they also cause numerous discussions about their workability and longevity in the ever-changing shipping and international trade practice. In the meantime, the rules raise the questions of to what extent the holders are protected against the potential pitfalls arising from the <b>incorporation</b> <b>clauses,</b> and whether the solutions to the problems are adequate in terms of giving commercial efficacy to these clauses. In particular, the overall impact of the rules of incorporation forces all the concerned parties to ask one question: Is the glass half full or half empty? With a view to bringing these issues to light, this thesis thoroughly examines and compares the respective rules of incorporation adopted in English and U. S. law, which offer strikingly different methods to tackle the question of incorporation. In order to illustrate the impacts of the <b>incorporation</b> <b>clauses</b> on the contractual position of the bill of lading holders, the thesis looks at the incorporation of the particular charterparty clauses which have mostly given rise to disputes between the parties, such as forum selection, demurrage, fiost and similar clauses. Notably, the thesis discusses the viability of the incorporation rules in the wake of the new international movements concerning the unification of the laws governing the bills of lading. Finally, this study, inter alia, concludes that the trend is more receptive to the carriers’ imposition of monetary liabilities through the incorporation of charterparty terms than the enforcement of charterparty forum selection clauses.

50|$|Incorporation of the Anti-Establishment Clause in 1947 {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} in several ways and subject to critique. The controversy surrounding Establishment <b>Clause</b> <b>incorporation</b> primarily {{stems from the fact}} that one of the intentions of the Establishment Clause was to prevent Congress from interfering with state establishments of religion that existed at the time of the founding (at least six states had established religions at the founding) - a fact conceded by even those members of the Court who believe the Establishment Clause was made applicable to the states through incorporation. Critics have also argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is understood to incorporate only individual rights found in the Bill of Rights; the Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause (which critics readily concede protects individual rights), does not purport to protect individual rights.|$|R

They also undermine the Clause’s vigorous application against the states and place the Court’s anti-establishment decisions under a cloud of illegitimacy. This Essay sets forth logical, textual, and historical justifications for Establishment <b>Clause</b> <b>incorporation</b> based on the original eighteenth-century understanding of the Clause as a purely structural limitation on federal power. The Establishment Clause did not reserve state power, but disabled congressional action. As an express disability on Congress, the Clause generated two immunities, one held by the states against congressional interference with state decisions about religious establishment or disestablishment, and one held by the people against congressional establishment of a national religion. As part of Reconstruction’s imposition of new federal limits on state power, the Fourteenth Amendment extinguished the state immunity from federal interference, but extended the personal immunity to protect the people against state as well as federally established religions. This is logically coherent in the context of Reconstruction’s goals and also sounds in the personal liberty and citizen immunities protected by the text of the Fourteenth Amendment. When framed by a logical and textual account of Establishment <b>Clause</b> <b>incorporation,</b> Reconstruction history suggests an originalist account that the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Establishment Clause to the states. Incorporation of the Establishment Clause, therefore, is eminently defensible. Its justifications require more careful consideration by courts and commentators than they have yet received...|$|R

40|$|Back to back can {{be defined}} as a rule of {{construction}} by which in appropriate circumstances the wording of the reinsurance agreement is to be construed {{in the same way as}} the wording of the underlying policy. The discussion on whether or not two contracts are back to back is always interconnected with the contract wording. That way, the most suitable way to discuss the back to back principle is to discuss firstly the full reinsurance <b>clause,</b> <b>incorporation,</b> and then back to back principle conditions, scope, and limits. Back to back overlaps incorporation. If two contracts are rendered back to back, one contract incorporates terms of other one, and the incorporated terms in the reinsurance contract will hold the same meaning as in the underlying policy. Some clauses that can have their meaning altered by back to back presumption are follow the settlements, follow the fortunes, claims control and claims cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{libraries}} {{need to have}} a solid base {{of legal}} information to permit a more precise understanding of the legal framework in which their main product –information – is situated. The industry related to scholarly, cultural and artistic creation has consistently gained in economic prominence: this has led governments to develop new rules to guarantee protection to this very important sector. The arrival of new technologies has obliged national legislators to guarantee the defence of the legitimate rights of the authors against the possibility of new products and services being based on their works. Traditionally, libraries did not have to worry much about these questions since, as non-profit organisations devoted to the promotion of reading, cultural information and research collaboration, their activities supposedly did not infringe on the normal exploitation of works protected by copyright. For the past decade, with the arrival of electronic information library personnel have been confronted by the need to negotiate licences, defend the <b>incorporation</b> of <b>clauses</b> that they consider essential, understand what they can or cannot do with the resources acquired, answer questions of users concerned by the issue of document copying, etc. This article attempts to respond to the most frequent questions that a librarian might ask about copyright.

40|$|Noun {{incorporation}} in Frisian (Dyk 1997) {{is unusual}} {{because it shows}} certain restrictions that are not seen in other languages with noun incorporation, such as Mohawk and Chukchi. In addition, while others argue that noun incorporation is indeed possible in Germanic (see Booij 2009 for Dutch, Barrie and Spreng 2009 for German), Frisian is unusual even with respect to Germanic in allowing noun <b>incorporation</b> in finite <b>clauses.</b> In this paper, I show that noun incorporation in Frisian should be analyzed as synthetic compounding, with the compound licensed by a null verbal head. It {{is the presence of}} this head that accounts for the unusual restrictions. Not only does this head explain the distribution of noun incorporation, it also explains the distribution of detransitivization. I show that there are parallels between noun incorporation and synthetic compounding in English with –ing. An important consequence of this analysis is that it allows us to treat this phenomenon in Frisian as a more typologically appropriate instance of compounding rather than as canonical noun incorporation found in polysynthetic languages...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} {{of international trade}} is specific and evolves rapidly in accordance with its needs. Today arbitration constitutes the usual way to settle disputes of international commerce. However, certain rules of arbitration {{do not seem to}} be adapted with this practice. The written form of the arbitration agreement as required by, inter alia, the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration is one of them. First this thesis presents the rules of these two instruments. Then international trade's practice is examined, and especially the <b>incorporation</b> of arbitration <b>clauses</b> by reference and the use of electronic means to conclude such clauses. There is a noteworthy discrepancy between the rules and reality of trade. Having exposed the various difficulties, this thesis examines national laws and case law in order to determine whether they offer satisfactory solutions. Different interesting answers have been brought in Civil Law as well as Common Law countries. Yet they remain local and do not allow for harmonization worldwide. They even often vary one from another and are sometimes contradictory. A more satisfactory solution could be found on the international level, and more specifically by the UNCITRAL. Indeed the Commission entrusted the Working Group II the mission of proposing a solution. A proposal of compromise has been drafted, namely, a revised article of the Model Law and an interpretative instrument of the New York Convention. This soft proposal is interesting but will perhaps not be able to settle all the problems related to the issue of the arbitration clause's form...|$|R
40|$|In its {{opinion in}} McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010), {{concerning}} {{the incorporation of}} the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court included a footnote that listed the Eighth Amendment prohibition on excessive bail {{as one of the}} incorporated Bill of Rights protections. Oddly, the Court had never incorporated the bail clause or even explained what protections it conferred. While strange, these circumstances provide a rare opportunity to reason backward from incorporation to the meaning of the incorporated provision. And by pursuing those backward implications, the paper offers novel arguments about the proper understanding of the bail clause. I contend that incorporation solves two long-standing riddles about the clause. First, does it confer a right to bail? And, second, when bail is required, are the permissible goals of bail defined by construction of the clause itself? There has long been serious doubt that the clause grants any right to bail or defines any measure of excessiveness that exists apart from legislative direction. On this view, the clause is only a directive to judicial officers to respect the separation of powers by honoring bail legislation. However, I urge that incorporation implies that the clause must accomplish much more than this it if is to impose the kind of fundamentally important limits on state government that warrant <b>incorporation.</b> The <b>clause,</b> through construction, must grant a right to bail in broad circumstances and define the measure of excessiveness. I also contend that incorporation calls for the Court to resolve two additional questions about the bail clause that it otherwise could have avoided. The issues concern the nature of the evidence that trial courts should consider in deciding bail questions and the standard that reviewing courts should apply in passing on the decisions of trial courts setting bond. On the first question, I contend that individualized consideration of the character, record and crime of an arrestee should generally inform bail decisions, which weighs against over-reliance on bail schedules. On the second question, I contend that the standard of review generally should ask whether a chosen bail amount is substantially more burdensome than required to reasonably assure the reappearance of the defendant. These conclusions balance the fundamental importance of thebail clause in safeguarding liberty and justice against several competing interests of government. Finally, I argue that incorporation calls for rethinking the justiciability of excessive-bail claims on review of criminal convictions after trial. The prevailing view apparently is that the rights to bail and non-excessiveness are purely substantive. Denial is thought not to affect the validity ofthe trial. Based on this view and the notion that the rights end at the point of conviction, few cases requiring interpretation of the clause survive for presentation to the Supreme Court. I contend, however, that the rights to bail and non-excessiveness are not only substantive but procedural, because improper pretrial detention can prejudice the defendant at trial. Honoring the procedural aspect of the protections would acknowledge the full significance of unlawful detention for arrestees and enable the Court to receive more cases through which it could construct and enforce the clause...|$|R
