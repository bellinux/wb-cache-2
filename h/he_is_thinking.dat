500|$|Drake {{says what}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> aloud, a feature {{designed}} to correlate with the likely thoughts and {{reactions of the}} player. Amy Hennig called Drake a [...] "Die Hard guy that gets in there and just {{takes care of the}} situation; 'the fly in the ointment'." [...] Drake's voice actor North was instructed to imbue his own personality into the character.|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{quest to}} become senior class {{president}} appears doomed {{and along with}} it his college prospects; he confesses to Rachel (Lea Michele) that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about stuffing the ballot box to ensure that he wins. Sue's (Jane Lynch) congressional campaign is also in trouble: to combat allegations {{that she is a}} lesbian, Sue decides to start an arbitrary relationship with a man, and chooses former bedmate Cooter Menkins (Eric Bruskotter), who has been having difficulty connecting with Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) due to her emotional armor. A distraught Beiste sings [...] "Jolene", confesses her love for Cooter and tells Sue she won't give him up without a fight. Sue loses the congressional election to Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley).|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) seeks {{advice from}} {{others in the}} office on how to start a {{relationship}} with Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt), the woman he socialized with at the Valentine's Day singles mixer at the office (from the previous episode, [...] "Blood Drive"). Andy (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynne, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and take things slow. Pam (Jenna Fischer), on the other hand, suggests he ask her out immediately and not be afraid to express himself to her. When Lynne visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b> He tells her {{that she has a}} nice smile and he would like to take her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says [...] "Nice...boobs", but Lynne seems flattered by the statement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{her all the}} morning; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of her now.|$|R
60|$|Rescued {{from death}} in the Arctic wastes, and reunited to a {{beautiful}} wife, the lieutenant looked, nevertheless, unaccountably anxious and depressed. What could <b>he</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of? <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of Clara.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{the bright}} blush that overspread her face when Hardyman first spoke to her; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of the {{invitation}} to her to see the stud-farm, and to ride the roan mare; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of the utterly powerless position in which he stood towards Isabel and towards the highly-born gentleman who admired her. But he kept his doubts and fears to himself. [...] "The train won't wait for me," [...] he said, {{and held out his}} hand once more.|$|R
500|$|The script {{described}} Gort as nanotechnology by {{the time}} the director signed on, although it did not specify Gort's appearance. The 15th draft of the script had depicted the robot as a four-legged [...] "Totem" [...] that stands upright after firing its weapon beam. Okun explained there were many more [...] "horrific" [...] or [...] "amazing" [...] concepts, but it made sense that the robot would assume a familiar human shape. He cited the Monolith from [...] as an inspiration for Gort's texture, noting [...] "it's a simple shape, it has no emotion [...] it just simply is", which makes Gort more frightening because the audience cannot tell what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b> The animators estimated the computer-generated robot as [...] tall, whereas in the original he was played by the [...] tall Lock Martin. Gort's computer model was programmed to reflect light, and the filmmakers spent time on motion-capture sessions to guide the performance. An actor wore weights on his hands and feet, allowing the animators to bring a sense of weight and power to Gort. His destructive capabilities were based on locust swarms, although the idea of metal-eating insects goes back to Stephen Vincent Benét's 1933 poem [...] "Metropolitan Nightmare".|$|E
2500|$|In the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode {{featuring}} the movie The Thing That Couldn't Die, Mike Nelson is being sent people <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of by {{a race of}} omnipotent beings {{in one of the}} [...] "host segments". The person appears and begins to beat up Mike {{in a manner similar to}} Finnegan in the classic [...] episode [...] "Shore Leave". [...] Mike thinks of Adrienne Barbeau at the insistence of one of his robot companions. [...] Barbeau is played by Mike Nelson's real-life wife Bridget Jones Nelson.|$|E
2500|$|Crash joins another team, the Asheville Tourists, {{and breaks}} the minor-league record for career home runs. We see Nuke one last time, being {{interviewed by the}} press as a major leaguer, reciting the clichéd answers that Crash had taught him earlier. Crash then retires {{as a player and}} returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she's ready to give up her annual affairs with [...] "boys". Crash tells her that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about {{becoming}} a manager for a minor-league team in Visalia. The film ends with Annie and Crash dancing in Annie's candle-lit living room.|$|E
60|$|She {{started a}} little. Strange that <b>he</b> should <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{her by her}} surname instead of her Christian name; but it mattered little as long as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> very indifferent. In fact <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of other}} things.|$|R
60|$|He {{never even}} thanked me. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> entirely of himself.|$|R
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the narration in Os Lusíadas consists of grandiloquent speeches by various orators: the main narrator; Vasco da Gama, recognized as [...] "eloquent captain" [...] ("facundo capitão"); Paulo da Gama; Thetis; and the Siren who tells the future in Canto X. The poet asks the Tágides (nymphs of the river Tagus) to give him [...] "a high and sublime sound,/ a grandiloquent and flowing style" [...] ("um som alto e sublimado, / Um estilo grandíloquo e corrente"). In contrast to the style of lyric poetry, or [...] "humble verse" [...] ("verso humilde"), <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about this exciting tone of oratory. There are in the poem some speeches that are brief but notable, including Jupiter's and the Old Man of the Restelo's.|$|E
2500|$|In , Snake Eyes is {{a member}} of G.I. Joe. He was given the name [...] "Hebi no me" [...] ("Snake Eyes") by his Arashikage clan sensei, Hard Master, because he {{possesses}} the [...] "steely gaze of a serpent". He cannot speak after having his throat punctured, and just shows up for special missions when called by Scarlett, who can [...] "translate" [...] what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b> He is not used to teamwork, but now that he has joined G.I. Joe, his sense of honor and morality would not let him walk away. In the episode [...] "Dreadnoks Rising", Zartan takes off his visor but puts it back on and says, [...] "You need it more than I do". Snake Eyes' wolf Timber made an appearance in the episode [...] "White Out", where he was rescued by Snake Eyes from a bear trap, before they were assaulted by Storm Shadow and Shadow-Vipers; at the end, Snake Eyes asks Snow Job to watch Timber until he returns. In the episode [...] "Revelations, Part 1", Scarlett learns that Snake Eyes briefly met her father, and promised him to look after his daughter, and he shows signs of having feelings for her. During the time when Snake Eyes still spoke, before his throat injury in the episodes [...] "Return of the Arashikage, Parts 1-2", Snake Eyes was voiced by Danny Cooksey.|$|E
6000|$|... [124] [Byron is {{speaking}} of his departure from Spain, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of his departure from Malta, and his half-hearted amour with Mrs. Spencer Smith.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> that <b>he</b> {{would never}} light a {{cigarette}} there again.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that, Lucius, because I differ from you. What I wish {{to tell you}} now is this,--that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of trying the {{question}} again." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{listens to}} me with that far-away look that I have learned to love {{and that means that}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> deeply; at times he almost seems not to hear.|$|E
60|$|Quest did not at once reply. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of Laura's obstinacy.|$|R
60|$|Morris took it up mechanically; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{something}} very different.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of his long, humiliating confession. She {{looked at}} him curiously.|$|R
60|$|He has a trick when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> deeply {{of passing}} his hand--which is white, slender and tapering--over that scanty {{covering}} of what, but for it, {{would be a}} bald cranium.|$|E
60|$|LORD BROCKLEHURST (who is so {{agitated}} {{that she}} ought to see <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> not of her but of himself). It is a painful matter--I wish I could have spared you this, Mary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> {{over his}} {{words for the}} seventh day," [...] said the {{housekeeper}} solemnly. [...] "Forgetting hunger and thirst and all our poor earthly feelings in the blessedness of his work." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> {{over the}} work, his work, the all {{important}} to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> not too {{pleased at}} the interruption. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> and <b>he</b> wanted to <b>be</b> alone.|$|R
60|$|The man hesitated, and {{she guessed}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of his dusty jean.|$|R
6000|$|Peter {{scratched}} his long left ear {{with his long}} right hindfoot, a way he has when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> or is puzzled. [...] "That's funny," [...] said he. [...] "I wonder why his eyes are fixed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa talks sneeringly about {{chairs and}} tables. Of course, I know what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of. As I cannot {{go with him}} to the Mandarins, I think I ought to be allowed to look after the chairs and tables." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mary, it's just father's way. Most of {{the time}} he never sees us, either. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> deeply, that is all. And I AM going to pray that God will keep you in Four Winds--because I like you, Mary." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr Warden was embarrassed. The {{subject of}} Mr Vince's opulence had not entered into his discourse. He had {{carefully}} avoided it. The fact that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of it and}} that Ruth knew that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of it, and that he knew that Ruth knew, {{had nothing to do}} with the case. The question was not in order, and it embarrassed him.|$|R
