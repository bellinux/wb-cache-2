He also gave initial funding for several large infrastructure projects, such as High Speed 3 (an east–west rail line across the north of England), Crossrail 2 (a north–south rail line across London), a road tunnel across the Pennines, and upgrades to the M62 motorway.

However, many charities complained that they thought Osborne's 2016 budget favoured big business rather than disabled people.|$|E

The country-case studies find varying degrees of redistribution, with PAYG-DB and mixed programs redistributing more than <b>individual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> programs.

30|$|PAYG-DB {{programs}} {{usually have}} some in-built redistributive components, like minimum and maximum pensions, {{so they are}} often considered to be better equipped in principle to perform redistribution than more actuarial DC programs (Palmer, 2006). Pure <b>individual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are actuarially fair and hence, by construction, do not perform redistribution. In this light, if pension programs are expected to alleviate poverty and reduce inequality in all age (Barr 2001), PAYG-DB programs have an advantage over <b>individual</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> However, {{in the real world}} it is not always clear whether PAYG-DB programs are effective in alleviating poverty or reducing income inequality in old age. Also many <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> programs are complemented with redistributive non-actuarial components, like minimum pension guarantees and matching contributions. Therefore, whether a program contributes to reducing inequality is an empirical issue.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>Individual</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Account</b> (ISA; [...] ) is a {{class of}} retail {{investment}} arrangements available to residents of the United Kingdom.

Cash and {{a broad range of}} investments can be held within the arrangement, and there is no restriction on when or how much money can be withdrawn. Funds cannot be used as security for a loan.

50|$|Retirement plan. In {{order to}} reduce burden of the {{government-funded}} pension systems, governments may allow individuals to invest in their own pension. In the USA these sanctioned programs include Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s. The contributed income will not be taxable today, but will be taxable when the individual retires. The advantage to these plans is that money {{that would have been}} taken out as taxes is now compounded in the account until the funds are withdrawn. With the Roth IRA and the newly introduced (2006) Roth 401(k), income is taxed before the contributions are made into the account but are not taxed when the funds are withdrawn. This option is preferred by those workers who expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement than they currently are. A similar system is available in the United Kingdom and is known as the <b>Individual</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Account.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main {{alternative}} to a principal and interest mortgage is an interest-only mortgage, where the principal is not repaid throughout the term. This type of mortgage is common in the UK, especially when associated with a regular investment plan. With this arrangement regular contributions are made to a separate investment plan designed {{to build up a}} lump sum to repay the mortgage at maturity. This type of arrangement is called an investment-backed mortgage or is often related to the type of plan used: endowment mortgage if an endowment policy is used, similarly a Personal Equity Plan (PEP) mortgage, <b>Individual</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Account</b> (ISA) mortgage or pension mortgage. Historically, investment-backed mortgages offered various tax advantages over repayment mortgages, although this is no longer the case in the UK. Investment-backed mortgages are seen as higher risk as they are dependent on the investment making sufficient return to clear the debt.|$|E

30|$|PAYG {{programs}} are totally unfunded {{and so they}} lie at one extreme {{of the degree of}} funding dimension.
