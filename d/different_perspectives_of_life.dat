40|$|The Advisory Committee on Measuring Innovation in the 21 st Century Economy (2008), defined {{innovation}} as "the design, invention, development, and/or {{implementation of}} new or altered products, services, processes, systems, organizational structures, or business {{models for the}} purpose of creating new value for customers and financial returns for the firm" (Santolaria et al., 2011). In that way, eco-design considering the <b>life</b> cycle <b>of</b> products, processes or services, plays a fundamental role in innovation driven companies, adding a sustainable value to the strategy of the firm. In this paper the results of a research concerning eco-design strategies are presented. The Italian medium size company in partnership with the Architecture and Design Department of Politecnico di Torino undertook the research which the aim is the environmental improvement of building materials and products. Therefore, the LCA method is been applied as a tool for integrating environmental criteria into the strategic plans in order to: - evaluate environmental impacts; - improve brand value on the market; - fulfill client demand; - make products more fashionable; - integrate eco-design into energy efficiency construction sector. A case study proposed in this paper shows a LCA-based analysis applied to a thermal plaster from <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> whole <b>life</b> cycle stages, including: row materials suppliers, manufacturing companies, building designers, installation company, end-user and end-of-life business. The main goal, from all the project partners points of view, is the development of an innovating product characterized by the combination of: low environmental impacts of production, high market competitiveness (in price, energy efficiency, installation features, etc.) and long expected service life. In particular, two different analysis are carried out to promote both the environmental benefits and the industrial feasibility. LCA methodology is applied to develop and improve a range of experimental prototypes of thermal plaster using natural material as a primary source including minerals and plants, often derived from agriculture by-products or scraps. This first step can be helpful for the industrial partner to evaluate environmental impacts of each plaster blend as well as assessing and optimizing every manufacturing process to formulate a final product that follows appropriate eco-design criteria in terms of energy and environmental impact and cost. A second step of the study concerns the comparison between existing thermal plasters with the eco-innovating product coming from the former analysis. In this context, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology can be applied to eco-design to promote circular economy and influencing decision makers towards sustainable choices. As a result, interlinked local companies can share by-products and process scraps to reduce environmental impact and support eco-innovatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{present study}} investigates {{women in their}} later stage <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> who are {{believed}} to experience the double burden of being old and female. This research attempts to investigate the connection between activities and elderly women's well-being, and focuses on activity levels and life satisfaction in female older adults in Java. Activities within the society are often associated with money making, but also include socially beneficial activities. Combining all these aspects together, the present study aims to provide a <b>different</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> elderly women’s <b>life</b> satisfaction in a location where community involvement is greatly encouraged. The combination of survey and semi-structured interview will be conducted through a fieldwork towards three activity level-based groups with older adults as participants. The groups are classified into three: (1) women doing paid job or voluntary work, (2) housewife or family caretaker, and (3) older women in nursing homes. The last category is added because in Java, some women are enrolled in nursing home {{and need to be}} taken care <b>of.</b> <b>Life</b> satisfaction measurement is adopted from three measures by Jaya, Hanum, and Lubis (2011), SWLS by Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin (1985), and well-being measures by Krueger and Schkade (2008). Some prior studies indicate that activity levels correlate to life satisfaction, and working gives more satisfaction than caretaking (Kim, 2013; Baker et al., 2005). According to the premise, this study proposes that women of the group of nursing homes are most likely the least satisfied of all groups. Combining statistical analysis and qualitative analysis, this research finds out whether higher activity levels equate to higher life satisfaction in female older adults in Java. The current study will contribute an index <b>of</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction on a specific location in South East Asia, namely Java. Lastly, this research will also contribute in the field of gender and development because women’s well-being is considered two essential aspects in development...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{experiences}} of infertility and quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> as subjectively experienced health and psychological well-being as well as demographic, socio-economic and health issues in men and women terminating IVF unsuccessfully, i. e. without subsequent childbirth. The informants in the qualitative studies, in which a descriptive, phenomenological method was used, were eight women (Paper I) and eight men with severe male-factor infertility (Paper II). The informants had, two years earlier, terminated assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment unsuccessfully. All informants had had fertilized oocytes after in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo transfer (ET) had also been performed. Papers III and IV are parts of a large collaborative project in the Västra Götaland region including <b>different</b> <b>perspectives</b> on quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> 4 - 5. 5 years after terminated IVF treatment provided by the public health system. The informants in Paper III were couples who had undergone unsuccessful IVF treatment. The study in Paper IV was performed on {{men and women who}} had successfully or unsuccessfully undergone IVF. Comparisons were made with a control group with spontaneously conceived children. Data were collected with the “Psychological General Well- Being” (PGWB) and “Sense of Coherence “(SOC) instruments, and with two questionnaires focusing on experiences of infertility and socio-economic, demographic and health data. This thesis shows that the essence of the women’s experience of involuntary infertility was life-grief, including grief at being childless, unable to reproduce and unable to continue the family, as well as a feeling of being unable to confirm the relationship through parenthood. The essence of the men’s experiences was described with a metaphor: climbing a mountain step by step with the aim of reaching the top, i. e. having a child and thus a family with a child. Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> among couples who had terminated IVF unsuccessfully did not differ considerably from that in a control group with children. However, 23 % of this unsuccessful IVF group were living without children and 77 % were living with children. The 23 % living without children had a lower quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> than the 77 % living with children and the control group. Infertility remained a central issue for those living without children. Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> among men in the unsuccessful IVF group living without children was lower than among men in the successful IVF group and men in the control group. Women in the unsuccessful IVF group living without children reported a lower quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> than women in the successful IVF group and they scored two of the assessed quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> variables lower than women in the control group. Men in the successful IVF group scored three assessed quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> variables higher, compared to the women in that group. Men and women in the unsuccessful IVF group living without children did not differ in quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Keywords: infertility, IVF, ICSI, childlessness, phenomenology, lifeworld, grief, male-factor infertility, obstructive azoospermia, experience, psychology, quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> follow-up, gender ISBN 978 - 91 - 628 - 8074 -...|$|R
