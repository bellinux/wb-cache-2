40|$|The {{oxidizing}} purification {{of liquid}} radioactive waste (LRW) from organic substances and radionuclides {{with the use}} of a water solution of potassium permanganat is investigated. At a mass ratio of organic substances and a 5 % solution of potassium permanganat of 1. 5 : 1 in a strongly sour environment, the <b>dichromate</b> <b>oxidizability</b> decreases from 2360 to 100 mg O 2 /dm 3, the concentration of uranium from 42 to 1. 3 mg/dm 3 and the activity of 90 Sr from 2. 2 • 107 to 3. 5 • 104 Bq/dm 3 decrease. The basic opportunity of the oxidizing purification of LRW {{with the use of}} a water solution of potassium permanganat for the preliminary preparation of LRW at a stage prior to the evaporating devices of the Chernobyl NPP is shown...|$|E
40|$|Regularities of the {{oxidizing}} purification of {{deep blue}} residues of liquid radioactive wastes (LRW) from organic compounds and transuranium elements (TUE) {{with the use}} of hydrogen peroxide, and permanganate of potassium and the subsequent ultrafiltration are studied. The optimum modes of oxidization are established. Under the indicated conditions, the initial <b>dichromate</b> <b>oxidizability</b> of deep blue tailings of LRW goes down from 6000 – 9500 to 500 – 1000 mgO 2 /dm 3, the activity of TUE diminishes on the isotopes of 238, 239, 240 Pu by > 74 – 87 %, 241 Am by > 94 – 95 %, 244 Cm by > 90 – 95 %, and the concentration of uranium by 94 – 99 %. Introduction of the developed method on the Chernobyl NPP is offered...|$|E
