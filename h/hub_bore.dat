40|$|This paper {{presents}} the boundary element analysis of interference fit problems using axisymmetric bound-ary elements. A subregional technique {{is used to}} calculate the interference pressure and to find the von Mises stresses on the <b>hub</b> <b>bore,</b> without using iteration and incremental methods. The shaft and hub are modelled with equal lengths, unequal lengths, a shoulder on the shaft, and a grooved hub. Axisymmetric models of the shaft and hub are used to determine variable interference pressure along the interface line in the axial direction. The hub material is considered as steel and grey cast iron, and the shaft material is taken to be steel. All models used in the analysis are also solved using the finite element method with the ANSYS program. The results are compared with each other...|$|E
40|$|The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} {{developed from the}} keyless, frictionless, static press-fit of a solid shaft into a hub with bore rounded edges are addressed. Derived from an analytical approach, a normalising parameter Φ is employed that accounts for the combined effects on the hub stress concentration of the fillet radius of the <b>hub</b> <b>bore,</b> the shaft radius, the interference, and the Young’s modulus. Compiled {{with the aid of}} Finite Elements, several design charts are presented that report the elastic stress concentrations within the hub versus the normalising parameter Φ. Each curve is valid for prescribed ratios of a) the hub inner radius to the outer radius, and b) the fillet radius to the shaft radius. An approximating expression of ample validity is also presented for a prompt evaluation of the hub stress concentration factor...|$|E
40|$|In this article, the {{achievement}} of a uniform elastic contact pressure in a frictionless, keyless, shaft-hub interference fit obtained by properly shaping the mating profiles is examined. The peculiarity of the hub mechanical response according to which, under {{the effect of a}} uniform pressure applied to the <b>hub</b> <b>bore,</b> the bore axial profile moves radially without any distortion, is exploited to simplify the determination of the mating profiles that return a uniform pressure. In particular, the hub radial deflection may be computed with a simple plane model, whereas only the shaft radial deflection requires a more complex analysis in cylindrical coordinates. Explicit approximate expressions are reported for the shapes to be conferred to the mating profiles to achieve a uniform pressure. Selected examples are presented to clarify the proposed design procedure and to preliminarily explore the effect on the pressure profile of simple shape errors...|$|E

50|$|In 1902, the W. M. Ritter Lumber Company {{began making}} {{plans for a}} massive lumbering {{operation}} along Hazel Creek. Ritter convinced Southern Railway to extend the railroad from Bushnell {{to the mouth of}} Hazel Creek, where Ritter built the <b>hub</b> that <b>bore</b> his name. From this hub, Ritter constructed a logging railroad extending 16 mi up the Hazel Creek valley to the mouth of Proctor Creek. The train, operated by Ritter's subsidiary Smoky Mountain Railway, offered passenger service to Proctor and Medlin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} {{developed from the}} keyless frictionless static press-fit of a shaft into a hub are addressed. Two configurations are examined, namely (a) an infi-nitely long solid shaft press-fitted into a hollow <b>hub</b> with <b>bore</b> rounded edges, and (b) a shaft with filleted extremity, partially inserted into a hub. Derived from an analytical approach, a normalizing parameter is proposed that accounts for the combined effects on the stress con-centrations of the fillet radius, the shaft radius, the interference, and Young’s modulus. With the aid of finite elements, various design charts are compiled that report the elastic stress con-centrations within the hub versus the proposed normalizing parameter. Each curve is valid for a fixed ratio of inner to outer hub radii...|$|R
40|$|The peak contact {{stresses}} {{are addressed}} that are {{developed from the}} frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into an elastically similar hub with bore rounded edges. The non-linear behavior of this progressive contact is addressed by scaling a local solution available from the literature, {{with the aid of}} intermediate, auxiliary problems extracted from the fracture mechanics realm. The title problem being linear on the global domain with both the bending couple and the interference, this problem is solved by combining the FE forecasts obtained for two separate load cases, i. e. a) the interference alone and, b) the bending couple alone. Such results are expressed in terms of a) stress intensity factors for the auxiliary FM problems, and b) hoop strain component, as sampled in the proximity of the indenting edge for both the mating members. Design formulae for the contact stresses are proposed, that account for various normalized geometrical parameters, such as the outer to inner hub radii ratio, the radius of the <b>hub</b> <b>bore</b> fillet, and the contact length. Comprehensive coefficient tables are provided as well. Finally, an error analysis for the proposed method is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} are addressed that are {{developed from the}} keyless frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into a <b>hub</b> with rounded <b>bore</b> edges. Derived from a formal modeling of the title problem {{in terms of an}} integral equation, a set of normalized parameters is proposed that accounts for the combined effects on the hub stress concentration of the fillet radius, the shaft radius, the hub outer radius, the hub axial length, the interference, the Young's modulus, and the bending couple. A numerical validation of the normalized parameters is presented. With the aid of Finite Elements, various design charts are compiled that (a) forecast the bending couple initiating the detachment between the shaft and the hub, and (b) report the elastic stress concentrations within the hub versus the proposed normalized parameters in the absence of shaft–hub detachment. Such charts assist the designer in dimensioning an interference fit {{in the presence of a}} bending couple...|$|R
40|$|LectureThe {{transmission}} of torque from a shaft to a hub can be efficiently accomplished {{through the use}} of friction. The advantages of this system over a keyed connection are: (1) the significant reduction of stress concentrations in the shafts and hubs, (2) an increase in the torque that can be transmitted, and (3) the ease of hub removal. The disadvantages of this system are: (1) it requires more care at installation, and (2) it can generate high shaft stresses if misused. The theory of {{transmission of}} torque {{through the use of}} friction is relatively simple. A <b>hub</b> having a <b>bore</b> slightly smaller than the shaft on which it will be installed is expanded radially either through heating or through hydraulic pressure. Sufficiently expanded, the hub can slide on the shaft and then is allowed to resume its original diameter; however, the shaft prevents this from happening. In the process, a high contact pressure is created at the interface. It is this pressure, the contact area, and the coefficient of friction that generates the tangential force which permits the torque transmission. The contact pressure at the interface also generates high stresses in the parts. These stresses must be carefully calculated in order to avoid immediate failure of the hubs, or fatigue failure of the shafts. The practice of hydraulic installation and removal is simple if a few rules are religiously followed. The most important ones are: (1) very good contact pattern at the interface, (2) cleanliness of the parts and oil, (3) accurate measurements of pressures and motion, and (4) observance of safety rules. This paper gives the formulae necessary for the calculation of the torque that can be transmitted through an interference fit, and for the calculation of the generated stresses. The second part gives the rules that have to be followed for a safe installation and removal of the hub, and illustrations showing various methods in use...|$|R
