40|$|Brachytherapy {{consists}} of placing <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> into or adjacent to tumors, to deliver conformal radiation treatment. The technique {{is used for}} treatment of primary malignancies and for salvage in recurrent disease. Permanent prostate brachytherapy seeds are small metal <b>implants</b> containing <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> of I- 125, Pd- 103, or Cs- 131 encased in a titanium shell. They can embolize through the venous system to the lungs or heart and subsequently be detected by cardiovascular computed tomography. Cardiovascular imagers {{should be aware of}} the appearance of migrated seeds, as their presence in the chest is generally benign, so that unnecessary worry and testing are avoided.

40|$|The Health Physics Society (HPS) {{has adopted}} a {{position}} that a dose-based criterion is appropriate to govern the release of patients who were treated with therapeutic quantities of radiopharmaceuticals or who received permanent <b>implants</b> of sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> for therapeutic purposes. The HPS considers the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) patient release dose criteria in 10 CFR 35. 75 to provide ample public health safety measures. The NRC patient release dose criteria (U. S. NRC 2001) allow patients to be released if the effective dose to any other individual {{is not likely to}} exceed 5 mSv per patient and require that the patient be given instructions, including written instructions, on actions recommended to maintain doses to other individuals as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) if the total effective dose equivalent to any other individual is likely to exceed 1 mSv per patient. According to the HPS position statement “Radiation Risk in Perspective, ” these dose criteria are well below the lowest dose that justifies quantitative estimation of health risks (HPS 2010). Application of the dose criteria for release of patients should properly balance public-safety issues with the patient’s access to treatment with therapeutic quantities of radiopharmaceuticals and sealed sources. In response to comments on the 1997 10 CFR 35. 75 rulemaking, the NRC stated the patient release dose criterion of 5 mSv applies to each patient release based on NRC staff’s review that multiple administrations in the same year to the same patient were not expected to exceed 5 mSv to any other individual (U. S. NRC 1997 a) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> {{are being}} {{incorporated}} into the world’s scrap metal supply. In order to prevent this unwanted radioactive material from entering metal processing sites, some facilities have voluntarily installed radiation monitoring devices {{at the entrance to}} their facilities (Figure 1). However, this monitoring does not guarantee that all <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> will be detected in scrap metal loads. Shielding of the sources by the metal scrap, location of the source within the scrap load and the location and sensitivity of the monitoring system will determine if the source is detected. To date, there have been 83 meltings of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> in metal processing facilities (1), with site cleanups averaging $ 12 – 15 million (1). One facility, the site of a melted a radiation source, has incurred cleanup costs in excess of $ 26 million (1). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a cooperative partnership with the scrap metal industry, developed a CD ROM based training program to provide a protocol for response to facility radiation alarms (2). This training enables site workers to identify and properly manage <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> after they have been detected in the scrap metal supply. In order to prevent these sources from becoming uncontrolled, it is necessary to identify and manage these <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> before they get placed in the scrap metal supply. A CD ROM based training program entitled “Identifying <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Sources</b> at the Demolition Site ” is designed to address this problem and help the demolition industry secure radioactive gauges and devices at their point of installation...|$|R

This will be achieved through the permanent disposal of all disused sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> (DSRS) in the three target Member States. 2. Project background and rationale Sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> are widely used throughout the world for beneficial purposes, in industry, medicine and research. Regulatory and physical control of the majority of sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> is ensured during manufacturing, distribution and regular use. However, the IAEA has recognised that when sources become disused, and especially where regulatory infrastructure is ineffective and/or financial resources are limited, there is the possibility that control over these sources will be lost. In other circumstances, repatriation of DSRS to countries manufacturing and supplying sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> may not be possible, in which case interim or long-term storage of the DSRS is required. But in Member States without an adequate radioactive waste management infrastructure, the management of DSRS in storage may also be extremely weak. In order to overcome these difficulties and assist its Member States the IAEA supports various initiatives aimed at improving management an...|$|R
40|$|Every year {{millions}} tons {{of steel}} are produced worldwide from recycled scrap loads. Although the detection {{systems in the}} steelworks prevent most orphan <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> from entering the furnace, {{there is still the}} possibility of accidentally melting a <b>radioactive</b> <b>source.</b> The MetroMetal project, carried out in the frame of the European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP), addresses this problem by studying the existing measurement systems, developing sets of reference sources in various matrices (cast steel, slag, fume dust) and proposing new detection instruments.
