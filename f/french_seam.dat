This coatdress incorporates an androgynous look of design elements of redingote: a feminine silhouette of cowl design of the skirt combined with a large notched collar and a single-breasted front closure. Asymmetrical line of the skirt and the fitted bodice creates informal balance. For the surface design, an inspiration came from The Water Lilies: Setting Suns by Claude Monet. Twisting and tying resist techniques and natural dyes (alkanet, annatto, cutch, and sandalwood) were used to emulate the painter 2 ̆ 7 s dappled brushstrokes and the color schemes. The <b>French</b> <b>seam,</b> bias binding, bias facing, and bound buttonholes were used to complete the look. The skirt was lined with the fabric dyed with the same as the skirt...|$|E
40|$|N WESTERN EUROPE {{flexible}} structures, {{in particular}} pneumatic con-structions, are today predominatly {{made on the}} basis of PVC-coated polyester fabrics. For this purpose 4 standard types of fabric are currently available, the technical data of which are shown in Table 1. This table includes apart from the strength at room temperature, also the strength at 70 ° C. This elevated temperature was chosen because temperature measurements conducted on air-supported structures in West Germany have always given membrane temperatures below 70 °C so that 70 ° C represents an upper limit for test purposes. Which of the 4 materials will be selected depends on the loads to be expected, resulting from the design of the structure and the environmental influences to which it will be exposed. It has been found that in West Germany the most commonly used materials is type II. In addition to the materials presented here, there have, of course, been developed other materials for special structures requiring, for instance, extremely high translucence. Moreover, there are signs that in addition to the 4 standard fabrics included in Table 1, a so-called type V having a nominal strength of about 2000 N/cm may be find general acceptance. Apart from the materials, great importance must be attached to the joints. Here, too, 4 types of seams have developed, which can be used in any of the above-mentioned materials. The joints represented in Table 2 include the high frequency seam, the double lapped seam, the 4 -ply <b>French</b> <b>seam,</b> and the so-called combined seam, which consists of a 2 -ply flat seam which additionally been secured by high frequency welding...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{geological}} storage of CO 2 is heavily studied {{around the world}} in order to limit global warming due to the greenhouse effect. The atmospheric CO 2, which has been steadily increasing for more than a century, is assumed to be in a large part responsible of this warming. Nowadays, various options have been considering to store CO 2 in an underground environment for periods covering several centuries. Among the options, one is to inject it in unexploited coal seams. The objective of our work is to characterise the interactions between CO 2 ans coal interfaces from two <b>French</b> coal <b>seams.</b> This will contribute to identify the most adapted coal basin which could be used for storing CO 2 in France...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose for}} this garment {{was to create}} a piece of {{clothing}} that a woman can wear out to a formal or social event. I wanted to make the wearer feel confident and sexy, {{but at the same time}} show her fun side. The off-shoulder strap creates a sexy and confident look and the handmade roses show the fun and romantic side of the woman. Having a bold purple color shows a more fun and confident woman. Process: The process of this garment started with my interests. I love roses and I wanted to do something with them. I looked on Pinterest for ideas and what I could do with my interest in roses. I started sketching and it took a few tries to get the perfect dress; after that I measured my model and started draping. Once the draping was done, I started patterning the draped garment. After flat patterning, I began to create my sample garment. With the sample garment, I fitted it on my model to see if there were any adjustments I needed to make. Adjustments were made to the pattern from the fitting. The finished garment was sewn together and roses were hand sewn on as a final touch to the garment. Techniques: The technique I used to make this garment was draping. The bodice was draped by using the princess line technique. The pattern for the skirt was a flare skirt draping technique. I used <b>French</b> <b>seams</b> to assure the inside of the garment looked as clean and tidy as the outside. The straps were cut on the bias to have more stretch for ease of movement. Making the roses and applying them to the final garment was a tedious and detail-oriented process. Innovation: The innovation of this garment is the three dimensional texture and how it expresses the fun and confidence of the woman wearing the dress. Materials: Cotton fabric, polyester, a zipper, and purple threads. This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30, at 3 : 00 p. m. and 7 : 00 p. m. in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall...|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} new-for-1990 Touring Coupe model (see entry below) {{introduced}} {{later in the}} model year, {{it was a year}} of enhancement for Eldorado. A driver's side airbag was introduced as standard equipment, but as a result, the telescoping steering column was discontinued (although the tilt feature remained). Cruise control buttons were mounted on the center of the previous steering wheel, but {{with the advent of the}} air bag (mounted on a smaller diameter steering wheel), they were now moved to the turn signal stalk. A new multi-point fuel injection replaced the throttle-body style from last year, and horsepower jumped from 155 to 180, although the new system required the use of premium fuel. A new cast aluminum wheel design (not available with the Touring Suspension package) was optional for those customers who desired something different than the standard [...] "snowflake" [...] alloy wheel on the base Eldorado. Seating received numerous enhancements, including new molded trim panels, additional lateral and lumbar support, <b>French</b> <b>seams,</b> and revised front headrests. Full leather upholstery (formerly leather and cloth) was now standard on the Biarritz model, but the base model lost the seat-back map pockets. The cellular telephone disappeared from the option list, and the vinyl center armrest was revamped. The electronic climate control received an update in the form of three automatic and two manual settings. The optional leather upholstery package on the base model now included a power passenger seat recliner. Last year's [...] "Eldorado Option Package" [...] (which included new-style carpeted floor mats, body-color door edge guards, illuminated driver and passenger visor vanity mirrors, luggage compartment mat, and the illuminated entry system) was now standard. Additionally, previously optional items that were added as standard equipment this year included the rear window defogger with heated outside mirrors, and bodyside accent striping. New options for 1990 included a central-unlocking feature (from the outside door locks using the key) added to the automatic door locks. A revised deck-lid engine plaque now mentioned the port fuel injection, and the deck-lid itself held a chromed handle above the license plate opening. Also, the rear safety reflectors moved from the bumper onto the panel below the decklid this year. A new charcoal-colored vinyl strip accented the chrome bumper and bodyside moldings this year, while the front bumper guards changed from body-color to charcoal. In the front suspension, the stabilizer shaft was revised for ride and handling, while the tire jack located in the trunk had a new carpeted storage container. Price for 1990 was $28,885, with the Biarritz model an additional $3,180. Production dropped to 20,874 units, about 1/3 of which were the Biarritz model. An additional 1,507 Eldorado Touring Coupe models were made.|$|R
