METHODS: We {{developed a}} neuropsychological algorithm {{in a sample}} of 1, 023 elderly residents of Cache County, UT. We compared algorithmic and clinical dementia diagnoses both based on DSM-III-R criteria. The algorithm diagnosed dementia when there was impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain. We also tested a variant of the algorithm that incorporated <b>functional</b> <b>measures</b> that were based on structured informant reports. RESULTS: Of 1, 023 participants, 87 % could be classified by the basic algorithm, 94 % when <b>functional</b> <b>measures</b> were considered. There was good concordance between basic psychometric and clinical diagnoses (79 % agreement, kappa = 0. 57). This improved after incorporating <b>functional</b> <b>measures</b> (90 % agreement, kappa = 0. 76).

40|$|The <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> for Children (WeeFIM) is {{a simple}} tool for {{assessing}} the functional independence of three domains: mobility, self-care, and cognition. Children are usually apprehensive about performing standardized structured language or developmental tests, and only licensed professionals can administer standardized tests. We attempted to apply the <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> for Children for assessing children with developmental delay and to assess for any correlation of these scores with standardized language tests. We recruited 49 children with developmental delay, and the <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> for Children was administered. Two standardized language tests (Symbolic Play Test and Reynell Language Developmental Scale) were administered to assess language age. There was a significant correlation between <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> for Children scores with both verbal comprehension age and verbal expression age. There was no correlation of <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> for Children scores with gender, age, or having domestic helpers.

This study has been taken as an insight to capture <b>functional</b> <b>measures</b> using <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> and <b>Functional</b> Assessment <b>Measure</b> scale on both motor and cognitive function which shows the dependence of the patient performing activities of daily living. This measurement is useful for assessing patient’s progress and functional outcome. Methodology: The functional disability of the patient was assessed using the <b>Functional</b> Independence <b>Measure</b> and <b>Functional</b> Assessment <b>Measure</b> scale at admission, in the middle and on discharge in 124 patients. Functional gain was recorded as the difference between the score on admission and at discharge. Data were collected by direct observation of the patient and by interview with the help of a questionnaire. Study Setting: Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospitals. Results: The score ranges between 30 - 210. A score of 30 indicates impairment of functioning and 210 indicates complete regain of normal functioning.
