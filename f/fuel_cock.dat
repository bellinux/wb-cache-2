5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the <b>fuel</b> <b>cock</b> that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to later aircraft, the Vampire had a relatively disorganised cockpit {{that in some}} aspects lacked ergonomic measures; such as the fuel gauges being difficult for the pilot to observe without pulling the control column back. A few controls, such as the low-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>cock,</b> were known for being difficult to move or were otherwise obstructed by other controls. The pilot was provided with a fairly favourable external view, in part aided by the relatively small size of the Vampire.|$|E
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprised}} two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and rear spars of the (inner) anhedral wing {{section of the}} port and starboard wings, each with [...] capacity. The tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red warning light in the cockpit. The fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the power plant. Should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the <b>fuel</b> <b>cock</b> armature. The powerplant was cooled by a , ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of [...] was positioned under the engine.|$|E
50|$|The cockpit {{containing}} the flying officers {{were provided with}} numerous controls and features; {{to the left of}} the first pilot were the controls for the auto-pilot and a P.4 compass, who was also provided with a beam approach indicator (to aid nighttime landings) and DF visual loop indicator in addition to the standard flight controls. Switches for the flaps and position indicators were located on a central panel set between the two pilots, while the master <b>fuel</b> <b>cocks</b> were set above these on the roof; throttle and mixture controls were also normally positioned between the pilots. Only limited engine instrumentation was provisioned for, such as engine speed indicators and boost gauges.|$|R
50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the {{throttle lever}}s actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the <b>fuel</b> <b>cocks,</b> which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
50|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>cocks,</b> activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|R
2500|$|After {{arriving}} in Australia he was posted to Darwin, Northern Territory on 12 August 1942 with No. 77 Squadron RAAF (Kittyhawks), {{during this time}} he was involved in his second air accident. [...] While flying P-40E A29-60 on 7 September 1942, he was forced to land due to an incorrectly set <b>fuel</b> <b>cock.</b> Both Gorton and his aircraft were recovered several days later after spending time in the bush. On 21 February 1943 the squadron was relocated to Milne Bay, New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>cock</b> for {{the reserve}} tanks {{were in the}} {{passenger}} compartment and - {{if they were not}} already on - to switch to reserve one of the crew would have to go aft. There might have been insufficient time given the height at which they were flying.|$|E
50|$|XR638 3 January 1966: While {{serving with}} 21 Flt, UK, the {{aircraft}} encountered engine {{problems caused by}} the inadvertent closure of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cock</b> in mistake for the heater control, during a delivery flight from Wroughton to Middle Wallop. The aircraft subsequently lost height and crashed tail first at Marlborough, Wiltshire. It then caught fire and burnt out killing the two crew.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the <b>fuel</b> <b>cocks</b> and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|R
50|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{the wing}} {{was the first}} to fly an Air Mobility Command sortie {{supporting}} the Air Force's response to the terrorist attacks by refueling the F-16 that delivered the Federal Emergency Management Agency director to New York only {{three and a half hours}} after the attacks. All of the 319th Air Refueling Wing's mission-capable aircraft were prepped, <b>fueled</b> and <b>cocked</b> within 24 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{of their}} Whitley heavy bomber for the Royal Air Force was a priority, {{and work on}} the Ensign {{proceeded}} slowly. Construction took place not at the main Coventry factory, but at the production line of Air Service Training Ltd (another member of the Hawker-Siddeley group) in Hamble. Constant changes were requested by Imperial, slowing production further. As a result, the Ensign's maiden flight did not take place until 24 January 1938. The first flight showed a problem with applying full rudder that was cured by modifying the servo. On the second, the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. The prototype then went on for more exhaustive tests before passing to the A&AEE for Air Ministry testing. On her fourth flight, the engines cut out due to incorrect settings of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cocks</b> and it had to be glided down to RAF Bicester where it made a perfect [...] "dead-stick" [...] landing. Imperial Airways named the prototype [...] "Ensign" [...] and as such the [...] "Ensign class" [...] was applied to the whole fleet. The aircraft were fitted out for either Empire routes (eight aircraft) or European routes (four aircraft). The former carried 27 passengers in three cabins or 20 sleeping; the latter 40 passengers across three cabins and a four-person [...] "coupe" [...] aft of the third cabin. The only difference in crewing was a [...] "flight clerk" [...] replacing one of the two stewards on Empire routes.|$|R
5000|$|There is no fuel gauge, however a [...] "fuel low" [...] {{light is}} present, which gets {{brighter}} as the reserve level is approached. Filling {{up at the}} lowest brightness of the light will result in only half the fuel capacity of the motorcycle being used. The bike has a 4 L reserve, switched to with the usual <b>fuel</b> <b>cock</b> on the left hand seat unit fairing.|$|E

Methodology: transversal studyon 600 children between 24 and 59 months of Childcare center of Cuenca City, was conducted by randomizing sample. Validated ISAAC test survey was used for diagnosis of asthma, and intra domiciliary pollutants were investigated using a formulary designed for that purpose, the prevalence ratio(PR) with IC of 95 %andChi-square test were used to find association between asthma and intra domiciliary pollutants. Results: The prevalence of asthma according to ISAAC was 38 %, higher in those patients who have domestic animals (40. 1 %), use of aerosols(43. 2 %), domestic gas as fuel(38 %) and smoking (44. 9 %). Conclusions: Children exposed to aerosols in home present 1. 37 {{times more likely to}} develop as thmathan those not exposed(p < 0. 05). Population exposed to second hand smoking at home are 1, 27 times more likely to develop as thmathan those not exposed(p < 0. 05). Overcrowding, the presence of plagues such as rats, domestic pets and using <b>fuel</b> for <b>cocking</b> at home were not statistically associated with the presence of asthma.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} design {{requirements}} for an aviation fuel system (AFS), AFS basic design requirements, reliability, and design precautions to avoid AFS failure. Compares {{the reliability and}} fail-safety of AFS and aircraft hydraulic system (AHS), considers the promising alternative ways to raise reliability of fuel systems, as well as elaborates recommendations to improve reliability of the pipeline system components and pipeline systems, in general, based on the selection of design solutions. It is extremely advisable to design the AFS and AHS in accordance with Aviation Regulations АП 25 and Accident Prevention Guidelines, ICAO (International Civil Aviation Association), which will reduce risk of emergency situations, {{and in some cases}} even avoid heavy disasters. ATS and AHS designs should be based on the uniform principles to ensure the highest reliability and safety. However, currently, this principle is not enough kept, and AFS looses in reliability and fail-safety as compared with AHS. When there are the examined failures (single and their combinations) the guidelines to ensure the AFS efficiency should be the same as those of norm-adopted in the Regulations АП 25 for AHS. This will significantly increase reliability and fail-safety of the fuel systems and aircraft flights, in general, despite a slight increase in AFS mass. The proposed improvements through the use of components redundancy of the fuel system will greatly raise reliability of the fuel system of a passenger aircraft, which will, without serious consequences for the flight, withstand up to 2 failures, its reliability and fail-safety design will be {{similar to those of the}} AHS, however, above improvement measures will lead to a slightly increasing total mass of the fuel system. It is advisable to set a second pump on the engine in parallel with the first one. It will run in case the first one fails for some reasons. The second pump, like the first pump, can be driven from the aircraft gearbox or from additional motor and fires as soon as the first one fails; to duplicate a <b>fuel</b> emergency shutoff <b>cock,</b> which functions only in case of engine fire, as well as to increase the strength reserves of the pipelines and the fuel system pressure units up to three units, as it is stipulated in the AHS. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{aircraft}} was robust, with an airframe fatigue life of 7,200 hours, the cockpit ergonomics were less than perfect. An example of this was the cabin heater switch being mounted next to the <b>fuel</b> <b>cock.</b> Unfortunately, {{this led to the}} loss of at least four aircraft when the pilot inadvertently closed the <b>fuel</b> <b>cock</b> instead of switching off the cabin heater, causing the engine to shut down. The autorotational qualities of the Scout have also been described by some pilots as 'startling'. In service trials and testing were carried out by the AAC's Development Wing at Middle Wallop, Hampshire. A wide variety of weapons and equipment were evaluated, although many were never adopted. Amongst these were the 7.62mm General Electric Minigun and the two-inch rocket pod. The rocket pods were mounted either side of the central fuselage section on the multi-spar weapon booms and both smooth tube and fin-stabilised rockets were tested, although the accuracy was described as [...] "indifferent". Studies were also carried out for a pintle-mounted M2 Browning machine gun in place of the standard 7.62 GPMG, and the French AME.621 20mm cannon. Another was the installation of a Bendix R.100 lightweight weather and ground-mapping radar, which had a range of eight and forty miles. This was mounted behind the fibreglass nose access panel along with a small viewing screen in the cockpit. The radar antenna was moved further forward later in the development to improve downward scanning.|$|E
