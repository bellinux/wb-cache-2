40|$|The {{reason why}} Randall Fallows wrote Exploring Perspectives: A Concise Guide to Analysis is simple: to help give {{students}} {{a better understanding}} of how to discover, develop, and revise an analytical essay. Here is how his 5 chapter book goes about doing just that:The first two chapters focus on the nature of an analysis and what’s involved in writing an analytical essay. Randall shows that analysis consists of a balance of assertions (statements which present their viewpoints or launch an exploration of their concerns), examples (specific passages/scenes/events which inspire these views), explanations (statements that reveal how the examples support the assertions), and significance (statements which reveal the importance of their study to personal and/or cultural issues). After showing why each feature should be present throughout an essay, he reveals how to ”set the stage“ for producing one of their own. He first helps students to evaluate their own views on a subject and to examine how these views emerge from their own experiences, values and judgments. He, then, shows them how to research what others have said about the subject and provides suggestions for evaluating and incorporating this research into their own perspectives. Finally, Randall discusses the nature of writing, not as a linear procedure, but as a recursive process where the discovery and clarification of a concept occur simultaneously. The remaining three chapters reveal more specific advice on how to develop an analytical essay. Exploring Perspectives: A Concise Guide to Analysis by Randall Fallows is a great text to prepare any student to write analytical essays for the argument and persuasion courses.

This book streamlines the presentation of material to ensure that every page is relevant, engaging, and interesting to undergraduate business students, without losing the depth of coverage {{that they need to}} be successful in their academic journeys and in their professional careers. This is not Legal Environment of Business (LEB) ”light. “ Rather, this is LEB without risk of students’ eyes glazing over in boredom or from lack of comprehension. This is LEB presented in an exciting way, where every page is interesting to students and relevant to real life. The authors recognize that the sheer volume of information to be covered in a LEB course makes it one of the more challenging courses for the business undergraduate. Not only do typical LEB texts read like the first year curriculum at law school, but also the LEB course is grounded in the humanities, which can make the subject even more demanding for students who are also taking statistics, economics, finance, and accounting. Each chapter contains not only substantive law, but also illustrative videos, interactive exercises for hands-on learning, and discussion questions for critical thought. Additionally, each chapter presents ”A Question of Ethics“ section, which contains real world ethical dilemmas relevant to the topic under study. These videos, exercises, discussion questions, and ethics sections all provide opportunities for students to apply concepts that they are learning in the context of relevant LEB topics that shape or restrain actual decision-makers’ actions. It’s real world practice in the safety of the classroom environment. Lau & Johnson’s The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business is a textbook that students will enjoy reading.

40|$|International Business {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} and exciting courses to teach in the Business School. To teach a current, dynamic and complete course you need a textbook by authors as passionate and informed about International Business as you are. Carpenter and Dunung’s International Business: The Opportunities and Challenges of a Flat World provides exploration into building, leading, and thriving in global organizations in an increasingly flat world. The authors define ”Flat world“ as one where (1) service industries that dwarf manufacturing industries in terms of scale and scope, (2) an Internet that pervades life and work, and (3) networks define modern businesses, whether service or manufacturing. Carpenter and Dunung’s text is designed to speak to technologically-savvy students who see national borders as bridges and not barriers. The authors use the lexicon of international business, and additionally, develop students’ knowledge of international contexts with the aim that they may launch, run, and work in any organization that is global in scope (or is wrestling with global competition or other global threats). The textbook is organized in 5 Sections: Section 1 introduces the global business course and concludes with a chapter on seizing global opportunities. Section 2 develops student knowledge about key facets of the global business environment, while Section 3 develops knowledge about how a student or organization can exploit opportunities in that global environment. Section 4 is devoted to entrepreneurship in a flat world — this section will explore why the entrepreneurial context is changing, provide lenses for identifying and capitalizing on entrepreneurial opportunities, and Section 5 shows how key organizational activities can be managed for global effectiveness. Every chapter has five enumerated learning objectives, each of these five sections concludes with a short summary (”Key Takeaways“) and five review questions. In addition, each chapter concludes with a mini case on a unique global business that encompasses the topics shown in the chapter. The authors even provide a set of end-of-chapter questions that are mapped to AACSB learning standards, so that you will be able to measure how well students are grasping course content that aligns with the AACSB guidelines.

40|$|Essentials of Geographic Information Systems {{integrates}} {{key concepts}} behind the technology with practical concerns and real-world applications. Recognizing that many potential GIS users are non-specialists or may only {{need a few}} maps, this book {{is designed to be}} accessible, pragmatic and concise. Essentials of Geographic Information Systems also illustrates how GIS is used to ask questions, inform choices and guide policy. From the melting of the polar ice caps to privacy issues associated with mapping, this book provides a gentle, yet substantive, introduction to the use and application of digital maps, mapping and GIS. Maps are everywhere - on the internet, in your car and even on your mobile phone. Moreover, maps of the 21 st century are not just paper diagrams folded like an accordion. Maps today are colorful, searchable, interactive and shared. This transformation of the static map into dynamic and interactive multimedia reflects the integration of technological innovation and vast amounts of geographic data. The key technology behind this integration, and subsequently the maps of the 21 st century, is geographic information systems or GIS. In today's world, learning involves knowing how and where to search for information. In some respects, knowing where to look for answers and information is arguably {{just as important as the}} knowledge itself. Because the authors designed Essentials of GIS to be concise, focused and directed, readers are encouraged to search for supplementary information and to follow-up on specific topics of interest on their own when necessary. This text provides the foundations for learning GIS, but readers are encouraged to construct their own individual frameworks of GIS knowledge. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. First, it promotes active learning through re/search. Second, it facilitates flexible and selective learning, i. e., what is learned is a function of individual needs and interest. Since GIS and related geospatial and navigation technology change so rapidly, a flexible and dynamic text is necessary in order to stay current and relevant. Though essential concepts in GIS tend to remain constant, the situations, applications and examples of GIS are fluid and dynamic. The Flat World model of publishing with the MIYO (Make It Your Own) customization platform is especially relevant for a text that deals with information technology. The authors can keep the text updated easily, and you, the instructor, can add content on the technology that you find timely and relevant to the book with a few clicks on the mouse. Though this book is intended for use in introductory GIS courses, Essentials of Geographic Information Systems will also appeal to the large number of certificate, professional, extension and online programs in GIS that are available today.

40|$|Are you {{teaching}} freshman level students? Is {{this one}} of the first college level courses your students have ever taken? Probably. That is why this English Handbook is different (and we think better). Miles McCrimmon’s, The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers is based on the understanding that writing {{is at the center of}} the college experience, not just something students do on their way to ”higher-level“ coursework. The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers supports the goal of acculturating entering students to the demands of college-level thinking and writing, whether that goal is being met through coursework in Composition, Student Development, or some combination of the two. Miles shows students how to use writing as a portal for thinking and learning and for communicating with the world. Its writing prompts and exercises encourage students to do a great deal of low-stakes, exploratory writing, but also to experience gradually the rhetorical considerations of going public in a variety of genres and media. Through it all, students are asked to reflect on their writing, exploring precisely how it functions depending on the rhetorical considerations of their voice, audience and purpose. The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers is both a guide to college-level writing and thinking and a comprehensive college-level writing handbook. In Part 1, students will identify and develop habits of mind they can use for success in college and life, and in Parts 2 - 4 and the Appendices, they will find the tools they need to become better and more polished writers. Dig in deeper to the organization to see what we mean: The driving energy of Part 1 (”Composing Habits of Mind“) is the reciprocal relationship between thinking and writing. Students will use low-stakes, personal writing to identify, develop, and activate the habits of mind they need for college-level thinking, then learn how to apply those habits to their high-stakes, public writing. The first three chapters each focus on a different cluster of four related ”habits of mind“, while Chapter 4 focuses on the rhetorical demands of demonstrating those habits in the presence of others. Chapter 1 (”Writing to Think and Writing to Learn“) activates the following habits of mind: examining the status quo; posing productive questions; slowing down your thinking; and withholding judgment. Students are exposed to a variety of ways to use low-stakes writing as a gateway to deeper thinking, not so much as a stepping stone toward producing more audience-centered texts, but more as a preliminary, meditative strategy to generate further questions. Habits of mind activated: Chapter 2 (”Becoming a Reflective Practitioner“) activates the following habits of mind: developing a ”meta“ sense; attending to your own role in observation; reading texts carefully and critically; and nurturing curiosity, wonder, and humor. Students cultivate the ”meta“ sense as a crucial habit they must acquire and develop in order to succeed as college-level writers, readers, and thinkers. They are also exposed to a variety of methods they can use to reflect productively about themselves, as well as about the texts they encounter and produce. Chapter 3 (”Thinking through the Disciplines“) activates the following habits of mind: seeing and making connections; sustaining two ideas simultaneously; articulating multiple sides of an issue; and finding your place and purpose in the world. Students come to understand that the disciplines they encounter in college, just as the occupations they will someday assume, are socially constructed and negotiated. These disciplines have developed distinct conventions for writing, speaking, and making meaning that are under constant interrogation and revision. Chapter 4 (”Joining the Conversation“) introduces students to what’s involved when low-stakes writing of the type produced in the first three chapters goes public and finds a medium and genre. Systematically, students will explore the rhetorical stakes of writing for an instructor, small peer groups, larger units like an entire class, and still broader audiences outside the confines of the academic setting. The rest of Miles’ handbook has the look and feel of a comprehensive handbook, but with a few crucial differences. Parts 2 - 4 and Appendix A and B are consistently infused with the principles and habits of mind introduced in Part 1, with exercises designed to reinforce becoming a reflective practitioner, writing to think and learn, thinking through the disciplines, and joining the conversation. The handbook portion also maintains the personable voice of a writing guide established in Part 1, rather than taking on the dry, pedantic tone of a manual. Textboxes, graphics, web links to text, audio and video files, and samples of student work further enliven the handbook portion. Frequent cross-indexing and internal linking between Part 1 and the rest of the book strengthens The Flat World Knowledge Handbook for Writers dual function as a both a writing guide and a comprehensive handbook. We’ve rambled on enough about this handbook, it’s time for you to take a look.

40|$|American Government and Politics in the Information Age by Paletz, Owen, and Cook, is a {{comprehensive}} introduction to the vital subject of American government and politics. It is {{a comprehensive}} introduction to American politics and government; it covers all the basics. The text: • introduces {{the intricacies of the}} Constitution, the complexities of federalism, the meanings of civil liberties, and the conflicts over civil rights; •	explains how people are socialized to politics, acquire and express opinions, and participate in political life; • describes interest groups, political parties, and elections—the intermediaries that link people to government and politics; •	details the branches of government and how they operate; •	shows how policies are made and affect people’s lives. However, American Government and Politics in the Information Age goes beyond the basics of American politics and government to explain how and why, in this information age, government and politics are most commonly depicted in the media. Appreciating and learning these subjects can be a challenge. Inspired by students’ familiarity with mass media and their fluent use of new communication technologies, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, live streaming, and the Ipad, The authors have chosen an approach that connects our subject matter with these media and technologies. Many students acquire political information from the dramatic and dynamic news cycle with its twenty-four-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week coverage of events. More and more students obtain news online, including from the websites of mainstream news organizations such as the New York Times and CNN. But the web also provides them with information that repeats, amplifies, challenges, or even contradicts the news they get from the mainstream media. Many students connect with government and politics through media entertainment. They watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Colbert Report, and the late-night television talk shows of Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Conan O’Brien. They tune in to television and radio commentators such as Glenn Beck, Bill O’Reilly, Rachel Maddow, and Rush Limbaugh. They watch television competitions, reality shows, dramas, and comedies, most of which have political aspects. They may have seen one or more of Michael Moore’s polemical documentaries (e. g., Fahrenheit 9 / 11), or a movie about social issues, such as Crash. They may have listened to music with political messages, for example Lee Greenwood’s Proud to be an American and Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA. They may read the satirical newspaper The Onion. Although most political information still originates in the mainstream media—newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and movies—even these media are being transformed by new forms of communication. Information can now be transmitted much more quickly and subjected to far more individual control, initiative, and choice than ever before. Digital technologies support new media formats, such as weblogs, podcasts, and wikis, which blend interpersonal with mass communication, through e-mail and instant messaging. Yet, students are often unfamiliar with the origins of the media’s contents, especially the importance of ownership, profits, and professionalism. They may not fully grasp the influence on the media of outside forces, such as interest groups, political parties and candidates, and policymakers, most of whom are media savvy and use the new technologies to try to maximize their positive and minimize their negative coverage. Paletz, Owen, and Cook have, therefore, organized our text to connect students’ media-saturated daily lives to the world of politics and government. They want students to learn how the media interact with and depict the American political system; to recognize the similarities and differences between these media depictions and the real world of government and politics; and to understand the consequences these interactions and depictions can have for the public, politics, government, and public policies. They also want students to learn how the media, including new media, can help them intervene productively in politics and get things done. Each chapter contains a comparison of the reality of American government and politics with the media’s most common depictions (acknowledging that there are differences between and among the media and in their political content). The authors show that the depictions range from accurate and revealing to inaccurate and misleading, and distinguish the telling accounts and insights from partial truths, false impressions, and distortions. The online version of our text includes links to the media we discuss for the student to experience and react to first hand. The authors do not inflate the importance of the media. We recognize that much of politics and government occurs under the media’s radar screen and that the consequences of the media’s coverage vary widely. They avoid the temptation of “gee whiz” utopian celebrations of new technologies. Rather, the text offers discussions of both their possibilities, their limitations, and their dangers: they can and do lower the costs of political activity and organization but do not necessarily turn people into thoughtful, full-fledged activists. Finally, the text was written with recognition of the fact that people variously accept, ignore, reject, or rework the media’s contents. Above all, in today’s information age, they are able to hash and rehash the meaning and impact of what is covered and not covered in the media. As an example of how the authors integrate media influences into American Government and Politics in the Information Age, chapter 1 is devoted to detailing the system of communication, the organization of media, and the transmission of information in the United States. Then the authors integrate relevant mass media and new-media material throughout every chapter. Each chapter opens with an anecdote that ties media to the particular institution, process, or policy area under study. For example, Chapter 4 (Civil Liberties) starts by showing how the television “reality” show Cops depicts the police as working effectively to stop crime but downplays the civil liberties of individuals, including the rights of the accused. Each chapter presents the most common media depictions of its subject. In some chapters, a few depictions dominate: most news coverage portrays the US Supreme Court and its decisions as above politics (except when the president has nominated a new member); and the entertainment media depict the judicial system unrealistically. In other chapters, depictions are split. For example, in Chapter 4, students see that journalists’ diligent defense of the civil liberties that are central to their job does not carry through to their stories about crime or war. One of Paletz, Owen, and Cook’s goals in writing American Government and Politics in the Information Age is to encourage students to participate in civic life. In appropriate chapters, they add a “Civic Education” box showing how young people have become involved in politics, government, and the making of public policies, as well as how the media, old and new, can help and hinder civic work. The ultimate goal of this text is to help you teach your students so they will come to understand, appreciate, question, and criticize the realities of American politics and government and the media depictions of these realities, and possibly come to use the media to intervene effectively in the American political system on their own terms.
