Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. <b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration emphasized <b>the</b> use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. <b>In</b> 1983, <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration intervened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired <b>in</b> controversy. <b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, <b>in</b> particular <b>the</b> regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|R

25|$|Simon gained {{national}} prominence after criticizing President George H. W.

During a speech at Chicago's Taste of Polonia, Bush had aggressively promoted the success of his own presidency and his importance as Vice President <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration's role in Eastern Europe. This was an attempt by Bush to carry Chicago's Polish community in order to win Illinois during the election. Bush's claims were roundly denounced by Simon, and Bush eventually lost the state in the general election, possibly due to Simon' remarks. Simon did not seek reelection in 1996.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, a once U.S.-supportive {{leader who}} was later accused of spying for Fidel Castro and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, {{was one of}} the most {{recognizable}} names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well. Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.|$|E
25|$|Faith Ryan Whittlesey (born 1939) is {{a former}} Pennsylvania Republican {{politician}} and White House Senior Staff member notable for her effort to communicate Reagan's entire policy agenda to U.S. opinion leaders and for bringing {{together for the first}} time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> White House evangelical, Catholic, and other conservative religious groups who opposed legalized abortion and were concerned about moral and cultural decline and the break-up of the family. These groups became a significant component of the Reagan coalition as they grew more politically self-conscious in the 1980s. Whittlesey also organized the White House Central American Outreach Group at the direction of Chief of Staff James Baker to provide information about Reagan's anti-communist policies in the region and was an active supporter of Reagan's defense buildup and the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Whittlesey served twice for a total of nearly 5 years as U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and also served for 2 years on the Reagan White House Senior Staff as Assistant to the President for Public Liaison.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} police and security sector discussions, the U.S. was undertaking some independent training and equipment donations, though the programs—mainly organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—were not explicitly detailed to the international community. Lia writes that covert contacts and counter-terrorism collaboration between the PLO and the CIA had been ongoing in the 1970s and throughout the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s but were not favored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> and Bush administrations. After the Oslo accords, the Clinton Administration revived covert ties and intelligence training. In January 1994 media sources reported that PLO officials and bodyguards were traveling to the U.S. to receive training {{as a result of}} an agreement between Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Publicly, the U.S. was ambivalent regarding support for police and security sector activities. The Gaza–Jericho Agreement between the PLO and Israel signed on May 4, 1994 increased U.S. interest in coordinating public international efforts to fund the PLO police who were to deploy into Gaza and Jericho. The day after the treaty was signed, the U.S. announced a $5 million grant for the PLO police and they worked to encourage other nations to donate flexible funds for the same purpose.|$|E

The U.S. response included reducing economic assistance and pressuring Panama to reform its banking secrecy laws, crack down on narcotics trafficking, investigate the murder of Spadafora, and reduce the FDP's role in the government.|$|E
