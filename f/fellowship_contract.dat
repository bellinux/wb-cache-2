40|$|Several {{methods for}} characterizing DNA-protein {{interactions}} are available, but none have demonstrated both high throughput and quantitative measurement of affinity. Here we describe 'high-throughput sequencing'-'fluorescent ligand interaction profiling' (HiTS-FLIP), a technique for measuring quantitative protein-DNA binding affinity at unprecedented depth. In this approach, the optics {{built into a}} high-throughput sequencer are used to visualize in vitro binding of a protein to sequenced DNA in a flow cell. Application of HiTS-FLIP to the protein Gcn 4 (Gcn 4 p), the master regulator of the yeast amino acid starvation response, yielded [approx] 440 million binding measurements, enabling determination of dissociation constants for all 12 -mer sequences having submicromolar affinity. These data revealed a complex interdependency between motif positions, allowed improved discrimination of in vivo Gcn 4 p binding sites and regulatory targets relative to previous methods and showed that sets of genes with different promoter affinities to Gcn 4 p have distinct functions and expression kinetics. Broad application of this approach should increase understanding of the interactions that drive transcription. United States.

40|$|Deposition {{of bubbles}} {{on a wall}} {{withdrawn}} from a liquid bath is a phenomenon observed in many everyday situations—the foam lacing left behind in an emptied glass of beer, for instance. It is also of importance to the many industrial processes where uniformity of coating is desirable. We report work on an idealized version of this situation, the drag-out of a single bubble in Landau–Levich–Derjaguin flow. We find that a well-defined critical wall speed exists, separating the two regimes of bubble persistence at the meniscus and bubble deposition on the moving wall. Experiments show that this transition occurs at Ca[superscript ∗] ~ Bo[superscript 0. 73]. A similar result is obtained theoretically by balancing viscous stresses and gravity.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an operator}} {{depending on the}} “transverse velocity” r that describes the effect of hadron masses on the leading 1 /Q power correction to event-shape observables. Here, Q is {{the scale of the}} hard collision. This work builds on earlier studies of mass effects by Salam and Wicke [J. High Energy Phys. 2001 061 () ] and of operators by Lee and Sterman [Phys. Rev. D 75 014022 (2007) ]. Despite the fact that different event shapes have different hadron mass dependence, we provide a simple method to identify universality classes of event shapes whose power corrections depend on a common nonperturbative parameter. We also develop an operator basis to show that at a fixed value of Q, the power corrections for many classic observables can be determined by two independent nonperturbative matrix elements at the 10 % level. We compute the anomalous dimension of the transverse velocity operator, which is multiplicative in r and causes the power correction to exhibit nontrivial dependence on Q. The existence of universality classes and the relevance of anomalous dimensions are reproduced by the hadronization models in Pythia 8 and Herwig​+​+, though the two programs differ in the values of their low-energy matrix elements.

Equations for the second-order statistical moments are considered for both phases, continuous and dispersed, in {{the limit of}} high-inertia non-colliding particles. A simplified version of this model is used for studying axisymmetric particle-laden gas jets. Emphasis is made in the analysis of the dispersed phase equations only. The equations for radial and axial momentum and normal Reynolds stresses for the particulate phase are divided into their basic terms and analysed separately. The modelling of the corresponding shear stresses relies on a Boussinesq closure, consistent with the theoretical work of Reeks (Phys. Fluids A 5 (3) (1993) 750) and Zaichik (J. Appl. Math. Mech. 61 (1997) 127) {{in the limit of}} high-inertia particles. By this procedure a global picture of the momentum and fluctuating energy transfer in the flow is attained.

The partial differential equation (PDE) model treats simultaneous first-order generation due to chemical reaction and diffusion of reaction products in spherical geometry to capture the microsphere-size-dependent effects of autocatalysis on PLGA erosion that occurs when the microspheres are exposed to aqueous media such as biological fluids. The model is solved analytically for the concentration of the autocatalytic carboxylic acid end groups of the polymer chains that comprise the microspheres {{as a function of}} radial position and time. The analytical solution for the reaction and transport of the autocatalytic chemical species is useful for predicting the conditions under which drug release from PLGA microspheres transitions from diffusion-controlled to erosion-controlled release, for understanding the dynamic coupling between the PLGA degradation and erosion mechanisms, and for designing drug release particles. The model is the first to provide an analytical prediction for the dynamics and spatial heterogeneities of PLGA degradation and erosion within a spherical particle.

40|$|Mechanical {{degradation}} of lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes has been correlated with capacity fade and impedance growth over repeated charging and discharging. Knowledge {{of how the}} mechanical properties of materials used in LIBs are affected by electrochemical lithiation and delithiation could provide insight into design choices that mitigate mechanical damage and extend device lifetime. Here, we measured Young's modulus E, hardness H, and fracture toughness K[subscript Ic] via instrumented nanoindentation of the prototypical intercalation cathode, Li[subscript X]CoO[subscript 2], after varying durations of electrochemical charging. After a single charge cycle, E and H decreased by up to 60 %, while K[subscript Ic] decreased by up to 70 %. Microstructural characterization using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and further nanoindentation showed that this degradation in K[subscript Ic] was attributable to Li depletion at the material surface and was also correlated with extensive microfracture at grain boundaries. These results indicate that K[subscript Ic] reduction and irreversible microstructural damage occur during the first cycle of lithium deintercalation from polycrystalline aggregates of Li[subscript X]CoO[subscript 2], potentially facilitating further crack growth over repeated cycling. Such marked reduction in K[subscript Ic] over a single charge cycle also yields important implications {{for the design of}} electrochemical shock-resistant cathode materials. United States.

No differences in the absolute content of lipids or in the percentage of different lipid classes were observed between the eggs from the three groups. Both experimental groups fed with the artificial diets produced eggs of poor quality, with low percentages of buoyancy and hatching. Those observed in the eggs from the Control Group were significantly higher (p> 0. 01) than those of the experimental groups. The higher hatching rate of the eggs from the Control Group was associated with higher DHA:EPA and AA:EPA ratios.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{accuracy}} of the windowed multipole direct Doppler broadening method to that of the ENDF-B/VII. 1 libraries that come with MCNP 6. Various windowed multipole libraries were generated with different maximum allowed relative errors. Then, the libraries were compared to the MCNP 6 data via resonance integral and through single assembly Monte Carlo analysis. Since the windowed multipole uses resonance parameters, resonance integrals are only affected by the number of resonances included in the library and not by the order of the background fitting function. The relative performance of each library with varying maximum allowed error was evaluated. It was found that setting a maximum target relative error of 0. 1 % in the library provided highly accurate data that closely matches the MCNP 6 data for all temperatures of interest, while still having suitable computational performance. Additionally, a library with a maximum relative error of 1 % also provided reasonable accuracy on eigenvalue and reaction rates with a noticeable improvement on performance, but with a few statistically significant differences with the MCNP 6 data.

40|$|Cuttlebone exhibiting high {{compressive}} strength {{is a very}} interesting material from the biomimetic materials' technology point of view. Its microstructure and chemical composition were characterized by complementary analytical techniques. Structural features of the skeleton were revealed by SEM, micro-Raman, FT-IR and XRD measurements. XRD analyses showed that the only mineral phase present in the samples is aragonite. 2 D-maps obtained from micro-Raman analyses for peaks attributed to aragonite (1100  cm- 1) and chitin (1660  cm- 1) revealed that the septa are richer in chitin and pillars in aragonite. 2 D-distributions of elements detected by a electron microprobe showed that Ca-rich locations are poor in Mg, Na, and Br. Ca is mainly present at those locations where aragonite prevails. Bromine, sodium and magnesium are most likely located in the organic matrix. The average content of the elements, as determined by ICP-OES, was: Na - 1. 0 %, Mg - 0. 133 %, K - 0. 26 %, Fe - 0. 03 % and Sr - 0. 28 %. Using the elemental CHN analysis the following amounts of nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen were detected: 1. 42 %, 15. 36 % and 0. 68 %, respectively. The elemental analysis together with TGA measurements allowed evaluating the approximate concentration of organic matter in the cuttlebone at the level of 10 %.

40|$|Accepted in Astrophysics Journal Letters. Non edited. We {{report on}} the first far-IR {{detection}} of H 2 D+, using the Infrared Space Observatory, {{in the line of}} sight toward Sgr B 2 in the galactic center. The transition at λ= 126. 853 μm connecting the ground level of o-H 2 D+, 1 _ 1, 1 with the the 2 _ 1, 2 level at 113 K, is observed in absorption against the continuum emission of the cold dust of the source. The line is broad, with a total absorption covering 350 km s^- 1, i. e., similar to that observed in the fundamental transitions of H 2 O, OH and CH at 179, 119 and 149 μm respectively. For the physical conditions of the different absorbing clouds the H 2 D+ column density ranges from 2 to 5 x 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2, i. e., near an order of magnitude below the upper limits obtained from ground based submillimeter telescopes. The derived H 2 D+ abundance is of a few 10 ^- 10, which agrees with chemical models predictions for a gas at a kinetic temperature of 20 K.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} physical forcing on zooplankton biomass distribution in the Strait of Gibraltar {{as a function of}} tidal phase. A set of 5 Longhurst-Hardy-Plankton-Recorder (LHPR) casts were made along the main channel of the Strait during different phases of the tidal cycle to determine how the hydrological processes taking place in the strait (mainly internal wave generation) influenced the distribution and taxonomic composition of zooplankton biomass. A CTD coupled to the LHPR net allowed a detailed study of the hydrological patterns created by the generation and development of the internal waves. Plankton samples were analyzed using a semi-automatic method for zooplankton discrimination (plankton visual analyzer) which is able to differentiate each individual within a sample into specific taxonomic groups. The results show that the internal wave generation on the main channel of the strait induces divergent processes causing a reduction of the zooplankton biomass. Flow patterns within the internal waves lead to alternating bands of high and low zooplankton biomass with varying taxonomic composition. Changes in taxonomic composition appear {{to be the result of}} spatial differentiation between smaller (weak-swimming) and larger (strong-swimming) taxa. This work demonstrates the necessity to consider and understand physical processes when addressing biological patterns, especially in regions with intense hydrodynamic regimes.

From a global fit to the first thrust moment we extract the strong coupling and the leading power correction matrix element Ω[subscript 1]. We obtain α[subscript s](m[subscript Z]) = 0. 1140 ±(0. 0004) [subscript exp]±(0. 0013) [subscript hadr]±(0. 0007) [subscript pert], where the 1 -σ uncertainties are experimental, from hadronization (related to Ω[subscript 1]) and perturbative, respectively, and Ω[subscript 1]= 0. 377 ±(0. 044) exp±(0. 039) pert[*][*]GeV. The nth thrust cumulants for n≥ 2 are completely insensitive to Ω[subscript 1], and therefore a good instrument for extracting information on higher order power corrections, Ω[subscript [′ over n]/Q[superscript n], from moment data.

40|$|We {{present the}} first signature-based search for delayed photons using an {{exclusive}} photon plus missing transverse energy final state. Events are reconstructed in a data sample from the CDF II detector corresponding to 6. 3 fb- 1 of integrated luminosity from √s= 1. 96 TeV proton-antiproton collisions. Candidate events are selected if they contain a photon with an arrival {{time in the}} detector larger than expected from a promptly produced photon. The mean number of events from standard model sources predicted by the data-driven background model based on the photon timing distribution is 286 ± 24. A total of 322 events are observed. A p value of 12 % is obtained, showing consistency of the data with standard model predictions. © 2013 American Physical Society. This work {{was supported by the}} U. S.

The measurement uses proton-antiproton collision data at center-of-mass energy 1. 96 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8. 7 fb- 1 collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab during Run II of the Tevatron. We measure R to be 0. 87 ± 0. 07, and extract the magnitude of the top-bottom quark coupling to be |Vtb|= 0. 93 ± 0. 04, assuming three generations of quarks. Under these assumptions, a lower limit of |Vtb|> 0. 85 (0. 87) at 95 % (90 %) credibility level is set. © 2014 American Physical Society. This work was supported by the U. S.

40|$|This work {{shows the}} ability of two natural phenols, namely syringaldehyde and methyl syringate, to act as {{mediators}} of recombinant Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (MtL) in eucalypt-pulp delignification. After alkaline peroxide extraction, {{the properties of the}} enzymatically-treated pulps improved with respect to the control. Likewise, removal of the main lipophilic extractives present in eucalypt pulp, such as free and conjugated sterols, was observed after the above laccase-mediator treatments. In the same study, the doses of both MtL and methyl syringate were reduced, and results compatible with industrial implementation were obtained, taking also advantage from the high-yield production of the recombinant enzyme that enables its commercial availability.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of minor mergers, typically having mass ratios greater than 3 : 1, predict little enhancement {{in the global}} star formation activity. However, thesemodels also predict that the satellite galaxy is more susceptible {{to the effects of}} the interaction than the primary. We use optical integral field spectroscopy and deep optical imaging to study the NGC 7771 +NGC 7770 interacting system (~ 10 : 1 stellar mass ratio) to test these predictions. We find that the satellite galaxy NGC 7770 is currently experiencing a galaxy-wide starburst with most of the optical light being from young and post-starburst stellar populations (< 1 Gyr). This galaxy lies off the local star-forming sequence for composite galaxies with an enhanced integrated specific star formation rate. We also detect in the outskirts of NGC 7770 HÎ± emitting gas filaments. This gas appears to have been stripped from one of the two galaxies and is being excited by shocks. All these results are consistent with a minor-merger-induced episode(s) of star formation in NGC 7770 after the first close passage. Such effects are not observed on the primary galaxy NGC 7771. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.

40|$|This study aims to {{characterize}} the mannose receptor (MR) gene in sheep {{and its role in}} ovine visna/maedi virus (VMV) infection. The deduced amino acid sequence of ovine MR was compatible with a transmembrane protein having a cysteine-rich ricin-type amino-terminal region, a fibronectin type II repeat, eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD), a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail. The ovine and bovine MR sequences were closer to each other compared to human or swine MR. Concanavalin A (ConA) inhibited VMV productive infection, which was restored by mannan totally in ovine skin fibroblasts (OSF) and partially in blood monocyte-derived macrophages (BMDM), suggesting the involvement of mannosylated residues of the VMV ENV protein in the process. ConA impaired also syncytium formation in OSF transfected with an ENV-encoding pN 3 -plasmid. MR transcripts were found in two common SRLV targets, BMDM and synovial membrane (GSM) cells, but not in OSF. Viral infection of BMDM and especially GSM cells was inhibited by mannan, strongly suggesting that in these cells the MR is an important route of infection involving VMV Env mannosylated residues. Thus, at least three patterns of viral entry into SRLV-target cells can be proposed, involving mainly MR in GSM cells (target in SRLV-induced arthritis), MR in addition to an alternative route in BMDM (target in SRLV infections), and an alternative route excluding MR in OSF (target in cell culture). Different routes of SRLV infection may thus coexist related to the involvement of MR differential expression. This work was supported by project CICYT Nos.
