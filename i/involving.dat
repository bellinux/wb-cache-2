40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the anatomic pattern of disease spread at first disease relapse compared with baseline in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who were newly diagnosed as having DLBCL between January 2004 and June 2014 who initially achieved complete remission but who eventually developed relapsed disease during follow-up were retrospectively identified. Available histological and imaging data {{were used to determine}} which nodal regions and extranodal locations were <b>involved</b> at relapse. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with relapsed DLBCL were included, of whom 8 (38. 1 %) presented with disease relapse at previously <b>involved</b> sites only, 7 (33. 3 %) presented with disease relapse at both previously <b>involved</b> and new sites, and 6 (28. 6 %) presented with disease relapse at new sites only. A total of 57 nodal stations and 34 extranodal locations were <b>involved</b> in all 21 relapsed DLBCL patients. Of these 57 <b>involved</b> nodal regions, 47 (82. 5 %) were also <b>involved</b> at baseline, whereas 10 (17. 5 %) were not <b>involved</b> at baseline. Of the 34 <b>involved</b> extranodal locations, 17 (50. 0 %) were also <b>involved</b> at baseline, whereas 17 (50. 0 %) were not <b>involved</b> at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Relapsed DLBCL generally tends to affect previously <b>involved</b> sites, although close to one third of patients seem to have disease recurrence exclusively in previously uninvolved sites. The great majority of <b>involved</b> nodal stations at relapse are also <b>involved</b> at baseline, whereas only one half of <b>involved</b> extranodal locations at relapse are <b>involved</b> at baseline...|$|R
