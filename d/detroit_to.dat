5|$|When {{the first}} state {{highways}} were signed {{in the field in}} 1919, M-53 was one of them, running from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Elkton. In the 1920s, the highway was extended northward to connect with Port Austin. Later improvements through 1940 realigned a section of the roadway near Imlay City and completed paving. With planning and construction during the 1950s and 1960s, the state converted portions of the road north of <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> have divided highway and freeway segments. The freeway bypass of Romeo was started in the 1990s and finished to its current state in 2003.|$|E
5|$|After the 1954 New York State Thruway opened from Buffalo to New York City, Michigan {{officials}} encouraged Ontario {{to bypass}} Highway 3 {{as the most}} direct path from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Buffalo. By 1956, construction had begun on a segment between Highway4 in London and Highway2 in Woodstock, {{as well as on}} the section between Windsor and Tilbury.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1924, {{officials}} in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> run northwesterly {{across the state}} to Ludington, bisecting the angle created by Woodward and Grand River avenues. This roadway was named Northwestern Highway when {{it was built in}} 1929 to an endpoint at 14Mile Road. Further construction on Northwestern Highway was halted by the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{state highway}} map in 1933 showed a {{proposed}} southern extension from Clarkston through southern Oakland County, Wayne County into Monroe County. This proposed highway would have bypassed Metro <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> the west through Farmington, Northville, Plymouth and Belleville. The full highway was never built, and M-15 was never extended south of Clarkston, {{but part of}} this proposal was completed. Much of it later became Haggerty Highway, {{and part of the}} I-275 and M-5 corridors.|$|E

5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> the defense plants at Willow Run Airport. The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951, which {{proposed}} {{the construction of a}} toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. Interagency politics stalled progress on any proposed turnpikes while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{built the}} Willow Run Expressway to carry workers from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> the defense plants at Willow Run Airport. This {{expressway}} was numbered {{as a part}} of US112 initially. During the 1950s, additional highways were converted to freeways before the coming of the Interstate Highway System in 1957. The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was US24A in the southeastern corner of the state, which became part of Interstate 75 (I-75) in 1959.|$|E

5|$|M-53 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that connects <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> The Thumb region. The highway starts in Detroit at {{a connection with}} M-3 and ends in Port Austin, Michigan at M-25. In between, the trunkline passes through the northern suburbs of Metro Detroit, connects to freeways like Interstate69 (I-69) and provides access to rural farmland. In Macomb County, M-53 follows the Christopher Columbus Freeway, while {{the remainder of the}} highway is known as Van Dyke Avenue in the metro area or Van Dyke Road elsewhere. The highway has also been named the Earle Memorial Highway for one of the pioneers of the Good Roads Movement and Michigan's highway system.|$|E
5|$|Many former US Highways in Michigan {{have left}} an M-numbered highway {{with the same}} number as a relic of their existence. For example, M-27 runs along a portion of former US27. In addition, there are two occurrences of {{original}} M-numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations: all of M-16 became US16 and most of M-10 from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Saginaw was assumed into the route of US10 in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E
5|$|On October 2, Cleveland beat <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> clinch {{at least}} a tie, and Boston beat New York 5–1, ending the Yankees' pennant run and {{bringing}} the race down to two teams. On {{the last day of}} the season, October 3, Boston won their game and Cleveland lost, giving them identical 96–58 records and forcing a tiebreaker the following day at Boston. The Indians chose rookie Gene Bearden to start against Boston in the tie-breaker, despite only having one day of rest, as he had beaten the Red Sox twice that season, and the Red Sox chose Denny Galehouse, passing on Mel Parnell, who had beaten the Indians on three separate occasions that season.|$|E

5|$|The channel shared {{professional}} team coverage {{rights with}} some Detroit area broadcast television stations until {{the spring of}} 2008. In March 2008, the channel signed new long-term contracts with the Pistons, Red Wings and Tigers to broadcast more games than in previous years, becoming the exclusive local home of all three teams {{for the first time}} until at least 2018. This leaves only the NFL's Detroit Lions as the only local professional sports team in <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> have all of its games on broadcast television.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the highway system in Michigan {{dates back to the}} old Native American trails that crossed the state. These trails were {{pathways}} no wider than approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails, including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US24 from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Toledo, Ohio. This trail connected with Braddock's Road which led to the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a sizable}} Serbian American {{diaspora}} in the United States; in 2007 {{a total of}} 172,834 people of Serbian nationality or descent were recorded to be inhabiting the U.S. The first documented wave of Serbian immigrants to the United States was recorded in the 1970s when many Serbian factory workers emigrated to <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> manufacture automobiles for Ford. In 2011, Serbia was ranked second in the world (after Guinea Bissau) in human capital flight according to USAID. Brain drain to the United States and Canada has been cited as a chronic phenomenon in Serbia, especially from 1990 to 2000 during the decade of UN sanctions and war.|$|E

5|$|These roads proved {{inadequate}} {{to the needs}} of the military during the War of 1812. Territorial Governor Lewis Cass lobbied the federal government for road construction funding to bolster defensive needs as well as aid in settlement of the territory. Military roads debuted in 1816 with the construction of the Detroit–Fort Meigs Road to Toledo as a response to transportation needs. More roads were built with Congressional appropriations in the 1820s and 1830s connecting <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Port Huron, Saginaw, Grand Rapids and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{original}} {{sections of}} I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names. The westernmost {{of these is}} the Willow Run Expressway, named for the Willow Run complex. The plants at Willow Run produced B-24 Liberator bombers for Ford Motor Company during World War II. The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> the industrial plants at Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit–Chicago highway.|$|E
5|$|US Highway25 (US25) {{was a part}} of the United States Numbered Highway System in {{the state}} of Michigan that ran from the Ohio state line near Toledo and ended at the tip of The Thumb in Port Austin. The general routing of this state {{trunkline}} highway took it northeasterly from the state line through Monroe and <b>Detroit</b> <b>to</b> Port Huron. Along this southern half, it followed undivided highways and ran concurrently along two freeways, Interstate75 (I-75) and I-94. Near the foot of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, US25 turned north and northwesterly along the Lake Huron shoreline to Port Austin.|$|E
