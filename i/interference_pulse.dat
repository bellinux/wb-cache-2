40|$|ABSTRACT: Hydraulic <b>pulse</b> <b>interference</b> tests {{involve a}} cyclic {{injection}} of fluid into the source well, and by high precision {{measurement of the}} pressure pulse in a neighboring well, detailed hydraulic characterization between wells can be made. The <b>pulse</b> <b>interference</b> test is highly sensitive to hydrogeological properties between the pulse source and receiver wells. The transient nature of the test, involving the time delay and attenuation of the hydraulic pulse, enables the formation’s complete hydraulic properties to be computed. The advantages of the <b>pulse</b> <b>interference</b> test are the short duration of the test, the high resolution and directional characterization data obtained, {{and the lack of}} any generated contaminated groundwater. The hydraulic <b>pulse</b> <b>interference</b> test is ideal for characterizing a site for groundwater remediation systems such as iron permeable reactive barriers and accelerated bioremediation injection systems. The hydraulic conductivity of the site formation and the hydraulic connectivity between wells are of utmost importance when designing such systems. Hydraulic <b>pulse</b> <b>interference</b> tests are presented for two case histories; one involving a subsurface iron permeable reactive barrier in a sand and gravel deposit, and the second for a accelerated bioremediation injection system in a fractured basalt bedrock overlain by a sand, gravel and clay glacial deposit.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{research}} TOA based tracking and deinterleaving algorithms suited to radar emitters in an EW environment for application on the CSIR 5 th generation DRFM platform. The research problem statement stipulated that the only defining characteristic of the different emitters be the time of arrival (TOA) of their pulses. The pulse repetition interval (PRI) schemes considered in the study was constant, jittered, staggered and dwell and switch. The different TOA based deinterleaving algorithms investigated were sequence search (SS), TOA difference histogram, CDIF, SDIF, CDIF with SS (CDIF SS), SDIF with SS (SDIF SS) and interleaved pulse train spectrum estimation. The interleaved pulse train spectrum estimation algorithm results could not be replicated and were not included in simulations. The TOA based tracking algorithms that were also investigated were Delta-t histogram, Kalman filter, alpha-beta filter and alpha-beta-gamma filter. The alpha-beta-gamma filter became unstable during simulations and hence their results have also been excluded. The algorithms were simulated in MATLAB against EW environments with varied TOA measurement noise, number of emitters, PRI schemes and <b>interference</b> <b>pulses</b> (missing and spurious). General conclusions drawn from the deinterleaving simulations were the success of the algorithms decrease with the increase of emitters in the EW environment, <b>interference</b> <b>pulses</b> increased the success of some algorithms and the success of algorithms increased with TMNR (time measurement to noise ratio). General conclusions drawn from the tracking simulations were track loss of the algorithms decrease with increase in TMNR, tracking error decreases with increase in TMNR and <b>interference</b> <b>pulses</b> affected the initial estimates used to initialise the filters. The performance of the deinterleaving (CDIF & CDIF SS) and tracking (Delta-t histogram & alpha-beta filter) algorithms were compared on the DRFM platform. On the DRFM platform, the CDIF algorithm deinterleaved in fewer pulses but had more false detections as compared to the CDIF SS algorithm. The alpha-beta filter performed better with lower TMNR than the Delta-t histogram, on the DRFM platform. The CDIF SS algorithm and alpha-beta filter were chosen, based on their performance on the DRFM, to be implemented on a DRFM based system that would deinterleave and then track emitters in an EW environment. The system was successfully implemented and met all requirements that were placed on it. Possible improvements to the system and the future improvements to the research are also discussed...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a novel pulse {{interference}} filter for fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogation {{based on the}} tunable Fabry-Perot (F-P) filtering principle is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The self-developed FBG interrogation system is devised for the aircraft health management of key structures. Nevertheless, the pulse interference is detected in the reflection spectrum of FBG causing interrogation system unstable. To address the problem, the first-order lag pulse broadening filter is proposed in this paper. The first-order lag filter is applied to preprocess and smooth the original signal, meanwhile enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Afterwards, peaks of reflection spectrum are distinguished with pulse interference by pulse broadening. Experimental results indicate that 634 peaks are detected before adopting the first-order lag pulse broadening filter. Comparatively, the number of peaks decreases to 203 after filtering the <b>interference</b> <b>pulse,</b> and the correct rate of peak detection is higher than 98.5 %. Through the comparison with the finite impulse response (FIR) filter, the advantage of first-order lag filter is proved. The vibration monitoring experiment demonstrates that this system has high dynamic precision with a dynamic interrogation range of 0 Hz– 400 Hz, and the maximum repetition rate of 800 Hz.|$|E

30|$|High {{data rate}} pulsars in MPT {{telemetry}} not only create signals that propagate uphole, but also reverse direction, down-going signals that reflect at the drillbit which combine to create constructively or destructively interfering signals. Strong signal reflections are detected {{at the surface}} signal detectors caused by mud pumps, pulsation dampeners, drill string joints and diameter changes, dispersion and filtering of certain frequencies within mud channel (Brackel 2016; Brooks 2015). The ultimate signal that travels up the drillpipe depends on mud velocity, {{the position of the}} pulsar in the drill collar, operating frequency and the bottomhole assembly details forming the host waveguide. The superposition of the main wave from the transmitter and the multiple reflected waves generate either destructive interference or constructive <b>interference</b> <b>pulse</b> signals (Shi et al. 2004). Destructive interference signal can severely limit data rate and transmission distance while the constructive interference signal, if properly applied, can enhance LWD signal strength without the power penalties incurred by mechanical methods.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spatial overlap of nonclassical ultrashort light pulses produced by self-phase modulation effect in electronic Kerr media and its relevance {{in the formation}} of polarization-squeezed states of light. The light polarization is treated in terms of four quantum Stokes parameters whose spectra of quantum fluctuations are investigated. We show that the frequency at which the suppression of quantum fluctuations of Stokes parameters is the greatest can be controlled by adjusting the linear phase difference between pulses. By varying the intensity of one pulse one can suppress effectively the quantum fluctuations of Stokes parameters. We study the overlap of nonclassical pulses inside of an anisotropic electronic Kerr medium and we show that the cross-phase modulation effect can be employed to control the polarization-squeezed state of light. Moreover, we establish that the change of the intensity or of the nonlinear phase shift per photon for one pulse controls effectively the squeezing of Stokes parameters. The spatial overlap of a coherent pulse field with an <b>interference</b> <b>pulse</b> produced by mixing two quadrature-squeezed pulses on a beam splitter is analyzed.

40|$|Abstract—Beamforming methods rely on {{training}} data {{to estimate the}} covariance matrix of the <b>interference</b> <b>pulse</b> noise. Their convergence slows down if the signal of interest {{is present in the}} training data, thus requiring a large numbers of training snapshots to maintain good performance. In a distributed array, in which the array nodes are connected to a fusion center via a wireless link, the estimation of the covariance matrix would require the communication of large amounts of data, and thus would consume significant power. We propose an approach that enables good beamforming performance while requiring substantially fewer data to be transmitted to the fusion center. The main idea is {{based on the fact that}} when the number of signal and interference sources is much smaller than the number of array sensors, the training data matrix is low rank. Thus, based on matrix completion theory, under certain conditions, the training data matrix can be recovered from a subset of its elements, i. e., based on sub-Nyquist samples of the array sensors. Following the recovery of the training data matrix, and to cope with the errors introduced during the matrix completion process, we propose a robust optimization approach, which obtains the beamforming weight vector by optimizing the worst-case performance. Numeri-cal results show that combination of matrix completion and robust optimization is very successful in suppressing interference and achieving a near-optimal beamforming performance with only partial training data.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{evaluates the}} level of {{interference}} caused by different ultra-wideband (UWB) signals to other various radio systems, {{as well as the}} performance degradation of UWB systems in the presence of narrowband interference and pulsed jamming. The in-band interference caused by a selection of UWB signals is calculated at GSM 900, UMTS/wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA), and global position system (GPS) frequency bands {{as a function of the}} UWB pulsewidth. Several short-pulse waveforms, based on the Gaussian pulse, can be used to generate UWB transmission. The two UWB system concepts studied here are time hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum. Baseband binary pulse amplitude modulation is used as the data modulation scheme. Proper selection of pulse waveform and pulsewidth allows one to avoid some rejected frequency bands up to a certain limit. However, the pulse shape is also intertwined with the data rate demands. If short-pulses are used in UWB communication the high-pass filtered waveforms are preferred according to the results. The use of long pulses, however, favors the generic Gaussian waveform instead. An UWB system suffers most from narrowband systems if the narrowband interference and the nominal center frequency of the UWB signal overlap. This is proved by bit-error rate simulations in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with interference at global system for mobile communication (GSM) and UMTS/WCDMA frequencies.
