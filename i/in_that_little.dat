500|$|Few {{passengers}} {{at first}} {{were willing to}} board the lifeboats and the officers {{in charge of the}} evacuation found it difficult to persuade them. The millionaire John Jacob Astor declared: [...] "We are safer here than <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> boat." [...] Some passengers refused flatly to embark. J. Bruce Ismay, realising the urgency of the situation, roamed the starboard boat deck urging passengers and crew to board the boats. A trickle of women, couples and single men were persuaded to board starboard lifeboat No.7, which became the first lifeboat to be lowered.|$|E
2500|$|I {{must say}} when I bowled at Len I {{felt a sense}} of {{personal}} grudge I have never known against any other batsman. [...] Ray did too. I suppose Len suffered a greater barrage from the two of us than any other player in the world. We both put <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time... he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.|$|E
2500|$|Honeyman-Scott's role {{in shaping}} the Pretenders' sound {{primarily}} involved adding melodic lead lines to existing songs to help tie them together. He recalled in the early days, [...] "We did lots of rehearsing - seven days a week, {{all hours of the day}} and night. At first a lot of the licks were very heavy - like 'Up the Neck' started off as a reggae song. I said, 'Let's speed it up,' and put <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> guitar run. The melodic parts of the numbers really all started coming together by me putting in these little runs and licks. [...] And then Chrissie started to like pop music, and that's why she started writing things like 'Kid'".|$|E

40|$|I {{passed by}} a garden, a little dutch garden, Where useful and pretty things grew, Hearts’ ease tomatoes, And pinks and potatoes, And lilies and onions and rue. I saw <b>in</b> <b>that</b> garden, <b>that</b> <b>little</b> Dutch garden, A chubby {{old man with a}} spade And a rosy like a scow, And a flaxen hair’d little Dutch maid. There grew <b>in</b> <b>that</b> garden, <b>that</b> <b>little</b> Dutch garden, Blue flag flowers lovely and tall, And early blush roses, and little pink posies, But Gretchen was fairer than all. My hearts <b>in</b> <b>that</b> garden, <b>that</b> <b>little</b> dutch garden, It tumbled right in as I passed, ‘Mid wildering mazes of spinach and daisies, And Gretchen is holding it fast...|$|R

2500|$|Known on Michigan’s campus as “The Chief,” Revelli {{was known}} as a tough taskmaster. Revelli had a fierce {{dedication}} to excellence and drilled the desire for perfection into his band students. [...] One former band member recalled that the “sequence of our attitudes toward him often went from fear to anger to respect to awe to reverence.’” [...] Another recalled: “He was a tyrant who was feared by many, and an educator revered by all.” [...] One of his students from the 1940s recalled the same emotions but noted: “I learned more about music-making <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> class ... than I had learned in my prior 12 years of private lessons.” [...] It has been said that, if asked, “nearly every student who played under Revelli could vividly recount some memory of him; he left a lasting impression on everyone with whom he crossed paths.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Murdoch and Lowe {{were joined}} by Third Officer Pitman and the White Star Line's {{chairman}} J. Bruce Ismay to help them lower Boat 5, which left at 12:43a.m. The boat was loaded primarily with women and children. Most of those on deck were unaware {{of the seriousness of}} their situation and did not even attempt to board. John Jacob Astor, who was subsequently among the victims of the disaster, remarked: [...] "We are safer on board the ship than <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> boat." [...] J. Bruce Ismay, the chairman of the White Star Line, disagreed; still wearing slippers and pajamas, he urged Pitman to begin loading the boat with women and children. Pitman retorted: [...] "I await the Captain's orders," [...] and went to the captain for the approval. Ismay returned a short time later to urge a stewardess to board, which she did. In the end, only 36 people boarded, including Pitman himself, on Murdoch's orders.|$|E
2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe. They asked the man, [...] "What are you doing?" [...] He responded, [...] "Oh, you are my grandchildren. Oh this here, this is my food that I am going to feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
