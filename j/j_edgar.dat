Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E

5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.

When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E

5|$|FBI {{director}} <b>J.</b> <b>Edgar</b> Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment {{that led to the}} number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.|$|E
5|$|Post-production work on {{the episode}} was {{finished}} by May 1993, with {{the final version of}} the episode being assembled only three hours before its preview screening for the network's executives. Stock footage of the exterior of the <b>J.</b> <b>Edgar</b> Hoover Building was added to the episode, although later episodes would film new exterior shots using Simon Fraser University as a stand-in location. The climactic abduction scene featuring Billy Miles in a forest clearing featured a swirling vortex of leaves created using computer imagery by the series' visual designer Mat Beck; which Carter has described as being more complicated to achieve than the Normandy landings.|$|E

5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by <b>J.</b> <b>Edgar</b> Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E

5|$|After {{years as}} a {{struggling}} actress, Watts came to attention in David Lynch's psychological thriller Mulholland Drive (2001). The following year she enjoyed box-office success with her role as Rachel Keller in The Ring (2002), the remake of a successful Japanese horror film. She then received nominations at the Academy Awards and the Screen Actors' Guild Awards in the Best Actress categories for her portrayal of Cristina Peck in Alejandro González Iñárritu's neo-noir 21 Grams (2003). Her subsequent films include David O. Russell's comedy I Heart Huckabees (2004), the 2005 remake of King Kong, the crime-thriller Eastern Promises (2007) and the Tom Tykwer-directed thriller The International (2009).

5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and <b>J.</b> <b>Edgar</b> Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
