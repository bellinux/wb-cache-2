For {{mechanical}} Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate shutter speed dial sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (BL has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec, {{and ends with}} 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an 'A' setting for automatic exposure, controlled by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) <b>exposure</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} 20 {{years of his}} {{photography}} Weston determined all of his exposure settings by estimation based on his previous experiences and the relatively narrow tolerances of the film at that time. He said, [...] "I dislike to figure out time, and find my exposures more accurate when only [...] "felt"." [...] In the late 1930s he acquired a Weston <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> and continued {{to use it as}} an aid to determine exposures throughout his career. Photo historian Nancy Newhall wrote that [...] "Young photographers are confused and amazed when they behold him measuring with his meter every value in the sphere where he intends to work, from the sky to the ground under his feet. He is [...] "feeling the light" [...] and checking his own observations. After which he puts the meter away and does what he thinks. Often he adds up everything ‒ filters, extension, film, speed, and so on ‒ and doubles the computation." [...] Weston, Newhall noted, believed in [...] "massive exposure", which he then compensated for by hand-processing the film in a weak developer solution and individually inspecting each negative as it continued to develop to get the right balance of highlights and shadows.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, {{production}} of the Minox II began in 1948 at a new company, Minox GmbH, in Giessen/Heuchelheim near Wetzlar, West Germany. The new camera very much resembled the original, but was made with a plastic chassis covered by an aluminum shell. This greatly reduced its weight and, to an extent, cost. The camera continued {{to appeal to a}} luxury [...] "gadget" [...] market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s. It also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the Cold War. During this time, the Minox company continued to develop the camera, working with Gossen to develop a companion miniature <b>exposure</b> <b>meter,</b> as well as improved models such as the Minox B, which incorporated an even smaller Gossen-designed meter into the camera itself. The Minox B became the most popular and widely produced model of the line. Further developments included autoexposure, and the company developed an extensive line of accessories. These included flash guns, viewfinder attachments, tripod mounts, and copying stands, all increasing the camera utility in a variety of applications. One accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens (see illustration). Limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes, such as gold plating. Standard cameras were also available in an optional black anodized finish.|$|E

50|$|APEX made {{exposure}} computation {{a relatively}} simple matter; the foreword of ASA PH2.5-1960 recommended that <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> <b>exposure</b> calculators, and exposure tables be modified to incorporate the logarithmic values that APEX required. In many instances, this was done: the 1973 and 1986 ANSI exposure guides, ANSI PH2.7-1973 and ANSI PH2.7-1986, eliminated exposure calculator dials in favor of tabulated APEX values. However, the logarithmic markings for aperture and shutter speed required to set the computed exposure were never incorporated in consumer cameras. Accordingly, no reference to APEX was made in ANSI PH3.49-1971 (though it {{was included in the}} Appendix). The incorporation of <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> in many cameras in the late 1960s eliminated the need to compute exposure, so APEX saw little actual use.|$|R

30|$|Each {{exposure}} control algorithm starts with <b>exposure</b> <b>metering.</b> We will discuss three metering systems {{which are used}} depending on the application or camera type. In some cases, they can even be used simultaneously, or as a fall-back strategy if one metering system provides unreliable results.|$|R
50|$|The <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> uses a {{circular}} CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is to {{estimate}} the subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it {{has to make a}} number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is taken as the [...] "reference" [...] exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>metering</b> is through-the-lens (TTL) {{and thus}} {{accounts}} for the aperture set on the lens in use. (Unlike SLR lenses, where the diaphragm controlling lens aperture is generally closed only {{at the time of}} shutter release, rangefinder camera lenses close or open the diaphragm directly as the aperture control is applied).|$|R
50|$|Use of APEX {{required}} logarithmic {{markings on}} aperture and shutter controls, however, and these never were incorporated in consumer cameras. With {{the inclusion of}} built-in <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> in most cameras shortly after APEX was proposed, the {{need to use the}} exposure equation was eliminated, and APEX saw little actual use.|$|R
