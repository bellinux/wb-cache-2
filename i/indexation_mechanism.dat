30|$|The Belgian wage {{formation}} model, with a dominant sector-level and additional firm-level bargaining {{is quite common}} among European countries (see Du Caju et al. 2009). Moreover, even if the Belgian <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is particular, similar institutions are found in Spain, Luxembourg and Cyprus, and wages of close to one third of European workers are subject to a formal or informal <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> (see Du Caju et al. 2009; Babecký et al. 2010 and Druant et al. 2009).|$|E

40|$|International audienceSimilarity {{search in}} metric spaces refers to searching {{elements}} in data repositories {{that are similar}} to an element supplied by the user (query example). Similarity functions are used to determine which elements in the data repositories are similar to the query example and indexing mechanisms are used to improve the efficiency in the search. Classic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as LSH, M-Index, and M-Tree behave different according to the dimensionality in the metric space, volume of data repositories, and query strategies. In this paper, we describe SimSearch, a modular and flexible framework for similarity search in metric spaces, which allows to use, analyse, compare, and add several <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> search approaches, and query strategies. SimSearch allows doing queries given one or more example elements to obtain the set of elements more similar to the query examples, using query composition and Skyline. We show the variability of performance of several <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> including LSH-ML (our proposed variant of LSH), with experimental study in the domain of images represented by a feature vector in a high dimensionality metric space and Web Services represented by a vector with the values of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters...|$|R
40|$|Automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are often}} {{criticized for being}} a key source of inflexibility of actual real wages and thus {{responsible}} {{for a lack of}} adjustment to in the labour market and for a deterioration of cost-competiveness. The aim {{of this study is to}} empirically assess whether this point of view is well founded. Statistical The Statistical and econometric research relates to four countries: two with institutionalized indexation of wages to consumer prices (Luxembourg and Belgium) and two without institutionalized indexation (Germany and France). this comparative econometric study, applied to four countries with or without <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> shows that the presence of institutionalized indexation does not significantly alter the process through which hourly wages are set, by observingas revealed by the long-term relationships or dynamic reactions to an exogenous shock. In other words, whilst differences in wage flexibility exist, their causes may be found elsewhere and not necessarily in automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Beyond the perimeter of this study, factors for the adjustment or inflexibility of wages might rather be sought in other directions, such as wages upon recruitment, inter-sector flexibility, the variable portion of remuneration, or changes in the composition of the labour force by sector, for example...|$|R
30|$|All in all, access {{criteria}} {{are more often}} negatively adjusted {{than the other way}} round, especially if we focus on crisis measures. This (as well as the changes in gross benefits that skip indexation or adapt <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and equivalence scales) seems to be in line with the literature on retrenchment, that predicts that unpopular measures will generally be hidden behind rather technical measures, or distinguish between various small groups.|$|R
30|$|Even before 1993, {{when the}} <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> was in place, there was {{evidence}} {{of the existence of}} a compensating differential between the indexed and the non-indexed part of the wage (see Manacorda, 2004). For Scandinavian countries, Hibbs and Locking (1996) and Holden (1998) find that increases in nationally negotiated wage have little offsetting effect on wage drift.|$|E
30|$|In Bulgaria, {{a nominal}} {{standstill}} since January 2009 resulted in rather substantial real decreases of net income packages.

40|$|This study explores {{two aspects}} of Colombian chronic but {{moderate}} inflation experience during the period 1970 1990. Based on time series analysis, the study suggests that the policy to increase relative price of energy products be complemented with expenditure reducing mechanisms to avoid the validation of higher price pressures stemming from other sectors. Moreover, it recommends efforts to dismantle <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which {{make it difficult to}} reduce inflation. ...|$|R
30|$|Many of {{the nominal}} {{increases}} {{observed in the}} first crisis years translate in substantial real hikes in most countries. This is partially due to the lagged reaction of <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to in some cases quite substantial pre-crisis increases in consumer prices. Yet these automatic increases were further reinforced by additional increases of gross benefits in {{a substantial number of}} countries (see Table  2). Later on, the deceleration in nominal growth or the outright skipping of indexation led in some countries to a small loss in purchasing power. However, bar a few exceptions (most importantly Ireland and Portugal), this decrease does not appear exceptional when compared to pre-crisis trends.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{in this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the determinants of inflationary process in Turkish economy. For this purpose, based on some potential causes of inflation, an empirical model is contructed upon emphasizing the roles of various factors on inflationary process. The results obtained support the view of cost-push inflation led by exchange rate depreciations, wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> real interest structure and public sector pricing behaviour which is considered some part of wholesale prices, rather than the demand-pull monetary factors. Some other factors such as the course of real effective exchange rate have been found indicating a relieving effect on the cost pressure settled in domestic economy as well. Supporting these arguments, we find that the smaller the growth performance of the economy given the cost-pressure through exchange-rate pass-through effects, wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the real interest structure be imposed, the larger would be the inflation structure. These all might also be given as evidence to that the cost-push rather than demand-pull factors would affect the course of Turkish business cycles.

30|$|As {{stated in}} Sect. 2, {{collective}} agreements may {{last several years}} but include annual wage setting policies. Using firm-level data from the Wage Dynamics Network (wdn) Project, Babecký et al. (2010) report that firm-level indexation in Spain is widespread and often automatic (around 55  % of firms apply some automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the second largest share after Belgium). Likewise, using the same survey, Druant et al. (2012) document that 84  % of firms in Spain change wages only once a year (the second largest share among the 15 European countries examined).|$|E
30|$|This {{pattern is}} more {{pronounced}} for {{some aspects of}} social citizenship than for others and especially outspoken for changes to the standard rates of minimum income benefits (MIP in Fig.  4). Whereas declines in standard rates are virtually absent in 2008 and 2009, nine countries issue increases in 2009. To some extent, this is in countries where an adequate <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is lacking, but also other countries chose to increase gross benefits over and above indexation. Later on, these additional increases become rare. In addition, from 2010 onwards, more and more countries take measures that {{have a negative impact}} on minimum income benefits.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the shortcomings of}} the Real Plan combining political science and economics, considering evidences on difficulties in implementing a complete plan of deindexation, namely: the distributional conflict, the corporatist relations between the State and society and the bureaucratic isolation of a highly specialized technocracy. The announcement of the plan triggered defensive reactions, fueling distributive tensions during the URV period, forcing the economic team to take measures that contradicted the overall guidelines followed. The persistence of <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> indicate the resulting obstacles in seeking a reform of the State through a stabilization plan, even though the latter has the former as a precondition...|$|R
30|$|The {{long-term}} {{impact of these}} technical changes is hard to predict. For now, time series and standard simulations of changes in net disposable income packages show relatively modest impacts in the period 2009 – 2012. Yet some of the technical changes may carry the seeds for an incremental path departing process, such as new, less generous <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> or different equivalence scales. These changes may have far-reaching implications in the longer run, although their immediate impact is rather modest, {{not in the least}} because they may impact on the notion of what a social floor should actually entail. Nonetheless, in some countries, such as Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Romania, the combined effect of various retrenchment measures already now weighs heavily on minimum income beneficiaries.|$|R
40|$|High and {{persistent}} inflation {{has been one}} of the distinguishing macroeconomic characteristics of many developing countries - particularly in Latin America - since the end of World War II. Pazos (1972) coined the term "chronic inflation" to refer the this phenomenon. In his view, chronic inflation is quite a different creature from the much more spectacular hyperinflations studied by Cagan (1956). First, unlike hyperinflations whose duration is measured in terms of months, chronic inflation may last for decades. Second, countries learn how to live with high {{and persistent}} inflation by creating various <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which, in turn, tend to perpetuate the inflationary process. As a result, inflation does not have an inherent propensity to accelerate and, if it does, soon reaches a new plateau...|$|R
30|$|Wage {{bargaining}} in Slovenia in {{the private}} sector is highly structured and are negotiated at three levels 7. A general agreement at the national level determines the wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is binding for the entire private sector, while sectoral and enterprise-level agreements negotiate additional wage increases based on productivity growth, financial performance, and other considerations. Agreements at each of the lower levels normally improve on the provisions of the higher level agreements. However, the higher level agreements generally include escape clauses that allow enterprises in financial distress to defer specified wage increases under certain conditions.|$|E

40|$|This article uses Survey of Households' Income and Wealth {{microdata}} {{to investigate}} the role the Scala Mobile played in the initial fall and subsequent rise in earnings inequality in Italy between 1977 and 1993.

30|$|All in all, bar {{a number}} of {{important}} exceptions at either side of the spectrum, in the brunt of countries minimum income protection beneficiaries only experienced rather limited real decreases. This is partially because of the time frame, that does not include some of the expansionary measures introduced at the start of 2009 and only covers two and a half years, partly because some measures (e.g. changing <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in Germany and the United Kingdom, different calculation methods in Romania) will only reveal their full impact in the longer run, partly because changes were not quite that pronounced in {{a number of}} countries (at least not for these particular family types) and partly because the average obfuscates the impact of some policy changes on a limited number of family types.|$|R

30|$|Automatic {{indexation}} {{of wages}} to prices is {{a proxy for}} centralisation. This method has survived only in Belgium and Luxembourg. Clauses in collective agreements with automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> triggering wage rises have been abolished in the USA (around 1980), New Zealand and Australia (1980 s), Denmark (1983), the Netherlands (1983), Switzerland (1991), Italy (1992), and Sweden (1993). Against the specific recommendation under the EU’s new economic governance system, the Belgian government decided in 2012 to retain automatic wage indexation with some adjustments in the calculation. The latest central agreement for 2013 – 14 allows wages to rise {{only as much as}} the change in the cost-of-living index. In Luxembourg, which received a similar EU admonition, the government failed to gain union support for reform in 2010 and went ahead unilaterally with suspending indexation between 2012 and 2014.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{distributional}} {{effect of a}} wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> - the Scala Mobile (SM) - that heavily compressed the distribution of Italian wages during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The SM imposed large real wage increases {{at the bottom of}} the distribution and was essentially irrelevant for high-wage workers. We document that this mechanism triggered a strong redistribution within the firm. Skilled workers received lower wage adjustments when employed at firms with many unskilled workers and they tended to move towards more skill-intensive firms. We rationalize these findings with a simplified model of intra-firm bargaining with on-the- job search...|$|E
30|$|Some {{important}} institutional {{features of}} the labour market affect individual wages in Belgium, such as indexation and sector-level collective bargaining agreements, which can possibly be supplemented with agreements concluded at the firm level. These features explain why Belgium is characterised as a country with high real wage rigidity (see Dickens et al. 2007 b or Du Caju et al. 2012). We briefly describe these characteristics of the Belgian labour market. Firstly, as in several countries, a minimum wage is legally binding. Also, practically all employees’ gross wages are linked to a consumer price index through an automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> 2 This effectively limits the scope for real wage cuts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract 9 ̆ 7 The paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research on the design of stock option plans and the risk of expropriation of minority shareholders among Italian companies with concentrated ownership. In such a context, managers are more likely to extract rents through excess compensation and the design of SOPs could acerbate the so-called agency conflict type II (controlling shareholder versus minorities). We empirically assess whether the SOPs with certain characteristics (short vesting period, absence of lock-up period, lack of <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms)</b> are associated with the extraction of private benefits at the expense of minority shareholders. We find that the presence of a vesting period of more than three years significantly and positively affects the risk of expropriation.

40|$|This report {{explores the}} impact of the crisis on wage-setting {{mechanisms}} in the 28 EU Member States plus Norway. It also examines {{the impact of}} the EU’s new economic governance regime – specifically the requirements of the country-specific recommendations and Memoranda of Understanding – on wage-setting mechanisms. It looks at changes in wage bargaining levels, the extent of horizontal coordination across bargaining units, links between the different levels involved in wage-setting, minimum wage-setting and <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and the volume and duration of collective wage agreements. The report examines the factors influencing changes, chiefly economic and political ones, and addresses the role of different institutional actors in initiating and implementing changes, including the social partners, national governments and the European and international institutions.

40|$|Chile {{was among}} the first {{countries}} to adopt an inflation target. Its long inflation history had led to widespread backward-looking indexation in goods, labour, and financial markets as well as in policy instruments. While indexation exacerbates inflation inertia, this paper provides evidence that adoption of inflation targets by an autonomous Central Bank since 1990 has made possible a regime change reflected in gradual inflation convergence toward international levels. Assessing Chile’s targeting experience in an international context and analyzing the conduct of monetary policy in Chile provides the background for understanding its recent stabilization experience. A simple dynamic model illustrates the role and macro effects of inflation targeting in a highly indexed open economy. VAR estimations for inflation, inflation targets, and related macro variables support the notion that the introduction of forward-looking inflation targets has contributed to breaking inflation expectations, paving the way for Chile’s convergence to sustained lower inflation and reducing the influence of indexation albeit most <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are still in place. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is whether there was a textbook-like inflation-output {{tradeoff}} in post-WWII Italy. We estimate both standard and time-varying parameter models of the relationship between inflation and the level of real economic activity over the 1949 to 2010 period and find no evidence of a stable, significant and positive association between output and prices. We attribute this evidence primarily to a fiscally dominated monetary policy and a rigid <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> aimed at protecting wages from inflation. These two institutions contributed to the persistent inflation bias and macroeconomic instability that lasted almost until the entry of the country in the European Monetary Union...|$|E

We {{estimate}} a consensus {{model of the}} relationship between inflation and the level of economic activity over 1949 - 1998, finding no evidence of a significant and positive feedback from output to prices. We also estimate similar models for the UK and the US. We discuss the role of wage coordination and indexation mechanisms in generating what amounts to a significant departure of Italian data from what holds true for the US and UK. Likely, the rigid <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that aimed at protecting wages from inflation ended up contributing to the persistent inflation bias that Italy experienced almost until its entry into EMU. ...|$|E

I also use the abolition of a wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> (Scala Mobile) as an experiment to test the predictions of monopsony against other models. By comparing correlations of changes in relative employment and relative wages {{of men and women}} before and after the reform, I find that relative employment of men responded positively to the exogenous wage increase in the relative wage differential...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{makes an}} {{analysis}} of the major inflationary mechanisms that origins from factors inherent to Russia's new economic environment {{since the beginning of the}} reform program in January 1992. After some theoretical clarifications over the two different views of the inflationary dynamics, (i. e. the monetary and the fiscal view), an accurate picture of the inflationary structures of the industrial and the financial sector will be made. Then the various factors (other than the January's price liberalization) responsible for the persistence of the high level of inflation in the country will be systematically studied (i. e. firms' soft budget constraint, <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and inflation inertia process, dollarization and depreciation of the ruble, and the use of seigniorage by the government). An anti-inflationary program including an efficient bankruptcy law, a tax-payment and government-bond indexation, is proposed.

40|$|EIRO’s annual {{analysis}} of collectively agreed pay for 2012 finds that although average nominal agreed increases were slightly {{greater than in}} 2011 in many countries, the rise in prices diminished people’s purchasing power. In real terms, {{only a handful of}} countries had positive collective pay increases on average – and, if so, then very modest. In 2012, these were Sweden (+ 1. 7 %), Austria (+ 0. 8 %), Germany (+ 0. 6 %), France (+ 0. 4 %) and Belgium (+ 0. 4 %, already including indexation). In the case of Austria, this was a return to positive figures after two years of real decline on average. In countries where some form of pay <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are in place, the increases set via these mechanisms did – by and large (with the exception of Italy) – compensate for the rise in prices in 2012, while they had failed to do so in 2011.
