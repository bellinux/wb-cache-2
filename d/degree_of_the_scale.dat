25|$|In {{the key of}} C major {{the first}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> called the tonic, is the note C itself, so a C major chord, a triad built on the note C, may be called the one chord of that key and notated in Roman numerals as I. The same C major chord {{can be found in}} other scales: it forms chord III in the key of A minor (A–B–C) and chord IV in the key of G major (G–A–B–C). This {{numbering}} lets us see the job a chord is doing in the current key and tonality.|$|E
25|$|Thus, then, {{a typical}} phrase {{in the most}} {{familiar}} Gregorian mode, such as was daily in the ears of the Rhenish Jews, in secular {{as well as in}} ecclesiastical music, was centuries ago deemed suitable for the recitation of the Absolution of Vows, and to it was afterward prefixed an introductory intonation dependent on the taste and capacity of the officiant. Many times repeated, the figure of this central phrase was sometimes sung on a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> sometimes on a lower. Then these became associated; and so gradually the middle section of the melody developed into the modern forms.|$|E
25|$|The modal {{differences}} {{are not always}} so observable in the Sephardic or Southern tradition. Here {{the participation of the}} congregants has tended to a more general uniformity, and has largely reduced the intonation to a chant around the dominant, or fifth <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> {{as if it were a}} derivation from the Ashkenazic daily morning theme (see below), but ending with a descent to the major third, or, less often, to the tonic note. Even where the particular occasionsuch as a fastmight call for a change of tonality, the anticipation of the congregational response brings the close of the benediction back to the usual major third. But enough differences remain, especially in the Italian rendering, to show that the principle of parallel rendering with modal difference, fully apparent in their cantillation, underlies the prayer-intonations of the Sephardim also. This principle has marked effects in the Ashkenazic or Northern tradition, where it is as clear in the rendering of the prayers as in that of the Scriptural lessons, and is also apparent in the Ḳerobot.|$|E
5000|$|It will {{be noted}} that several chords could fulfill {{different}} functions depending on the context. In the simplified theory where the functions in major and minor are on <b>the</b> same <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> <b>the</b> possible functions <b>of</b> chords on <b>the</b> seven <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> could be summarized as follows: ...|$|R

25|$|Technical wizardry also {{prevails}} in compositions that illustrate Reicha's theoretical treatise Practische Beispiele (Practical Examples) of 1803, where {{techniques such as}} bitonality and polyrhythm are explored in extremely difficult sight-reading exercises. 36 fugues for piano, published in 1803, was conceived as an illustration of Reicha's neue Fugensystem, a new system for composing fugues. Reicha proposed that second entries of fugue subjects in major keys could occur in keys other than the standard dominant), to widen the possibilities for modulations and undermine the conservative tonal stability of the fugue. The fugues of the collection not only illustrate this point, but also employ a variety of extremely convoluted technical tricks such as polyrhythm (no. 30), combined (nos. 24, 28), asymmetrical (no. 20) and simply uncommon (no. 10 is in 12/4, no. 12 in 2/8) meters and time signatures, {{some of which are}} derived from folk music, an approach that directly anticipates that of later composers such as Béla Bartók. No. 13 is a modal fugue played on white keys only, in which cadences are possible on all but the 7th <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> without further alteration. Six fugues employ two subjects, one has three, and No. 15 six. In several of the fugues, Reicha established a link with the old tradition by using subjects by Haydn (no. 3), Bach (no. 5), Mozart (no. 7), Scarlatti (no. 9), Frescobaldi (no. 14) and Handel (no. 15). Many of the technical accomplishments are unique to fugue literature.|$|E
500|$|The musical shift {{occurs when}} the singer pronounces the words [...] "Core", during which, as {{described}} by Nikki Debben in her essay included in the Manual Edition of Biophilia, the [...] "modality switches from minor to major". The lecturer noted that [...] "the close, dark sound of the verse {{is partly due to}} the minor mode which has a flattened third degree, compared to the brighter sound of the chorus in the major mode which has the [...] "normal" [...] third degree of the chord". This part of the song uses a Plagal cadence, which involves a movement [...] "from a chord built on the fourth <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> to one built on the first degree of the scale". The chorus of the song features a vocal crescendo performed by the choir, which juxtaposes with breakcore-influenced beats, which display elements from dub. Chris Chafin of Capital compared the sound of the chorus to the work of The Chemical Brothers and stated that tracks like [...] "Crystalline" [...] and [...] "Mutual Core" [...] recall previous works from Björk's discography, especially Post (1995) and Homogenic (1997).|$|E

5000|$|The Neapolitan sixth is {{the first}} {{inversion}} of a major triad built on the flattened supertonic (second <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale)</b> - a Neapolitan sixth in C major, therefore, consists of the notes F, A and D.|$|E

25|$|In many styles, such as soleá or siguiriya, {{the melody}} tends to proceed in {{contiguous}} <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale.</b> Skips <b>of</b> {{a third or}} a fourth are rarer.

50|$|For example, G {{major and}} E minor {{both have a}} single sharp in their key {{signature}} at F; therefore, E minor is <b>the</b> relative minor <b>of</b> G major, and conversely G major is <b>the</b> relative major <b>of</b> E minor. <b>The</b> tonic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative minor is <b>the</b> sixth <b>scale</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major <b>scale,</b> while <b>the</b> tonic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative major is <b>the</b> third <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>scale.</b> <b>The</b> relative relationship may be visualized through <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> fifths.|$|R
50|$|The Sim Shalom maneuver, {{which is}} named after the Sim Shalom prayer, in which it often occurs, begins in Ahavah Rabbah, and modulates to the major key on the fourth <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale.</b> It also uses Ukrainian Dorian as a shift back to the {{original}} Ahavah Rabbah.|$|E
50|$|The Yishtabach {{maneuver}} {{moves from}} Magein Avot to Adonai Malach on the 4th <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale.</b> It then moves through Ukrainian Dorian {{and back to}} Magein Avot.

50|$|The {{alternative}} (and less common) {{version is}} the asymmetric Aeolian 4 scale, {{the only difference}} with the Hungarian minor scale being that the 7th <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> is not raised.

5000|$|Various popular idioms of {{the twentieth}} century break down the {{standardized}} chord progressions of the common-practice period. While these later styles incorporate many elements of the tonal vocabulary (such as major and minor chords), the function of these elements is not necessarily rooted to classical models of counterpoint and harmonic function. For example, in common-practice harmony, a major triad built on the fifth <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> (V) is unlikely to progress directly to a root position triad built on the fourth <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> (IV), but the reverse of this progression (IV-V) is quite common. By contrast, the V-IV progression is readily acceptable by many other standards; for example, this transition is essential to the [...] "shuffle" [...] blues progression's last line (V-IV-I-I), which has become the orthodox ending for blues progressions {{at the expense of the}} original last line (V-V-I-I) [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{augmented}} 2nd interval is found, {{as well as}} {{the raising}} of the fourth and seventh <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale.</b> It is often used for melodic expression.

50|$|The major scale or Ionian {{scale is}} one of the {{diatonic}} scales. It is made up of seven distinct notes, plus an eighth that duplicates the first an octave higher.
