2500|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} sold by Hydro-Québec to its {{grid-connected}} customers in Quebec and exported to neighboring markets came almost exclusively from renewable sources. Hydro (96.78%) {{is by far}} the largest source, followed by wind (2.16%) and biomass, biogas and waste (0.75%). The remainder came from nuclear (0.19%) and thermal (0.12%) generation. Emissions of carbon dioxide (1,130 tonnes/TWh), sulfur dioxide (4 tonnes/TWh) and nitrogen oxides (10 tonnes/TWh) were between 49 and 238 times lower than the industry average in northeastern North America. <b>Imported</b> <b>electricity</b> bought on the markets account for most [...] of these emissions.|$|E

50|$|In May 2011 NB Power {{announced}} that it was considering converting Coleson Cove to burn natural gas. The high price of fuel oil in recent years, coupled with the plant's still-high emissions, has meant that it has sat idle for much of the last decade as it has been cheaper for NB Power to purchase <b>imported</b> <b>electricity</b> to replace the generating capacity. The decline in natural gas prices in recent years, increased cost of the mid-life refurbishment of the nearby Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station, and the rising cost of replacement <b>imported</b> <b>electricity</b> has provided an economic case for converting Coleson Cove, however, the project must be approved by the Government of New Brunswick and undergo environmental study. Additionally, a natural gas pipeline to supply the plant must be constructed from either the Saint John Lateral of the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline or the Brunswick Pipeline.|$|E
50|$|Tehran has {{provided}} €50 million for laying of 170Km transmission {{line for the}} import of 1000MW of electricity from Iran in 2009.

The <b>imported</b> <b>electricity</b> is much cheaper than the electricity produced by the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) because Iran subsidises oil and gas which feed the power plants. Iran has also offered to construct a motorway between Iran and Pakistan connecting the two countries.|$|E

25|$|Annual {{wind power}} {{production}} is currently (2014) equal to about 39% of electricity consumed in Denmark. The proportion {{of this that}} is actually consumed in Denmark has been disputed, as the considerable hydropower resources of Norway (and to some extent, Sweden) is used as grid storage with low loss. Hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating power, saving water for later, and can export electricity to Denmark when wind power output drops. Short term, Denmark <b>imports</b> <b>electricity</b> from Norway during daytime and exports in nighttime. Long term, Denmark <b>imports</b> <b>electricity</b> in summer and exports in winter. Wind is higher in autumn and winter, when consumption is also high. This service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found {{around the world in}} pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants.|$|R

5000|$|Except for peat, {{which is}} {{variously}} classed {{as either a}} fossil fuel or a slow-renewable fuel, Finland imports all the fossil fuels used for electricity production. Coal and natural gas account {{for most of the}} production, with some oil generators acting mostly as reserve. The use of fossil fuels has fallen from highs over 30% in 2003-2004 to 20% or below in 2012-2014. This is largely a consequence of cheap <b>imported</b> <b>electricity,</b> although domestic renewables have also increased in their share of production.|$|E
50|$|The Gaza {{electricity}} {{crisis is}} a result of the tensions between Hamas, who rules the Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority/Fatah, who rules the West Bank over custom tax revenue, funding of the Gaza Strip, and political authority. Residents receive electricity for a few hours a day on a rolling blackout schedule. As a result of the crises the Gaza power plant has reduced and then ceased operations due to a lack of fuel, and the amount of <b>imported</b> <b>electricity</b> from Israel and Egypt has been reduced.|$|E
40|$|The decarbonised future European {{electricity}} {{system must}} remain secure: reliable electricity supply {{is a prerequisite}} for the functioning of modern society. Scenarios like Desertec, which partially rely on solar power imports from the Middle East and North Africa, may be attractive for decarbonisation, but raise concerns about terrorists interrupting supply by attacking the long, unprotected transmission lines in the Sahara. In this paper, I develop new methods and assess the European vulnerability to terrorist attacks in the Desertec scenario. I compare this to the vulnerability of today's system and a decarbonisation scenario in which Europe relies on gas <b>imports</b> for <b>electricity</b> generation. I show that the vulnerability of both gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>imports</b> is low, but <b>electricity</b> <b>imports</b> are more vulnerable than gas imports, due to their technical characteristics. Gas outages (and, potentially, resulting blackouts) are the very unlikely consequence even of very high-number attacks against the gas import system, whereas short blackouts are the potential consequence of a few attacks against the <b>import</b> <b>electricity</b> lines. As the impacts of all except extreme attacks are limited, terrorists cannot attack energy infrastructure and cause spectacular, fear-creating outages. Both gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>import</b> infrastructure are thus unattractive and unlikely terrorist targets...|$|R
