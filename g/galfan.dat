The microstructure {{and composition of}} the <b>Galfan</b> coatings, applied by the hot dip process, was performed using SEM and EDS technology to evaluate the coating thickness and its relationship with technological parameters.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the exposure to humidity and UV radiation (UVCON test) of an organic coating (lacquer) containing chromating reagents applied on galvanised steel, galvanneal and <b>galfan</b> substrates. An attempt is made to establish possible relationships between the degradation of the lacquered surface during its exposure and {{the presence or absence of}} alloying elements on the original zinc-based substrate. With the galvanised steel and <b>galfan</b> coatings, 60 days of exposure to the UVCON test are necessary for a slight reduction in the lacquer content to be observed. Removal of the lacquer leaves the Cr(III) formed on the surface of the zinc-based substrate exposed. With the <b>galfan</b> coating, the chromate layer grows on the initial aluminium oxide film. With the galvanneal coating, in contrast to the lacquered galvanised steel and <b>galfan,</b> 15 days are sufficient for detachment of the lacquer to be observed. Longer exposure times lead to an appreciable increase in the percentage of lacquer removed. Surprisingly, the chromate layer remains on the surface of the galvanneal coating, preventing its corrosion, even after 60 days of exposure. XPS data suggest the presence of Cr-O-C type bonds at the interface, due to the oxidation of the lacquer surface associated with the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which contribute significantly to the increase in lacquer adhesion. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} corrosion of line hot dip ZnMgAl coating was investigated at low and ambient concentration of CO 2 {{as a function}} surface chloride concentration and temperature and compared to conventional hot dip galvanised (GI) and <b>Galfan</b> coatings. The corrosion of zinc coatings was enhanced in low CO 2 conditions and ZnMgAl material was more affected than GI, and {{in the range of}} the <b>Galfan</b> coating. An obvious pH effect was underlined in low CO 2 conditions. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) and simonkolleite were mainly formed on ZnMgAl coating in the absence of CO 2 while hydroxycarbonate and simonkolleite were dominating in ambient air.

40|$|AbstractGalfan {{coatings}} {{on steel}} in laboratory exposures with predeposited NaCl and cyclic wet/dry conditions exhibit {{nearly the same}} corrosion products as after 5 years of marine exposure. A general scenario for corrosion product evolution on <b>Galfan</b> in chloride-rich atmospheres is proposed. It includes the initial formation of ZnO, ZnAl 2 O 4 and Al 2 O 3 and subsequent formation of Zn 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 ⋅ 4 H 2 O, and Zn 2 Al(OH) 6 Cl⋅ 2 H 2 O and/or Zn 5 Cl 2 (OH) 8 ⋅H 2 O. An important phase is Zn 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3 ⋅ 4 H 2 O, which largely governs the reduced long-term zinc runoff from <b>Galfan.</b> A clear influence of microstructure could be observed on corrosion initiation in the slightly zinc-richer η-Zn phase adjacent to the β-Al phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{rare earth metal}} (Ce, Er, Y) {{additions}} on the corrosion behaviour of Zn- 5 Al <b>Galfan</b> alloy has been investigated. The corrosion resistance of Zn- 5 Al- 1 Ce, Zn- 5 Al- 1 Er and Zn- 5 Al- 1 Y alloys has been assessed by various electrochemical tests, such as corrosion potential measurements, polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. They have been performed in a 0. 1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution, at approximately neutral pH, without stirring and {{in contact with the}} air. For comparison, the electrochemical tests have also been carried out on the Zn- 5 Al alloy. Moreover, the surface morphology and nature of the corrosion products have been investigated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{rare earth metal}} (Gd, Dy, Er, and Y) small {{additions}} on the corrosion behaviour of Zn- 5 % Al (<b>Galfan)</b> alloy has been investigated. The corrosion resistance of Zn- 5 Al- 0. 1 Gd, Zn- 5 Al- 0. 1 Dy, Zn- 5 Al- 0. 1 Er, and Zn- 5 Al- 0. 1 Y alloys has been assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements carried out in a 0. 1 M NaCl solution, at approximately neutral pH, without stirring and {{in contact with the}} air. For comparison, the electrochemical tests have also been carried out on the <b>Galfan</b> alloy. EIS results showed that rare earths' addition significantly improves the corrosion behaviour of Gal- fan. This improvement is most likely due to enhanced barrier properties of the corrosion products layer and additional active corrosion protection originated from the inhibiting action of the lanthanide ions entrapped as oxides/hydroxides in this surface laye...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy {{hot dip coating}} of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in <b>Galfan</b> ® process technology. Applications to hot dip bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating of iron and steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. Hot dip practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of hot dip) processes precede the coating step. Moreover, hot dip coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating. Although traditional galvanized coatings with small (0. 1 %) aluminum compositions are the most popular, the most rapidly growing hot dip coating is made with the <b>Galfan</b> ® process, wherein a Zn- 5 % Al coating is applied by hot dipping (all composition data in this paper are in % by weight). This paper reviews this process and presents a model for management of the aluminum content in the hot dip <b>Galfan</b> ® bath...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{tests of}} 316 L and two {{intermetallic}} compounds Fe 3 AI and FeCrSi in industrial Galvanizing (Zn- 0. 18 Al), <b>GALFAN</b> (Zn- 5 AI), GALVALUME (Zn- 55 AI), and Aluminizing (AI- 8 Si) baths and lab-scale static baths were conducted. In on-line tests in industrial hot-dip baths, 316 L steel shows better corrosion resistance than Fe 3 AI in Galvanizing, <b>GALFAN,</b> and GALVALUME baths. The corrosion resistance of 316 L and Fe 3 AI {{is similar in}} Aluminizing bath. In static tests, FeCrSi shows the ' best corrosion resistance in pure Zn, Zn- 55 AI ~ and AI- 8 Si baths. The corrosion resistance of 316 L is better than that of Fe 3 Al. In Zn- 5 AI bath, 316 L shows no thickness loss after the test. For the same bath composition, the corrosion rates of the alloys in industrial baths are higher than those in static baths. Bath temperature and chemical composition play important roles in corrosion and intermetallic layer formation. Increasing bath temperature accelerates the corrosion process and changes the nature of intermetallic layers. A small amount of aluminum reduces the corrosion process by reducing the activity of Zn and forming inhibition layer. However, after aluminum content reaches the critical point, the dominant corrosion process changes from Zn-Fe reaction to AI-Fe reaction, and, consequently, the corrosion process accelerates by increasing aluminum content in the bath.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{offered by}} the EIS technique for studying the progress of corrosion in several types of galvanised coatings were investigated. Corrosion tests were performed in a 3 wt. % NaCl aqueous solution, at approximately neutral pH, without stirring and {{in contact with the}} air. A tendency was seen towards an electrochemical overestimation of the corrosion values of essentially pure zinc and Zn- 5 %Al (<b>Galfan)</b> coatings compared with the gravimetric reference values. In contrast, the opposite tendence was revealed with the Zn- 10 %Fe (Galvanneal) coating. These deviations have made it necessary to use empirical values of the constant B of the Stern-Geary equation. The approximately linear progress of the attack with immersion time suggests a slight barrier effect of the corrosion products layer. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} problem {{associated}} with water availability and its mapping is due to the need to solve urgent water {{problems of the}} Russian regions for their sustainable development.  At the same time, sustainability is understood as rational use of water resources and their conservation to maintain the ecological balance of territories, and water security of regions is evaluated from the standpoint of water supply to municipalities.  The shortage of water resources in Russia is perceived skeptically since our country is rich in water resources and the scarcity of fresh water threatens {{only a small part}} of its territory. However, the experts consider [Danilov-Danilyan, <b>Galfan,</b> 2015] that such a myopic point of view can lead in the long term to emergencies. The potential danger and risk of water use are already typical for the areas, which experience water stress. These are the territories with extremely low water availability per capita, less than 1. 0 - 2. 0 thousand m 3 /person/year [Shiklomanov, 2000; Danilov-Danilyan, Losev, 2006].  Geoinformation-cartographic modeling allows to differentiate the area under study according to water resource potential, to identify municipalities with low water availability and to estimate the population living in the area of potential danger and risk of water use. </p...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) is used {{to analyse}} variations during exposure to humidity and UV radiation (UVCON test) in the chemical composition of the outer surface of organic coatings (lacquers) containing phosphating or chromating reagents applied on galvanised steel, galvanneal and <b>galfan</b> substrates. By means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements the protective character of the coatings analysed by XPS is studied and an attempt is made to establish possible relationships between the chemical composition of {{the surface of the}} lacquered substrates after exposure to the UVCON test and their electrochemical characterisation in immersion in a 3 % NaCl solution. In general, the formation of defects or the loss of adhesion of the lacquer film leads to a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance values and, at the same time, an increase in interfacial capacitance values. The special behaviour of the galfan/lacquer >with chromating reagents> system is associated with the presence of a thin insulating film of chromium and aluminium oxides {{at the base of the}} pores in the lacquer. Interfacial capacitance values tend to evolve in close correspondence with the content of some elements on the surface of the materials. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

As there is a method for coating known as <b>Galfan</b> is available, in which combination of 95 %zinc and 5 % Aluminium is used for protecting steel from corrosion. As there are not much details available about why this composition is used Zinc- 5 %Al, we are interested in study of effects of different composition of Aluminum with Zinc, so we study the effect by adding different composition 2. 5 %, 4. 5 %, 6. 5 %, 8. 5 % & 11. 5 % Aluminum in Zinc, for this study we are using hot dip galvanizing process for studying this coating. Hot-dip galvanizing is widely used to improve the corrosion resistance of steel. To obtain high-quality coatings, some alloy elements are added to the zinc bath.

40|$|The fencing of land {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the input cost for farmers in South Africa and approximately 240, 000 tons of wire is purchased annually. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} the consumer to ensure they obtain the most durable wire for the application they intend. The effect of environmental conditions on the longevity of wire is a factor that should be borne in mind. In order to advise especially the farming community on the suitability of wire fencing in different climatological areas, the Agricultural Engineering Institute of South Africa (AEI) initiated a long-term atmospheric exposure programme during December 1990. The project objective was to determine the environmental corrosion effect on five different wire types that were available at the time, at six different localities in South Africa. The wire types used comprised steel wire that was light galvanized, heavy galvanized, 95 %/ 5 % zinc/aluminium coated and aluminium coated. A locally produced rust resistant steel wire, with nominally 11 % chromium was also included. This report compares the performance of wires after an eleven-year period. Wire coating thickness and in the case of the rust resisting steel, tensile strength, were compared to 1990 initial measurements. These results are reported in this paper. The marine site was significantly more corrosive on galvanized wire coatings than inland sites. The <b>Galfan</b> coating was deemed the optimum coating...|$|E
