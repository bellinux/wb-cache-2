40|$|Anticipated handovers {{that use}} Link Going Down (LGD) and Link Down (LD) trigger events require the network {{operator}} {{to set the}} LGD trigger high enough that the handover completes before the LD trigger event. &nbsp; However, setting the LGD trigger too high can result in frequent handovers by mobile nodes, leading to high signaling overhead. We propose a mechanism for balancing these requirements using a risk function. The function expresses the risk {{with respect to the}} probability that the LD event falls within a range of times with respect to <b>handover</b> <b>completion.</b> &nbsp; The risk function can be used with weights that allow the network operator to set the relative importance of the early <b>handover</b> <b>completion</b> requirement and the requirement that the LGD trigger not be too sensitive. Because the risk is expressed using the characteristic function of the handover time, we can easily use it to set the LGD trigger for any mobility management protocol...|$|E
40|$|So far, {{research}} on Smart Cities and self-organizing networking techniques for 5 G cellular systems has been one-sided: a Smart City relies on 5 G to support massive M 2 M communications, {{but the actual}} network is unaware of the information flowing through it. However, a greater synergy between the two would make the relationship mutual, since the insights provided by the massive amount of data gathered by sensors can be exploited to improve the communication performance. In this work, we concentrate on self-organization techniques to improve handover efficiency using vehicular traffic data gathered in London. Our algorithms exploit mobility patterns between cell coverage areas and road traffic congestion levels to optimize the handover bias in HetNets and dynamically manage mme loads to reduce <b>handover</b> <b>completion</b> tim...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out in the {{framework}} of the Whyless. com project, which aims at providing wireless communications, by exploiting the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, and relying on IP as network layer protocol. Our aim is to analyze the behavior of the Mobile IP protocol in micro-pico cellular wireless networks, where handover events are frequent. We decompose the delay introduced by handover procedures into Movement Detection Delay and <b>Handover</b> <b>Completion</b> Delay. While the latter can be effectively reduced by adopting Micro-mobility frameworks and Smooth Handover strategies, the former is still a challenging issue for developers. We primarily focus on Movement Detection (MD) methods and propose a new effective and flexible algorithms that we call Enhanced Lazy Cell Switching (ELCS). We deeply analyze their performance, putting in evidence that our solution exhibits a better behavior...|$|E

INTRODUCTION: Interrumption that occur during nursing practice are hazardous for patient safety, resulting in a heavy cognitive load for the health care professionals and {{increases the risk of}} making mistakes. METHODS: An observational study was carried out in UU. OO operation of Neurosurgery and Vascular Surgery at a hospital in Liguria. The observation lasted one months, from July 1 st, 2012 to August 1 st, 2012. For data collection were used three form, one for each work shift, in which each health care professional had to report what activity was interrupted and why. RESULTS: A total of 7744 interruptium (in 5676 in Neurosurgery and 2068 Vascular Surgery). The major source of interruption was the bell, followed by the phone and relatives' questions. In general, activities interrupted were mainly made beds / hygiene care, administration and preparation of medication, <b>handover</b> and <b>completion</b> of the nursing documentationCONCLUSIONS: Interrumption will be an inevitable part of nursing practice, because of its very nature. It is therefore necessary to intervene on interruptions deemed avoidable and organizational variables that generate them, in order to increase patient safety and improve care activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{aviation}} {{community is}} currently working on the standardization of data communication systems for the future air traffic management. In this context, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has initiated a work on standardization of an IPv 6 -based aeronautical telecommunications network and on future radio access technologies, respectively. In this paper, we integrate L-Band Digital Aeronautical Communications System Option 1 (L-DACS 1), which is one candidate for future radio access technologies, with realistic IPv 6 -based network layer functionality and analyze the effect of handover delay to the TCP performance. Realistic Frame Error Rate (FER) values obtained from an L-DACS 1 physical layer simulator, which uses a realistic aeronautical channel model, are used in the simulation experiments. In the first stage, we decreased layer 3 handover latency by removing the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure for address configuration. In the second stage, we introduced a Home Agent (HA) -buffering method, which is used to buffer the traffic (destined to the mobile node) during <b>handover.</b> Transmission <b>completion</b> time is the primary performance metric in our analysis. With the HA-buffering method, the transmission completion time is reduced by at least 10 % for the transmission of 110 kB of information over a wireless link with 31. 5 kbit s− 1 data rate...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether implementation of a new nursing handover model led to improved completion of nursing care activities and documentation. A pre- and post-implementation study, using a survey and document audit, was conducted in a hospital ED in Melbourne. A convenience sample of nurses completed the survey at baseline (n = 67) and post-intervention (n = 59), and the audit was completed at both time points. Results showed significant improvements in several processes: handover in front of the patient (P < 0. 001), patients contributed and/or listened to handover discussions (P < 0. 001), and provision of adequate information about all patients in the department (P < 0. 001). Nurses also reported a reduction in omission of vital signs (P = 0. 022) during handover. Three hundred sixty-eight medical records were audited in the two study periods: 173 (pre-intervention) and 195 (post-intervention). Statistically significant improvements in the completion of two nursing care tasks and three documentation items were identified. The findings suggest that implementation of a new <b>handover</b> model improved <b>completion</b> of nursing care activities and documentation, and transfer of important information to nurses on oncoming shifts...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the IST project Moby Dick an IPv 6 -based, mobility-enabled and security aware architecture, including Quality of Service mechanism, is defined and implemented. This paper, based on results originated in the mobility evaluation of the project, analyses in detail the effects of Fast Handovers on the performance of TCP connections and real-time UDP data streams. Based on our optimised Linux kernel implementation, we present quantitative results on the benefits of the Fast Handover support for Mobile IPv 6 i) in an integrated architecture comprising end-to-end Quality of Service and appropriate AAA mechanisms and ii) independent of the deployed access technology. The analysis for Wireless LAN (i. e., IEEE 802. 11 b) intra-technology handover shows handover interruption times below 1 ms and interruptionless Ethernet to/from Wireless LAN inter-technology handover. Finally, our results show the impact of the delay introduced by Quality of Service and AAA on the overall <b>handover</b> <b>completion</b> time...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{handover}} protocols for Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) and Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) define mobility {{management procedures}} that support unicast communication at reduced handover latency. Fast handover base operations do not affect multicast communication and, hence, do not accelerate handover management for native multicast listeners. Many multicast applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, comprise delay-sensitive, real-time traffic and {{will benefit from}} fast <b>handover</b> <b>completion.</b> This document specifies extension of the Mobile IPv 6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv 6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PFMIPv 6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in fast handover operations. This multicast support is provided first at the control plane by management of rapid context transfer between access routers and second at the data plane by optional fast traffic forwarding that may include buffering. An FMIPv 6 access router indicates support for multicast using an updated Proxy Router Advertisements message format...|$|E
30|$|At this point, the MMT {{has enough}} {{information}} about the surrounding networks {{to decide on the}} network to which it will hand over. Once the MMT has decided the target network to hand over, it delivers a handover commit command to the MIHF (message 7 – 10), which will be used for resource reservation in the target network before switching from the serving network to the target network (L 2 and L 3 handover). After completion of resource reservation in the target network, the MMT starts to establish the connection in the target network. Once the connection is established, a higher-layer handover procedure can start. In this case Mobile IP has been selected, although any other mobility management protocol would be equally suited. When the handover is completed at the higher layers, the MMT sends an MIH_HO_Complete message to the MIHF, which will inform the target PoS that it is now the new serving PoS. At this point the target PoS informs all the involved network elements of the handover finalization (message 11 – 14). Specifically, the target PoS has to inform the serving PoS of the <b>handover</b> <b>completion</b> so that it can release any resources.|$|E
40|$|Many {{public sector}} {{construction}} {{projects in the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are marred by communication and coordination problems, with owners having to pay {{a high price for}} schedule delays and cost overruns. The process by which building information is conveyed to owners lacks standardisation, a holistic approach, and consistency. This often results in KSA public sector owners receiving building information in a variety of formats, resulting in buildings operating at sub-optimal levels and relevant building data being unavailable at required times to support decision-making and optimal operations and maintenance. Existing systems of data management within KSA public sector projects cannot match the demand of operations and maintenance, as buildings are becoming more complex, in terms of space management, energy demand management, and addressing environmental concerns, due to the functional requirements of modern infrastructure. This research focuses on investigating key technology and processrelated challenges in order to ensure smoother transition of information from project design and construction to maintenance and operation phases of a building’s lifecycle. This research aims to develop a framework to enhance data management in building handover practices of public sector construction projects in the KSA. This framework helps improve the operation and maintenance of buildings by establishing a relationship between the project design and construction team, and the operations and project maintenance team. The research identifies key data requirements for effective building handover from a Saudi client perspective. In order to achieve the research aim, an empirically based systems analysis of a singledetailed case study organization of Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Regional Municipality in KSA was carried out. Substantial fieldwork was undertaken using both qualitative and quantitative methods to match specific research questions. The questionnaire survey provides a wider view of building handover practices in the KSA, while the qualitative study provided an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art in practice. Many tools were used to collect the data, including semi-structured interviews supplemented by survey questionnaires together with documentation review. The implementation of more than one method to collect the data was used in order to achieve data triangulation, to explore implementation of data management in building handover practices, and to provide a more an in-depth understanding. The finding of this research concludes some unique factors that affect the implementation of actual building handover practices within the public sector construction industry in KSA. These factors include: high manager turnover; lack of knowledge and experience; lack of use of technology; lack of training; lack of communication during project data at the Handover Stage; unclear responsibilities. However, the finding indicates that it is important for all managers in public sector construction to understand that the handover is started already {{at the beginning of the}} project. Furthermore, early handovers must be reviewed and strengthened during the final project handover. Also, the research findings confirmed that the lack of communication was possibly because of the fact that the project team is big and multi-cultural. Thus, the individuals were afraid to ask any questions as they assumed others would think that they were too inexperienced to understand some technical specifications. Hence, it is highly critical to define and use a clear communication procedure. Every manager is responsible for communicating internally and externally about status and issues. These findings will strengthen the existing literature on effective data <b>handover</b> at project <b>completion</b> stage and will narrow the gap in knowledge in KSA studies in particular and to Arab studies in general. Therefore, significant recommendations to the policy, practitioners, and researchers, within both the public and private sector projects, are made to aid and improve construction industry practices. This research provides specific original findings, which include an in depth understanding of factors that affect the facilitation of data management in building handover practices of construction projects in the KSA via a case study conducted within the KSA public sector construction context. This research is the first study in KSA regarding issues that affect data management in building handover practices of construction projects in the KSA. It is also the first academic study of the Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Regional Municipality in KSA...|$|R
40|$|Host {{mobility}} protocols such as Locator-Identifier Separation Protocol Mobile Node (LISP-MN) {{are known}} to experience packet loss {{at the point of}} handover. For the duration of the handover, packets sent to the MN via the old access link are dropped by the router since it has no way of knowing where the device has moved to. This affects the performance of transport layer protocols of the TCP/IP stack, which results in degradation of network performance. Buffering these packets close to the MN's new location and forwarding them to the MN on <b>handover</b> <b>completion</b> is one way of improving the overall performance of the mobility protocol. Hence, we introduce a novel network node, loc-server, to buffer these packets in order to mitigate the packet loss and reduce the service disruption time (SDT) experienced by MNs during handovers. Using a laboratory testbed implementation, LISP-MN with loc-server support shows significant reduction in packet loss and reduced SDT in comparison to vanilla LISP-MN. Similarly, performance analysis of DASH video player also shows the new architecture helps in improving the average video quality downloaded by the MN and reduces the player's instability...|$|E
40|$|In {{wireless}} {{and mobile}} networks, handover {{is a complex}} process that involves multiple layers of protocol and security executions. With {{the growing popularity of}} real time communication services such as Voice of IP, a great challenge faced by handover nowadays comes from the impact of security implementations that can cause performance degradation especially for mobile devices with limited resources. Given the existing networks with heterogeneous wireless access technologies, one essential research question that needs be addressed is how to achieve a balance between security and performance during the handover. The variations of security policy and agreement among different services and network vendors make the topic challenging even more, due to the involvement of commercial and social factors. In order to understand the problems and challenges in this field, we study the properties of handover as well as state of the art security schemes to assist handover in wireless IP networks. Based on our analysis, we define a two-phase model to identify the key procedures of handover security in wireless and mobile networks. Through the model we analyze the performance impact from existing security schemes in terms of <b>handover</b> <b>completion</b> time, throughput, and Quality of Services (QoS). As our endeavor of seeking a balance between handover security and performance, we propose the local administrative domain as a security enhanced localized domain to promote the handover performance. To evaluate the performance improvement in local administrative domain, we implement the security protocols adopted by our proposal in the ns- 2 simulation environment and analyze the measurement results based on our simulation test...|$|E
