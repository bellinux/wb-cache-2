The <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> versus the laser intensity, measured over three decades of the <b>extracted</b> <b>charge,</b> which represents a significant extension of the previous experiments, gives us the opportunity to test the so-called thermally assisted non-linear photoemission model. The present results show non-linear photoemission behavior that can be explained, as expected, by a thermally assisted 3 -photon emission. However a pure 4 -photon emission could not be discarded. To take aim at clarifying this question the related non-linear coefficients are calculated and a scaling law for the probability of different multiphoton orders is proposed...|$|E

In detail, we used pin-structures with active layers containing a bulk heterojunction of Zincphthalocyanine (ZnPc) and C 60. Extended lifetime measurements under constant monochromatic or white illumination at defined temperatures of 50 °C or 90 °C are done. On the one hand, we {{show that the}} number of <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> carriers is important to determine the degree of degradation. On the other hand, our results show that the energy of irradiated photons is significant for accelerated measurements. This is an major advantage for the realisation of accelerated lifetime measurements. Additionally, we find that not single charge carriers, but excitons cause the degradation of the observed solar cells. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The charge carriers are photogenerated by a strongly absorbed, 3 ns laser flash, and extracted by {{the application of}} a reverse bias voltage pulse after an adjustable delay time (tdel). It is found that the mobility of the <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> carriers decreases with increasing delay time, especially shortly after photoexcitation. The time-dependent mobility μ(t) is attributed to the energy relaxation of the charge carriers towards the tail states of the density of states distribution. A model based on a dispersive bimolecular recombination is formulated, which properly describes the concentration decay of the <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> carriers at all measured temperatures and concentrations. The calculated bimolecular recombination coefficient β(t) is also found to be time-dependent exhibiting a power law dependence as β(t) =β 0 t−(1 −γ) with increasing slope (1 −γ) with decreasing temperatures. The temperature dependence study reveals that both the {{mobility and}} recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers are thermally activated processes with activation energy in the range of 0. 1 eV. Finally, the direct comparison of μ(t) and β(t) shows that the recombination of the long-lived charge carriers is controlled by diffusion...|$|E

For bottom gate transistors, the devices using silicon nitride as gate insulator show the lowest off-current for a given induced charge and the steepest subthreshold slope. The charge carrier mobility of around 3 x 10 - 3 cm 2 /Vs and an Ion/Ioff ratio of around 105 are almost independent of the insulator material. In a double gated thin film transistor using low stress silicon nitride as top gate insulator, transistor parameters are extracted for the identical semiconducting layer when the bottom gate is used and when the top gate is used, respectively.

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{photocurrent}} {{losses in the}} power-generating regime of organic solar cells (OSCs) remains a controversial topic, although recent literature suggests that the competition between bimolecular recombination and charge extraction determines the bias dependence of the photocurrent. Here the steady-state recombination dynamics is studied in bulk-heterojunction OSCs with different hole mobilities from short-circuit to maximum power point. It is shown that in this regime, in contrast to previous transient <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> and absorption spectroscopy studies, first-order recombination outweighs bimolecular recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. This study demonstrates that the first-order losses increase with decreasing slower carrier mobility, and attributes them to either mobilization of charges trapped at the donor:acceptor interface through the Poole–Frenkel effect, and/or recombination of photogenerated and injected charges. The dependence of both first-order and higher-order losses on the slower carrier mobility explains why the field dependence of OSC efficiencies has historically been attributed to charge-extraction losses...|$|E

By observing the dependence of the form factor ratio as a function of Q 2 over 0. 05 – 0. 09 GeV 2, the dependence of the radii extraction on the shape of the form factors is minimized.

The measured charge carrier lifetime increases by up to a factor of three at sufficiently high applied biases (up to 8 V), suggesting significant errors in CE measurements without applied bias.

Here, oxygen-induced degradation of archetypal perovskite solar cells under operation is observed, even in dry conditions. With prolonged aging, this process ultimately drives decomposition of the perovskite.

In the zero-bias limit Cooper pairs, each with twice the electron charge, carry the Josephson current. An applied bias V_SD leads to multiple Andreev reflections (MAR), which {{in the limit of}} weak tunneling probability should lead to integer multiples of the electron charge ne traversing the junction, with n integer larger than 2 Δ/eV_SD and Δ the superconducting order parameter. Exceptionally, just above the gap, eV_SD> 2 Δ, with Andreev reflections suppressed, one would expect the current to be carried by partitioned quasiparticles; each with energy dependent charge, being a superposition of an electron and a hole. Employing shot noise measurements in an SIS junction induced in an InAs nanowire (with noise proportional to the partitioned charge), we first observed quantization of the partitioned charge q=e^*/e=n, with n= 1 - 4; thus reaffirming the validity of our charge interpretation.

We observed {{a difference in the}} initially <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> carrier concentration in the photo-CELIV experiment by one order of magnitude, which we assigned to an enhanced geminate recombination due to a fine interpenetrating network with isolated phase regions in the 1 : 1 pBTCT-C 12 :PC 61 BM bulk heterojunction solar cells. In contrast, extensive phase segregation in 1 : 4 blend devices leads to an efficient polaron generation resulting in an increased short circuit current density of the solar cell. For both studied ratios a bimolecular recombination of polarons was found using the complementary experiments. The charge carrier decay order of above two for temperatures below 300 K can be explained by a release of trapped charges. This mechanism leads to a delayed bimolecular recombination processes.

40|$|Successful {{operation}} of the APS storage ring (SR) in top-off mode requires a reliable injector system that efficiently delivers up to 10 nC of charge at 7 GeV to the SR. One way to possibly improve injector reliability is to inject the linac beam directly into the booster and bypass the PAR. Direct injection into the booster imposes several requirements on the booster rf system. First, the rf must capture the complete linac beam {{or at least a}} large fraction of it. Second, bunch purity must be preserved. Third, the whole acceleration process from injection to extraction at 7 GeV must be as efficient (as measured by particle loss) as possible at up to 10 nC of <b>extracted</b> <b>charge.</b> Finally, the rf system parameters should be chosen to preserve the present linear ramp profile used in the booster (0. 325 to 7 GeV in 223 ms).

This photodegradation study has been performed on encapsulated photovoltaic blend devices comprised of the silole-based donor-acceptor polymer KP 115 blended with [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Photodegradation induces an almost 20 % decrease in power conversion efficiency, primarily {{as a result of a}} reduction in short circuit current, JSC. The initial burn-in phase of the photodegradation has been examined using a combination of transient absorption spectroscopy and charge extraction measurements, including photo-CELIV (charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage) and time-resolved charge extraction using a nanosecond switch. These measurements reveal a bimodal KP 115 polaron population, comprised of both delocalised and localised/trapped charge carriers. The photodegradation results are consistent with an alteration of this bimodal KP 115 polaron population, with the polarons becoming trapped in a broader, deeper density of localised states. Under laser illumination and at open circuit conditions, this enhanced trapping after light soaking inhibits charges from undergoing bimolecular recombination, leading to higher <b>extracted</b> <b>charge</b> densities at long times.
