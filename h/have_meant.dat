5|$|Despite American {{hunger for}} land, the {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory did not actually want to remove the Sioux from the territory. Federal subsidies to the tribes were heavily siphoned by the U.S. settlements and removal of the tribes from the territory would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> loss of this income.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton had Top Secret {{access to}} Strategic Air Command {{operations}} {{and was an}} expert in surface-to-air missile countermeasures.

5|$|The {{area and}} the {{surrounding}} chase were subject to forest law, as a Royal forest. In the early period, this would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> harsh punishments for residents that poached livestock or encroached on other Royal entitlements. By Tudor times, royal lands had become used as commons and forest law had fallen into disuse.|$|E
5|$|Then in August 2009, {{speculation}} mounted {{that the}} UK would drop the F-35B for the F-35C model, which would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> the carriers being built to operate conventional {{take off and}} landing aircraft using the US-designed Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults.|$|E
5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known of}} which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
50|$|This {{remoteness}} {{and the few}} visitors <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> that Chizarira <b>has</b> experienced {{increased risk}} from poachers in recent years.

The Dukes of Gloucester and Kent had both inherited their titles from their fathers, the first dukes.|$|E
5|$|Peter Padfield's Hess, Hitler and Churchill (2013) {{explores the}} mystery of Hess's flight to Britain.

5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery.

5|$|Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) was an eleventh-century {{ruler of}} the Kingdom of Dublin and perhaps the Kingdom of the Isles. He {{was the son of}} a man named Aralt, and appears to have been a {{grandson}} of Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin. Such a relationship would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that Ímar was a member of the Uí Ímair, and that he was a nephew of Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of Dublin, a man driven from Dublin by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill in 1036.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, there has been {{increasing}} talk of "networking. " This word <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> two quite different things in library usage.

Second, it <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> distribution through telecommunications of information services. The latter sense is the more recent, but the older sense is the more important because the telecommunications systems now emerging promise to allow a new age of library cooperation. Before describing this new promise, I would like to present my reasons for believing the fulfillment of the promise to be nearly ineluctable. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E
5|$|At the time, HBO {{made their}} {{commitments}} {{for only one}} year at a time, a third season would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> opening up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including {{the introduction of new}} storylines for current and new characters, and further clarification and elaboration on the show's mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E
5|$|Between 1111 and 1117 {{the ancient}} clas church was granted by Gilbert fitz Richard to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester (a Benedictine house), as a cell or priory of St Peter's Abbey. This may <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> the {{construction}} of a stone church, perhaps the first on the site; a new tower and porch were built. It is not clear whether the Celtic monks and priests (married and single) were expelled, or whether they were joined by brethren of a new sort. A few years later, in 1141, Ewenny Priory, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was founded as a priory of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. As with Llanbadarn, there was a pre-existing church, in this case definitely one in stone, and probably dating from the 1120s, as it was consecrated 1126 by Bishop Urban of Llandaff.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, {{because he could not}} count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> weakening of the power and the prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
