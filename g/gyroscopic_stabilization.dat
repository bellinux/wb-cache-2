40|$|Long period sawteeth {{have been}} {{observed}} to result in low-β triggering of neo-classical tearing modes, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Consequently, a detailed physical understanding of sawtooth behaviour is critical, especially for ITER where fusion-born α particles are {{likely to lead to}} very long sawtooth periods. Many techniques have been developed to control, and in particular to destabilize the sawteeth. The application of counter-current neutral beam injection (NBI) in JET has resulted in shorter sawtooth periods than in Ohmic plasmas. This result has been explained because, firstly, the counter-passing fast ions give a destabilizing contribution to the n = 1 internal kink mode—which is accepted to be related to sawtooth oscillations—and secondly, the flow shear strongly influences the stabilizing trapped particles. A similar experimental result has been observed in counter-NBI heated plasmas in MAST. However, the strong toroidal flows in spherical tokamaks mean that the sawtooth behaviour is determined by the <b>gyroscopic</b> flow <b>stabilization</b> of the kink mode rather than kinetic effects. In NBI heated plasmas in smaller conventional aspect-ratio tokamaks, such as TEXTOR, the flow and kinetic effects compete to give different sawtooth behaviour. Other techniques applied to destabilize sawteeth are the application of electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) or ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH). In JET, it has been observed that localized ICRH is able to destabilize sawteeth which were otherwise stabilized by a co-existing population of energetic trapped ions in the core. This is explained through the dual rôle of the ICRH in reducing the critical magnetic shear required to trigger a sawtooth crash, and the increase in the local magnetic shear which results from driving current near the q = 1 rational surface. Sawtooth control in ITER could be provided by a combination of ECCD and co-passing off-axis negative-NBI fast ions...|$|R

5000|$|An earlier {{stabilization}} {{technology was}} <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The World War I transport USS Henderson, completed in 1917, {{was the first}} large ship with gyro stabilizers (right). It had two 25 ton, 9 ft diameter flywheels mounted {{near the center of}} the ship, spun at 1100 RPM by 75 HP AC motors. The gyroscopes' cases were mounted on vertical bearings. When a small sensor gyroscope on the bridge sensed a roll, a servomotor would rotate the gyros about a vertical axis in a direction so their precession would counteract the roll. In tests this system was able to reduce roll to 3 degrees in the roughest seas. The ship Conte di Savoia, which first sailed in November 1932, had three flywheels which were 13 feet in diameter and weighed 108 tons. Gyroscope stabilization was replaced by fin stabilization due to its lower weight and bulk.|$|E
5000|$|The Brenneke slug was {{developed}} by the German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke (1865-1951) in 1898. The original Brenneke slug is a solid lead slug with ribs cast onto the outside, much like a rifled Foster slug. There is a plastic, felt or cellulose fiber wad attached to the base that remains attached after firing. This wad serves both as a gas seal and as a form of drag stabilization. The [...] "ribs" [...] impart a small amount of rotation to the projectile as it travels down the bore. This rotation does not impart <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stabilization,</b> rather it improves accuracy by correcting for manufacturing irregularities. [...] Additionally, the ribs decrease contact surface with the bore, reducing friction and increasing velocity. The ribs also deform through the choke more readily than a solid slug would, thus reducing pressure and wear on the choke to safe levels.|$|E
5000|$|Most Foster slugs {{also have}} [...] "rifling", which {{consists}} of ribs {{on the outside of}} the slug. Like the Brenneke, these ribs impart a rotation on the slug to correct for manufacturing irregularities, thus improving precision (i.e., group size.) [...] Unlike traditional rifling, the rotation of the slug imparts no significant <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The ribs also minimize the friction on both the barrel and projectile and allow the slug to be swaged down safely when fired through a choke, although accuracy will suffer and choke wear may be progressively accelerated when fired through any gauge choked tighter than about improved cylinder. Foster slugs can safely be swaged down much more than Brenneke slugs, when fired through a choke, being hollow. The amount of wear on a choke is therefore much less of a problem than when shooting Brenneke slugs. It is also safe to fire Foster slugs through rifled slug barrels.|$|E

The detector is housed inside an instrument package cooled at the temperature of liquid helium. This package is first spun about a horizontal axis at a frequency of typically 1 Hz, for providing <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stabilization</b> and modulating the gravity signal, and then released inside the falling capsule.

40|$|The {{development}} of a very stable and lightweight planetary entry probe termed SCRAMP (Slotted Compression RAM Probe) is described. The probe geometry is comprised of a sphere-cylinder forebody with a larger diameter flare-skirt aft-body which produces most of the drag (Figure 1). The geometry permits a large static margin due to {{the separation of the}} payload/forebody and relatively lightweight aft-body. The CFD and initial ballistic range tests are presented. In addition, several sub-orbital test flights were conducted using the sounding rocket-based SOAREX (Sub-orbital Aerodynamic Re-entry Experiments) test flight series. The dynamic stability was demonstrated from the very quick recovery of the design flight attitude from a tumble induced from the exo-atmospheric deployment (Figure 2). For certain future planetary missions such as network and companion missions, this new probe configuration may be particularly attractive.

40|$|<b>Gyroscopic</b> <b>stabilization</b> {{can be used}} to {{maintain}} an otherwise unstable body in an upright position. Devices equipped with gyroscopes can balance upon a small area or point without falling over when the gyroscopic stabilizing force is greater than a rotational force or moment from an out-of-balance load that causes the device to tip. A new concept for a gyroscopically stabilized platform has been proposed {{in the form of a}} schematic diagram. The proposed system comprises of four interconnected gyroscopes that react to the tipping of an inherently unstable external body. The purpose of this research is to evolve a design for, and establish the feasibility of building the proposed stable platform using available materials and technology. If feasible, the gyroscopically stabilized platform will be made at the most practical and economic size. Louis Brennan developed a 37 tonne monorail that was maintained in the upright position with two 3 tonne counter rotating gyroscopes. The Brennan monorail is analysed to better understand the behaviour of a similar coupled <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>stabilization</b> system. The reactions between the components that maintain the monorail in the stable position are studied and comparisons are made between the proposed stable platform and the Brennan system. A mathematical analysis of the proposed system is presented. The equations of motion for the system are derived using the Lagrangian Formalism. The characteristic equation of the system is then determined and from this a set of stability conditions imposed on the design of the physical parameters of the stable platform. The general solutions to the equations of motion are then derived. Expressions that model the behaviour of two of the variables that describe the motion of the stable platform are determined. A systematic approach is adopted for establishing a new concept for the proposed system. Testing of the initial stable platform prototype (Prototype A) showed the system did not behave as intended. The platform was optimised further and this resulted in a second prototype, Prototype B. Prototype B exhibiting the desired oscillatory motion about the vertical of the platform. Predictions made using the mathematical model are compared with empirical results. The mathematical model was found to be an accurate method for predicting the response of the stable platform...|$|E
