40|$|In a first paper (part I), {{prechamber}} ignition in cogeneration {{natural gas}} engines {{has been shown}} to significantly intensify and accelerate the combustion process, offering a further potential to reduce the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> while keeping efficiency at a high level. This second part discusses the influence of the engine operating parameters (spark timing and load) and the turbocharger characteristics with the objective of evaluating the potential to reduce the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions,</b> particularity the CO emissions, below the Swiss limits (NOx and CO emissions: 250 and 650 mg/m 3 N, 5 % O 2, respectively), without <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> after treatment. The advantage of using an unscavenged prechamber is conditioned by a significant delay of the spark timing in order to generate substantial gas jets. This results in a large decrease in peak cylinder pressure and in an important reduction of NOx, CO and THC emissions. Minimum emissions are achieved at a spark timing of about 8 °CABTDC. In comparison with the direct ignition, the prechamber ignition yields approximately 40 % and 55 % less CO and THC emissions, respectively. However, this also leads to about 2 %-point lower fuel conversion efficiency. The optimisation of the turbocharger results in a recovery of about 1 %-point in fuel conversion efficiency, but a consequent change in the <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>gas</b> dynamics attenuates the reduction in THC emissions. At the rated power output (150 kW), the prechamber ignition operation fulfils the Swiss requirements for <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and still achieves a fuel conversion efficiency higher than 36. 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} is the {{automated}} computation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> from timerelated measuring data sets. For the determination of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> in real world conditions, the test vehicle was equipped with a new On Board Measurement (OBM) system. The raw data provided by the OBM must be post processed to describe the vehicle performance. It is required to find out faulty data sets, to correct them, then to calculate necessary variables and to draw diagrams. In order to decrease the required time, all of these procedures have been automated. The data sets coming from the OBM system and the experimental data achieved during the driving tests are used to compute <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions,</b> the driving resistance, characteristic engine curves, fuel consumption et. All of these computations were automated using a website script interface in Matlab Simulink.

It is important to visualize gained information with diagrams, for this reason the procedures to obtain necessary diagrams were also automated. It can be concluded that the use of automated functions enables a more efficient study of the vehicle performance from real-world data. The real-world measurements of an Opel Zafira 1. 6 CNG ECOTEC with manual gearbox were used as a sample to calculate the engine characteristic maps.
