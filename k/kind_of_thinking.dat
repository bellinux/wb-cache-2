But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing koina is an active thinking process in the rational {{part of the human}} soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this sensus communis, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.|$|E

It has also been suggested that it was the original Buddhist thought that was being preached by Ashoka as Dhamma and later on certain theological additions were made to Buddhism. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> is based on some Buddhist chronicles. It is believed that the Kalinga war was a dramatic turning point where out of remorse for the death and destruction of war, Ashoka decided to become Buddhist. The Buddhist records credit him with the propagation of Buddhism in India and aboard. As an emperor, Ashoka did not favour Buddhism at the expenses of other religions.|$|E

An extreme example of this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> was the destruction of Nelson's Pillar in O'Connell Street in 1966. This statue of the famous British admiral was a Dublin landmark for a century, but was blown up by a small bomb shortly before the 50-year commemorations of the Easter Rising. In 2003, the Pillar was replaced as a landmark by the Dublin Spire which was erected on the same spot.

40|$|Background. Research {{indicates}} that supporting self-regulation and metacognition in learners improves their attainment and wider learning capabilities. However, using this knowledge effectively is challenging. Aims. This paper has two main aims. The {{first is to}} make a case for the relative benefits of metacognitive and self-regulatory approaches for improving learning. Comparative data from over 50 meta-analyses of interventions in schools indicates such approaches are more beneficial than other interventions. The second aim is to present data about different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> metacognitive <b>thinking</b> in classrooms which was elicited with cartoon templates. Sample and methods. Data about thinking in classrooms is drawn from a sample of 355 pupils, aged 4 – 15, in 12 schools who were involved in a project which promoted meta-cognition and self-regulation. The completed templates were coded for different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> including metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive skillfulness. A two way ANOVA (gender and age) was conducted to examine the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> across age groups (4 – 7 year olds; 7 – 11 year olds; 11 – 15 year olds). Results. There was an increase in all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> recorded on the templates with younger children (4 - 11 year olds), but contrary to expectation more complex <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> were identified less frequently with the 11 – 15 year olds. Conclusion. There is strong evidence from meta-analysis that metacognition and selfregulation are key dimensions in supporting learning, but there are also indications from classrooms that such approaches are not routinely embedded in schools in a way which takes advantage of learners’ developing capabilities...|$|R

500|$|A {{prevalent}} {{idea in the}} 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries was that illness {{was a result of}} the condition of the whole body. [...] The environment and the activity of the patient thus played a large part in any treatment. [...] The epitome of this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> was the concept of the vital force, which was supposed to govern the chemical processes within the body. [...] This theory held that organic compounds could only be formed within living organisms, where the vital force could come into play. [...] This belief had been known to be false ever since Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesising urea from inorganic precursors in 1828. [...] Nevertheless, the vital force continued to be invoked to explain organic chemistry in Bird's time. [...] Sometime {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, a new way of thinking started to take shape, especially among younger physicians, fuelled by rapid advances in the understanding of chemistry. [...] For the first time, it became possible to identify specific chemical reactions with specific organs of the body, and to trace their effects through the various functional relations of the organs and the exchanges between them.Vinten-Johansen, pp. 85–86 ...|$|E
500|$|Justus von Liebig {{is another}} {{important}} figure {{in the development of}} the new thinking, although his position is ambiguous. [...] He explained chemical processes in the body in terms of addition and subtraction of simple molecules from a larger organic molecule, a concept that Bird followed in his own work. [...] But even the materialistic Liebig continued to invoke the vital force for processes inside living animal bodies. [...] This seems to have been based on a belief that the entire living animal is required for these chemical processes to take place. [...] Bird helped to dispel this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> by showing that specific chemistry is related to specific organs in the body rather than to the whole animal. [...] He challenged some of Liebig's conclusions concerning animal chemistry. For example, Liebig had predicted that the ratio of uric acid to urea would depend on the level of activity of a species or individual; Bird showed this to be false. [...] Bird also felt that it was not enough simply to count atoms as Liebig did, but that an explanation was also required as to why the atoms recombined in one particular way rather than any other. [...] He made some attempts to provide this explanation by invoking the electric force, rather than the vital force, based on his own experiments in electrolysis.Brock, p. 310Rosenfeld, 2003, p. 1701Wermuth, p. 5Rosenfeld, 1999, p. 50 ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{curriculum}} {{documents in}} Design and Technology make claims about how students will develop and learn {{as a result}} of engaging in Design and Technology learning activities. These claims will often include the development of creative and innovative <b>thinking,</b> both <b>of</b> which are regarded as forms <b>of</b> higher order <b>thinking.</b> However, there is little research evidence to support these claims and much of what is available (eg Knopke, 2003) is drawn from small-scale qualitative studies and thus subject to the limitations inherent in such research. This paper outlines and examines the use of an instrument called the Cognitive Holding Power Questionnaire (CHPQ) (Stevenson, 1998) to measure higher order thinking with primary age students engaging in design and technology learning activities. The CHPQ is a quantitative instrument that elicits responses from students on their perceptions about the influence the learning environment (teacher, materials, activities etc) is having on the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> they are using during their learning. The instrument is suitable for large scale studies and provides powerful data to support the learning area.
