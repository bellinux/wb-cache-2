5|$|In 1890, {{during his}} father's second {{term in the}} West Virginia Senate, Flournoy and his family {{relocated}} from Romney to Charleston, where his father continued practicing law after his resignation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{announcing his}} {{campaign}} for governor, Wolf submitted an inquiry to the Massachusetts Ethics Commission as a precaution {{there would be no}} conflict of interest. However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort. In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Republicans {{controlled}} neither {{house of}} Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge {{did not believe}} Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession. Ignoring James Murray Mason's contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. He also voted against a resolution to remove {{the names of the}} senators from seceded states <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> roll.|$|E
5|$|Burton's {{term was}} due to expire on March 4, 1907. After his {{conviction}} was finally affirmed, a resolution to expel Burton <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on May 22, 1906. Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.|$|E

Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut {{broke with}} the Democratic caucus {{that he is}} a member of and vowed to join a Republican-led {{filibuster}} if the public option was not removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> health care reform bill.|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} third century, {{the balance of}} power had shifted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to the army, and the {{position}} of the Senate was considerably weakened. The emperor of Rome was appointed by the support of the military, while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority. Both Macrinus and later Elagabalus secured the support of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate. Macrinus was in dire circumstances after Elagabalus' rebellion and had no other choice but to turn to the Senate for assistance. While in Antioch, Macrinus made one final attempt at securing support, this time from Rome. A combination of distrust <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> insufficient funds, and Elagabalus' impending approach, however, forced Macrinus to face Elagabalus' approaching legions with only his Praetorian Guard. Had more time had been available, the Prefect of Rome Marius Maximus {{might have been able to}} muster troops to send as reinforcements to assist Macrinus. Despite their relative powerlessness, the Senate still declared war against the usurper and his family.|$|E
5|$|During his education, {{he became}} active in {{university}} politics, and in 1563 {{he was elected}} the rector of the law department. Around that time he also wrote De senatu Romano, a brochure about Ancient Rome government. He returned to the Commonwealth in 1565, {{and was the first}} person to receive a commendation letter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> of the Republic of Venice.|$|E
5|$|Garfield placated the Stalwarts by {{endorsing}} Chester A. Arthur of New York, a Conkling loyalist, as {{nominee for}} vice president, {{but it was}} to Blaine and his delegates that Garfield owed his nomination. When Garfield was elected over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, he turned to Blaine to guide him in selection of his cabinet and offered him the preeminent position: Secretary of State. Blaine accepted, resigning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> on March 4, 1881.|$|E

25|$|The first Congressional {{investigation}} into the Inslaw case came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI). PSI's report was issued in September 1989, {{after a year and}} a half of investigation. During the investigation, Inslaw made a number of new allegations, which take up most of the PSI report.|$|R
5|$|His {{confrontations}} with conservatives cost him several leadership {{positions in the}} Senate, including chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. Despite isolation from his conservative colleagues, Mathias played an influential role in fostering African American civil rights, ending the Vietnam War, preserving the Chesapeake Bay, and constructing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1987, having served in Congress for twenty-six years (eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives and eighteen years in the U.S. Senate).|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Tyler {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> District that included Chief Justice John Marshall.

5|$|Lucullus was {{astonished}} upon hearing {{this in the}} year 70, {{and he began to}} prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia. Although he had no mandate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to authorize such a move, he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, he marched his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located.|$|E
5|$|Mathias held a {{retirement}} {{party at the}} Baltimore Convention Center on July 14, 1986, which had over 1,200 attendees. The proceeds from the event, at $150 per person, were used to establish a foreign studies program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in his name. Mathias planned to teach at Johns Hopkins following his departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E

5|$|The censors {{were the}} magistrates who {{enforced}} the ethical {{standards of the}} Senate. Whenever a censor punished a senator, they had to allege some specific failing. Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption, abuse of capital punishment, or the disregard of a colleague's veto, constitutional precedent, or the auspices. Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished. While punishment could include impeachment (expulsion) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion. While the standard was high for expelling a member <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> {{it was easier to}} deny a citizen the right to join the Senate. Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate, including bankruptcy, prostitution, or a prior history of having been a gladiator. One law (the Lex repetundarum of 123 BC) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been convicted of a criminal offense. Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic, as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels.|$|E
5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators could {{not engage in}} banking or any form of public contract. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they could not leave Italy without permission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{tremendous}} public outcry when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it. Only Prentice, in the Courier-Journal, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were burned in effigy.|$|E
