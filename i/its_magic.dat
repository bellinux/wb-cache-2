5|$|Enlisting {{the help}} of the Stabbington Brothers, a duo of muscular thieves who were once betrayed by Flynn, Gothel offers them both revenge on Flynn Rider and Rapunzel's gift once they agree to help her find them, not {{intending}} to keep the latter half of her promise as she only wants Rapunzel for herself. When her initial attempt to convince Rapunzel to return home with her fails, Gothel, upon a second encounter, tricks the Stabbington Brothers into immobilizing Flynn, later knocking them unconscious when they attempt to kidnap Rapunzel. Convincing Rapunzel that Flynn has betrayed her, they return to the tower. While Flynn escapes from the dungeon, Rapunzel suddenly realizes her true identity and rebels against Gothel, only to be chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Flynn upon his arrival to rescue Rapunzel, but agrees to free Rapunzel long enough to heal him on the condition that she remain with her forever. However, Flynn unexpectedly cuts Rapunzel's hair, causing it to lose <b>its</b> <b>magic.</b> It turns brown, and a horrified Gothel (failing to salvage Rapunzel's hair) ages rapidly, falling out of the tower's window but disintegrating into dust before she hits the ground, essentially dying of old age. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms, but is miraculously returned to life by Rapunzel's tear, and she is finally reunited with her biological parents.|$|E

Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel bound and gagged. Gothel stabs Eugene and attempts to escape with Rapunzel, but Rapunzel agrees to lifelong captivity if she is allowed to heal Eugene.

Showing no gratitude, the wizard curses Conan's armor, scatters it across the world, and teleports the barbarian away. Vowing to retrieve his armor, Conan meets A'kanna while he is fighting through a pirate base. Teaming up with the barbarian to find his armor, the warrior queen hopes to use <b>its</b> <b>magic</b> to end the curse—the Black Death—that is causing her people to kill each other.

500|$|The {{music for}} Kingsglaive was {{composed}} by John R. Graham, with additional themes by Shimomura {{taken from her}} score for Final Fantasy XV. Suzuki also worked on the Kingsglaive soundtrack. Shimomura also composed the film's main theme. Graham had previously contributed to the score of Square Enix's Bloodmasque and the 2014 film The Forger. For a few of Shimomura's pieces used in the film, the arrangement was altered to make it darker and add scale. Some tracks, such as [...] "Battle for the Crown City", changed a lot during the score's development based on the scene it was set to within the film. While both orchestral and electronic elements {{were used in the}} score, the film's director Takeshi Nozue insisted on keeping the electronic elements to a minimum and fuse those that existed with the score to create a distorted clash of elements. This was due to the story of the film revolving around Lucis' Crystal and the rules surrounding <b>its</b> <b>magic,</b> in addition to the story focusing on the differing reactions of people facing extraordinary circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion of}} faith and deep belief is a large party of the novel, and {{is related to the}} book's other theme of identity. Throughout the story there is a tension between a faith in the Nameless Ones and their power, and human curiosity and the {{tendency}} to question. The importance of tradition and belief in Kargish culture is emphasized when Tenar is taken from her family, and chosen to be the high priestess of the Tombs. However, Tenar's mother unsuccessfully tries to dupe the priestesses into believing the child has a skin disease. Commentators state that this episode suggests certain universal impulses can lead to resistance against [...] "cultural imperatives"; Tenar's mother is willing to bend the rules to keep her child. Unlike the rest of Earthsea, which relies on the [...] "Old Speech" [...] for <b>its</b> <b>magic</b> and rituals, the Kargish lands use their own tongue, and rituals are conducted with meaningless babble; thus from the moment the chanting of the priestesses is described, Le Guin suggests that the Kargish faith is one of meaningless words and ritual. The Kargish deities are revered as the [...] "Nameless Ones"; thus Ged's statement to Arha that all things have names also works to undermine her faith.|$|E
500|$|Manning's film {{credits include}} {{the lead role}} in the 1986 Ozploitation film Dead End Drive-In.

He finds himself amongst a community of misfits trapped at the site, and seeks to break out. The film, directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith, received mixed reviews: Tim Kroenert writing for Eureka Street described it as [...] "Mad Max-lite" [...] {{and said that the}} film [...] "is an example of how literality of translation can result in the sacrifice of the story’s essence. The film is fun on its own terms, but much of the nuance and irony that lend ‘Crabs’ <b>its</b> <b>magic</b> are simply lost". Philippa Hawker writing for The Age said the film was [...] "an energetic, inventively designed, cheerfully satirical and entertaining film", and it is one of American film director Quentin Tarantino's favourites. The film received only a short box-office season; Manning was critical of the distributor Greater Union and worked with the film's other actors to secure separate release in independent cinemas. Manning's other film credits include an appearance in the teen film Looking for Alibrandi. He has also made a short film, Love Bites. Manning's television credits include Bodyline, The Shiralee [...] and Brides of Christ.|$|E

500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} review {{came from}} The Wire, which felt that: [...] "In the end, Vespertine commits <b>its</b> <b>magic</b> by daring to go places more obvious and more human than {{one would have}} ever expected." [...] Calling it [...] "one {{of the most impressive}} and cohesive" [...] albums of the year, Tiny Mix Tapes found Vespertine to be Björk's most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Simon Reynolds, praised it in Uncut saying [...] "Her best yet, {{it reminds me of the}} jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa In The Gold Dust Rush, of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie and the Banshees circa A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside." [...] Katy Widder, writer for PopMatters, believed the album was a masterpiece, stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender, particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "Women have seized rock 'n' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes, but we've yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself." [...] Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as [...] "a breath of fresh air." [...] Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer, musicOMH's Michael Hubbard wrote that [...] "It sounds like Björk has grown up while that would be a pity, it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music. She is a legend in her time." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil Geinzlinger of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "it may not {{stay in the}} public eye long because this movie is {{probably}} not going to put up Twilight-like numbers," [...] adding that [...] "the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status, which is odd, since the producers include Will Ferrell." [...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of <b>its</b> <b>magic</b> potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this was a perfectly vulgar way to spend 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one might be enough — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin of IndieWire {{praised the}} {{animation}} and art direction, but {{wrote that he}} wished [...] "the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy" [...] and that [...] "Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that's merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise." [...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying [...] "Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it [...] "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop {{in the manner of}} the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it [...] "may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying [...] "It may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A− and said it [...] "is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost <b>its</b> <b>magic.</b> The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote [...] "Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids." ...|$|E

[...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost <b>its</b> <b>magic</b> recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E
