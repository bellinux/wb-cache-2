40|$|Ketoprofen is {{a potent}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug which {{is used for the}} treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The oral administration of ketoprofen can cause gastric irritation and adverse renal effects. Transdermal delivery of the drug can bypass gastrointestinal disturbances and provide relatively consistent drug concentrations at the site of administration. The release of ketoprofen from proprietary gel products from three different countries was evaluated by comparing the in vitro release profiles. Twenty extemporaneously prepared ketoprofen gel formulations using Carbopol® polymers were manufactured. The effect of polymer, drug concentration, pH and solvent systems on the in vitro release of ketoprofen from these formulations were investigated. The gels were evaluated for drug content and pH. The release of the drug from all the formulations obeyed the Higuchi principle. Two static FDA approved diffusion cells, namely the modified Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> and the European Pharmacopoeia <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell,</b> were compared by measuring the in vitro release rate of ketoprofen from all the gel formulations through a synthetic silicone membrane. High-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometric analytical techniques were both used for the analysis of ketoprofen. The validated methods were employed for the determination of ketoprofen in the sample solutions taken from the receptor fluid. Two of the three proprietary products registered under the same manufacturing license exhibited similar results whereas the third product differed significantly. Among the variables investigated, the vehicle pH and solvent composition were found have the most significant effect on the in vitro release of ketoprofen from Carbopol® polymers. The different grades of Carbopol® polymers showed statistically significantly different release kinetics with respect to lag time. When evaluating the proprietary products, both the modified Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> and the European Pharmacopoeia <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> were deemed adequate although higher profiles were generally obtained from the European Pharmacopoeia diffusion cells. Smoother diffusion profiles were obtained from samples analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography than by ultraviolet spectrophotometry in both diffusion cells. Sample solutions taken from Franz diffusion cells and analysed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry also produced smooth diffusion profiles. Erratic and higher diffusion profiles were observed with samples taken from the European Pharmacopoeia <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> and analysed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The choice of diffusion cells and analytical procedure in product development must be weighed against the relatively poor reproducibility as observed with the European Pharmacopoeia <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|E

40|$|Sink {{conditions}} are often violated when using conventional release methods for dispersed systems. A novel reverse dialysis bag method {{was designed to}} overcome this problem. Model drug transport rates from submicron emulsions obtained using the conventional <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> method and this novel method were compared. In the side-by-side <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> method, emulsions {{were placed in the}} donor chamber and surfactant/buffer solutions in the receiver chamber. In the novel dialysis bag method, emulsions were diluted infinitely in the donor phase and surfactant/buffer solutions were placed in the receiver phase (dialysis bags). Slow release rates and linear release profiles were obtained using the side-by-side <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> method apparently due to limited model drug solubility in the donor chamber resulting in violation of sink conditions. Biphasic release profiles were obtained using the dialysis bag method apparently due to an initial rapid release of free and micellar solubilized model drug from the donor to the receiver chambers followed by slow release from the oil droplets. Using both release methods, an initial increase and latter decrease in release rates were observed with increase in surfactant concentration. The initial increase was considered to be due to a decrease in the model drug oil-in-water partition coefficients and the subsequent decrease in release rates was due to micellar shape change (spheres to rods) causing a decrease in diffusion rates. Sink conditions were violated using the side-by-side <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> method but were maintained in the dialysis bag method since emulsions were diluted infinitely in the donor phase...|$|E

40|$|A <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> {{was used}} to {{experimentally}} determine the diffusivity of natural organic matter (NOM). Various diffusivities were obtained for NOM with respect to both pH and the molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of membranes. Values determined with the <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> were compared to those estimated from flow field-flow fractionation (fl-FFF) and high-performance size exclusion (HP-SEC). Firstly, the diffusivities obtained with the <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> were much lower than those from both fl-FFF and HP-SEC,which {{was due to the}} interference in NOM transmission through the membrane Pores. Secondly, the diffusivity of NOM increased with decreasing pH due to both electrostatic interactions and double layer compaction. Thus, at lower pH, the mass transfer coefficient of NOM increased due to increases in the corresponding diffusivity. Thirdly, the diffusivity of NOM decreased as the MWCO of a membrane decreased, which {{was the result of the}} sieving effect between the NOM and the membrane. Along with the experimental identification of NOM diffusivity, the transport parameters (mass transfer coefficient (k), solute permeability (P-m), and membrane selectivity (sigma)) of NOM under different pH conditions were also investigated using irreversible thermodynamic models. The transport parameters of NOM in a membrane system depended on the permeability and surface charge. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reservedclose 6...|$|E
