The aim of the evaluation is to verify the efficiency and efficacy of the implementation process, particularly as concerns the objective of integration of environmental issues in the agricultural policy. In this context, a more comprehensive evaluation methodol-ogy is needed. Particularly, the spatial structure of the territory the intervention targets must be inte-grated in the analysis. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been widely considered a useful tool to encompass the spatial aspects in the evaluation process. GIS, in fact, are able to perform spatial analysis as well as estimate quantitative indicators referred to different geographic frames.

40|$|Current European {{legislation}} on biomedical research appears to adversely affect pan European clinical research activities. The {{impact of the}} EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001 / 20 /EC has been widely debated since coming into force in May of 2004. Ongoing translational research activities and the growing use of human biological materials have exposed additional critical legislative gaps at the European level. The Directive aims {{to protect the rights}} and wellbeing of human subjects enrolled in clinical trials, increase European clinical research competitiveness, harmonise regulatory procedures, and ensure Good Clinical Practices by means of a common legal <b>framework.</b> <b>Member</b> States, however, have interpreted, transposed and implemented the Directive in different ways. The core principles of the Directive on subject protection and general procedural rules are identical at the European level but differ in practice, a result of the various transpositions of those principles into national legislation – true harmonisation has yet to be achieved. European researchers must overcome these national discrepancies in order to carry out multinational clinical trials. This costs time, money and precious resources and has failed to increase trial subject protection and to ensure equal access to innovative research for all European citizens.

The work, {{performed by the}} RTO study team SAS- 078, involves the development of NLW requirement descriptions, which are put against a set of NLW systems. Gaps are likely to occur, indicating that a particular requirement may not be (completely) satisfied with the currently available NLW. However, the military user of potentially gap-filling (new) NLW needs some level of assurance that a required effectiveness can indeed be met. The SAS- 078 group developed an Integrated NLW Experimentation Framework containing the essential elements that together constitute non-lethal effectiveness. The framework is a baseline for NLW Experimentation Guidebook, which is intended to position and improve non-lethal effectiveness assessments. The Guidebook does not prescribe specific tests, but facilitates the exchange and comparison of test results between nations.

50|$|The {{title of}} the three Nazareth-Conferences - “Germans and Israelis: The Past in the Present” -, was its program. It spoke of two {{national}} groups and suggested to recognize the past {{of the relationship between}} the two target groups in the present. Thus, the conferences were able to become a place where individual and group identities could meet and where was given the opportunity to explore the chances and risks of such an encounter. The task was to find out how the current relationship to the other group was influenced by belonging to the own and how the presence of this ratio was influenced by the past. Although it was intended, thereby also to detect the underlying, unconscious fantasies, the target was not therapeutic, but learning at the moment of encounter. To address this difficult task undisturbed by the everyday life of the participants, the design of conferences presented a secure <b>framework.</b> <b>Members</b> and staff lived together in a house and worked for six days in the topic. Conference language was English. The use of one's own national language was permissible, but only if all those present dominated this language. Through all this, it gradually should be possible to perceive one's own role, which was taken at the conference in the presence of others, and explore how this role was affected by past and current psychological and social processes.|$|R
