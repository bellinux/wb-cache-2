It is one of 19 {{stations}} {{in the country that}} are managed by Network Rail. As of 2016, it is the fifth-busiest station in Britain and the busiest inter-city passenger terminal in the country. It is the sixth-busiest terminus in London by entries and exits.|$|E
40|$|In this Letter, I {{distinguish}} "passive" <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> {{as those}} with no current star formation, as distinct from "active" <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> that have undergone recent star formation. I built a sample of nearby galaxies with <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> observed in the near- and mid-infrared from the NIRS 0 S and the S 4 G surveys. I used archival far-ultraviolet (FUV) and Hα imaging of 319 galaxies to diagnose whether their <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> are passive or active. I found that passive rings are found only in early-type disc galaxies (- 3 <=T<= 2). In this range of stages, 21 +- 3...|$|R

5|$|Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s {{saw many}} large scale {{developments}} in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and {{a new system of}} roads, including the <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> Road, were laid out. Also at this time many of the old slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} {{its intention to}} close one lane in each direction on Euston Road between 2020 and 2026 to accommodate work on High Speed 2. The decision was condemned by Camden Borough Council as it could affect business and cost more than £1 billion in lost revenue. The Automobile Association said the works were the largest ever proposed in London and would affect far more than local traffic due to its <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> Road status.|$|E

5|$|Park Lane is a {{major road}} in the City of Westminster, in Central London. It {{is part of the}} London <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> Road and runs from Hyde Park Corner in the south to Marble Arch in the north. It {{separates}} Hyde Park to the west from Mayfair to the east. The road has a number of historically important properties and hotels and {{has been one of the}} most sought after streets in London, despite being a major traffic thoroughfare.|$|E
5|$|Several {{main roads}} {{run around the}} {{perimeter}} of Hyde Park. Park Lane is part of the London <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> Road and the London Congestion Charge zone boundary. The A4, a major road through West London, runs along the southeastern edge of the park, while the A5, a major road to Milton Keynes and the Midlands runs northwest from Marble Arch.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s.

5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people. The main {{growth of the}} city was in part due to an organized private streetcar system. With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars ran down important roads extending from Downtown Minneapolis. Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates {{around the turn of the}} century as a result of this system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> suburbs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a computational model for calculating {{the lifetime of}} rolling bearings in a 1. 5 MW wind turbine’s epicyclic gearbox. At first, a quasi-dynamic model is established to analyze the skidding of bearings and the skew of rollers. Then, the load distributions on raceways and <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> of bearings are calculated using the quasi-dynamic model. Meanwhile, a multi-body finite element model established in RomaxWind software is utilized to simulate and analyze dynamics behaviors of the epicyclic gearbox including all bearings. The comparison of bearings’ lifetimes calculated with different methods shows that the quasi-dynamic model can obtain very close results as the multi-body finite element model obtains, but costs less time. Failures occurring on <b>inner</b> and outer <b>rings,</b> such as pitting, adhesion, are mainly resulted from the misalignment of <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> and roller number on the skidding of bearings...|$|R

40|$|We present {{dynamical}} {{simulations of}} NGC 2523 and NGC 4245, two barred galaxies (types SB(r) b and SB(r) 0 /a, respectively) with prominent <b>inner</b> <b>rings.</b> Our {{goal is to}} estimate the bar pattern speeds in these galaxies by matching a sticky-particle simulation to the $B$-band morphology, using near-infrared $K_s$-band images to define the gravitational potentials. We compare the pattern speeds derived by this method with those derived in our previous paper using the well-known Tremaine-Weinberg continuity equation method. The <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> in these galaxies, which {{are likely to be}} resonance features, help to constrain the dynamical models. We find that both methods give the same pattern speeds within the errors. Comment: 29 pages, 3 tables, 13 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journa...|$|R
5|$|The A57 and A61 {{roads are}} the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, {{crossing}} in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring, allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south east and north, nearer {{the edge of the}} city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E

The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up. Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current (post-1983) layout is generally that of 1770.|$|E
40|$|The outer {{rings of}} impact basins are {{interpreted}} as the bounding rings of the excavated basin cavities analogous to Copernicus-type crater rim crests. It is suggested that the <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> are strata from depth uplifted during excavation of the transient cavity. Spacing relations and morphology appear to indicate a transition from central peaks to rings but not from terraces to rings. Evidence related to terrestrial craters with rings or peaks produced by meteorite impacts suggests that one or more crater rims may form inside the main, outer crater rim, resulting in nested craters. There {{is some evidence that}} peaks grade into <b>inner</b> <b>rings</b> as material is ejected from their cores in progressively larger impacts. Multiply layered materials may produce multiple rings by differential excavation of the layers...|$|R

5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E
