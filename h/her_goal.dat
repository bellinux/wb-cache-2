5|$|Morgan {{scored the}} winning {{goal in the}} Olympic semi-final match against Canada in extra time, sending the United States to the gold medal match against Japan. <b>Her</b> <b>goal</b> came in the 123rd minute, the latest goal ever scored {{by a member of}} the U.S. women's team and a FIFA record. The goal {{continued}} her propensity for late heroics in the closing stages of matches. Seventeen of her 28 total goals to date have come after the 60th minute. The match-winning goal was Morgan's team-high 20th in 2012, becoming only the sixth and youngest U.S. player to do so in a single year. In the final, a 2–1 win against Japan on August 9, Morgan assisted on a Carli Lloyd header.

5|$|The Buckeye {{was first}} bred and {{developed}} in 1896, by a Warren, Ohio resident named Nettie Metcalf.

Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks, Buff Cochins, and some black breasted red games to produce the Buckeye. <b>Her</b> <b>goal</b> was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters. Contrary to popular belief the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed and Metcalf actually sent birds to the RIR breeders for them to improve their breed.|$|E

5|$|To {{accomplish}} <b>her</b> <b>goal,</b> Varian {{sought the}} assistance of British horse breeder Patricia Lindsay, who traveled to Poland and purchased three mares on Varian's behalf. The mares arrived in California in December 1961.

Bachantka and Naganka had been trained and raced in Poland. Bachantka had a record of 2/15 (0-1-3), and Naganka a record of 2/12 (3-4-1). After her arrival in the USA, Bachantka also had a brief but successful horse show career.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course.

She also said that <b>her</b> <b>goal</b> in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E

5|$|Will Burton (Gaelan Connell) is a music enthusiast and a David Bowie fan {{with a hint}} of {{rock and}} roll and boy next door. Throughout the movie, Will writes journal-like e-mails to Bowie every day, {{although}} Bowie never answers. When Will's mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow) finds a new job, he switches to a new school, which he is eager to do since he was bullied at his previous one. During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl who says her name is written Sa5m but pronounced Sam, the 5 is silent (Vanessa Hudgens). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends but, shortly after, he is sought after by another girl named Charlotte Barnes (Aly Michalka). One afternoon, Charlotte asks Will to join her in an after-school day-care center. When she starts inviting him to hang out with her, the teenager is stunned—as is his single mother Karen. Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/ska band. <b>Her</b> <b>goal</b> is apparently to take revenge on her egocentric musician ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatley (Scott Porter) during Bandslam.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 season, Fishlock scored {{her first}} {{goal of the}} season during the team's home-opener against Western New York Flash. <b>Her</b> <b>goal</b> in the 25th minute {{was the first of}} the match and assist to Megan Rapinoe in the 86th minute contributed to a 5–1 win for the Reign. During a match against the Washington Spirit on 2 May, Fishlock scored a goal in the 75th minute off an assist from Kim Little {{resulting}} in a 3–1 win over the Spirit. During a match against Sky Blue FC in New Jersey, Fishlock received a controversial red card in the 90th minute that required her to sit out the team's next match against league-leading Chicago Red Stars. The controversy stemmed from a scrum in the box after a Sky Blue corner kick and Fishlock's last-minute save on the goal line. Fishlock stated the ball bounced off her head, but Sky Blue forward Nadia Nadim said she blocked it with her hand and the ref awarded Sky Blue the penalty kick. Both matches resulted in 1–1 draws. During the team's second match against Sky Blue FC in Seattle on 6 June, Fishlock scored a goal and an assist earning Player of the Match after leading Seattle to a 3–0 win. She was named NWSL Player of the Week by the media for the ninth week of the season. The Reign finished the regular season in first place clinching the NWSL Shield for the second consecutive time. After advancing to the playoffs, Seattle faced fourth-place team Washington Spirit and won 3–0, advancing to the championship final. Seattle was ultimately defeated 1–0 by FC Kansas City during the championship final in Portland. Fishlock, along with teammates Kim Little, Beverly Yanez, and Lauren Barnes were named to the NWSL Best XI team.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Games, she competed {{in a warm}} up event in Switzerland, and set Australian records in the 100m, 400m and 800m events.

She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her team mates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100m relay. In the individual events, she finished fifth in the women's T53 100m event (a race won in world record time by Huang Lisha), seventh in the women's T53 200m event (also won in a world record time by Huang), seventh in the women's T53 400m event, and led out the women's 800m final, eventually finishing sixth. After a couple of sub-par competition results in 2011, Ballard made big changes to her diet, gloves, technique, chair position, and training regime. She entered the 2012 London Paralympics ranked world number one in both the T53 100m and 200m. At the games, Ballard participated in the T53 class events for 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m events. She won two silver medals in the 200m and 400m T53 events, and a bronze medal in the 100m T53 event.|$|E
