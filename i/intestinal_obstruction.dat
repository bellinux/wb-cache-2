5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer.

25|$|Newborns with <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{typically}} require surgery, whereas {{adults with}} distal <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> syndrome typically do not.

40|$|Background: The {{motor and}} {{cognitive}} outcome at school age of newborn children with surgically treated <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions</b> is unknown. Physiological stress and anesthesia may potentially be harmful {{in the period}} of early brain development in newborn infants. Objective: To determine motor and cognitive outcome at school age in children with surgically treated <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions</b> as newborns, and to identify clinical risk factors for adverse outcome. Study design: Cohort study of infants born between 1995 and 2002 with atresia, stenosis, or intestinal malrotation. At 6 to 13 years we assessed their motor functions, intelligence, attention, visual perception, visuomotor integration, and verbal memory. Results: Of 44 children three (7 %) died. Twenty-seven survivors (66 %) were included for follow-up (median gestational age 36. 7 weeks, birth weight 3000 g). Motor outcome was abnormal (Conclusions: Children treated surgically for <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions</b> in the neonatal period had an increased risk for poor motor functioning and selective attention at school age. Low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction and intestinal perforation were risk factors for adverse outcome. We recommend to closely follow the motor and attentional development of these children. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

25|$|Differentiation between {{proximal}} enteritis {{and small}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{is important to}} ensure correct treatment, and can be assisted {{with the help of}} ultrasound. Horses with small <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> will usually have an intestinal diameter of -10nbsp&cm with a wall thickness of 3-5mm. Horses with proximal enteritis usually have an intestinal diameter that is narrower, but wall thickness is often greater than 6mm, containing a hyperechoic or anechoic fluid, with normal, increased, or decreased peristalsis. However, obstructions that have been present for some time may present with thickened walls and distention of the intestine.|$|E

25|$|If {{complications}} of helminthiasis, such as <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> occur, emergency surgery may be required. Patients who require non-emergency surgery, for instance for removal of worms from the biliary tree, can be pre-treated with the anthelmintic drug albendazole.|$|E

30|$|The {{incidence}} of cecal volvulus ranges from 2.8 to 7.1 per million people per year [1, 2]. Cecal volvulus {{is responsible for}} 1 – 1.5  % of all adult <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions</b> [6] and 25 – 40  % of all cases of volvulus involving the colon [7 – 9]. Cecal volvulus can occur when the ascending colon, cecum, and terminal ileum are abnormally mobile, which represents a failure of complete rotation, descent, and fixation of the right colon.|$|R
50|$|Parasites {{present one}} of the biggest threats to health in Guatemala. Many of the common parasites in {{developing}} countries like Guatemala are spread through contamination of both water and food. Some of the effects of parasites include <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions,</b> which can hinder the body from absorbing nutrients, lead to a loss of appetite, impair long term growth, induce vomiting, cause anemia and anorexia, and in severe cases, cause death. Symptoms can also include intense abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, and fever.|$|R

25|$|Most {{cases of}} Meckel's {{diverticulum}} are diagnosed when complications manifest or incidentally in unrelated {{conditions such as}} laparotomy, laparoscopy or contrast study of the small intestine.

25|$|The {{lifetime}} {{risk for a}} person with Meckel's diverticulum to develop certain complications is about 4–6%. Gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonitis or <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> may occur in 15–30% of symptomatic patients (Table 1). Only 6.4% of all complications requires surgical treatment; and untreated Meckel's diverticulum has a mortality rate of 2.5–15%.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} volvulus {{is thought}} to be caused by a change in local peristalsis, or due to a lesion that the mesentery may twist around (such as an ascarid impaction), and usually involves the distal jejunum and ileum.w It {{is one of the most}} common causes of small <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in foals, possibly because of a sudden change to a bulkier foodstuff. Animals present with acute and severe signs of colic, and multiple distended loops of small intestine, usually seen radiographically in a foal. Small intestinal volvulus often occurs secondary to another disease process in adult horses, where small <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> causes distention and then rotation around the root of the mesentery. Surgery is required to resect nonviable sections of bowel, and prognosis is correlated to the length of bowel involved, with animals with greater than 50% of small intestinal involvement having a grave prognosis.|$|E

25|$|Bowel obstruction, {{also known}} as <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction,</b> is a {{mechanical}} or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion.

25|$|Death {{is caused}} by an {{underdeveloped}} part of the digestive system. The large intestine of the horse is a complex system where most digestion takes place, and comprises the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. Necropsies on LWS foals reveal a pale, underdeveloped colon and <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> (impaction). Samples of affected tissue show a lack of nerves that allow the intestine to move material through the digestive system, a condition called intestinal agangliosis.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides.

Pyrantel pamoate may induce <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E

With the advent of deep enteroscopy, palliative stent placement for mid-gut obstruction using currently available self-expandable metal stents may be feasible in selected cases. Proper patient selection and technical proficiency in deep enteroscopy and stent placement are key determinants for a successful outcome. Alternative means of stent delivery, including the percutaneous route, are also being developed, with the hope of expanding the use of stents in the mid small bowel beyond palliation...|$|R

Inflammatory bowel diseases-associated fibrosis was seen as an irreversible process that frequently led to <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions</b> requiring surgical intervention.

40|$|Introduction: Annular {{pancreas}} {{is a rare}} developmental anomaly, representing 1 % of the neonatal <b>intestinal</b> <b>obstructions.</b> Case Report: We {{report a}} case of prenatal sonographic diagnosis of duodenal obstruction, observed on the 32 nd gestational week. There was no other ultrasound finding beyond the ‘double bubble’ sign, which persisted until labour, by the 39 th week. An annular pancreas was diagnosed at the 3 rd day of life, by an exploratory laparotomy. Conclusion: Diagnosis of partial or total duodenal obstruction is almost exclusively suggested by the ‘double bubble‘ sign, resulting from a dilatation of the stomach and duodenum. Despite being a rare anomaly, the differential diagnosis of annular pancreas should be considered, if this prenatal sonographic finding is observed...|$|R
