Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>direction.</b> You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E

As other engineers joined the growing company, he no longer felt needed there and by early 1985, Wozniak left Apple again, stating that the company had [...] "been <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> for the last five years".

The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to [...] "contain" [...] Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year.

The British Vanwall team took the maiden Constructors' Championship that season, but ruined their Drivers' Championship aspirations by taking points off one another. Stirling Moss, despite having many more wins than Hawthorn, lost the championship by one point. It was high sportsmanship that cost Moss the 1958 title. When Hawthorn was threatened with disqualification at the finish of the Portuguese Grand Prix for <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> (to restart his car following a spin), Moss argued to stewards on Hawthorn's behalf.

5000|$|Tim Jackson {{points out}} that {{according}} to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some relative resource decoupling: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' — that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP — decreased by 33 percent; but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent {{during the same period}} of time. Hence, no absolute energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even relative resource decoupling have materialized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of iron ore, bauxite, copper and nickel was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that [...] "resource efficiency is <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction," [...] mostly due to emerging economies — notably China — building up their infrastructure. Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP. Jackson further cautions that [...] "simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sculley's and Jobs's {{respective}} visions for {{the company}} greatly differed. The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company {{to focus on the}} closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services. Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. Many left including Wozniak, who stated that the company had [...] "been <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> for the last five years" [...] and sold most of his stock. The Macintosh's failure to defeat the PC strengthened Sculley's position in the company.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{a nucleus}} of young talent and high {{expectations}} for 1999–2000, injuries caused the Bruins to plummet {{to the bottom of}} their division, and they went on track to miss the playoffs. This was further exacerbated by negative attention over teammate Marty McSorley's hit on Donald Brashear. With his career nearing an end and the team <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>direction,</b> Bourque requested a trade from the fading Bruins so he would {{have a chance to win}} the Stanley Cup. Bourque wanted to be traded to a team on the East Coast such as the Philadelphia Flyers, and Flyers' general manager Bobby Clarke offered the Bruins Andy Delmore and Daymond Langkow for Bourque. Bruins general manager Harry Sinden badly wanted Bourque to have a chance to close out his career with a Cup win and decided to pursue a trade with the Colorado Avalanche instead. Doing his best to keep word of the deal out of the press, Sinden worked out the specifics of the deal and on March 6, 2000, Sinden told Bourque he would be traded to the Avalanche and said, [...] "this may not be your first choice, but this is the team I feel is best."

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{summer of}} 2007 Corona got invited by Les Grandes Eaux Nocturnes (an annual festival of sound, light and water at Château de Versailles in France) {{to compose a}} 6 speaker {{composition}} for the grand evening fountain display <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jardin du Roi. The Versaille Sessions is an aural document of that installation. GetSound, who commissioned the project, hired a Parisian group of musicians specialized in baroque music. Murcof and <b>the</b> musicians resided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GetSound studio <b>in</b> Paris for two days to record the musicians’ interpretations of compositions from the baroque time, from for example Jean-Baptiste Lully, Henry Purcell and François Couperin. The pieces were played traditionally {{as well as with}} note and instrument experimentation. They experimented with modifying the score, tempo, pitch and by inserting random pauses. Texturally they explored the instruments by throwing all sorts of material inside the harpsichord and pounding on the viola da gamba’s body, capturing a wide range of timbres, giving Corona lots of composing options. Corona stated it was a great learning experience for him thanks to the musicians’ open mindedness and fun approach. Corona described the composition process as partially different from the usual Murcof composition method. He was processing previously recorded acoustic material as usual, but this time the source material was very specific 17th century baroque and <b>the</b> experiments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio were already a part of the composing process. Two weeks before the opening Corona went to the site wanting to get an impression of the sound, but couldn’t make the necessary tests due to pouring rain. He did realize though that he was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> musical direction. He thought the big space demanded a different sound: more openness, more time for the sounds to develop and resonate. So <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining two weeks he reworked the whole commission into The Versailles Sessions.|$|R
40|$|Research on African economies {{has arrived}} at the third stage of {{perceptions}} in recent times â€“ after â€œAfricaâ€™s growth tragedyâ€ and â€œEmerging Africa,â€ we have now come back down to earth.

6000|$|I do {{not pretend}} this {{search for the}} battle-field of Marston Moor was the most {{exciting}} episode of my stay in York. In fact, I think it was much surpassed in a climax of dramatic poignancy incident to our excursion to Bishopsthorpe, down the Ouse, {{on one of the}} cosey little steamers which ply the stream without unreasonably crowding it against its banks. It was a most silvery September afternoon when we started from the quay at York, and after escaping from embarkment on a boat <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>direction,</b> began, with no unseemly swiftness, to scuttle down the current. It was a perfect voyage, as perfect as any I ever made on the Mississippi, the Ohio, the St. Lawrence, or the Hudson, on steamers in whose cabins our little boat would have lost itself. We had a full but not crowded company of passengers, overflowing into a skiff at our stern, in which a father and mother, with three women friends, preferred the high excitement of being towed to Bishopsthorpe, where it seemed that the man of the party knew the gardener. With each curve of the river and with each remove we got the city in more and more charming retrospective, till presently its roofs and walls and spires and towers were lost in the distance, and we were left to the sylvan or pastoral loveliness of the low shores. Here and there at a pleasant interval from the river a villa rose against a background of rounded tree tops, with Lombardy poplars picking themselves out before it, {{but for the most part}} the tops of the banks, with which we stood even on our deck, retreated from the waterside willows in levels of meadow-land, where white and red cows were grazing, and now and then young horses romping away from groups of their elders. It was all dear and kind and sweet, with a sort of mid-Western look in its softness (as the English landscape often has), and the mud-banks were like those of my native Ohio Valley rivers. The effect was heightened, on our return, by an aged and virtuously poor (to all appearance) flageolet and cornet band, playing 'Way down upon the Suwanee River, while the light played in [...] "ditties no-tone" [...] over the groves and pastures of the shore, and the shadows stretched themselves luxuriously out as if for a long night's sleep. There has seldom been such a day since I began to grow old; a soft September gale ruffled and tossed the trees finely, and a subtle Italian quality mixed with the American richness of the sunshiny air; so that I thought we reached Bishopsthorpe only too soon, and I woke from a pleasant reverie to be told that the steamer could not land with us, but we must be taken ashore in the small boat which we saw putting out for us from its moorings. To this day I do not know why the steamer could not land, but perhaps the small boat had a prescriptive right in the matter. At any rate, it was vigorously manned by a woman, who took tuppence from each of us for her service, and presently earned it by the interest she showed in our getting to the Archbishop's palace, or villa, the right way.|$|E
