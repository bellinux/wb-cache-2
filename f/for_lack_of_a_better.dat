25|$|Dosage of {{chemotherapy}} can be difficult: If the dose is too low, {{it will be}} ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side-effects) will be intolerable to the patient. The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated body surface area (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a nomogram, using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans. The study only included 9 human subjects. When chemotherapy {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, the BSA formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> option.|$|E

In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy."

Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of sound and image cues our perception that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> word, sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records.

500|$|The Stuka {{operated}} {{with considerable}} success in {{close air support}} and anti-shipping at the outbreak of World War II. It spearheaded the air assaults in the invasion of Poland in September 1939. [...] Stukas were crucial in the rapid conquest of Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in 1940. Although sturdy, accurate, and very effective against ground targets, the Stuka was vulnerable to contemporary fighter aircraft, like many other dive bombers of the war. During the Battle of Britain its lack of maneuverability, speed and defensive armament meant that it required a heavy fighter escort to operate effectively. [...] After the Battle of Britain the Stuka operated with further success in the Balkans Campaign, the African and Mediterranean theaters and {{the early stages of}} the Eastern Front where it was used for general ground support, as an effective specialized anti-tank aircraft and in an anti-shipping role. [...] Once the Luftwaffe lost air superiority, the Stuka became an easy target for enemy fighter aircraft on all fronts. It was produced until 1944 <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> replacement. By the end of the war ground-attack versions of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 had largely replaced the Stuka, but Stukas remained in service until the end of the war.|$|E

2500|$|This {{technique}} of separating the 3D image {{has been called}} a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film The Power of Love. Calum Marsh of The Dissolve said that [...] "the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched.

[...] David Ehrlich of The Dissolve has described the technique as a [...] "choose your own adventure" [...] shot and wrote that [...] "by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard has found a way for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. Goodbye To Language effectively argues that every cut is porous, and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory." [...] Amy Taubin of Film Comment called the shot [...] "a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence" [...] and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival.
