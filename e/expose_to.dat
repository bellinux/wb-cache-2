5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were to educate people in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to <b>expose</b> <b>to</b> the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The book , co-written by {{the three}} bodyguards fired the {{previous}} year, was published on August 1. It was the first <b>exposé</b> <b>to</b> detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse. Genetic analysis of a hair sample in 2014 found evidence of genetic variants that could have caused his glaucoma, migraines and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, his drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that most likely had damaged his brain.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to <b>expose</b> <b>to</b> the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

For those children <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the aggressive model, the number of imitative physical aggressions exhibited by the boys was 38.2 and 12.7 for the girls (: 89). The results concerning gender differences strongly supported Bandura's prediction that children are more influenced by same-sex models. Results also showed that boys exhibited more aggression when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> aggressive male models than boys <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> aggressive female models. When <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> aggressive male models, the number of aggressive instances exhibited by boys averaged 104 compared to 48.4 aggressive instances exhibited by boys who were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> aggressive female models.

25|$|Aesthetic {{collections}} : Some collections {{consist of}} coins which could {{fit into the}} other categories, and on coin grading may be graded poorly due to not conforming to their systems. These collections {{are made up of}} coins which are pleasing to the owner and to others not due to perfect condition, but rather due to the uniqueness of the coin based on several factors. These can include patinas which form from being exposed to acidic or basic environments (such as soil, when coins are excavated), and warping or wearing which come from use in circulation. Very interesting patinas and patterns can form on coins which have been naturally <b>expose</b> <b>to</b> environments which can affect the contents of the coin. Examples include naturally blackened Victorian pennies, which have only the most raised surface showing the underlying copper, meaning that the head is clearly presented. Many collectors often find discolored coins from the same year which are remarkably different, which makes for added categorization and enjoyment.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this opinion}} {{apparently}} altered by 1993, when script-writers decided that Pete's storyline {{had come to}} a [...] "natural end" [...] and he was written out. Peter Dean went public with his criticism of the show, believing {{there was a lot more}} his character had to offer and that the failure to come up with decent material for Pete was due to unimaginative scriptwriters. His <b>exposé</b> <b>to</b> The Sun newspaper included his suspicions of set secrets, such as earlier plans to write Pete out and his opinions about former co-stars. Following Dean's exposé, Pete was killed off-screen seven months after his initial exit. Peter Dean speculated that Pete's off-screen killing was a result of the exposé. Although this accusation has never been confirmed by the BBC, show creator Julia Smith had publicly decreed that derogatory stories sold by cast members to the press about the show's production would not be tolerated, and any cast member doing so would not return to the show.|$|E
