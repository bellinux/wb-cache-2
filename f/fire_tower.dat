25|$|Its views {{have been}} {{described}} as the finest from any Catskill <b>fire</b> <b>tower,</b> and it is a common destination for hikers. Aspiring members of the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club come because the peak is required for membership, other hikers come to complete the Adirondack/Catskill <b>Fire</b> <b>Tower</b> Challenge, and some come just for the view from the tower itself.|$|E

25|$|For {{those not}} able to get too close to it, the waterfalls can be seen in their {{entirety}} in the distance from the northern approach to the summit of Kaaterskill High Peak, across the clove, and sometimes even from the <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> on Hunter Mountain.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{strategic}} location, {{in the past}} the neighborhood was the site of two <b>fire</b> <b>towers,</b> Arapzade Tower and Ayarcıbaşı Tower.|$|R
50|$|Although many <b>fire</b> lookout <b>towers</b> {{have fallen}} into {{disrepair}} {{as a result of}} neglect, abandonment, and declining budgets, some fire service personnel have made an effort to preserve older <b>fire</b> <b>towers,</b> arguing that a good set of human eyes watching the forest for wildfire can be an effective and cheap fire safety measure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> lookout <b>towers</b> are an {{important}} part of American history and several organizations have been founded to save, rebuild, restore, and operate <b>fire</b> lookout <b>towers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The blue-blazed old {{road to the}} <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> {{from the}} {{southwest}} is {{the most commonly used}} route to the summit. While most who take it do so on foot, it is also blazed for horses and has recently been renovated and slightly rerouted for them. Cross-country skiers also use it in the winter as well.|$|E

25|$|The Hunter Mountain <b>Fire</b> <b>Tower</b> {{is located}} on the summit of the eponymous mountain, second highest of the Catskill Mountains in the U.S. state of New York. It was the first of 23 fire lookout towers built by the state in the region, and the {{next-to-last}} of the five still standing to be abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} <b>fire</b> lookout <b>towers</b> predates the United States Forest Service, founded in 1905. Many townships, private lumber companies, and State Forestry {{organizations}} operated <b>fire</b> lookout <b>towers</b> {{on their own}} accord.|$|R

25|$|Hunter, {{like many}} other Catskill peaks, has a wide flat summit covered with forest. Since the entire Catskill range is below tree-line, {{360-degree}} views are extremely rare. The only ones available are from the <b>fire</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Graham and Doubletop mountains, Balsam Lake's higher {{neighbors to}} the east, {{dominate}} {{the view from the}} <b>fire</b> <b>tower,</b> with Slide, the highest Catskill peak, between them in clear weather. In the best of conditions the Blackhead Range at the northeast corner of the Catskills is visible as well. To the north Dry Brook Ridge appears as a single peak rather than a long ridge, with Bearpen, highest peak in New York outside the Forest Preserve, visible in clear weather. Westward Woodpecker Ridge and the eastern summit of Mill Brook Ridge are closest, and in the distance the view looks down on the lower peaks in eastern Delaware County, with Mount Pisgah, home to Ski Bobcat, standing out above most of them. South the view takes in the Beaver Kill Range, with Peekamoose, Table and Red Hill and its <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> also visible. In clear weather the Shawangunk Ridge is also visible to the southeast, and Elk Mountain, highest peak in Northeastern Pennsylvania, is on the southwest horizon.|$|E
25|$|Panoramic {{views of}} not only the {{mountains}} but the adjacent Hudson Valley, Massachusetts, Connecticut and sometimes southwestern Vermont are available from it. Likewise, {{it can be seen}} from many of the surrounding mountains, the village of Hunter and the upper slopes of the ski area. It is the highest <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> still standing in the state and the second-highest in the entire Northeast.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{approached}} from three directions. The two most common use the Dry Brook Ridge Trail, blazed with blue plastic markers, {{to connect to}} the red-blazed Balsam Lake Mountain Trail, which makes a short loop across the summit. South of the <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> it connects to the yellow-blazed Mill Brook Ridge Trail, which offers a longer approach from the west over that mountain.|$|E
50|$|Barton Knob is a {{mountain}} summit located on Cheat Mountain in southeastern Randolph County, West Virginia. Easily accessible during warm-weather months, Bickle Knob {{is also home}} to {{one of the few remaining}} <b>fire</b> <b>towers</b> in Monongahela National Forest.|$|R

50|$|The {{tower was}} used {{until the end}} of the 1988 season and was officially closed in early 1989 when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation {{determined}} that airplanes were more effective for spotting <b>fires</b> than <b>fire</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the century}} {{interest}} in restoring and preserving the <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> led to a local fundraising campaign after DEC proposed to remove it as a structure incompatible with the Forest Preserve. It was reopened in spring 2001 and listed on the National Register in late 2001. A new extension of the Long Path along the ridge past Carl Mountain to Plateau Mountain was opened that year as well.|$|E
25|$|The Catskill Center for Conservation and Development and DEC {{helped the}} {{communities}} near the fire towers form the Catskill <b>Fire</b> <b>Tower</b> Restoration Project. Volunteers {{in the area}} raised $16,000 through benefit concerts and art exhibits. DEC employees and AmeriCorps volunteers began restoring the tower in 1999, putting in new stairs and a new roof and windows for the cab. After new ironwork was installed, the tower reopened in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the state {{replaced}} the 1918 cabin {{with the current}} one. Unlike older observer's cabins in the Forest Preserve, the one on Balsam Lake lacks a porch. This was the most significant change to any aspect of the <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> complex after {{the construction of the}} current tower. During that time the observers were busy. A drought in 1962 led to many fires, and similar conditions the following year resulted in Governor Nelson Rockefeller ordering the closing of the Forest Preserve in 1963 and again for short periods the following year.|$|E
5000|$|In Queensland, {{construction}} of <b>towers</b> for <b>fire</b> detection commenced during the mid-1930s {{as part of}} a fire protection system which also included firebreaks [...] <b>Fire</b> <b>towers</b> continued to be erected as plantations were established through the 1940s and the 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|... 1933-1938The Civilian Conservation Corps makes {{important}} {{contributions to the}} state's forestry efforts. 52 <b>fire</b> <b>towers</b> were constructed. Hundreds of miles of woods trails were made. Almost 15 million trees were planted. Over 6,000 acres of timber stand improvement work was carried out.|$|R
25|$|In 1889 {{members of}} the Balsam Lake Club built the Catskills' first <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> on the summit of Balsam Lake Mountain; twenty years later, after the fires two drought-plagued summers had taken a heavy toll on the forests, the state's Forest, Fish and Game Commission (FFGC) took it over {{as part of a}} new strategy, proven {{successful}} in Maine. of putting trained observers in strategically placed towers to spot the first traces of fire and report its location via dedicated telephone lines. The state built its first tower on Greene County's highest peak, Hunter Mountain later in 1909, and within a decade there were several others throughout the range and in the nearby Shawangunks.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 {{the state}} briefly closed the tower, {{but it was}} reopened the next year due to {{problems}} with communications in that region. The Dibbles sold their farm in the early 1980s, and the new owner was not as hospitable to hikers, closing it off to all but state access per its easement. Shortly afterward it was closed, as the fire risk to the region had declined since the early 20th century due to {{the decline of the}} railroads and logging and the public's greater vigilance in reporting fires. But a renewed period of heavy fires led the state to reopen it in 1987. This time it remained in use until 1990, the last <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> in the Catskills to be closed.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of the crash, Saint-Donat villagers {{remember}} hearing the noise of a large aircraft passing overhead and moments later an impact. Jos Gaudet, then on duty in <b>fire</b> <b>tower</b> number four at Archambault lake did see the light emitted by the burning wreckage on top of the mountain but thought of it as the reflection of the sun on a moist rocky slope. On the morning of the crash Gaudet and Georges Moore took a boat around lake Archambault to look for signs of wreckage such as oil slicks or debris, believing that the aircraft had fallen in the water. Later on, Mr. Moore went to the town hall to alert the military authorities but his claim was dismissed as being implausible.|$|E
