The days were crisp and mellow, with warm {{sunshine}} and a tang of frost in the air, mingled with the woodsy odours of the withering grasses. The hens and turkeys prowled about, pecking at windfalls, and Pat made mad rushes at them amid the fallen leaves. The world beyond the orchard was in a royal magnificence of colouring, under the vivid blue autumn sky. The big willow by the gate was a splendid golden dome, and the maples that were scattered through the spruce grove waved blood-red banners over the sombre cone-bearers. The Story Girl generally had her head garlanded with their leaves. They became her vastly. Neither Felicity nor Cecily could have worn them. Those two girls were of a <b>domestic</b> <b>type</b> that assorted ill with the wildfire in Nature's veins.

40|$|Mobilizing {{sufficient}} {{resources is}} essential for supporting environmental activities in developing countries, and cofinancing is generally considered an important tool to help developing countries increase the resources they need. Moreover, cofinancing should increase ownership of projects by local authorities while improving accountability.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the cofinancing ratio and its determinants using projects financed by the GEF Trust Fund. The empirical results confirm that {{the rules of the}} fund, requiring different minimum cofinancing ratios by size and focal area of the GEF projects, do matter.

It provides a conceptual {{comparison of the}} two prevalent <b>domestic</b> <b>types</b> of multiunit franchising in the U. S., area development and sequential multi-unit franchising. The suggestions provided in this paper focus on the philosophical distinction of these two categories of aspiring franchise owners, suggesting that a prospective franchisee’s decision for {{a particular type of}} franchise can be likened to a consumer’s purchase decision. It is argued that sequential multi-unit operators have more of an entrepreneurial motivation than area developers, who are labeled “investors”, and that this underlying difference in philosophy might influence the decision process. It is suggested that a clear need exists for marketing researchers to understand the emergence of such important and pervasive marketing institutions as franchise businesses, and this article is considered a step in this direction...|$|R

50|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{powerful}} <b>domestic</b> <b>type</b> of organized crime in Slovakia are the criminal clans that emerged among the impoverished southern Slovakia Hungarian minority communities. The local Hungarian mob {{is one of the}} oldest organized criminal entities and has been active since the fall of communism in the country. Their main activities are the trafficking and smuggling of narcotics, mainly heroin, people smuggling, extortion schemes involving kidnappings and contract killing. They have connections with groups tied to the Russian mafia, in Slovakia as well as in neighboring Hungary.In contrast to the more limited activities of the Slovak gangs in major cities of the country, the Hungarian criminal clans in the south of Slovakia are regarded to be exceptionally violent. The brutality of the southern Hungaro-Slovak clans reached its pinnacle in 1999, when crime lord Tibor Papay was gunned down in a local restaurant along with 10 henchman by an AK-47. This moment is regarded as the most disturbing gang massacre in the history of Slovakia.|$|E

Not understanding how Dinah could have such shallow friends, Hart confided his frustrations to Bridget, which only fueled Dinah's jealousy. Finally, fearing she was about to lose Hart, Dinah agreed to tell her friends that they had to leave. Believing Jean Luc's words that Hart was trying to turn her into a <b>domestic</b> <b>type,</b> Dinah made a turnaround and refused to tell her friends to leave. Although she and Hart tried to settle their differences, she kept finding herself drawn to the jet-setting life and finally the couple decided they were incompatible and broke up in 1997. Her mother had mysteriously died but was later found alive and well; she had been battling an illness and when told that passing on the illness was a possibility, Dinah began to have second thoughts about having children with Hart, whom she had eventually reunited with, something that didn't please him. When Dinah continued to have doubts about having children, despite Hart's having learned from Vanessa's doctor that the possibility was slight, it became apparent that perhaps Dinah just didn't want to have children.

Mom Fanny was a typical <b>domestic</b> <b>type,</b> the family power center but in a low-key way. Young son Junior was a lot like Chester Gump, but he did have an occasional fabulous adventure, such as joining a circus and touring with them for months. Teenage daughter Betsy, a typical young woman of the flapper era, was the only one who didn't have an analog in the other strip. Despite its similarity to an established property, The Nebbs caught on and appeared in about 500 papers. In fact, it was in most of the Hearst papers, despite being distributed by a rival of Hearst's King Features Syndicate, because William Randolph Hearst himself liked it. But it never reached the stellar heights of The Gumps. There were a few Big Little Books in the 1930s, a short-lived radio show in the mid-'40s, and not much else in the way of merchandising or media spin-offs.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, the Concord Police Department {{referred}} to Free Staters as domestic terrorists {{in a federal}} grant application to the United States Department of Homeland Security for a Lenco BearCat, stating: [...] "The State of New Hampshire's experience with terrorism slants primarily towards the <b>domestic</b> <b>type.</b> We are fortunate that our State has not been victimized from a mass casualty event from an international terrorism strike however on the domestic front, the threat is real and here. Groups such as the Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire are active and present daily challenges." [...] Gericke responded by saying: [...] "The Concord NH Police Department has made false and misleading statements in a grant application for $258,024 in federal funds from the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") to receive a Lenco BEARCAT armored vehicle… I am alarmed and appalled at the cleverly worded insinuation that the FSP is a domestic terrorist threat, or that 'Free Staters' are 'active' and 'present daily challenges' to the Concord Police Department.Individuals who {{sign up for the}} FSP generally subscribe to the non-aggression principle, an ethical stance which asserts that 'aggression' is inherently illegitimate. 'Aggression' is defined as the initiation of physical force against persons or property, the threat of such, or fraud upon persons or their property. Our website specifically states: 'Anyone who promotes violence, racial hatred, or bigotry is not welcome.'The New Hampshire Constitution states: 'All men are born equally free and independent; therefore, all government of right originates from the people, is founded in consent, and instituted for the general good.' To discriminate against 'Free Staters' for their pro-liberty, pro-peace, small government ideological beliefs, and to defame an organization in the manner set forth in the DHS grant is unconscionable, and unconstitutional." [...] When the matter was brought before Concord's City Council, the issue was tabled after many residents came out to voice their opposition to the city's purchase of such a vehicle. Gericke and other activists led a campaign to stop the city from accepting the money based on false claims. In the end, the council voted to accept the grant and buy the BearCat. However, John Duvall, Concord's Chief of Police, did resign after the incident.|$|E

40|$|It has {{previously}} been suggested that the coconut populations of Pacific islands arose by introgression between wild types that disseminated by floating from an ancestral center of origin and <b>domestic</b> <b>types</b> that were brought in small boats from a center of domestication. This simplistic model {{is complicated by the}} subsequent movement of the introgressed germ plasm in large boats, particularly following the industrialization of coconut growing for copra in the late 19 th century. Although copra is no longer an attractive article of trade, the coconut palm continues to be an attractive eco-amenity for the tourist industry. The occurrence of epidemic lethal diseases in previously important copra producing areas, and the increasing opportunity for pathogens and vectors to be transmitted by innocent tourists and uninformed landscape developers is a potential threat to coconuts and other palm species. It has also been suggested that disease resistance arose during domestication. If that is so, then the ability to use molecular techniques to characterize coconut varieties will help accelerate selection, which presently can only be based on survival in long-term field exposure trials...|$|R

50|$|John Muir was {{to bring}} this {{important}} project to the newly formed practice. Work on the Waller Estate was to last for over a decade, with their Ballarat office servicing {{the development of this}} ongoing project. Australia experienced severe housing shortages after World War II. Private housing developments were to become common at this time, and were to profoundly change the pattern of Australian residential development. The Waller Estate is said to represent the first and most intact example of housing development built by a private consortium in Ballarat. John Muir and the practice of Muir and Shepherd are attributed to the design {{of the majority of the}} houses built by the Waller syndicate within this estate. To create architectural diversity throughout the development Muir was commissioned to design a variety of <b>domestic</b> <b>types.</b> It has been noted that in a number of the firms designs that although the front elevations were similar, the plans differed. Described as post-war suburban, most of these houses were brick veneer in construction with terracotta roof tiles with small front porches and windows that wrap around corners. This estate was developed by the Waller consortium until 1961.|$|R
