A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder.

Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E

50|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that burnout is etiologically, clinically, and nosologically similar to depression. In a study that directly compared depressive symptoms in burned out workers and clinically depressed patients, no diagnostically significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups; burned out workers reported as many depressive symptoms as clinically depressed patients. Moreover, a study by Bianchi, Schonfeld, and Laurent (2014) showed that about 90% of workers with full-blown burnout meet diagnostic criteria for depression. The view that burnout is a form of depression has found support in several recent studies.|$|E

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 15 male athletic voluntaries to participate in this study and did two intensive aerobic and anaerobic tests in a 2 experimental trials separated by at least 10 day. Blood sample were taken before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after tests to analysis number of circulating leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes. Results: A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of leucocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of neutrophils before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of monocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of leukocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of neutrophils before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of monocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). These data demonstrate that intensive aerobic test was inducing increase leucocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, spatial in macrophage system. And also demonstrate that intensive anaerobic test was not inducing signification varied in immune system. Conclusion: The result is that a maximal aerobic test increase and strength the immune system and anabolic state can exercise testosterone and research has shown that this hormone can reduce immune system components...|$|R

50|$|Krubitzer and {{her team}} have decided to focus part of their {{research}} on studying the cortical evolution of the neocortex. It is known that the neocortex {{has the ability to}} adapt and change over time. This is an important feature that allows the brain function and connectivity to coordinate movements vital for an organism’s survival in a specific environment. Krubitzer {{and her team}} used a variety of different rodents and squirrels to test their hypothesis. They hypothesized that the level of cortical activity organization would be directly correlated with the specific connections in the brain based on the environment that the particular animal was accustomed. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> lab animals and wild caught animals as would be expected.Krubitzer varied the amounts of sensory stimuli that each test subject was exposed to early on in development. By doing this, she was able to track the organization of the cortex from early development on. One example of how she did this was altering the vision in an opossum in early development. Research found that when vision is lost early in development, other sensory systems will begin to take over that area and the cortex will re-organize itself {{to make up for the}} loss of this sensation.|$|E
5000|$|Weitzer {{has done}} {{research}} on police-minority relations in Israel, Northern Ireland, South Africa, and the United States, including studies of racial profiling and police misconduct and racially biased policing. His research has used multiple research methods including quantitative surveys of the public, in-depth interviews, archival research, and systematic observations of police-citizen interactions at [...] "community policing" [...] meetings. He conducted in-depth interviews and observations of police-citizen interactions in a major study of three neighborhoods in Washington, DC—funded by the National Science Foundation. Each neighborhood was either racially or economically distinct—a black middle-class community, white middle-class community, and an impoverished black community. Major <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> three neighborhoods in {{their perceptions of the}} DC police and the kinds of interactions and experiences neighborhood residents had with police officers. Prior to this study, Weitzer conducted major research on police-community relations in Northern Ireland, comparing four types of Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods and the impact of policing on each. The study resulted in his 1995 book, Policing Under Fire: Ethnic Conflict and Police-Community Relations in Northern Ireland. Recently, Weitzer has analyzed survey data on Arabs and Jews opinions of the Israel Police. In 2006, he published a book on Americans' views and personal experiences with the police, entitled Race and Policing in America: Conflict and Reform. This research project was followed by several studies of African Americans and the police in St Louis and East St Louis, published in Urban Affairs Review, Sociological Quarterly, and Journal of Contemporary Ethnography.|$|E

50|$|Fertilization {{rates were}} high for all gamete combinations, thus no {{evidence}} of gamete incompatibility between the species was noted. The larvae were reared according to the methods employed for A. planci and developed through the typical larval stages of bipinnaria and brachiolaria. Numbers of late-stage larvae were 10-29% of the original numbers of eggs, except for the A. brevispinus batch in which only a few normal late brachiolaria were seen. The subsequent development of the A planci batch and reciprocal hybrid batches followed the typical pattern of A. planci. There was settlement and metamorphosis into a five-armed starfish, 0.4-1 mm in diameter. They fed on encrusting algae. Many failed to develop normally, and six weeks after metamorphosis, 60 A. planci, 30 A. planci hybrids, six A. brevispinus hybrids, and no A. brevispinus starfish remained. It was impossible to distinguish the hybrids from A. planci during {{the early months of}} development, but when the hybrids were 200 mm in diameter, they were conspicuously different from this species. Hybrids showed intermediate features between the parent species. Spines were the immediately obvious feature, being intermediate in length between the species. In other features that distinguish A. planci and A. brevispinus, the hybrids were intermediate. The hybrids were variable, but no consistent <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two hybrids. Juvenile A. planci animals tended to have a 'bull's-eye' pattern on their aboral disks and this persisted in some adults. One of three adult A. brevispinus hybrids showed this pattern. None of the 12 adult A. planci hybrids showed it. None of the hybrids showed the pale marks between the bases of the arms that are characteristic of A. brevispinus.|$|E
