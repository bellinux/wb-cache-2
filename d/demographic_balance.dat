Senanayake's moderate, western-oriented United National Party led government {{which led to}} a split in the Tamil Congress. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the splinter Federal Party (FP or Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), contested the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which denied citizenship to Tamils of recent Indian origin, before the Supreme Court, and then in the Privy council in England, but failed to overturn it. The FP eventually became the dominant Tamil political party. In response to the Sinhala Only Act in 1956, which made Sinhala the sole official language, Federal Party Members of Parliament staged a nonviolent sit-in (satyagraha) protest, but it was violently broken up by a mob. The FP was blamed and briefly banned after the riots of May–June 1958 targeting Tamils, in which many were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes. Another point of conflict between the communities was state sponsored colonisation schemes that effectively changed the <b>demographic</b> <b>balance</b> in the Eastern Province, an area Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland, in favour of the majority Sinhalese.|$|E

Sample statewide calculations from Texas for three years (1998 - 99, 1999 - 2000, 2000 - 01) show stability in grade-specific measures for larger population groups and crucial grades. The statewide calculations for Native Americans in Texas show less stability, which may reflect the fact that net flows by population group measure the flow of classification in and out of categories as well as in and out of schools...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the fourth}} {{in a series of}} Working Papers {{published}} by the CDS on Kerala migration. Unlike the other three, this one is financed by the Kerala Government and the data were collected in UAE. The objectives of this Working Paper are to: document changes in the labour demand for different categories of emigrant workers, enumerate the emigration policies, examine employment and working conditions, wage levels and related problems of the Kerala emigrants, understand the education and training requirements of future emigrants to UAE. This paper is noteworthy {{in a number of ways}} for its contributions to our understanding of Kerala migration to the Gulf countries. It gives the most authentic estimate of the annual remittances to Kerala from the Gulf countries and from other parts of the world. The average annual estimate of the total remittances from all countries of the world is Rs 13, 815 crores for the period 1998 - 2000. Remittances from the Gulf countries alone would be about Rs 12, 640 crores. The paper concludes that changes in the immigration policy of the UAE government, completion of major infrastructure projects and economic recession in the region have reduced substantially the demand for unskilled and semi-skilled labourers in the UAE. The new policies are related to <b>demographic</b> <b>balancing,</b> emiratization, banning visa for unskilled Asian workers, large-scale mechanisation to make unskilled labour very expensive, etc. The UAE government has also stopped accepting applications for visas for unskilled workers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh with effect from 18 th July 1999. Future demand will be for categories of skilled workers, technicians, computer workers, heavy equipment operators, electrical workers and professional categories such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers and accountants.

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain).

25|$|Before the war, Lebanon was multisectarian, with Sunni Muslims and Christians {{being the}} {{majorities}} on the coastal cities, Shia Muslims being mainly {{based in the}} south and the Beqaa to the east, with the mountain populations being in their majority Druze and Christian. The government of Lebanon had been run under a significant influence of the elites among the Maronite Christians. The link between politics and religion had been reinforced under the mandate of the French colonial powers from 1920 to 1943, and the parliamentary structure favored a leading position for the Christians. However, the country had a large Muslim population and many pan-Arabist and left-wing groups opposed the pro-western government. The establishment of the state of Israel and the displacement of a hundred thousand Palestinian refugees to Lebanon during the 1948 and 1967 exoduses contributed to shifting the <b>demographic</b> <b>balance</b> in favor of the Muslim population. The Cold War had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the polarization that preceded the 1958 political crisis, since Maronites sided with the West while leftist and pan-Arab groups sided with Soviet-aligned Arab countries.|$|E
25|$|However, {{evidence}} of historical and recent protests {{suggests that the}} backbone of the protests are of peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanians disfranchised by liberal economic policies instituted in the country during the last decades. Specifically, previous mass protests include protests in 1989 in the city of Karak and other southern towns in the country known as April 1989 uprising (هبة نيسان) that led to reintroduction of democratic life. In 1996, bread riots erupted in Ma'an and other southern cities in Jordan as well. Both are predominantly of peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanian origins. More recently, the 2011–2012 uprising started with movements all over the country specially in towns with a predominantly east-Jordanian population known locally as Al-Hirak. Therefore, according to many analysts while protests in Amman might generates a media buzz about a revolution in Jordan, but discontent in rural Jordan among peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanians is what would really tip the scales. Regardless of identity and demographic sensitivities both groups tend to agree on the need for a more robust economy and a cure for Jordan’s crippling unemployment. However, many argue that the sensitive <b>demographic</b> <b>balance</b> in the country will ultimately decide how wide and deep political reforms will go.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{methods for}} {{producing}} Australian intercensal population estimates. Abstract Since the 1981 Census, the ABS has been producing estimates of estimated resident population (ERP) on Census year, and updates these with vital {{statistics for the}} intercensal periods. Estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ERP on each Census year have also been produced since the 1991 Census. However, the lack of sufficiently reliable births, deaths and migration data for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and the intercensal volatility in the Census counts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, do not {{make it possible to}} use the so-called standard approach to make intercensal estimates. Instead, ABS has produced population projections which have been widely used as a proxy for population estimates for various purposes. For some important users, however, this proxy is not sufficient or appropriate and therefore there has been significant demand from both government agencies and the community for intercensal population estimates. This paper investigates methods for producing intercensal population estimates. Due to the complexity of this task, the paper focuses on methods for estimates at the Australian level only. After highlighting key issues in data quality, and making an assessment of a series of historical ABS projections, the paper examines three key factors driving the growth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population and which should form part of any estimation method: (1) fertility levels and trends; (2) mixed parentage and births to non-Indigenous mothers; and (3) the extent of changing identification for Indigenous status on Census form. The paper concludes that the identification change plays a very important role and finds promise in using births registered in the last intercensal period to project identification change in the next Census. Building from these analytical results, the paper proposes an enhanced <b>demographic</b> <b>balancing</b> equation method for estimating intercensal population, and an iterative approach for estimating the intercensal population. The limitations of the proposed method and future directions are also discussed...|$|R

2500|$|In late 1943 {{and early}} 1944, after most Poles in Volhynia had either been murdered or had fled the area, the {{conflict}} {{spread to the}} neighboring province of Galicia, {{where the majority of}} the population was still Ukrainian, but where the Polish presence was strong. Unlike in the case of Volhynia, where Polish villages were usually destroyed and their inhabitants murdered without warning, in east Galicia Poles were sometimes given the choice of fleeing or being killed.

2500|$|The Qing began {{a process}} of {{settling}} Han, Hui, and Uyghur settlers into Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) starting in the 18th century. At {{the start of the}} 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census. However, a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han had been restored by 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation {{is similar to that of}} the early Qing period in Xinjiang. Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria). After 1831 the Qing permitted and encouraged Han Chinese migration into the Tarim basin in southern Xinjiang, although with very little success, and stationed permanent troops on the land there as well. [...] Political killings and expulsions of non Uyghur populations in the uprisings of the 1860s and 1930s saw them experience a sharp decline as a percentage of the total population though they rose once again in the periods of stability following 1880 (which saw Xinjiang increase its population from 1.2 million) and 1949. From a low of 7% in 1953, the Han began to return to Xinjiang between then and 1964, where they comprised 33% of the population (54% Uyghur), similarly to Qing times. A decade later, at the beginning of the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the <b>demographic</b> <b>balance</b> was 46% Uyghur and 40% Han; this has not changed drastically until the last census in 2000, with the Uyghur population reduced to 42%. Military personnel are not counted and national minorities are undercounted in the Chinese census, as in most censuses. While some of the shift has been attributed to an increased Han presence, Uyghurs have also emigrated to other parts of China, where their numbers have increased steadily. Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region, though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in northern Xinjiang Dzungaria, and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population.|$|E
