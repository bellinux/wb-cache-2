A policy <b>forming</b> <b>body</b> was formed with Lt. Col J.R. Bhonsle, Director of the Military Bureau, in charge and clearly placed under the authority of the IIL. Under Bhonsle served Lt. Col.

A number of the officers and troops who had returned to PoW camps, or had not volunteered in the first place, made it known that {{they would be willing to}} join the INA only on the condition that it was led by Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose was a hard-line nationalist, previously having won the presidency of Indian National Congress in the 1930s in the face of staunch opposition from Gandhi, who disagreed with Bose's approach to radical nationalism. Bose had, at the start of the war in Europe, escaped from house arrest to make his way first to Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. In a series of meetings between the INA leaders and the Japanese in 1943, it was decided to cede the leadership of the IIL and the INA to Subhas Chandra Bose. In January 1943, the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia. He accepted and left Germany on 8 February. After a three-month journey by submarine, and a short stop in Singapore, he reached Tokyo on 11 May 1943, where he made a number of radio broadcasts to the Indian communities, exhorting them to join in the fight for India's Independence. The INA was revived, and the units of dissolved INA were incorporated into Bose's army. The Hindustan Field Force formed the nucleus of the new INA's 2nd division, to form the 1st Infantry regiment. The first INA therefore formed the nucleus of the army under Bose's leadership, which he proclaimed the army of his Provisional Government of Free India. It drew a large number of civilian volunteers from Indian diaspora in south-east Asia, eventually growing to a unit of almost forty thousand soldiers.|$|E

40|$|We have identified, and {{followed}} the development of three macrogamete organelles involved {{in the formation of}} the oocyst wall of Eimeria maxima. The first were small lucent vacuoles that cross-reacted with antibodies to the apple domains of the Toxoplasma gondii microneme protein 4. They appeared early in development and were secreted during macrogamete maturation to form an outer veil and were termed veil <b>forming</b> <b>bodies.</b> The second were the wall <b>forming</b> <b>bodies</b> type 1, large, electron dense vacuoles that stained positively only with antibodies raised to an enriched preparation of the native forms of 56 (gam 56), 82 (gam 82) and 230 kDa (gam 230) gametocyte antigens (termed anti-APGA). The third were the wall <b>forming</b> <b>bodies</b> type 2, which appeared before the wall <b>forming</b> <b>bodies</b> type 1 but remain enclosed within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stained positively with antibodies raised to recombinant versions of gam 56 (anti-gam 56), gam 82 (anti-gam 82) and gam 230 (anti-gam 230) plus anti-APGA. At the initiation of oocyst wall formation, the anti-T. gondii microneme protein 4 positive outer veil detached from the surface. The outer layer of the oocyst wall was formed by the release of the contents of wall <b>forming</b> <b>bodies</b> type 1 at the surface to form an electron dense, anti-APGA positive layer. The wall <b>forming</b> <b>bodies</b> type 2 appeared, subsequently, to give rise to the electron lucent inner layer. Thus, oocyst wall formation in E. maxima represents a sequential release of the contents of the veil <b>forming</b> <b>bodies,</b> wall <b>forming</b> <b>bodies</b> types 1 and 2 and this may be controlled at the level of the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi body...|$|R

40|$|The oocyst wall of coccidian parasites is {{a robust}} {{structure}} that is resistant {{to a variety}} of environmental and chemical insults. This resilience allows oocysts to survive for long periods, facilitating transmission from host to host. The wall is bilayered and is formed by the sequential release of the contents of two specialized organelles - wall <b>forming</b> <b>body</b> 1 and wall <b>forming</b> <b>body</b> 2 - found in the macrogametocyte stage of Coccidia. The oocyst wall is over 90 % protein but few of these proteins have been studied. One group is cysteine-rich and may be presumed to crosslink via disulphide bridges, though this is yet to be investigated. Another group of wall proteins is rich in tyrosine. These proteins, which range in size from 8 - 31 kDa, are derived from larger precursors of 56 and 82 kDa found in the wall forming bodies. Proteases may catalyze processing of the precursors into tyrosine-rich peptides, which are then oxidatively crosslinked in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidases. In support of this hypothesis, the oocyst wall has high levels of dityrosine bonds. These dityrosine crosslinked proteins may provide a structural matrix for assembly of the oocyst wall and contribute to its resilience...|$|E

In order to understand the mechanism(s) by which nutrients are acquired by developing intracellular gametocytes and oocysts, we have performed uptake experiments using polystyrene nanoparticles (NPs) of 40 [*]nm and 100 [*]nm in size, as model NPs typical of organic macromolecules. Cytochalasin D and nocodazole were used to inhibit, respectively, the polymerization of the actin and microtubules. The results indicated that NPs entered the parasite at all stages of macrogametocyte development and early oocyst maturation via an active energy dependent process. Interestingly, the smaller NPs were found throughout the parasite cytoplasm, while the larger NPs were mainly localised to the lumen of large type 1 wall <b>forming</b> <b>body</b> organelles. NP uptake was reduced after microfilament disruption and treatment with nocodazole.

Three popular journals published both in the year 2000 and the 2015, were chosen for in-depth analysis of their contents (the periodicity of different topics was counted and compared).

The {{knowledge}} of regularities of deformation {{behavior of the}} processed confectionery masses with certain rheological properties allows to calculate parameters of shaping process and to select processing equipment for its carrying out. The article studies the obtaining of the rheological equation of deformation behavior of sugar dough in the conditions of monoaxial compression which is realized in sugar cookies dough pieces formation processes. The results of the pilot studies confirming adequacy of the offered rheological equation are presented. The behavior of an elastic-, viscous- and plastic body in the conditions of quasistatic test for creeping during which the set size is tension, and the measured one is relative deformation is considered. The main rheological properties of sugar dough received experimentally are given. Values of rheological constants are received and it is revealed that at 95 % confidential probability, the rheological equation for the general deformation of an elastic-, viscous- and plastic body adequately describes experimental data. The maximum fault thus makes 2, 3 %.
