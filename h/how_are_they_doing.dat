6000|$|I could wish here {{to offer}} a few respectful words {{on behalf of the}} calling so long the calling of myself and family, and the public {{interest}} in which is but too often very limited. We are not generally understood. No, we are not. Allowance enough is not made for us. For, say that we ever show a little drooping listlessness of spirits, or what might be termed indifference or apathy. Put it to yourself what would your own state of mind be, if you was one of an enormous family every member of which except you was always greedy, and in a hurry. Put it to yourself that you was regularly replete with animal food at the slack hours of one in the day and again at nine p.m., and that the repleter you was, the more voracious all your fellow-creatures came in. Put it to yourself that it was your business, when your digestion was well on, to take a personal interest and sympathy in a hundred gentlemen fresh and fresh (say, for the sake of argument, only a hundred), whose imaginations was given up to grease and fat and gravy and melted butter, and abandoned to questioning you about cuts of this, and dishes of that,--each of 'em going on as if him and you and the bill of fare was alone in the world. Then look what you are expected to know. You are never out, but they seem to think you regularly attend everywhere. [...] "What's this, Christopher, that I hear about the smashed Excursion Train? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> at the Italian Opera, Christopher?"

As to Lord Palmerston, the constant and wearing connection into which I have been brought with his lordship during the last few years is deserving of a pension. Then look at the Hypocrites we are made, and the lies (white, I hope) that are forced upon us! Why must a sedentary-pursuited Waiter be considered to be a judge of horseflesh, and to have a most tremendous interest in horse-training and racing? Yet it would be half our little incomes out of our pockets if we didn't take on to have those sporting tastes. It is the same (inconceivable why!) with Farming. Shooting, equally so. I am sure that so regular as the months of August, September, and October come round, I am ashamed of myself in my own private bosom for the way in which I make believe to care whether or not the grouse is strong on the wing (much their wings, or drumsticks either, signifies to me, uncooked!), and whether the partridges is plentiful among the turnips, and whether the pheasants is shy or bold, or anything else you please to mention. Yet you may see me, or any other Waiter of my standing, holding on by the back of the box, and leaning over a gentleman with his purse out and his bill before him, discussing these points in a confidential tone of voice, as if my happiness in life entirely depended on 'em.|$|E

40|$|The five Nordic {{countries}} have aggressive climate and energy policies {{in place and}} have already emerged to be leaders in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually “fossil free” by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition {{through the lens of}} three interconnected research questions: <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary for these five countries to achieve their low-carbon goals.

However, the section that follows emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and social justice and recognition concerns. The study concludes with implications for what such historical progress, and future transition pathways, mean for both energy researchers and energy planners...|$|E

40|$|In what follows, I want {{to recount}} {{a bit about}} a study I was {{commissioned}} to undertake for a major American corporation. It is perhaps best to let that corporation remain unnamed, yet be assured that it’s a company whose products you have almost certainly bought or otherwise acquired at numerous points in your life. The major {{purpose of the study}} was to gain insight into how contemporary American parents nurture their children. In order to develop consumable services and products, the company wanted to know: What does nurturing mean to parents, and <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> it? What are the parents ’ goals and ideals? What are the discrepancies? Or, as presented to me as an example, if parents take their children to the park, what’s the underlying reason or need to go there? It sounds, perhaps, very anthropological. I will argue in this paper that it truly was. But let’s take a minute to consider the time frame. Within the traditional academic anthropology paradigm, the time frame of this research makes it appear ludicrous, impossible, ridiculous, even blasphemous anthropology. I used perhaps some poetic license in the subtitle of this paper by boldly stating “three weeks to understand the nature of family life in the United States. ” In fact I had more time than that.

40|$|Title:		Every second week. A {{study on}} how co-parented {{children}} do family. The {{aim of the}} study is to explore children’s day-to-day experiences of co-parenting. It focuses on how the children actively participate in the process of shaping family life and their own childhoods in the context of family change. The study addresses the following questions: •	What characterizes co-parented childhood? •	What are the children’s day-to-day experiences of co-parenting? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> family? •	How do the children talk about their family and family life? The study is based on a qualitative method and consists of semi-structured interviews with eight co-parented children aged nine to thirteen. The starting point is the view of children as social actors and hence involved in interactions, negotiations and the construction of their social worlds. Thus the theoretical framework is based on the sociology of childhood, as well as the theoretical concepts of doing family, family practices and negotiation. These children’s experiences take place in the context of late modern society where family life is being transformed by changes in family structures, due to for example high rates of divorce. After the parental separation the children have to find new ways of living, sharing their time between their two parents on a 50 - 50 basis. Co-parenting is one among several models of post-divorce family life, and is an arrangement increasing rapidly in Sweden. Since it is a rather new model, no templates exist of what it should be like. Accordingly, these children are engaged in shaping –and displaying- new ways of doing family and creating new kinds of family relationships. The children conceptualize family in terms of relationships rather than blood ties or legal ties. Furthermore, in their view a family is based on practices and a common home (or in this case, one with each parent). According to these children, what is most important is the quality of the relationships. In line with this argument, what matters to them is being able to keep a close relationship with both their parents, which they stress is only possible as long as they share an everyday life. Despite the fact that the children themselves construct families based on ties of love and affection, most of them with open boundaries, they still voice the concept of the nuclear family when it comes to spontaneous reactions or describing their possible future family. Thus there are large contrasts between the open family boundaries of their own families and the nuclear family norm, which after all is present in their narratives. This indicates a complex relationship between personal views and underlying norms. One conclusion is that these children are pioneers as they {{are in the process of}} constructing new ways of doing family; co-parented family...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{market for}} {{scientific}} and technical information (STI) {{has been dominated by}} publishers from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands. This book {{takes a look at the}} interesting developments in publishing coming from the countries with emerging economies known as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), which comprise 40 % of the world’s population and whose GDPs comprise 18 % percent of the world’s economy. Each of these countries has a unique economic system as well as differing systems of academic higher education and research. As a result, they have each developed different models of academic publishing for the dissemination of their research results, many of which are based on principles of open access. This book closes a gap in the literature of academic publishing by examining the strategies employed in STI publishing in these countries. As a growing part of the international STI market, they will impact the ways in which information is produced and made available in the future. The models examined here can serve as alternative options for information delivery in developed countries, and may serve as more sustainable models for emerging economies in Africa and Latin America. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa all developed their own way to open access, based on specific blends of green and gold road, public investment and private initiatives. What they have in common, is their commitment to research as a driver of economic and societal development and to open science as a way to enhance quality, impact and access to scientific information. Open access is not an end in itself but a means to better science. Twelve established information professionals and scientists from seven countries contribute to this book and help the reader to understand the open access situation in the emerging countries. <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> what they are doing, and why? Where are the bottlenecks, and what are the challenges? What can be learned? Each chapter is introduced by "Facts & Figures," a section with basic data about each country, on its economic performance, research and development, scientific output and open access publishing. Brazil: The first chapter presents the open access journal platform ScieELO, the most important open access server for scientific journals worldwide, with an impact well beyond Brazil. Russia: Chapter two provides a general overview on institutional initiatives for free dissemination of public research on the Internet, especially in the field of grey literature, in a society with strong traditions of public interest prevailing on private intellectual property. India: Along with a detailed description of the open access movement in India, the third chapter informs about awareness and acceptance of institutional repositories and open access journals among the Indian scientific communities. China: The author presents the results of a recent survey on the development of open access journals in China. This is interesting insofar as only very few titles are known and indexed outside of China. South Africa: The last chapter shows how open access can increase its impact and also protect local content, and how it can build on African cultural traditions and values of Ubuntu, i. e. relatedness, sharing and generosity. Each chapter tells a story, and each story is different. A virtual roundtable concludes the book, with a focus on shared values and engagement in the international community of open access and open science. This book provides an important overview of publishing trends in BRICS nations and will be of interest to anyone concerned with the future of academic publishing, including librarians, higher education researchers, and publishers. It also provides insights regarding copyright issues, the economics of publishing and STI, and international affairs...|$|E
