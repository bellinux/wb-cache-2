5000|$|As a caterpillar, H. thysbe {{feeds on}} cherry trees, <b>European</b> <b>cranberry</b> bush, hawthorns, dogbane, honeysuckle, and snowberry. [...] It burrows {{into the soil}} to overwinter as a brown, {{hard-shelled}} pupa. In the late spring, it emerges as an adult moth. H. thysbe lays green eggs {{on the underside of}} plant leaves, which hatch in about a week. [...] Development takes four weeks, after which the caterpillar spins a cocoon at ground level. [...] Two to four weeks later a moth emerges for a second breeding cycle before summer's end in southern climates. [...] In northern climates, H. thysbe has a single mating cycle per year.|$|E
40|$|Cuttings of Oxycoccus palustris Pers. clones were {{collected}} in the strict nature reserves and planted in the field collection of Kaunas Botanical Garden of Vytautas Magnus University in the years 1996 to 1999. Forty-four of the clones were chosen for the investigation of morphological variation of the above-mentioned species. Leaf size, leaf and berry shape, berry weight and shoot length were the evaluated morphological characteristics. Our investigations showed that leaf size, berry mass as well as berry shape is suitable for description of different <b>European</b> <b>cranberry</b> clones...|$|E
25|$|With {{the release}} of the new album, the group {{announced}} a tour which was to include dates in Europe, parts of the UK, and North America. The shows were scheduled in smaller venues, with live orchestral accompaniment. However, in May 2017, shortly into the <b>European</b> tour, The <b>Cranberries</b> had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as O’Riordan had health issues. The North American tour dates were cancelled in July when her recovery had not progressed enough for her to participate. , no new or rescheduled tour dates were announced.|$|R
40|$|Many {{cranberry}} growers on the Oregon coast {{are well}} aware that good pollination is necessary for quality fruit set. Multiple visits to the flower deliver more pollen, which can increase the percentage fruit set, number of seeds per berry, and mature berry weight. The better a bee is at delivering pollen to the flower, the fewer the number of visits required for adequate pollination. Typically growers rent hives of the <b>European</b> honeybee for <b>cranberry</b> pollination. However, honeybees have exhibited a general preference for lotus, gorse, other weeds and native plants over cranberry flowers. As a result, growers must bring in enough hives to saturate the surrounding area so {{that at least some of}} the honeybees will have no choice but to forage in cranberry beds. In addition, honeybees forage primarily in fair weather. Multiple studies have shown (and many people have observed) that honeybees will retreat to their hives once it begins to rain. Often, they will retreat even when the skies become overcast, which is not ideal behavior for working in stormy coastal weather. Further, with the recent concerns about Colony Collapse Disorder, attack by mites and other diseases, the supply of available hives has decreased. This shortage brings to light the need for an alternate pollinator—a native species that is not susceptible to the ills of honeybees. In the Pacific Northwest, there are over 200 species of native bees. Those species native to Oregon are acclimated to Oregon weather. Several species of bumblebees begin foraging hours before honeybees are active, and cease foraging at dusk when the honeybees have already been inactive for an hour or two. The advantages of having bees forage longer hours are obvious—the more time they spend foraging, the more flowers they will pollinate. In addition, Oregon's native bee species are often sighted foraging when it is drizzling while the warm-weather preferring honeybees are in their hives. Currently, little is known about the number and diversity of bee species present on the southern Oregon coast. This information is required for determining whether a better pollinator than honey bees is available for cranberries. By determining which species are present during bloom it will be possible to select a species that flies during bloom, and one that is also loyal to cranberries...|$|R

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] the Pacific Northwest, lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea ‘Minus’ L.) are both an old and a new story.

During the last Ice Age, indigenous flora moved south into the temperate areas of North America, Europe, and Scandinavia.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} fruit yield of Oxycoccus palustris under the climatic and habitat conditions of northern Wielkopolska (the Greater Poland region), depending on the type of occupied plant community. Total fruit number and fruit weight as well as average cranberry leaf size were determined on 33 plots with an area of 1 m 2, located on 7 peatlands. On the study areas, <b>European</b> <b>cranberry</b> produced crops from 9. 2 up to 242. 0 g &# 56256;&# 56457;&# 56256;&# 56323; m - 2, which gives 92 - 2420 kg &# 56256;&# 56457;&# 56256;&# 56323;ha - 1.

40|$|The wild-harvested {{fruit of}} Vaccinium oxycoccos (<b>European</b> <b>cranberry)</b> is used medicinally in many European and North American countries; the plant, however, is seldom cultivated. In order to {{optimize}} the collection strategy and improve the horticulturally important characters of V. oxycoccos clones, comprehensive investigations of the species are necessary. In the present study we investigated the phenological, morphological and genetic diversity of 29 clones originating from two wild populations growing in two strictly protected Lithuanian reserves, Čepkeliai and Žuvintas. During an ex situ collection at Kaunas Botanical Garden, we observed great phenological variation between the collected V. oxycoccos clones. The following morphological traits most clearly distinguished our study clones: leaf size, berry shape, berry size and fruit colour at full maturity. The genetic variation of V. oxycoccos clones from the two populations was assessed using RAPD and SSR. RAPD analysis conducted with 9 primers resulted in 146 polymorphic loci for the total sample, and SSR analysis with 5 primers revealed 29 alleles for the total sample. A greater degree of polymorphism was demonstrated for the Čepkeliai population than for the Žuvintas population. The study allowed the selection of several clones having promising morphological traits for further testing in the field...|$|E
