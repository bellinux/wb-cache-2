In other words, fake but true. That book and the present one were collections of art and political commentary, and the mistake he made in his introduction had no bearing on the power of his art or the usefulness of his commentary. We at that time canceled a new book that had been scheduled, and went through a demanding and difficult period of truth-telling and eventual reconciliation with Micah. Just as I do not believe in capital punishment, nor do I believe that we had a responsibility or even the right to censure Micah or to banish him indefinitely. We consider him part of our community and we consider that he and we both learned from his mistakes back then. The work in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> as strong as ever, and we're excited to be publishing him".

40|$|Book reviewCan {{mathematics}} be used {{to inform}} legal analysis? This is not a ridiculous question. Law has certain superficial resemblances to mathematics. One might view the Constitution and various statutes as providing "axioms" for a deductive legal system. From these axioms judges deduce "theorems" consisting of interpretation of these axioms in certain situations. Often these theorems are built on previously "proven" theorems, i. e. earlier decisions of the court. Of course some of the axioms might change, and occasionally a theorem that was once true becomes false; the former is a common feature of mathematics, the latter, though theoretically not possible in mathematics (since a theorem is by definition true) {{has been known to}} happen in mathematical practice as well. So maybe mathematics can help law scholars. That is certainly what Michael Meyerson believes. <b>His</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> "premised on the belief that there are many legal ideas that can be explained or clarified by mathematics. ...|$|E
