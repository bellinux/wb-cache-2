25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} induce biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result {{from the use of}} antibiotics as <b>growth</b> <b>promoters</b> in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in farmer’s ponds at field level of Muktagachha upazilla to find out the effect of <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> on <b>growth</b> performance and feed utilization of monosex Tilapia fish. <b>Growth</b> <b>promoter</b> was used in the experimental cultured farm. This growth enhancing aqua drugs was used in feeds of Tilapia. The results indicated that the <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> was the best treatment which significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) increased of all growth performances (final weight, AWG, ADG and SGR), improved FCR, and best economic efficiency. It was clearly observed that there were distinct impacts of <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> on fish <b>growth</b> and production. In the present study water quality parameters were within the suitable range. Production of Tilapia i. e. 4650 kg/acre in promoter treated ponds whereas 3666 kg/acre in non treated ponds were recorded. Food conversion ratio (FCR) was 1. 70 and 1. 38 were found in the controlled and treated pond respectively. Clinically the treated fishes did not show any remarkable changes. There were no adverse effects on water quality criteria among all experimental treatments. It could be concluded that the inclusion of the commercial probiotic Rapid Grow at a level of 0. 05 mg Kg- 1 diet at stocking density rate of 250 fish / decimal of mono-sex Tilapia O. niloticus is useful to get the best fish performance with friendly effects on the environment...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Pseudomonas spesies {{are one of}} the rihizobacterial {{group that}} have an&# 13; {{important}} role in plant <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> and plant health. To prepare them as inoculants, they must&# 13; have a range of characters as <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> such as Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) producers which can&# 13; promote the growth of plants and solubilize phosphates. In addition, they must also have the various&# 13; characters that act as biocontrol agents such as siderofor, chitinase and anti-fungal compound&# 13; producers. Approach: Pseudomonas sp isolated from soybeans rhizospere and identified based on&# 13; physiological reactions and 16 S rRNA gene sequences. Various tests for the determination of the&# 13; <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> were based on IAA production, phosphate solubilization and <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> of&# 13; length of root and stems and number of lateral roots of soybean sprouts. Test of siderophore, chitinase,&# 13; as well as anti anti-fungal compounds productions to inhibit the growth of Fusarium oxysporum,&# 13; Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium rolfsii, were used as a biocontrol agent determination. &# 13; Hypersensitivity test was used to screen for Pseudomonas sp classified as non-pathogenic&# 13; rhizobacteria. Results: Fourteen isolates identified as a non-pathogenic Pseudomonas sp that produced&# 13; IAA and Promoted enhancement of root length, shoot length, or number of lateral root. Among those&# 13; 14 isolates, 8 isolates showed phosphate solubilizing activity, 12 isolates capable of producing&# 13; siderophore and six isolates were observed to have chitinolytic activity. Only three isolates were able&# 13; to inhibit the growth of Fusarium oxysporum in high level. While one and two isolates inhibited&# 13; Sclerotium rolfsii and Rhizoctonia solani in high level, respectively. Conclusion: On the basis of&# 13; excellent <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> and biocontrol activities, we recommended 5 isolates of Pseudomonas sp&# 13; which were Crb- 3, Crb- 16, Crb- 17, Crb- 44 and Crb- 94 as potential isolates of Pseudomonas sp that&# 13; could be applied as inoculants of soybean plant...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate bird responses to flavophospholipol at higher doses than those recommended by the Brazilian legislation. A trial was conducted with 900 male broilers divided into five doses of flavophospholipol: 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg. The performance evaluation was conducted weekly until 42 days of age. The evaluated parameters were: weight gain, feed conversion corrected for mortality, feed intake and mortality. At the end of experimental period, birds supplemented with <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> differed from the negative control for weight gain and feed conversion in the period from 1 to 42 days. Body weight gain and feed conversion were significantly higher for birds fed 16 mg/kg of flavophospholipol, compared with treatment without the <b>growth</b> <b>promoter</b> in the period from 1 to 21 days. In the accumulated period from 22 to 42 days, all doses were different for the negative control for feed conversion and body weight gain. The performance improvement was maximized at the dosage of 10. 1 mg/kg for feed conversion ratio and 10. 9 mg/kg for body weight gain by regression analysis.
