5|$|In DNA, <b>fraying</b> {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} <b>fraying</b> social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fiancé {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fray</b> is a serine/threonine kinase {{expressed}} by the peripheral glia of Drosophila, whose function is required for normal axonal ensheathment. Null <b>fray</b> mutants die early in larval development and have nerves with severe swelling and axonal defasciculation. The phenotype {{is associated with a}} failure of the ensheathing glia to correctly wrap peripheral axons. When the <b>fray</b> cDNA is expressed in the ensheathing glia of <b>fray</b> mutants, normal nerve morphology is restored. <b>Fray</b> belongs to a novel family of Ser/Thr kinases, the PF kinases, whose closest relatives are the PAK kinases. Rescue of the Drosophila mutant phenotype with PASK, the rat homolog of <b>Fray,</b> demonstrates a functional homology among these proteins and suggests that the <b>Fray</b> signaling pathway is widely conserved...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fray</b> Pedro Baptista, {{superior}} of the Franciscan religious {{residing in}} Miako (Kyoto), attempted to mediate with the authorities, but without success.

Besides <b>Fray</b> Pedro Baptista, they included <b>Fray</b> Martin de Aguirre, <b>Fray</b> Felipe de las Casas, <b>Fray</b> Gonçalo, <b>Fray</b> Francisco Blanco, <b>Fray</b> Francisco de San Miguel.

The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory.

Though he was initially supposed to be making a rehab start in Double-A for the Reading Fightin' Phils that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 for a start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.|$|E

25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid <b>fraying</b> and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E

[...] The brushstroke remained a part of his works for the remainder of his career. He produced painted bronze sculptural versions of his brushstrokes throughout his career.|$|E
