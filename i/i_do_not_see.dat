25|$|In 2010, an {{anthology}} Islam and Homosexuality was published. In the Forward, Parvez Sharma sounded a pessimistic note about the future: “In my lifetime <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Islam drafting a uniform edict {{that homosexuality is}} permissible.” Following is material from two chapters dealing with the present.|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> how {{any person}} can devote himself too {{entirely to the}} cause of the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1949, Nixon, {{although}} {{anxious to}} advance his political career, {{was reluctant to}} run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary. He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote [...] "I seriously doubt if we can ever work our way back in power. Actually, in my mind, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the 1905 season got underway, Schulz {{contracted}} malaria in the spring. [...] Newspapers {{reported it}} was a [...] "serious attack" [...] and that he [...] "has been quite ill", but {{he was able to}} recuperate before the 1905 football season. [...] In October 1905, Coach Yost said: [...] "In looking over the whole bunch, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> anyone who has improved more than Schulz. [...] He is bigger and stronger than ever, and I do not know a man in the world that has it the least bit over him in the center position. [...] I would not trade him for any other center rush in the country today. [...] He looks good to me for the All-America team right now". [...] Though he was not selected for the All-America team in 1905, Schulz did receive All-Western honors.|$|E

500|$|Ashwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University {{wrote that}} in a liberal {{democracy}} freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from [...] "devastating and direct harm". He said that the cartoons [...] "create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its {{way of life is}} threatened. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless." [...] He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that {{it would be difficult to}} put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I know it will be difficult to put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> where else it can [...] and we must try to do it".|$|E
500|$|Sobers was met in Bridgetown by an {{enormous}} and hostile press storm. [...] "To {{say there was}} an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place," [...] the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as [...] "a white black man" [...] and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had [...] "abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular". Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he [...] "may not be welcomed anywhere by {{people who believe that}} justice is bigger than even sport". Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had [...] "never been bothered about criticism, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> why I should start now". Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' [...] "calm dignity in response to the primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians".|$|E

500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL {{had begun}} to change. It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I said in the past and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said to do otherwise would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, Käßmann {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} it might be better to tear down former and unused churches than to allow them to be used for purposes that could damage their image. As examples of such purposes, she mentioned conversion into restaurants, discothèques, or mosques. A reassignment to a synagogue, however, she found positive. After protests from Muslims, she slightly qualified her statement, saying: [...] "If a Christian congregation is convinced that the use as a mosque can happen in deepest peace, I concur, but at the moment <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> that possibility." ...|$|E

[...] Those Indians in the Southeast and elsewhere who were not on reservations, {{such as those in}} Robeson County, were considered to be United States citizens and thus the responsibility of state governments.
