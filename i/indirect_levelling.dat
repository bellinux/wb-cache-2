40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the determination of}} vertical movements of facility of the University of Ljubljana. The measurements which were carried out were performed in three epochs. For the measurements the digital level Leica DNA 03 and the precision levelling invar with bar code Leica GPCL 2 were used. Observations were offset by <b>indirect</b> <b>levelling.</b> We got leveled heights of the benchmarks and the precision for the determination of benchmarks. For the determination and movement analysis of benchmarks we used the programme DAH - Hannover strain analysis and programme PremikWin 1. The programme PremikWin 1 assumes the benchmarks as stable, if the movement is less than three times lower than the precision of the determination of vertical movement. Hannover strain analysis is a procedure which detects and determines the resulting movements with the method of statistical analysis. With this procedure we test the homogeneity of the accuracy of epochs, and perform a global test of network consistency between the two epochs and test the eventual movements on the observed object. In the thesis the both processes were presented and compared...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} Chinese local people’s congresses (LPCs) in the reform era (1979 onwards). It explores the dynamics behind this development and the role LPCs play in legal-political reform in China. Changes to LPCs are examined in the following areas: national laws and local regulations concerning the LPC system, organization and operation of the LPCs and their standing committees, elections for deputies at both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>level,</b> and the activities of deputies, including deputy-voter interactions. Based on empirical findings, this thesis argues that LPC reform involves top-down legal reform of the congressional system, social stratification, {{the emergence of new}} social classes, a new awareness of rights, and greater public participation. It concludes that through congress elections, Chinese people are increasingly educated and trained to exert their political rights; meanwhile, through congress operations the Party state is becoming more institutionalized, legalized, and pluralistic. That is the contribution made by LPCs {{to the rule of law}} and democracy in China. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Our frame-work differs significantly from typical p 2 p collaboration in that it provides a founda-tion for distributed applications to cooperate based on pre-existing trust and altruism among social peers. With the goal of facilitating the approximation of relative levels of altruism among social peers within F 3 DS, we introduce a new metric: SocialDistance. SocialDistance is a synthetic metric that combines direct levels of altruism between peers with an altruism decay for each hop to approximate <b>indirect</b> <b>levels</b> of altruism.

50|$|Water is an {{absolute}} necessity in human sustainability and human survival. There is no human activity that can be sustained {{without the use of}} water whether it be at a direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>level.</b> The United Nations declared access to water as a fundamental basic human right under articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant, which identifies and protects rights at an international level. In addition, the Millennium Development Goals of 2000 includes the sharing and fair allocation of water as a major goal. The United Nations and Millennium Development Goals oppose water privatization because water is a human right and every human being is entitled to water use. Equal access to water entails that no individual should be given privilege over the other at the absolute basic level. The sale of water cannot be permitted or justified under the United Nations at the basic level because water is seen as a universal human right. The right to water was created specifically to assist poor individuals in developing countries through attaining equitable access to water to prevent illness and death. Additionally, water rights are also associated with protecting the environment, strengthening the economy and strengthening the water delivery system.|$|R

These rates of turnover have remained steady (NCES, 2011). Schools are workplaces where teachers face a multitude of factors that collectively contribute to job satisfaction/dissatisfaction. Generally, research has indicated that administrative support has a profound effect on the experiences of new teachers (Ingersoll 2 ̆ 6 Kralik, 2004). The purpose of this phenomenological study is to examine 6 principals’ perceptions of the main factors behind teacher retention statistics and their personal perceptions of their role as a factor in the career decisions of new teachers. In-depth interviewing will investigate the following research questions: To what extent do the principals identify with the new teacher experience? What do principals perceive to be the main factors behind high attrition rates for new teachers, and to what extent do principals believe that new teacher retention is important? What do the principals do to support new teachers in schools, and how is this effort affected by their perceptions of the research on new teacher retention or contextual variables?

These international projects involve various actors called stakeholders, who can have a positive or a negative influence on the firm. The aim {{of this research is}} to examine the opposition that arises in international projects and how this resistance is practiced, analyzing the firm-stakeholder and stakeholder-stakeholder relationships that emerge during a conflict in a foreign direct investment. The theoretical framework is based on stakeholder theory. In previous literature, only few studies have examined the behavior and the existing relationships among stakeholder groups. In addition, opposition has been analyzed as exerted against the firm, and there is lack of exploration on how resistance can be shown against other stakeholder groups, leading to complex relationships during a conflict. The research is conducted through the analysis of Botnia case. Data consists of newspaper articles, and they are analyzed using qualitative content analysis as a method. Results show that stakeholders can develop supportive or opposing relationships with other groups, and that these relationships are usually dynamic and changeable. Besides, the analysis identifies several opposition tactics, which can be utilized at both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>levels.</b> These tactics are further examined utilizing Den Hond and De Bakker's (2007) classification of tactics. The study contributes to stakeholder literature by showing how previous research on opposition can be utilized to understand resistance among stakeholders, and how stakeholder relationships can emerge as a method to show resistance. In addition, it highlights the importance of understanding stakeholder behaviors in international projects, so managers can learn how to identify and anticipate opposition tactics in order to ensure the project success...|$|R

Two frameworks have been adopted in the study, namely; Nexus of Forces and Capability-Based Framework for Open Innovation. The first purpose of the investigation was to identify to what extent and in what ways does Nexus of Forces affects the knowledge capabilities within the Open Innovation environment. The second purpose of the investigation was to identify what practical implications does Nexus of Forces brings to the Open Innovation practices. The investigation was conducted on a single company – Swisscom – by following a case study strategy. The methodological approach for collecting the data was a mixed method approach with concurrent embedded strategy. The study has focused mainly on qualitative data and the quantitative data was nested with the focus to strengthen the findings. For the primary data collection, 6 respondents were selected, Expert A and Expert B for interviews and 4 managers for survey.   In regard to the first purpose, our findings have shown that practices of Nexus of Forces have strategical implications {{on the process of}} managing knowledge capabilities.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Gunn rat is an {{excellent}} animal model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type 1. The liver and small intestine synthesize no functional bilirubin uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase and, consequently, the animals cannot conjugate bilirubin. In prior studies, the authors have shown that 15 - to 20 -cm jejunal transplants from normal Wistar rats lowered but did not normalize serum bilirubin levels. Phenobarbital {{has been used to}} increase enzyme conjugation of bilirubin. HYPOTHESIS: Phenobarbital treatment of Gunn recipients of jejunal transplants from Wistar rats normalizes serum bilirubin levels. METHODS: Forty-three Gunn recipients of jejunal transplants from Wistar rats were divided into four groups: 1) heterotopically placed grafts (Thiry-Vella loops), saline-treated, n = 14; 2) heterotopically placed grafts, phenobarbital-treated (80 mg/kg/day), n = 17; 3) orthotopically placed (in intestinal continuity) grafts, saline-treated, n = 5; and 4) orthotopically placed grafts, phenobarbital-treated, n = 7. Serum was collected before operation and weekly for 8 weeks for measurement of serum total, indirect, and direct bilirubin levels. Animals received cyclosporine, 5 micrograms/kg, daily intramuscularly. RESULTS: Phenobarbital significantly augmented the bilirubin-lowering effect of heterotopic jejunal transplants (group 2). Mean total serum bilirubin fell from 9. 14 +/- 0. 01 to a nadir of 1. 63 +/- 0. 11 mg/dL at 6 weeks, after which time, levels began to rise toward baseline (as noted previously). Serum <b>indirect</b> bilirubin <b>levels</b> behaved in a similar fashion. Phenobarbital treatment "normalized" serum bilirubin levels in recipients of orthotopic Wistar jejunal grafts (group 4). Mean total serum bilirubin plummeted from 8. 41 +/- 0. 20 to 0. 76 +/- 0. 15 mg/dL at 1 week, and levels remained within the normal range for the entire 8 -week study period. Identical changes were observed for serum <b>indirect</b> bilirubin <b>levels.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The combination of phenobarbital treatment and orthotopic small bowel transplantation may be an appropriate therapeutic alternative to liver transplantation in the management of Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type 1...|$|R

A critical adult is capable of making the work aware, evaluating it properly and, {{on the basis of these}} facts, making the right decisions. People employed in an institution such as a nursery school, are supposed to be professional, adaptive, competent, knowledgeable and use forward-looking working methods. Because of this it is essential that the employees follow each other, coordinate and improve quality indicators in the field of professional development, employee contentment and mutual collaboration. L. Katz (1993) and L. Marjanovič Umek (2002) describe such issues as an <b>indirect</b> <b>level</b> of quality in nursery schools. As they emphasize, indicators at this level include relationships in which children are not directly involved, yet the relations between all participants have a significant effect on work and life in a nursery school. Different quality dimensions, which could be considered and improved by the in-depth perception of the employees, are presented at the beginning of the theoretical part of the MSc thesis. Various models to define and ensure quality, factors affecting the quality of a nursery school as a learning institution, the role of a head teacher and the influence on the organisational atmosphere and culture are presented according to the work of different authors. Results of the survey undertaken among the nursery school teachers show that they feel satisfied. However, they are eager to be more often engaged in professional decisions whereas the head teachers believe they allow mutual dialogue and equal treatment of all nursery school teachers. In principle, the head teachers, as well as the teachers, are of the same mind about the importance of the welfare, creating positive atmosphere and creative organisational culture in order to achieve good results. Managing staff and the teachers are yet in agreement that promoting professional development influences the individual’s, as well as the development of the staff.
