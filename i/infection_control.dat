5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and <b>infection</b> <b>control,</b> fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E

5000|$|Risk of {{infection}} is a nursing diagnosis which {{is defined as}} [...] "the state in which an individual is at risk to be invaded by an opportunistic or pathogenic agent (virus, fungus, bacteria, protozoa, or other parasite) from endogenous or exogenous sources" [...] and was approved by NANDA in 1986. Although anyone can become infected by a pathogen, patients with this diagnosis are at an elevated risk and extra <b>infection</b> <b>controls</b> should be considered.|$|R

25|$|As {{the first}} line of defense, {{healthcare}} systems and workers are particularly vulnerable.

40|$|Background: Healthcare-associated {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{has become}} a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers (HCWs). HCWs are inevitably exposed to TB, due to frequent interaction with patients with undiagnosed and potentially contagious TB. Whenever there is a possibility of exposure, implementation of <b>infection</b> prevention and <b>control</b> (IPC) practices is critical. Objective: Following a high incidence of TB among HCWs at Maluti Adventist Hospital in Lesotho, a study was carried out to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of HCWs regarding healthcare-associated TB <b>infection</b> and <b>infection</b> <b>controls.</b> Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed in June 2011; it involved HCWs at Maluti Adventist Hospital who were involved with patients and/or sputum.

25|$|Between February and June 2007, three {{patients}} at Loughlinstown Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, were {{found by the}} coroner to have {{died as a result}} of C. difficile infection.

25|$|Recommendations {{to prevent}} {{spread of the}} virus among humans include using {{standard}} <b>infection</b> <b>control,</b> which includes frequent washing of hands {{with soap and water}} or with alcohol-based hand sanitizers, especially after being out in public. Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution.|$|E
25|$|Rigorous {{infection}} protocols {{are required}} to minimize this risk of transmission. <b>Infection</b> <b>control</b> measures, such as wearing gloves and noncritical medical devices used for a single person with CDI, are effective at prevention. This works by limiting the spread of C. difficile in the hospital setting. In addition, washing {{with soap and water}} will eliminate the spores from contaminated hands, but alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective.|$|E
30|$|Signs of {{persistent}} hydrocephalus reappeared after 3  days, {{and the patient}} underwent an endoscopic 3 rd ventriculocisternostomy. This procedure did not suffice and a ventriculoperitoneal CSF-shunt had to be inserted after 2  weeks. After careful consideration the boy was given chemotherapy according to the MET-HIT 2000 -BIS 4 protocol during the following 40  weeks. He had several episodes with serious infections, including shunt infection. Following completion of the chemotherapy and <b>infection</b> <b>controls,</b> a new CSF shunt, now ventriculoatrial, was implanted, 14  months after the tumor resection.|$|R

25|$|Based on {{the results}} of this and other {{laboratory}} and clinical studies, St. Francis Private Hospital, a 140-bed facility located in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland, decided to become the first hospital in the world to fully specify hygienic copper door handles throughout its facility as part of its <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> program.

25|$|Concern {{pertains}} to the potential for cross-resistance or co-resistance to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed {{and there have been}} results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance. Results from a study published in The American Journal of <b>Infection</b> <b>Control</b> showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study).|$|E
25|$|In the {{developing}} world some people sell their organs illegally. Such people are often in grave poverty or are exploited by salespersons. The people who travel {{to make use of}} these kidneys are often known as 'transplant tourists'. This practice is opposed by a variety of human rights groups, including Organs Watch, a group established by medical anthropologists, which was instrumental in exposing illegal international organ selling rings. These patients may have increased complications owing to poor <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> and lower medical and surgical standards. One surgeon has said that organ trade could be legalised in the UK to prevent such tourism, but this is not seen by the National Kidney Research Fund as the answer to a deficit in donors.|$|E

Other measures include cyber hygiene − exercising caution when opening e-mail attachments and links, network segmentation, and keeping critical computers isolated from networks. Furthermore, to mitigate the spread of ransomware measures of <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> can be applied.
