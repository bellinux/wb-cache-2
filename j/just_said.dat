5|$|The initial {{announcement}} <b>just</b> <b>said</b> {{that there would}} be 5 categories of songs. The full track list was not released until July 6, 2009, with Universal Studios Florida unveiling thirty songs (6 in each category) that can be played during the ride.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

25|$|The {{vanishing}} of {{the second}} invariant means that some observers measure no gravitomagnetism, {{which of course is}} consistent with what we <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> The fact that the first invariant (the Kretschmann invariant) is constant reflects the homogeneity of the Gödel spacetime.|$|E
25|$|When {{people get}} on well, {{the outcome of}} a {{negotiation}} is likely to be more positive. To create trust and a rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent's behavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of what another person <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement. Mirroring can help create trust and establish a relationship.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I <b>just</b> <b>said</b> like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's {{enough of}} that <b>just</b> now,' <b>said</b> the locksmith. 'You needn't make any more of that confounded clatter. Breakfast's ready.' ...|$|R
60|$|That the {{converse}} {{of what has}} <b>just</b> been <b>said</b> of horses is true of men, in the three countries named.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Allewinde, [...] "that the {{prisoner}} {{agreed to join}} the men assembled at Mrs. Mehan's in ridding the country of Captain Ussher; now what was meant by ridding the country of him?" ...|$|R
25|$|Charles Hennebois {{touches on}} a {{wrenching}} aspect concerning the wounded. Some of them, {{instead of being}} transported to the hospital, were finished off {{on the field of}} battle: “Men wounded the day before were calling them from afar and asking to drink. The Germans finished them off by butting them with their rifles or bayoneting them, then despoiling them. I saw this from several metres away. A group of seven or eight men, felled by machine-gun crossfire, found itself at that point. Several were still alive, as they were begging the soldiers. They were finished off like I <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> shaken down and heaped up in a pile”. This claim is refuted in a German propaganda book about what happened in the camps published in 1918.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus <b>just</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would not}} tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Squad writer Joel Keller praised Phil and Claire's plot for {{recycling}} a standard television trope while still having [...] "the biggest laughs". Keller criticized the Mitchell and Cam subplot [...] "because Cam's personality was tamped down by sickness" [...] and later wrote, [...] "Yes, I <b>just</b> <b>said</b> you can rehash stuff if done well. This one wasn't done well." ...|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I had to say was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd <b>just</b> <b>said</b> those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. It was my fault, nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{so taken}} aback. I didn't like to refuse. He {{put the money}} in his pocket, <b>just</b> nodded, <b>said</b> 'Thanks,' and walked out." ...|$|R
500|$|Leonardo's {{most famous}} {{painting}} of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has <b>just</b> <b>said</b> [...] "one of you will betray me", and the consternation that this statement caused.|$|E
500|$|After the Dream Within a Dream Tour {{in support}} of Britney {{finalized}} in July 2002, Spears announced she would {{take a break from}} her career for six months. In November 2002, she revealed that she had started working on her next studio album. She explained, [...] "Well, actually, I <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that I wanted two or three weeks off. [...] And the whole world was like, 'Ohmigod, [...] she's gone..." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lennon in a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine: [...] "I {{was going home}} in the car, and Dick Lester suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in In His Own Write, {{but it was an}} off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... <b>just</b> <b>said</b> it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{go out of}} the barn, children. I'm {{going to}} lay an egg, and can't look after you <b>just</b> now,' <b>said</b> their mother one day.|$|R

500|$|Wal-Mart {{refused to}} carry the album as it {{contains}} a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members {{did not wish to}} change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, [...] "There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We <b>just</b> <b>said</b> no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis said, [...] "It {{was a huge}} thrill. I {{was excited}} to be picked by New York." [...] He {{received}} fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: [...] He <b>just</b> <b>said</b> they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game is live or die for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, {{and learning how to}} play under pressure in front of all those people. He loved it, and I'm looking forward to it, too.|$|E
500|$|According to {{animation}} director Yoo Jae-myung, Nickelodeon {{was initially}} reluctant {{to approve the}} series and suspended production because, unlike in almost all American animated series, the protagonist was a girl. Conventional wisdom, according to Konietzko, had it that [...] "girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls". The creators eventually persuaded the channel's executives to change their mind. Konietzko related that in test screenings, boys said that Korra being a girl did not matter to them: [...] "They <b>just</b> <b>said</b> she was awesome." ...|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{stopped and}} faced him. [...] "What {{do you mean}} by what you <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now? You <b>said</b> that I was the {{immediate}} cause of the tragedy, and you say that you were talking of Henrietta's--of Henrietta. I {{had nothing to do with}} her illness." ...|$|R
