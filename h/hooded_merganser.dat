Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, broad-winged hawk, common raven, hermit thrush, house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, whip-poor-will, and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as <b>hooded</b> <b>merganser</b> and wood duck, and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock. In addition to the commonly seen red-tailed hawk, other raptors include the northern goshawk and the golden and bald eagles.|$|E

50|$|The birds {{reflect the}} landscape. Many birds use the {{deciduous}} forest to {{nest in the}} spring. These include rose-breasted grosbeaks, black-throated green warblers, ovenbirds, and great crested flycatchers. The wetlands provide migratory resting areas for large numbers of ducks, particularly wood ducks, <b>hooded</b> <b>mergansers</b> and ring-necked ducks. Wood ducks and <b>hooded</b> <b>mergansers</b> often nest. There are recorded nests of both heron and osprey, and for about a decade in the 1970s there was a heronry of more than thirty nests. There are also records of nesting turkey vultures. Owing {{in part to the}} quality of the forest, there are at least four species of woodpeckers: downy, hairy, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and pileated. Barred owls are regularly heard and seen.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of their}} high {{reliance}} on aquatic prey, <b>hooded</b> <b>mergansers</b> are very susceptible to harm from many types of pollution, {{some of which are}} poisons that accumulate in the food organisms, directly poisoning predators high in the food chain, and some of which simply reduce the populations of their prey.|$|R
