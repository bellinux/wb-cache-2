However, dialectic thinking {{is not unique to}} Chinese culture. For example, pessimism and optimism can co-exist, resulting in tragic optimism. Death fear and death acceptance can also co-exist, resulting in the multidimensional Death Attitude Profile. Resources and deficits co-exist, as conceptualized in the Resource-Congruence Model. Thus, family can be resources for effective coping, but intra-family conflict can also be a deficit or stressor.|$|R

25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{has been linked}} to {{political}} ideology. In the 1972 U.S. Presidential election, research of college students found that those with an <b>internal</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control were substantially more likely to register as a Republican, while those with an external locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Democrat. A 2011 study surveying students at Cameron University in Oklahoma found similar results, although these studies were limited in scope and most likely suffered sampling biases as they were limited to only southern populations rather than nationally and southern populations have many political differences {{from the rest of the}} nation.|$|E
25|$|They {{also argue}} that health locus of control is better at {{predicting}} health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting that health value is an important moderator variable in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed. Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking <b>internal</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control with improved physical health, mental health {{and quality of life}} in people with diverse conditions: HIV, migraines, diabetes, kidney disease and epilepsy.|$|E

We examined the self-esteem, <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, and external health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and external health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and external health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control were contributors for <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to external health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact of self-esteem and health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control in schizophrenia.

2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have <b>internal</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them {{accept the fact that}} things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. Externals attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 208 employees of Bushehr University of Medical Sciences by using convenience sampling method. Data were collected by using standard questionnaires of health-promoting lifestyle and multidimensional health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. Data analysis done by SPSS software version 20. Descriptive indicators and linear regression test was used. Results: Among regression models which related to health promoting behavior and its six dimensions, only there was a significant association between total behavior, physical activity and interpersonal relationship dimensions. Between demographic factors and health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control only <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control explained the health promoting behavior and it explained health promoting behavior changes  within 3. 2 % (R 2 = 3. 2 %).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and functioning in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was investigated. The hypothesis {{was that an}} <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control {{would be associated with}} less impairment in functioning than other dimensions <b>of</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. Prior research undertaken into CFS has been inconsistent in its finding's and it continues to be an area of controversial interpretations. A repeated measures design was used, 74 people participated at the initial stage of the study and 67 people participated in the second stage. The Functional Limitations Profile was used to assess levels of impairment. The Multidimensional Health <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control was used to identify types <b>of</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control orientation, and the Shapiro Control Inventory was used to establish a clearer picture of control issues. Correlations and t-tests were used to investigate the {{relationship between}} health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and functioning.

Multiple regression analysis was performed and showed that an <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control could successfully predict functioning measured at the second stage of the study. An unexpected discovery was that a doctor's health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control impacted negatively on functioning.

The subjects included 22 male and 18 female outpatients in a hospital-based rehabilitation program. Subjects were classified as having an internal or external health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, and were randomly assigned to either a self-monitoring or a non-self-monitoring group. Improvement was assessed via objective performance data and self-ratings of perceived improvement. The results indicated that individuals identified as having an <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control did not show greater gains in physical functioning or perceived improvement relative to externally oriented individuals. Additionally, those subjects participating in self-monitoring activities were no different from non-self-monitoring subjects in terms of improvement in exercise activities or perceived improvement. The results also indicated no interaction between health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and {{the presence or absence of}} self-monitoring. It was suggested that other factors such as workman's compensation, pain patient characteristics, low self-concept, and severe stress may have proved more powerful influences on patient improvement than <b>internal</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control or self-monitoring. It was also suggested that rehabilitation programs might benefit from creating structured environments in which patients receive frequent staff feedback and reinforcement for improvement.
