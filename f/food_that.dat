5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of <b>food</b> <b>that</b> they could easily provide to the growing market.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of <b>food</b> <b>that</b> does not change much from day to day.|$|E
5|$|Japanese tempura is {{a popular}} deep-fried <b>food</b> <b>that</b> {{generally}} consists of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E

She also made excursions from the camp, looking for food, and would bring back rats and snakes to Williams. Judy had another group of puppies, of which five survived. One of them was given to the camp Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any <b>food</b> <b>that</b> the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left.|$|E
5|$|Falafel are fried balls or patties of spiced, mashed chickpeas or {{fava beans}} {{and are a}} common Middle Eastern street <b>food</b> <b>that</b> have become {{identified}} with Israeli cuisine. Falafel is most often served in a pita, with pickles, tahina, hummus, cut vegetable salad and often, harif, a hot sauce, the type used depending {{on the origin of}} the falafel maker. Variations include green falafel, which include parsley and coriander, red falafel made with filfel chuma, yellow falafel made with turmeric, and falafel coated with sesame seeds.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, <b>food</b> <b>that</b> contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was mainly}} <b>food</b> <b>that</b> the {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E

As an adult Levin retained his love of Jewish cookery along with his passion for French haute cuisine.|$|E

40|$|A {{treatment}} with differential or noncontingent reinforcement and nonremoval of the spoon increased {{the acceptance of}} one or two of 16 foods for 2 participants with severe food refusal. These differential levels of acceptance were demonstrated empirically in an ABAB design in which A was the presentation of the accepted (preferred) foods and B was the presentation of foods the participants refused (nonpreferred foods). Subsequently, we implemented a blending treatment that consisted of mixing (blending) nonpreferred foods into preferred foods in various ratios (e. g., 10 % nonpreferred/ 90 % preferred, 20 % nonpreferred/ 80 % preferred). We then presented nonpreferred <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> had been exposed to blending to determine if consumption of nonpreferred foods would increase following the blending treatment. We also conducted periodic reversals in which we presented nonpreferred <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> had not been exposed to the blending treatment. Following initial implementation of the blending treatment, consumption was high for nonpreferred <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> had been blended and low for nonpreferred <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> had not been blended. Consumption increased for all foods (i. e., <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> had been exposed to blending and <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> had not been exposed to blending) after seven or eight foods had been exposed to the blending treatment. Thus, the variety of foods consumed by the participants increased from one or two to 16. These results are discussed in terms of stimulus fading, conditioned food preferences, and escape extinction.

5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the <b>food</b> <b>that</b> may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} the <b>food</b> <b>that</b> one consumed and {{the clothes}} that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing {{was made of}} hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E

Urban males are more likely to overwinter in cooler climes than rural males, an adaptation made feasible by the warmer microclimate and relatively abundant <b>food</b> <b>that</b> allow the birds to establish territories and start reproducing earlier in the year.|$|E
