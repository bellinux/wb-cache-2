25|$|Chapter 2 {{is about}} {{economics}} {{as it has}} been practised in the years leading up to 2009. The author refers to Keynes's view that an over-reliance on maths is a mistake, because mathematical models will always depend on the validity of their underlying assumptions. Skidelsky says that modern mainstream macroeconomics has become closely integrated with maths, {{at the expense of other}} disciplines such as political economy and history, and that this is partly why it became so unreliable at making accurate predictions or offering <b>good</b> <b>advice.</b> Various schools of thought within modern economics are briefly discussed, such as rational expectations, real business cycle theory and efficient market theory.|$|E

25|$|Miley is {{especially}} close with her father, from whom she receives much <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> and emotional support. She also values her relationships with her best friends Lilly and Oliver. However Miley {{is shown to}} be very uncomfortable {{with the fact that}} they're dating and even stops them from being a couple. Her relationship with Lilly occasionally suffers the occasional setback, but they always make up. In the episode 'What I Don't Like About You', Miley is asked to choose a side between a fight Lilly and Oliver had. But Miley, showing what a kind friend she was, made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie, which made Lilly and Oliver forgive each other. Miley's relationship with her brother Jackson is often hostile. The two siblings constantly fight and trash talk each other. However, in a few private conversations, both Miley and Jackson say that they love and appreciate each other, but they are both unwilling to admit this in public.|$|E

In December 2016, it was announced Michelle would be returning to the show after 21 years, with actress Jenna Russell taking over the role making her first appearance on 24 December 2016. In her first stint Michelle made some huge mistakes during her time in Albert Square mainly through having a habit of choosing the wrong men and her stubborn nature meant that she rarely accepted help or listened to <b>good</b> <b>advice.</b> Being determined and outspoken, {{she has never been}} afraid to defend herself or her beliefs. Since the recast to Russell in 2016, Michelle's storylines have revolved around her having had an illegal relationship with her student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor) in America, a love triangle involving her niece Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), crashing her car into the local chip shop and being stalked by Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey).|$|E

Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had some very <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food.

40|$|Abstract – In {{the last}} years, {{usability}} and accessibility {{have entered the}} agenda of e-Government projects as important requirements for Web sites. Since then, compilations of guidelines have been proposed as a definite panacea for problems with the User Interfaces.

This paper presents a framework for User Interface design patterns whose main goal is to promote the efficient use of guidelines by {{people involved in the}} design of e-Government Web sites. This framework has been validated by an industrial project at SmalS-MvM which is devoted to the development of e-Government applications. Based on the lessons learned in this project, we discuss policies to promote such a framework in very large scale. 1...|$|R

The Sydney Morning Herald ran the {{headline}} [...] "Baggy Green Shame" [...] while The Australian wrote of the [...] "$11,000 price of disgrace". Many newspaper columns and {{letters to the editor}} attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that [...] "Waugh and Warne said yesterday they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy." [...] Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that [...] "Warne is in need of some <b>good</b> <b>advice,</b> but not from business managers and PR folk too happy to tell him how wonderful he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads". Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and the Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} in trade publications, with Paul's garb being {{cited as the}} weakest aspect by two {{different}} reviewers. Walton of The Moving Picture News, praised the film as a success, but did not provide any details as to why it was successful. The Moving Picture World provided a detailed review which praised the adaptation of the novel and found the staging and the acting to be clear and strong. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was negative, criticizing the garb, tempest scene, [...] and describing the acting as lacking in feeling. The Nickelodeon, an uncommon source for Thanhouser reviews, was not fooled by Crane's outfit. The reviewer said, [...] "It is usually <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> to tell a man to 'keep his shirt on,' but we decidedly advise the actor who played the part of Paul in this piece to take his shirt off {{the next time he}} essays the role of a child of nature whose costume consists principally of his own skin plus a few trimmings. Baggy underwear, where his skin ought to be, looks like the arch-fiend. ... The production was adequate up to the point of the tempest and shipwreck, which fell down deplorably. Better to have left it out all together. From here onward the photoplay adapters have departed from the original story, and maybe they were wise. Paul in his nude underwear would have spoiled Virginia's funeral." [...] The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} to find his fluency against the bowling. Yardley took the new ball {{in an attempt to}} trouble the batsmen with extra pace, but instead, Loxton began to settle in. The Australian lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and hit three fours off a subsequent Pollard over. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. He had taken 177 minutes and hit 14 fours. Loxton then dominated the scoring in a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. The century stand yielded 105 runs in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Nevertheless, it was an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of the}} wicket, and Harvey's fast scoring helped to wrest the match back from England's firm control. O'Reilly said the innings was one of [...] "no inhibitions...completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot". He added that it was [...] "the very mirror of truth in the batting art", [...] "delightfully untrammeled by the scourage of <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> or any other handicapping influence", and deemed Harvey's innings to be most pleasing he had seen since Stan McCabe's 232 at Trent Bridge in 1938.|$|E
