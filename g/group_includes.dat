5|$|Most {{species in}} this order lack pedicellariae and {{all have a}} {{delicate}} skeletal arrangement with small or no marginal plates on the disc and arms. They have numerous groups of short spines on the aboral surface. This <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> the red starfish Echinaster sepositus.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} starfish {{consists}} mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish {{often with a}} global distribution. The shape is pentagonal or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. They mostly have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often spiny pedicellariae. This <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> the slime star.|$|E
5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and {{two rows of}} tube feet with suckers. There are {{conspicuous}} marginal plates on the arms and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> five {{prograde}} outer moons {{that are}} similar enough in their distances from the planet (186–297 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclinations (45–50°) and their colors {{that they can be}} considered a group. The moons are Ijiraq, Kiviuq, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarqeq. The largest among them is Siarnaq with an estimated size of about 40km.|$|E

5|$|The moons of Neptune can {{be divided}} into two groups: regular and irregular. The first <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> the seven inner moons, which follow {{circular}} prograde orbits lying in the equatorial plane of Neptune. The second group consists of all seven other moons including Triton. They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the only exception is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.|$|E
5|$|Uranus's {{irregular}} moons {{range in}} size from 120–200km (Sycorax) to about 20km (Trinculo). Unlike Jupiter's irregulars, Uranus's show no correlation of axis with inclination. Instead, the retrograde moons can be divided into two groups based on axis/orbital eccentricity. The inner <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> those satellites closer to Uranus (a < 0.15 rH) and moderately eccentric (~0.2), namely Francisco, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo. The outer group (a > 0.15 rH) includes satellites with high eccentricity (~0.5): Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, and Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|Wanless {{divided the}} genus Portia into two species groups: the schultzi group, in which males' palps have a fixed tibial {{apophysis}}; and the kenti group, {{in which the}} apophysis of each palp in the males has a joint separated by a membrane. The schultzi <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> P. schultzi, P. africana, P. fimbriata, and P. labiata.|$|E
50|$|The Maninka (also {{known as}} Malinke), {{a branch of}} the Mandé, are {{credited}} with the founding of the largest ancient West African empires. Other numerous Mandé <b>groups</b> <b>include</b> the Soninke, Bambara, and Dyula. Smaller <b>groups</b> <b>include</b> the Ligbi, Vai, and Bissa.|$|R
25|$|Civic <b>groups</b> <b>include</b> those {{involved}} in history, fraternal groups, and commercial promotion. The Sheridan Museum of History is a building-less group {{with a collection of}} artifacts and photographs displayed in borrowed space, including at the Yamhill County Historical Society Museum in McMinnville. Commercial <b>groups</b> <b>include</b> the Sheridan Chamber of Commerce and the West Valley Chamber of Commerce. Other civic <b>groups</b> <b>include</b> the Rotary International club, the Kiwanis, a Rebekah Lodge, and the Woman's Study Club of Sheridan.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931, {{during the}} process of trying to {{reconcile}} the dialects into the single standard Shona, Professor Clement Doke identified six groups, each with subdivisions: 1. The Korekore or Northern Shona, including Taυara, Shangwe, Korekore proper, Goυa, Budya, the Korekore of Urungwe, the Korekore of Sipolilo, Tande, Nyongwe of [...] "Darwin", Pfungwe of Mrewa; 2. The Zezuru <b>group,</b> <b>including</b> Shawasha, Haraυa, another Goυa, Nohwe, Hera, Njanja, Mbire, Nobvu, Vakwachikwakwa, Vakwazvimba, Tsunga; 3.

The Kalanga <b>group,</b> <b>including</b> Nyai, Nambzya, Rozvi, Kalanga proper, Talahundra, Lilima or Humbe, and Peri.|$|R
5|$|Cres– Lošinj and Krk– Rab island chains {{divide the}} Kvarner Gulf into four {{distinct}} areas: Rijeka Bay, Kvarner (sensu stricto), Kvarnerić, and Vinodol Channel. The Cres– Lošinj group {{also includes the}} inhabited islands of Ilovik, Susak, Unije, Vele Srakane, and Male Srakane, {{as well as a}} larger number of small, uninhabited islands. Zadar Archipelago extends to the southeast of the island group. The Krk– Rab island <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> only uninhabited islands in addition to Krk and Rab, the largest among them Plavnik, Sveti Grgur, Prvić, and Goli Otok. The Krk– Rab island group is usually thought to represent a single archipelago with the island of Pag (southeast of Rab) and islets surrounding Pag.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Scully are soon {{introduced}} to a strike-force that will be going into the subway to investigate. The <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens. Scully, however, decides the plan will work better if Doggett acts as her eyes and ears while she analyzes the situation from up in the Transit Control Center. Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
40|$|The Japanese {{species of}} Bagous are treated systematically; 17 species are recognized, of which 15 are newly described. These new species are B. buckinghami O’Brien and Morimoto, B. fractus O’Brien and Morimoto, B. fritodes O’Brien & Morimoto, B. lewisi O’Brien & Morimoto, B. minor O’Brien & Morimoto, B. occultus O’Brien & Morimoto, B. proprius O’Brien & Morimoto, B. pygmaeodes O’Brien & Morimoto, B. rotundatus O’Brien & Morimoto, B. ryukyuensis O’Brien & Morimoto, B. spiculatus O’Brien & Morimoto, B. subcordatus O’Brien & Morimoto, B. subvittutus O’Brien & Morimoto, B. tuberculosus O’Brien & Morimoto, and B. youngi O’Brien & Morimoto; B. bipunctatus (Kono) and B. kagiashi Chujo & Morimoto were {{previously}} described. Eight species groups are recognized, the B. pygmaeus <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. minor and B. pygmaeodes), the B. bipunctatus <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. subcordatus, B. bipunctatus, B. occultus, B. spiculatus, B kagiashi and B. ryukyuensis), the B. proprius <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. proprius), the B. buckinghami <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. buckinghami), the B. fractus <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. fractus), thl: B. rotundatus group (incuding B. rotundatus), the B. transversus <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. youngi), and the B. frit <b>group</b> (<b>including</b> B. fritodes). Three species (B. lewisi, B. subvittatus and B. tuberculosus) remain unassigned to species group {{because they are}} known only from female specimens and do not possess specific characters {{that allow them to}} be assign& with certainly. A key to species, diagnosis of species groups and each species, habitus photographs and line illustrations of male and female genitalia are provided...|$|R

5|$|The Medway Megaliths can {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} clusters: one {{to the west of the}} River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 miles). The western <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{belongs to a}} genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (F.mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons {{towards the end of}} the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon <b>group</b> <b>includes</b> both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the saker falcon (F.cherrug) is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.|$|E
5|$|The station's geology is {{dominated}} by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson <b>Group</b> <b>includes</b> layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some claystone and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include claypans, while to the west are stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.|$|E
