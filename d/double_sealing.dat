Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of two sealing types on dry matter recovery rate, aerobic stability, nutritional composition, and in vitro digestibility of corn silage in bunker silos: 110 -µm-thick double-sided polyethylene sealing (conventional sealing) and 110 -µm-thick double-sided polyethylene sealing superimposed on 111 -µm-thick translucent polyethylene sealing (<b>double</b> <b>sealing).</b> There were no significant differences in nutritional composition of silages between conventional and <b>double</b> <b>sealing.</b> However, the <b>double</b> <b>sealing</b> system was more efficient (P< 0. 05) in maintaining lower silo temperatures (30. 48 °C vs. 31. 18 °C), in dry matter recovery (88. 79 % vs. 85. 64 %), and increased in vitro neutral-detergent fiber digestibility (33. 04 % vs. 24. 6 %), when compared to the conventional version...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the sealing ability of amalgam and C&BMetabond against coronal microleakage of Entrococcus Faecalis. Materials & Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, 54 premolar teeth were randomly dividedto two groups of 24 teeth and for each the access cavities were prepared. The pulp chamber floorobturated with amalgam or C & B Metabond in two test groups. A further two groups of three teethserved as negative and positive controls. The external surface of each root, except the apical region,was covered with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were inserted into Eppendorf plastic tubes andsuspended in glass vials containing sterile BHI broth. Entrococcus faecalis were placed in the accessof test and control groups and opacity of BHI was examined twice a week. The results were analyzedusing fissure exact test and ANOVA (E= 0. 05). Results: Leakage was present in 13 / 20 of amalgam group; whilst 4 / 21 of the samples of C&B Metabondleaked at 3 months period. This difference was statistically significant and the sealing ability of twomaterials was increased by time lapse (p value < 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental results}} from a research facility which experimentally models hot gas ingress into the wheel-space of an axial turbine stage. Measurements of CO 2 gas concentration in the rim-seal region and inside the wheel-space are {{used to assess the}} performance of generic (though engine-representative) single and <b>double</b> <b>seals</b> in terms of the variation of concentration effectiveness with sealing flow rate. The variation of pressure in the turbine annulus, which governs externally-induced ingress, was obtained from steady pressure measurements downstream of the vanes. The benefit of using <b>double</b> <b>seals</b> is demonstrated: The ingested gas is shown to be predominately confined to the outer wheel-space radially outward of the inner seal; in the inner wheel-space, radially inward of the inner seal, the effectiveness is shown to be significantly higher. Criteria for ranking the performance of single and <b>double</b> <b>seals</b> are proposed, and the performance limit for any <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> is shown to be one in which the inner seal is exposed to rotationally-induced ingress. Although the ingress is a consequence of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow field and the cause-effect relationship between pressure and the sealing effectiveness is complex, the experimental data is shown to be successfully calculated by simple effectiveness equations developed from a theoretical model. The data illustrate that, for similar turbine-stage velocity triangles, the effectiveness can be correlated using two empirical parameters. In principle, these correlations could be extrapolated to a geometrically-similar turbine operating at enginerepresentative conditions...|$|R
40|$|In the {{continuous}} endeavour to develop surface seals capable of withstanding the high traffic volumes on some the country’s National routes, numerous surface seal design approaches {{including the use}} of modified binders are being considered.

50|$|In a <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> Back to Back, {{the barrier}} liquid in the cavity {{between the two}} seals is pressurized. Thus if the primary seal fails, the neutral liquid will leak into the pump stream instead of the {{dangerous}} pumped fluid escaping into the atmosphere. This application is usually used in gas, unstable, highly toxic, abrasive, corrosive, and viscous fluids. These are detailed in API Piping Plan standards #53a, 53b, 53c; or 54. Plan 74 may also be considered a <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> piping plan, although it is used exclusively when describing a dry gas barrier seal support system.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting <b>double</b> <b>seals</b> with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a <b>double</b> gas buffered <b>sealing</b> system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size <b>double</b> gas <b>sealing</b> device. The <b>double</b> gas <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the <b>double</b> gas <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply <b>double</b> gas <b>sealing</b> technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the <b>double</b> gas <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the <b>double</b> gas <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide <b>double</b> gas <b>sealing</b> solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R

40|$|The 2 MW cw {{requirement}} for ITER EC transmission lines has led GA {{to design a}} number of new and modified components, namely power monitors and polarizers to meet this requirement. In addition, the ITER transmission lines may require sliding joints or bellows to accommodate the thermal expansion of the lines and/or vessel motion. The ex-vessel sections of the EC launchers require <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> waveguides, miter bends and possibly <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> sliding joints to assure tritium retention in this region. GA has developed designs for many of these components and some of them have already been tested at high power at the JAEA RF Test Stand. Thermal analyses of the standard GA power monitor miter bend show that our standard design is suitable for 1 MW cw operation when the H-field is in the plane of the miter bend. For 2 MW cw operation a modified design, which also requires H-plane orientation, has been developed and a prototype has been fabricated and is ready for testing. For long pulse/cw operation, a 2 MW calorimetric miter bend with thermally isolated mirror has been designed and a prototype has been fabricated. Since the mirror is thermally isolated, calorimetry on the mirror cooling water can provide a measure of absorbed power. Such a miter bend, when made in a <b>double</b> <b>seal</b> version, could be useful for monitoring total power {{at the end of an}} EC transmission line just before the in-vessel section of an EC launcher. A mode analyzer using an all metal water-cooled beam splitter is being developed for use in measuring in real time the HE 11 and higher order mode content or total power in EC transmission lines. Such a high power diagnostic can be very useful in optimizing the alignment of the MOU output into a transmission line and in monitoring the HE 11 mode purity at various locations in a transmission line.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 30 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 11 - 14 July 2011 "Africa on the Move", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In life-cycle assessments conducted over the past 25 years, bitumen-rubber has proven itself as the most cost-effective modified binder in the South African bituminous product spectrum. It has been proven that by using bitumen-rubber, the life cycle cost decreases significantly whilst effectively increasing the functional performance and salvaging the otherwise rapidly deteriorating South African roads. The deterioration of the South African road network IS considered to be primarily {{the result of a}} lack of timely maintenance intervention on the ageing existing infrastructure. In order to retain the performance properties of the bitumen-rubber blend, South African roads engineers have adopted design methods and construction techniques to ensure that only minimal cutter is added to the bitumen-rubber blend before application (this does not apply to winter-grade applications). The objective {{of this paper is to}} present case studies and performance of unusual projects where bitumen-rubber was used successfully in single and <b>double</b> <b>seals</b> in order to demonstrate how the design parameters were extended. A brief overview is given of the properties and manufacture of bitumen-rubber, whlch is common to the projects whlch will then be discussed.
