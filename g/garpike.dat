He got none in Dublin, for they were all gone to the Welsh marches to help Earl Alfgar and King Griffin. So he went on through the Hebrides, intending, of course, to plunder as he went: but there he got but little booty, and lost several men. So he went on again to the Orkneys, to try for fresh hands from the Norse Earl Hereof; but there befell a fresh mishap. They were {{followed}} by a whale, which they made sure was a witch-whale, and boded more ill luck; and accordingly they were struck by a storm in the Pentland Frith, and the poor <b>Garpike</b> went on shore on Hoy, and was left there forever and a day, her crew being hardly saved, and very little of her cargo.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{reasonably}} popular aquarium fish Xenentodon cancila, has been traded under {{a variety of}} common names, including needlefish, silver needlefish, Asian freshwater needlefish, needlenose halfbeak, freshwater gar, needlenose gar and numerous others. While belonging to the same family as the marine needlefish known in Europe as gar or <b>garpike,</b> Belone belone, these fish are much more distantly related to other fishes sometimes called gars (such as the North American gars and South American pike characins). In Assam it is locally known as Kokila. It is known as [...] "Yonna (යොන්නා) or Habarali (හබරලි)" [...] in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5000|$|Gars (or <b>garpike)</b> {{are members}} of the Lepisosteiformes (or Semionotiformes), an ancient holosteian order of ray-finned fish; fossils from this order are known from the late Cretaceous onwards. The family Lepisosteidae {{includes}} seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern North America, Central America and the Caribbean islands. [...] Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is the largest, as specimens have been reported to be 3 m in length; however, they typically grow to 2 m and weigh over 45.3 kg. Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans.|$|E
40|$|Fishes {{have several}} means of moving water to effect odorant {{transport}} to their olfactory epithelium (‘olfactory flow’). Here {{we show that}} olfactory flow in the adult <b>garpike</b> Belone belone (Belonidae, Teleostei), a fish with an unusual nasal region, can be generated by its motion relative to water (swimming, or an external current, or both). We also show how the unusual features of the garpike’s nasal region influence olfactory flow. These features comprise a triangular nasal cavity in which the olfactory epithelium is exposed to the external environment, a papilla situated within the nasal cavity, and an elongated ventral apex. To perform our investigation we first generated life-like plastic models of <b>garpike</b> heads from X-ray scans of preserved specimens. We then suspended these models in a flume and flowed water over them to simulate swimming. By directing filaments of dye at the static models, {{we were able to}} visualise flow in the nasal regions at physiologically relevant Reynolds numbers (700 – 2, 000). We found that flow of water over the heads did cause circulation in the nasal cavity. Vortices may assist in this circulation. The pattern of olfactory flow was influenced by morphological variations and the asymmetry of the nasal region. The unusual features of the nasal region may improve odorant sampling in the <b>garpike,</b> by dispersing flow over the olfactory epithelium and by creating favourable conditions for odorant transport (e. g. steep velocity gradients). Unexpectedly, we found that the mouth and the base of the garpike’s jaws may assist the sampling process. Thus, despite its apparent simplicity, the garpike’s nasal region is likely to act as an effective trap for odorant molecules...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gaps {{exist in}} the modern {{literature}} that describes patterns of development in living groups of actinopterygian fishes. Relatively recent descriptions of development exist for the teleost fishes, bowfin, sturgeon, paddlefish and bichirs. Such literature dealing with the gars {{is to be found}} in older work, done approximately a century ago. The present study concerns the gars, of which the <b>garpike,</b> Lepisosteus osseus, is a representative example. Results: The embryonic period of life of this fish is divided, as required for experimentation, into 34 stages, from fertilization to exhaustion of the yolk supply. Diagnostic structural characteristics are cited for each stage, and the rate of development is indicated. Conclusions: Three features of development are especially noted that compare or contrast with other members of the Neopterygii, and with the Chondrostei. These are meroblastic cleavage, a well-defined yolk syncytial layer (ysl), and a pit at the posterodorsal edge of the blastoderm, which defines an overhanging dorsal lip. Meroblastic cleavage and the ysl in the <b>garpike</b> show an affinity to those character states in the teleosts, though not with Amia, the other neopterygian fish.

40|$|The {{effect of}} 10 ppm of cadmium on eggs of the Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii, {{incubated}} in sea water of 20 percent salinity at 5 #{ 176 }Cwas examined at five stages of development. Eggs exposed to cadmium hatched approximately 10 days earlier {{than those of}} the control; the percentage of viable hatch was 82. 0 in the control and 27. 3 for eggs exposed to cadmium; the average size of viable larvae was 8. 46 and 5. 49 mm respectively. Like the <b>garpike,</b> cadmium uptake by herring eggs reached its maximum early in the incubation period and was maintained throughout the 5 developmental stages studied; the total uptake was, however, much greater than that reported for Baltic herring. The relative activity of all four carbon dioxide fixing enzymes studied was depressed by exposure to cadmium; propionyl C 0 A carboxylase was depressed before flattening of the blastodisc stage; PEP carboxykinase depression started prior to closure of the blastopore, whereas NAD- and NADP-malic enzymes were depressed only prior to the hatching stage. It is postulated that the relatively small larvae hatching from eggs exposed to cadmium may be the result of: 1) depression of the relative activity of the carbon dioxide fixing enzymes at different stages of development, and/or 2) cadmium being bound to the chorion making it vulnerable, thus producing earlier hatching and premature larvae...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of the anterior pituitary to sexual maturity has been demonstrated by homoplastic implants in every major group of verte brates. Various effects from precocious sexual maturity to induced ovulation have been reported for fishes (15); for Amphibia as repre sented by frogs (24, 25), toads (14, 16), Triturus (2, 20), Triton (2, 20); for reptiles as represented by snakes (15, 16); for birds by pigeons (6); and mammals by rats, mice, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mon keys (6). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to summarize briefly the work on the Amphibia and to present considerable new evidence as to the quantitative factors involved and a dependable technique for induced ovulation and artificial fertilization in the frog, Rana pipiens. In general, the extract of whole sheep or cattle anterior pituitary (8) has not proven to be effective with frogs and toads, though there are possible exceptions with Rana vulgaris (3) and Discoglossus pictus (17). Both the whole sheep pituitary extract and the Antuitrin-S from pregnant human urine, as dispensed by Parke, Davis and Company, have been useful in inducing ovulation with Triturus and Ambystoma (11, 22), though the Antuitrin-S seems to be more potent. Neither of these extracts has proven useful with toads (18). Heteroplastic implants from the hen, rat, pig, dog, cattle, snake, fish, opossum and frog proved to be ineffective with respect to inducing ovu lation in toads (3, 7, 15). This raised the question of â€œ¿specificity,â€• especially since the toad, Bufo vulgaris, reacts only to homoplastic im plants while the toad pituitaries are effective when implanted in the frog, Rana vulgaris (3). Recent evidence (23) does not support this conten tention of species specificity of pituitary, since with large doses of pitu itary from the <b>garpike,</b> Lepidosteus, both the toad, Bufo americanus, and the frog, Rana pipiens, were induced to ovulate. It was suggested in this paper that previous failures may have been due to insufficient im plantations. While heteroplastic implants between fishes and Amphibia may prove effective, no amount of pituitary from the albino rat (23) would induce ovulation in either frog or toad. Further evidence fo...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic herring Clupea harengus membras, a local {{subspecies}} of the North Atlantic herring {{which had}} reached the Baltic Sea nearly 5, 000 years ago, {{is probably the most}} important food fish (for salting) both in the coastal regions as well as everywhere else in Estonia. The need to determine the exact time of fishing has inspired nearly 30 % of its popular names, mainly on the basis of orientation to phenological phenomena or popular festivals. Vendace/whitefish? Coregonus albula and rudds Rutilus rutilus and Scardinius erythrophthalmus, as common fresh-water fishes, are mentioned mostly in relation to omens. According to a legend the smelt Osmerus eperlanus smelled of horsemeat, as the fish were believed to have been born of drowned horses. According to ichthyologists, reports stating that the freshwater form of this species usually found in Lake Peipus had also been discovered in Estonia's largest inland-lake (Lake Võrtsjärv) date back to the 19 th century. By the mid- 20 th century the species had disappeared from Lake Võrtsjärv. A popular belief accuses the competing Russian fishers who had used magic to make the fish disappear (Orthodox peoples ate primarily fish during the Lent). The Baltic cod Gadus morhua callarias was traditionally caught with trawl-lines, as suggest the words of the spelling song in the article. The making of cod line was also associated with magic. Similar to the pike, the Baltic cod was considered a mythological being of the underworld (it has been called a one-eyed hog, piglet, etc.). The outward appearance of the fish has become to be thought as resembling the face of the Evil One (cf. Loorits 1926 : US 95). Various long-jawed species of fish have been popularly called 'windfish'. In coastal villages people used to hang the windfish outside {{and use it as a}} windsock. The coming of <b>garpike</b> Belone belone to the coastal waters before the Midsummer Day indicates the beginning of the Baltic herring's fishing season. Sturgeon Acipenser sturio was once considered an important food fish in Estonia, both for its flesh as well as roe. The collection of folklore at the second half of the 19 th century began too late to find reports on this wholly agreeable species. Stylised figures of two sturgeons were depicted on the blazon of Narva town, and the 17 th century öre coined in Narva. Remarkably, the popular name of the fish on the northern coast of Estonia was samb. According to the Finnish legends, sampo-fish was a giant mythical fish. And the Finno-Ugric myth about the three primordial bearers of the Earth is associated to the three sturgeons of the rivers. We might assume that the mythological concept which was inspired by the huge dimensions of the fish rather than particular species or family, concerned also other large fish (pike, sheatfish). The Russian word som and the Latvian word sams denoting sheatfish, not sturgeon, suggest the same. A legend from South-East Estonia concerning weatherfish Misgurnus fossilis or Cobitis fossilis, tells a story, where one of the characters, according to the register, was a snake (cf. Aa US 61). The Evil One tempted the rat to chew a hole into [Noah's] Ark, but the weatherfish closed the opening with its tail. There upon God rewarded weatherfish by naming them the best of fishes. A belief report from the northern coast of Lake Peipus contends that weatherfish could turn into snakes. And as weatherfish (much like eel) resemble snakes in many ways, the folkloric transmittance from one species to another is quite logical and expected...|$|E
