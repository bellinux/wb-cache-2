40|$|Objective : To {{describe}} {{factors that}} influence parents’ decisions on childhood immunisations at Kumasi Metropolis in Ghana. Study design : Quantitative cross-sectional survey. Methods : A sample of 303 parents was obtained from a monthly accessible population of 1420 individuals from the five district hospitals through convenience sampling of respondents at immunisation sessions in Kumasi. Data obtained from the survey were analysed with SPSS version 21 software. Results : Most parents were aware of child immunisations, but they had limited knowledge on vaccines and <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules.</b> Antenatal nurses constituted the most accessible source of vaccine information. The study established {{a high percentage of}} complete immunisation, influenced by parents’ fear of their children contracting vaccine-preventable diseases. Remarkably, some parents indicated that they immunised their children because they wanted to know the weight of their children. Forgetfulness and lack of personnel or vaccine at the centres were the reasons given by the few parents who could not complete <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules</b> for their children, whereas the socio-demographic variables considered did not influence parents’ decision on immunisation.

40|$|While {{remarkable}} {{gains in}} health {{have been achieved}} since the mid- 20 th century, these have been unequally distributed, and mortality and morbidity burdens in some regions remain enormous. Of the almost 10 million children under 5 years of age who died in 2006, only 100 000 died in industrialised countries, while 4. 8 million died in sub-Saharan Africa. 1 In deciding whether to finance an intervention, policy makers commonly weigh the expected population health gains against its costs. Most vaccinations included in national <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules</b> are inexpensive 2 and health gains to costs are very favourable compared with other health interventions. Newer vaccinations, such as those with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) or rotavirus vaccine, are also effective in averting child mortality and morbidity but are expensive relative to those commonly included in national <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules.</b> Policy makers may therefore decide that – at current prices – the comparison of health gains with costs does not justify the free public provision of these vaccinations.

40|$|The Ministry of Health {{convened a}} {{workshop}} in June 1998 {{on the future}} of the <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedule.</b> Your comments are invited on the recommendations of the workshop. PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE SCHEDULE: Improve on-time immunisation coverage as the priority. Reaching the last 20 % will cost at least as much as the first 80 % and is vital to achieve the aims of the immunisation programme (disease elimination and improved control). Obtain regular secure coverage data, derived from a tracking system that ensures children are followed up. Assess compliance with early childhood centre immunisation checks at entry and improve if necessary. Establish an expert committee to advise on the <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedule</b> and policies. Keep the schedule as simple as possible. Accept that vaccines are not generic and future schedule recommendations may be vaccine-specific. Involve providers in the process of change. PROPOSED CHANGES: Move the second dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine from age 11 years to around five years. Consider moving the third visit from five to four months to achieve earlier protection against pertussis. Consider adding a fifth dose of pertussis vaccine. Change to acellular pertussis vaccine, once suitable vaccines are available. Change to inactivated polio vaccine, once suitable vaccines are available.

40|$|AbstractThe {{eradication}} of infectious agents {{is an attractive}} means of disease control that, to date, has been achieved for only one human pathogen, the smallpox virus. The introduction of vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis into <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules,</b> and particularly the conjugate polysaccharide vaccines which can interrupt transmission, {{raises the question of}} whether disease caused by this obligate human bacterium can be controlled, eliminated, or even eradicated. The limited number of meningococcal serogroups, lack of an animal reservoir, and importance of meningococcal disease are considerations in favour of eradication; however, the commensal nature of most infections, the high diversity of meningococcal populations, and the lack of comprehensive vaccines are all factors that suggest that this is not feasible. Indeed, any such attempt might be harmful by perturbing the human microbiome and its interaction with the immune system. On balance, the control and possible elimination of disease caused by particular disease-associated meningococcal genotypes is a more achievable and worthwhile goal...|$|R
40|$|Infections by {{encapsulated}} {{bacteria are}} important causes of infant mortality worldwide. Over the last 20 years protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines {{have been developed}} to protect against the major invasive bacterial diseases of childhood, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Neisseria meningitidis. These vaccines are highly immunogenic and have resulted in a huge reduction in the diseases caused by these bacteria in the countries that have introduced them in their <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules.</b> However, {{it has been reported that}} infant immunisation is associated with a relatively short duration of antibody levels and vaccine effectiveness, despite the demonstrable presence of booster responses to further vaccine dose. In contrast, at older ages, more sustained protection has been described with just a single dose of a conjugate vaccine. Understanding the generation of long-term immunity, by protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, is essential to reduce infant mortality through the improvement of vaccine formulation and scheduling.

40|$|Circulating {{antibodies}} to poliovirus were estimated {{in a group}} of 300 British and 84 foreign first year students who registered at the health centre of Nottingham University in 1984. Detectable {{antibodies to}} all three poliovirus serotypes were found in 212 (71 %) of the British students but in only 47 (56 %) of those from abroad. Most of the British students (280; 93 %) had been born in 1965 or 1966, when uptake of poliomyelitis vaccine was declining. Immunisation histories showed that 10 British and 29 foreign students (3 % and 35 %) had no record of any immunisation; only five British and two foreign students, however, were negative for all three poliovirus serotypes. These findings provide evidence that a high proportion of British born people aged 18 - 29 have adequate circulating poliovirus antibodies despite incomplete <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules.</b> Though this is reassuring, the absence of antibodies in some students and the lack of previous immunisation against poliomyelitis in 39 suggest that reinforcing doses of vaccine at the time of leaving school or beginning further education are still warranted, particularly for students from other countries.

Over the last century, vaccine development has been undertaken in earnest for the prevention of this disease. Polysaccharide vaccines have been available for almost 40 years, yet they are poorly immunogenic in young children who are at the highest risk. Since their introduction into some routine <b>immunisation</b> <b>schedules</b> in 1999, polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines for the prevention of serogroup C meningococcal infection have proven efficacious.

To date, however, the development of a universally safe, immunogenic and effective serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis vaccine has remained a challenge. This review details the many conventional vaccine strategies and the more recent genome-derived technological approaches being used in serogroup B vaccine development.
