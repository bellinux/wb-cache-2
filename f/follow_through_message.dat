40|$|Abstract. Typical {{distributed}} testing architectures decompose {{test cases}} in actions and dispatch them to different nodes. They use a central test controller to synchronize the action execution sequence. This architecture {{is not fully}} adapted to large scale distributed systems, since the central controller does not scale up. This paper presents two approaches to synchronize the execution of test case actions in a distributed manner. The first approach organizes the testers in a B-tree synchronizing <b>through</b> <b>messages</b> exchanged among parents and children. The second approach uses gossiping <b>messages</b> synchronizing <b>through</b> <b>messages</b> exchanged among consecutive testers. We compare these two approaches and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. ...|$|R

40|$|The National <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> Program is {{a federally}} funded {{initiative}} {{to improve the quality}} of educational services for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This report discusses the implementation and outcomes of the program. In the first part of the paper, a history of the program iJ provided and the diversity of educational approaches in <b>Follow</b> <b>Through's</b> model programs, the gains in basic skills demonstrated by <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> students, and the dissemination of <b>Follow</b> <b>Through's</b> model programs are discussed. The second part considers three components of the <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> program. These are: (1) a holistic approach to instruction; (2) the development and use of research-based instructional programs and practic-s; and (3) effective educational delivery systems that stress sponsorship of local projects, staff development, and implementation of parent involvement activities. The third part, a conclusion, finds that the <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> program is clearly an important source of knowledge waiting to be tapped, and that its most important message may be that there is a critical need to forge a two-directional exchange, indicating the need for a link between research and schooling practice. <b>Follow</b> <b>through</b> has also identified ways of dealing with the evaluation of school improvement efforts, and corroborated findings in the literature on effective teaching and school effectiveness. A reference list of 62 items is included. An appendix lists overall goals and major design features of some widely implemented <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> model programs.

40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{research report}} {{looks at the}} changes in reading performance for the students in one rural school district from 1965 through 1980. During those years, the district moved from 28. 5 per cent of its second grade students at or above grade level to 88. 2 per cent at or above grade level. Similar gains are demonstrated in first and third grade. These gains are discussed in terms of: (I) phonics first, then basal reading instruction; (2) sponsorship; and monitoring and evaluation that resulted from the district's participation as a <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> site in the federally supported <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> Program. In 1968 <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> was born. The federal govern-ment selected 138 communities to become <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> sites, and 19 educational centers at universities. or corporations to become <b>Follow</b> <b>Through</b> sponsors.

Material and Methods. 400 subjects from two colleges (200 from each college) belonging to 18 – 20 years age group possessing mobile phones were randomly selected and baseline examination of oral hygiene and gingival status was carried out using Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Gingival Index (GI). Oral health education was provided to all the subjects. Oral health education <b>message</b> was reinforced <b>through</b> short <b>messaging</b> service (SMS) in mobile phones for the subjects belonging to the intervention group. There was no such reinforcement for the control group. Follow-up examinations were done {{at the end of}} 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 6 th month. After the 3 rd month, subjects of the intervention group did not receive oral health education <b>message</b> <b>through</b> short <b>messaging</b> service (SMS) and were followed up after next three months. Compiled data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 statistical software. Result. Mean OHI and GI scores in intervention group were significantly (p< 0. 01) less than those of control group after the 2 nd, 3 rd, and 6 th month. Conclusion.
