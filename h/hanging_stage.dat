40|$|Improved {{monitoring}} {{tools are}} important for the control of Campylobacter bacteria in broiler production. In this study, we compare the sensitivities of detection of Campylobacter by PCR with feces, dust, and air samples during the lifetimes of broilers in two poultry houses and conclude that the sensitivity of detection of Campylobacter in air is comparable to that in other sample materials. Profiling of airborne particles in six poultry houses revealed that the aerodynamic conditions were dependent on {{the age of the}} chickens and very comparable among different poultry houses, with low proportions of particles in the 0. 5 - to 2 -μm-diameter range and high proportions in the 2 - to 5 -μm-diameter range. Campylobacter could also be detected by PCR in air samples collected at the <b>hanging</b> <b>stage</b> during the slaughter process but not at the other stages tested at the slaughterhouse. The exploitation of airborne dust in poultry houses as a sample material for the detection of Campylobacter and other pathogens provides an intriguing possibility, in conjunction with new detection technologies, for allowing continuous or semicontinuous monitoring of colonization status...|$|E
40|$|Heerema Marine Contractors is {{building}} the world’s largest semi-submersible crane vessel ‘Sleipnir’. During the design phase of this vessel, model tests {{were performed to}} evaluate the hydrodynamic properties. In the model test, a significant roll motion at a period of 40 s was found. Because this response is not {{within the range of}} first order wave excitation, it received great attention. Later, the 40 s is proved to be the natural roll period of the vessel which can be excited by the difference frequency of the two first order wave components, thus it is called a 2 nd order roll in this thesis. The aim of this thesis is to explain this phenomenon in a better way and to investigate whether this 2 nd order roll identified in the model test will be a true problem in reality. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the physical reasons for the existence of 2 nd order roll as well as the methodology to quantify 2 nd order roll are discussed. Besides the resonance effect, the nonlinear excitation is proved to be quite considerable and the damping ratio is low within the natural frequency range because of the ship’s shape features. For the nonlinear excitations, Quadratic Transfer Functions (QTF’s) are firstly calculated based on the Pinkster’s theory. The second order forces and moments are further simulated by three methods in both frequency domain and time domain, where the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. For the damping, special attention is paid to the linearization method in the frequency domain and the application of Cummins’ equation in the time domain. The use of a cubic damping term is proposed to fix the inaccuracies of the current methods. Furthermore, the second order roll motion is simulated both in the frequency domain and time domain. All simulations are validated by comparing the results with the measured data from the model test. Multi-directional wave conditions are also simulated to make the methodology applicable in the real world. The second part of the thesis discusses an important phenomenon in the second order roll, i. e. the variance of the standard deviation of each simulation is quite large. The reasons for this phenomenon are the non-uniqueness in the excitation and the low damping ratio. Thus 2 nd order roll should be predicted as a probability distribution instead of a specific value because it has a much larger variance compared to the first order motions. The sensitivity of the factors makes the model test and the real situation different, and the factors causing a difference in the real situation are discussed by an explanation of the physical reasons supported by simulations. In the third part, the discussion is moved on to the reality. The second order roll is identified from offshore measurements of the existing semi-submersible ‘Thialf’, in both the free floating and free <b>hanging</b> <b>stage.</b> It is further used to validate the simulation methodology and the discussed characteristics for 2 nd order roll. In the end the operability of the Sleipnir is evaluated, and it is concluded that the 2 nd order roll actually has a dominant contribution to the overall roll motion. However, with the 2 nd order roll included, Sleipnir’s roll motion is still acceptable. The overall roll motion stays below a maximum amplitude of 0. 5 degree in the normal operational sea states (HsTp 2 < 75). As mitigations, bilge keels, tuggers and DP systems are proposed for the 2 nd order roll phenomenon. Offshore and dredging engineerin...|$|E

50|$|The opera explores {{themes of}} freedom and {{personal}} and community relationships, and makes some use of the African-American musical tradition of spirituals. It was the first libretto for the author and the first opera for the composer. Danielpour began work on the opera in 1998. The opera premièred on May 7, 2005 in Detroit; it was performed in Cincinnati in July 2005, and Philadelphia in February 2006. The three companies spent more than $2 million on the opera. Denyce Graves sang the title role in the premiere run, which featured a cast of nearly one hundred, flaming torches, a <b>hanging</b> on <b>stage,</b> and black-powder pistols. The opera requires a large cast because of the requirement for separate African and Caucasian choruses to portray the slaves and slave-owners. Other members of the initial cast were Angela M.

Aims: To clarify the incidence of non-cardiac etiology (NCE), actual distribution {{of the causes of}} OHCPA via perimortem CT and its usefulness. Settings and Design: Population-based observational case series study. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 1846 consecutive OHCPA cases and divided them into two groups: 370 showing an obvious cause of OHCPA with NCE (trauma, neck <b>hanging,</b> terminal <b>stage</b> of malignancy, and gastrointestinal bleeding) and others. Results: Of a total OHCPA, perimortem CT was performed in 57. 5 % and 62. 5 % were finally diagnosed as NCE: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) 8. 07 %, pulmonary thrombo-embolization (PTE) 1. 46 %, hypoxia due to pneumonia 5. 25 %, asthma and acute worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2. 06 %, cerebrovascular disorder (CVD) 4. 48 %, airway obstruction 7. 64 %, and submersion 5. 63 %. The rates of patients who survived to hospital discharge were 6 - 14 % in patients with NCE.

Growing unrest and instability from 1973 to 1976, {{as well as the}} fear of communism from neighboring countries spreading to Thailand and threatening the interests of the monarchy and the military, convinced the latter to bring former leaders Thanom and Praphas back to Thailand to control the situation. In response to Praphas's return on 17 August, thousands of students demonstrated at Thammasat University for four days until a clash with Red Gaur and Nawaphon thugs left four dead. On 19 September, Thanom returned to Thailand and headed straight from the airport to Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, where he was ordained as a monk in a private ceremony. Massive anti-Thanom protests broke out as the government faced an internal crisis after Prime Minister Seni Pramoj's attempt to tender his resignation was rejected by the Thai Parliament.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the sonoanatomy of the epidural space at first, second and third coccygeal space in horses. Phase 1 : two tails, obtained from a slaughterhouse, were used to perform the ultrasound anatomical study of the epidural space at the coccygeal level. One tail was first used to obtain CT images and then was used to make anatomical sections. The second tail was dissected to individualize the ligaments and the muscular planes, then the tail was completely stripped to bone in order to obtain the coccygeal bones to make a water immersion ultrasound study. Phase 2 : Fifteen standardbreed female horses, undergoing perineal surgical procedures, were enrolled in the study. After individuation of anatomical landmarks done in phase 1, images of the sacro-coccygeal zone were first collected from the horses always by the same operator in order to acquire the technique. Than each horse was sedated with xylazine 0. 5 mg/kg IV and the registration of data started; one expert operator and different inexpert operators individuated the needle insertion point for the epidural space with the classical method described by Skarda et al., 2009. The insertion point was marked with a specific dot for inexpert and expert operators. Then ultrasound images of the coccygeal (Co) spaces were taken and the most appropriate insertion point was detected. The distance between the expert and the inexpert points, the expert and the ultrasound technique points and between the inexpert and the ultrasound technique points were measured with a caliber. After the measurements were acquired, a surgical scrub of the area was done and an epidural needle insertion was performed at the ultrasound individuated point. The depth of the epidural space was individuated by ultrasound. The Thouy needle was then inserted with a 90 ° angle respect to the skin and the right positioning of the tip needle was confirmed by the <b>hanging</b> drop technique. <b>Stage</b> 1 : CT and ultrasound images of the tails confirmed that the spinous processes of coccygeal vertebrae are incomplete. Specific ultrasound images can be individuated and the depth of the epidural space can be measured. Stage 2 : mean depths of epidural space recorded at the spaces between Co 1 and Co 2 and between Co 2 and Co 3 were 3. 069 ± 0. 36 and 2. 63 ± 0. 29 respectively. Mean distance between the expert and inexpert points was 1. 18 ± 0. 94 cm, between the inexpert and ultrasound points was 2. 16 ± 1. 77 cm and between the expert and ultrasound points was 1. 26 ± 1. 46 cm. The hanging drop technique confirmed the right positioning of the needle in all horses. Ultrasound evaluation of the epidural space at coccygeal level is feasible and quite easy. This study puts in evidence that the ultrasound technique can be more accurate than both inexpert and expert operators in individuating the epidural injection point. This technique can also be used to know the depth of the epidural space. The technique may be a support tool and not a guide because the 90 ° angle of the needle does not allow the direct visualisation under the ultrasound probe during the procedure. Further studies are to be performed to evaluate the possibility to make the procedure under the ultrasound direct visualization.
