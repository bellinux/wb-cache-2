30|$|As a {{consideration}} of hydrolysis, the DTG curves of untreated and treated samples showed significant differences. The curves for the treated and untreated wood dowels differed in the temperature range of 500 – 650  K. Similar to the TG analyses, the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose likely caused these differences. The curves of welding interfaces showed differences in the temperature of <b>fastest</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> rate: 635  K for the untreated and 590  K for the treated one. The hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose occurred during immersing. Long chains of cellulose were broken into short chains, and hemicellulose was decomposed into polysaccharide. The products from these two reactions were thermal decomposed more easily than the materials of welding interface [45]. The same phenomenon {{was found in the}} PY-GC-MS test, low molecular compounds and glucose of treated samples were generated more quickly than that of untreated samples. Thus, the temperature of <b>fastest</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> rate was different for the two kinds of welding interfaces.|$|R

30|$|From the TG curves, {{it could}} be found that the {{shoulder}} of the pyrolysis weight loss appeared in advance. This phenomenon was consistent with the phenomenon where the pyrolysis velocity peak appeared early at approximately 310  °C on the DTG curve. This proved that the pyrolysis rate during the early stage of the welding progress was increased. It was generally believed that the thermogravimetric platform prior to 250  °C was a process in which the cellulose was depolymerized and formed the glassy state transition, thereby forming a reactive cellulose. In this study, the CuCl 2 on the wood dowel may have a catalytic effect on the pyrolysis process of cellulose, causing the TG curve shoulder of wood dowel pretreated with CuCl 2 to appear in advance and to increase the reaction speed [15]. However, with the increase in reaction temperature, the pyrolysis rate of wood dowel pretreated with CuCl 2 was lower than that of the untreated group. The addition of copper ions caused the cellulose pyrolysis weight loss to decrease significantly and slowly into the carbonization stage, which resulted in the total weight loss rate of wood dowel pretreated with CuCl 2 to be lower than that of the untreated group. It {{was also one of the}} reasons why the final residual ratio of the welding interface material of the pretreated group was higher than that of the untreated group. As the temperature of the welding interface reached about 250  °C during the welding process, the cellulose underwent a <b>faster</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> reaction under the catalysis of CuCl 2. Finally, the relative crystallinity of the interface material in the pretreated group was lower than that of the untreated group, which was consistent with the previous X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis [16, 17]. The DTG curve showed that with the extension of welded time, the amount of cellulose pyrolysis was greater during the welding process, which was also one of the reasons for the decrease in pullout resistance.|$|R

Chemical kinetics aswell as heat- andmass-transfer phenomena play an important role in this process; thus, a comprehensive kinetic model is applied. The proposed model, when compared to the majority of other devolatilization models, attempts to characterize pyrolysis reactions with a lumped stoichiometry using a limited number of equivalent components to describe not only gaseous products but also tar species.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} {{papers on the}} pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. However, very few reports are available for algal bio-oil production via pyrolysis. Miao et al. (2004b) performed <b>fast</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of Chllorella protothecoides and Microcystis areuginosa at 500 °C, and bio-oil yields of 18% and 24% were obtained, respectively. The bio-oil exhibited a higher carbon and nitrogen content, lower oxygen content than wood bio-oil. When Chllorella protothecoides was cultivated heterotrophically, bio-oil yield increased to 57.9% with a heating value of 41 MJ/kg (Miao et al., 2004a). Recently when microalgae become a hot research topic as the third generation of biofuel, pyrolysis has drawn more attention as a potential conversion method for algal biofuel production. Pan et al. (2010) investigated slow pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. residue with and without the presence of HZSM-5 catalyst and obtained bio-oil rich in aromatic hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis. Algal pyrolytic liquids separate into two phases with the top phase called bio-oil (Campanella et al., 2012; Jena et al., 2011a). The higher heating values (HHV) of algal bio-oil {{are in the range}} of 31−36 MJ/kg, generally higher than those of lignocellulosic feedstocks. Pyrolytic bio-oil consists of compounds with lower mean molecular weights and contains more low boiling compounds than bio-oil produced by hydrothermal liquefaction. These properties {{are similar to those of}} Illinois shale oil (Jena et al., 2011a; Vardon et al., 2012), which may indicate that pyrolytic bio-oil is suited for petroleum fuel replacement. In addition, the high protein content in microalgae led to a high N content in the bio-oil, resulting in undesirable NOx emissions during combustion and deactivation of acidic catalysts when co-processed in existing 10 crude oil refineries. Algal bio-oil had better qualities in many aspects than those produced from lignocellulosic biomass. For example, algal bio-oil has a higher heating value, a lower oxygen content and a greater than 7 pH value. However, upgrading towards the removal of nitrogen and oxygen in the bio-oil is still necessary before it can be used as drop-in fuels.|$|E

Hydrogen generation will be explored through modeling two types of processes: steam reforming and supersonic pyrolysis. Results of the model predict that although methanol is a widely used fuel for steam reforming, dimethyl ether can produce the same amount of hydrogen when it is reformed while consuming less energy. 	Supersonic pyrolysis is a well known process but has only recently been considered as a route to produce hydrogen. The model shows that pyrolysis could be a good alternative to steam reforming.

30|$|Several {{biofuels}} {{are obtained}} through lignocellulosic biomass such as bio-oil, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biogas, syngas etc. Bio-oil is produced through pyrolysis along with biochar, tar and gases. Bio-oil {{is produced by}} fast depolymerisation of lignocellulose components viz. hydroxyaldehydes, sugars, hydroxyketones, carboxylic acids, and phenols. Bioethanol can be produced through 5 different methods: separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), simultaneous and saccharification co-fermentation (SSCF), consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), and integrated bioprocessing (IBP) (Sarkar et al. 2012; Jagmann and Philipp 2014). SSF is the most promising among these processes because of its low-cost and high product yield. IBP is another promising process which involves treatment with microorganisms at every step in a single step. However, there is no reported work on pretreatment through IBP (Chandel et al. 2015). Biohydrogen can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass through thermochemical (gasification and pyrolysis) or biological routes (Ni et al. 2006). Through pyrolysis, hydrogen can be produced through <b>fast</b> or flash <b>pyrolysis</b> (Putro et al. 2016). Hydrogen can produced through gasification by partial oxidation and steam reformation followed by waster-gas shift reaction. Two processes to produce biohydrogen through biological route are: photo fermentation which is light dependant and dark fermentation which is light independent (Sivagurunathan et al. 2016). Although biogas and syngas have similar composition (CO 2, CH 4, H 2, and N 2), they are produced through two different processes. Biogas is produced through anaerobic digestion which comprises of four steps: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis (Taherzadeh and Karimi 2008) while syngas is produced by gasification carried out at lower temperature due to high reactivity of biomass. Biomass gasification has three types of processes namely: (1) pyrolysis which involves anaerobic decomposition of biomass at high temperature, (2) partial oxidation which requires less amount of oxygen as compared to oxidation, and (3) steam gasification which involves the reaction of water with biomass.|$|R

30|$|To {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} of pyrolysis products easily and accurately, the Py-GC/MS method was used. <b>Fast</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> was carried out at 500 °C, which has been suggested to be the optimal temperature for catalytic pyrolysis of biomass [7]. It {{is well known that}} the product of <b>fast</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of biomass includes volatile species and nonvolatile oligomers. Py-GC/MS can be used only for the analysis of volatile species. More than 100 peaks appeared in the chromatograms obtained from the <b>fast</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of rice husk.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{utilization}} of solid carbonaceous wastes, the mitigation of CO 2 {{and the development of}} CO 2 -based chemical production process which is divided into three main parts. The first part consists of the investigation of solid carbonaceous samples behaviours under pyrolysis and combustion processes. The second part covers experimental study of CO 2 gasification aiming at the identification of interactions during co-gasification. Here, the presence of interactions will be further discussed, particularly in terms of increasing the gasification rate of low reactive carbonaceous sample and the effect of pyrolysis heating methods on gasification reactivity. The last part considers the thermodynamic assessment of conventional and CO 2 -enhanced biomass gasification. The objective is to identify the influence of CO 2 as a gasifying agent in biomass gasification. Moreover, the comparisons study of bio-DME production based on conventional and CO 2 -enhanced gasification was also carried out in this thesis. (i) Pyrolysis of NMPCBS and combustion of solid carbonaceous materials This part consists of investigation of solid carbonaceous samples behaviours under pyrolysis and combustion processes. The objective is to explore the feasibility of the utilization of non-metallic part of waste printed circuit boards (NMPCB), including the thermal behaviours of NMPCB and its blends with two types of coals by using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). For individual sample, the results showed that the NMPCB had the <b>fastest</b> rate of <b>pyrolysis</b> and the highest maximum weight loss rate compared with coals, thus, the highest reactivity. These were attributed to the thermal degradation properties of the constituent elements in NMPCB. Meanwhile, based on kinetic study, it is evident that the lower heating rates favoured the pyrolysis process. For blends, it was revealed that there was 6...|$|R
40|$|During {{the seventh}} European Meeting on Chemical Industry and Environment (EMChIE), held in Tarragona (Spain) in June 2015, the {{production}} of bio-energy {{was one of the}} main focus domains of the conference. Submitted papers were peer reviewed and a selection was made in terms of a special issue by Renewable Energy. The selected papers of the EMChIE conference were complemented with additional papers submitted directly to the journal, but dealing with the same target technologies. The present Special Issue summarizes the different contributions, mainly divided in two sub-topics, being (i) anaerobic digestion and (ii) pyrolysis or bio-energy in a broader context. Anaerobic digestion is increasingly applied as a sustainable technique to handle a wide variety of organic waste streams such as manure, wastewater treatment sludge and agricultural wastes. While degrading the organic matter in the waste, an energy rich biogas is formed, which can be used for the on-site production of electricity, in most cases combined with heat recovery. Both are considered renewable and sustainable. When applying anaerobic digestion to waste sludge, anaerobic digestion affectively achieves a reduction of the operating costs of the wastewater treatment plant because of a decrease in sludge handling and disposal costs, again combined with energetic benefits as mentioned before. However, the process (conversion) efficiency is limited because of some drawbacks such as slow and incomplete degradation rates (the result of the slow and rate-limiting sludge hydrolysis step) due to the low biodegradability of a significant part of the organic matter. Methods to enhance the biogas formation should hence make the substrate more accessible to the anaerobic micro-organisms. Various contributions to this Special Issue evaluated different approaches to overcoming these drawbacks and hence enhancing the biogas production by co-digestion of agro-industrial wastes, or by applying ozonation, ultrasound or thermal hydrolysis as a pre-treatment step. Additional papers investigated the upgrading of the biogas by removal of H 2 S, the use of biogas in spark ignition engines, and the analysis of accidents in the biogas production and upgrading. As alternative to producing biogas, the possibility of dark fermentation of corn starch wastewater to H 2 was examined. In addition to anaerobic digestion, the transformation of biomass waste to biofuels and biomaterial building blocks was examined, with pyrolysis as main thermal technique applied. Pyrolysis processes crack large organic molecules thermally in the absence of oxygen. The products include (i) bio oil, which is targeted to be used as a liquid fuel, or from which valuable chemical can be recovered, (ii) biochar, the solid fraction, which is applied for land application and (iii) non-condensible gases, that are in most cases burned with heat recovery to sustain the high temperature (endothermal) pyrolysis process. Both slow <b>pyrolysis</b> and <b>fast</b> solar <b>pyrolysis</b> were dealt with. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Research on the CO 2 {{adsorption}} on {{activated carbon}} (AC) adsorbents has gained significant interest {{due to their}} low cost, low regeneration energy, and eco-friendly characteristics. The current research {{was focused on the}} systematic development of AC using different types of biomass, pyrolysis conditions and activation conditions to prepare adsorbent with tailored textural properties for CO 2 separation under simulated flue gas conditions. Impact of MgO impregnation on CO 2 adsorption behavior of AC was also studied and an isothermal mass transfer model was developed to model the CO 2 adsorption process in a binary mixture on porous carbon. The work was divided into four phases. The first phase of the work was focused on the synthesis of activated carbon using steam, CO 2 and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as activating agents and evaluation of the CO 2 adsorption performance under a range of temperature and inlet CO 2 concentrations (CCO 2). The KOH treated activated carbon had the best CO 2 adsorption performance of 1. 8 mol/kg due to its microporous structure under the optimized experimental conditions of 30 mol% CO 2 and 25 °C. All prepared activated carbon samples had a better performance at low temperature (~ 25 °C) and/or high CCO 2 (~ 30 mol%). In the second phase, the KOH activation conditions in the first phase was used for the activated carbon preparation using three different types of biomass (forest residue, agricultural residue and animal manure) as precursor and two different <b>pyrolysis</b> processes (<b>fast</b> and slow <b>pyrolysis).</b> The main finding in this phase was that activated carbons have different sensitivity to CO 2 separation according to their micro-pore distributions; and total pore volume and surface area are not significant factors for CO 2 adsorption on ACs. Overall, the pinewood saw dust derived ACs showed the best adsorption capacity of 78. 1 mg/g (at 15 mol% CO 2 in N 2 and 25 °C). In phase 3, the results of impregnating AC with magnesium oxide (MgO) showed that preparation method has a greater impact than metal content on the surface area and porosity of ACs. Moreover, MgO impregnation of AC overcomes the limitation of using not–impregnated AC at moderate temperature and low partial pressure of CO 2. In the phase 4, an isothermal mass transfer model for CO 2 adsorption in a mixture of CO 2 /N 2 has been developed. The adsorption equilibrium data of CO 2 on KOH activated carbon were determined at 273, 298, 323 and 348 K. The simulation of CO 2 adsorption in a fixed-bed of activated carbon was performed in Python using a bi-Linear Driving Force (bi-LDF) approximation for isothermal mass transfer. The model was used to reproduce the CO 2 adsorption breakthrough curves for CO 2 /N 2 gas mixture and it can be used for designing a fixed-bed adsorption process to separate CO 2 and N 2 using microporous and mesoporous carbon materials...|$|R
