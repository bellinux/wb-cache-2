I did that and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference.

[...] Vandernoot had {{to adapt to the}} North American way of filming series and learn to work fast. She said that filming the series was [...] "...exhausting but formative", and that filming in English was [...] "challenging". Vandernoot, who is a native French speaker, had a dialect coach.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about his}} pass on Räikkönen {{in the closing}} laps, Massa said that [...] "it was {{the best time for}} me in the race, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> strong and then I caught him and I passed him." [...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean we know what we want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Thompson starred {{alongside}} John Lynch, Geraldine Somerville, Lauren Cook and John Thomson in the Jim Doyle-directed film Re-Inventing Eddie. The {{movie is}} about a man named Eddie (Lynch), who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent bathtime game with his children is taken out of context. About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!. Out of around 400 hopeful youngsters, {{he was one of}} only a few to be selected to appear in the show. Prior to Stupid!s launch on the CBBC channel in 2004, Thompson commented, [...] "When I first started going to auditions <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> nervous but now I just get on with it. I go to quite a few and it gets easier." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Olivier Deriviere, who recorded the score with a 70-piece orchestra, then modified and changed it using electronic equipment. In {{an interview with}} Game Informer, Deriviere said: [...] "During my first contact , <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> confused by so much information and I felt the music should reflect this confusion". Deriviere disclosed that players would not hear the main theme {{until the end of}} the game, given that it is scattered in pieces through the rest of the score to reflect the nature of the game and the story of Nilin. For his work, Deriviere was awarded the 2013 IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media. Remember Me was created with Unreal Engine 3 to lessen the workload involved in making a new intellectual property with a nascent studio of just under 100 employees. To evaluate the engine, Dontnod collaborated with Epic Games' engineering team at various stages during production.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the special}} did garner some {{positive}} reception. Nancy Basile of the About.com gave the special positive reviews and wrote [...] "I had doubts {{that the recent}} Truth or Square special of SpongeBob SquarePants would be funny or clever. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> wrong." [...] She added that [...] "My kids and I were mesmerized." [...] Jose Strike of the Animation World Network positively reacted to the special and wrote [...] "Truth or Square is a major treat; in fact, I'm so happy I think I'll drop on the deck and flop like a fish..." [...] Ian Jane of DVD Talk said [...] "Truth or Square isn't your typical episode, as it mixes {{up a lot of}} live action material in with the more traditional animated sequences to very unusual effect." [...] He added [...] "but there's enough here in terms of the gags and the jokes that even if it's not a classic episode, it's still one worth seeing." [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson said that the special is her favorite among the series.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, {{a battle}} raged {{in the letters}} pages of The Guardian and The Independent. In The Guardian on April 20, 1989, Hughes wrote the article [...] "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace": [...] "In the years soon after [...] death, when {{scholars}} approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early. [...] If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, {{in the hope of}} correcting some fantasy, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal {{to have anything to do}} with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech [...] The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know." [...] Hughes died in 1998.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>quite</b> rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until II." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after arriving, the 146th Brigade's leading battalions {{began to}} move south. On 21 April, Carton De Wiart's troops engaged in the first {{encounter}} of the war between British and German troops. The British troops, largely confined to the road network and advancing in deep snow, were engaged by a slightly larger German force that was supported by artillery and air support. The Germans, utilizing sledges, motorcycles, and ski-troops were able to outmanoeuvre and force back the British. German follow-up attacks did not materialize, however the Luftwaffe heavily bombed the small port at Namsos. Carton De Wiart cabled the War Office and stated [...] "with my lack of equipment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> incapable of advancing on Trondheim and could see very little point in remaining {{in that part of}} Norway sitting out like rabbits in the snow." [...] The evacuation was not ordered {{until the end of the}} month and then completed in the early days of May, following the loss of 157 men of Mauriceforce. The lack of success in Norway, and the withdrawal of the forces attempting to retake Trondheim resulted in the collapse of Chamberlain's Government. Carton De Wiart, considered a daring and aggressive commander, was – per historian Jack Adams – [...] "hampered by... climatic and geographic conditions" [...] in addition to his troops being [...] "inexperienced, poorly prepared and badly backed up".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was divided, as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative. In the book The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 5, author Andy Meisler {{noted that some}} fans and critics responded positively to [...] "The Beginning," [...] most notably because the episode functioned as [...] "a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series's new season—and era." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' {{was a pretty good}} premiere episode. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting the shit out of Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, but it works well enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E
500|$|His {{contract}} was terminated {{by mutual consent}} with a year to run on 16 June 2008 and he joined Wycombe later that day. On joining Wycombe, Mousinho said [...] "It's been my local club since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> young so I've been down here {{a few times and}} it was the lure of that, plus the chance to work with Peter Taylor, that made me jump at the chance". He made his debut for Wycombe in a 1–1 draw against Morecambe, and scored his first goal for the club shortly after in a 2–0 away victory over Chester City. Shortly after this, Wycombe triggered a one–year extension clause in his contract, subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010. Mousinho scored his second goal of the season in Wycombe's 3–3 draw against his former employers, Brentford, netting in the first–half of the game with a volley. Two weeks later, he provided the assist for John Akinde's goal in the club's 1–1 draw with Barnet. He played a total of 38 times in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring twice as Wycombe earned promotion to League One after finishing in the third and final automatic promotion place. The following season, he played a further 41 games for the club, scoring once in a 5–2 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, but Wycombe were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. During his two years at Wycombe, he played a total of 79 times for the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} {{head when}} Ernest {{returned}} for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The 50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a [...] "strong push", and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred {{on the grounds that they}} might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, [...] "When I lived here <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me." [...] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, [...] "Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs." [...] This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, [...] "No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!" [...] The Queen also recorded that though King Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{had a more}} mixed reaction, {{giving the}} episode a rating of C+ and criticizing lead guest actor Cameron Monaghan, [...] "In this role, he was a drag, playing 'rebellious teen' in a stock, wooden way, with no extra layers. Also, nobody—not even Joshua Jackson, whom I've come to {{appreciate}} more as an actor over the run of this show—could make the 'My mind is being controlled!' scenes look anything other than goofy." [...] Murray also said, [...] "Yet for all my griping, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> taken with {{the theme of this}} episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the tinfoil Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in 'Of Human Action' about childish things." [...] Ramsey Isler from IGN graded the episode 8.0/10, explaining that despite it being a [...] "standalone" [...] episode, it was [...] "a high-intensity, action-filled tale that kept the adrenaline flowing. Fringe is usually more of a cerebral show, but there's nothing wrong with appealing to our love of action every now and then". Also positive was Chanel Reeder of Newsarama, who believed Fringe [...] "totally deliver in its most recent episode. The twists are back, along with the dramatic high intensity moments that the show is known for." [...] Reeder praised the plot twist of Tyler being the mind controller, and was pleased with the increased presence of Massive Dynamic.|$|E
500|$|In {{a notable}} {{contemporary}} act of conscience, Christian bushwalker Brenda Hean protested against the flooding of Lake Pedder despite threats and that {{ultimately lead to}} her death. Another was the campaign by Ken Saro-Wiwa against oil extraction by multinational corporations in Nigeria {{that led to his}} execution. So too was the act by the Tank Man, or the Unknown Rebel photographed holding his shopping bag in the path of tanks during the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 5 June 1989. The actions of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld to try and achieve peace in the Congo despite the (eventuating) threat to his life, were strongly motivated by conscience as is reflected in his diary, Vägmärken (Markings). Another example involved the actions of Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr to try and prevent the My Lai Massacre in the Vietnam War. Evan Pederick voluntarily confessed and was convicted of the Sydney Hilton bombing stating that his conscience could not tolerate the guilt and that [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent." [...] Vasili Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer on out-of-radio-contact Soviet submarine B-59 being depth-charged by US warships during the Cuban Missile Crisis whose dissent when two other officers decided to launch a nuclear torpedo (unanimous agreement to launch was required) may have averted a nuclear war.

60|$|I have {{received}} a serious, and to me, at any rate, an impressive remonstrance from the Scottish Patriotic Association. It appears that I recently referred to Edward VII. of Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, under the horrible description of the King of England. The Scottish Patriotic Association draws my {{attention to the fact}} that by the provisions of the Act of Union, and the tradition of nationality, the monarch should be referred to as the King of Britain. The blow thus struck at me is particularly wounding because it <b>is</b> particularly unjust. <b>I</b> believe in the reality of the independent nationalities under the British Crown much more passionately and positively than any other educated Englishman of my acquaintance believes in it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that Scotland <b>is</b> a nation; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that nationality is the key of Scotland; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that all our success with Scotland has been due to the fact that we have in spirit treated it as a nation. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that Ireland <b>is</b> a nation; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that nationality is the key to Ireland; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that all our failure in Ireland arose from the fact that we would not in spirit treat it as a nation. It would be difficult to find, even among the innumerable examples that exist, a stronger example of the immensely superior importance of sentiment to what is called practicality than this case of the two sister nations. It is not that we have encouraged a Scotchman to be rich; it is not that we have encouraged a Scotchman to be active; it is not that we have encouraged a Scotchman to be free.
