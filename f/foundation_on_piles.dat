40|$|The {{construction}} of an artificial island {{is one of the}} solutions to be able to drill for oil safely in the Caspian Sea. On this island the required facilities are installed. Construction of an artificial island however, results in loading of the subsoil and will trigger settlements. Consolidation is one of the processes which cause the settlement. Differential settlements can damage the shallow foundations on the island. In order to prevent this, an alternative <b>foundation</b> <b>on</b> <b>piles</b> needs to be considered. Piles placed in a thick, soft soil layer will have low end bearing capacity, and thus need to activate skin friction. Since the surrounding soft soil is consolidating, these piles will have their own challenges. The relative movement between pile and soil determines the zones of negative and positive skin friction. Positive skin friction will need to be mobilized to support pile loading. Applying load on the head creates additional pile settlements, thus expanding the zone of positive skin friction. The consequence of this is that the bearing capacity of the pile is increased. This research looks into the two dominant parts of these friction piles in a consolidating soil profile. The driving mechanism, consolidation and subsequent settlement of the subsoil, is studied. Besides that the behavior of the interface between the soil and the installed piled is considered. Site investigations performed at the reference project are interpreted and a ‘Caspian’ soil profile can be determined. Besides this general profile a ‘Centrifuge’ soil profile is determined, which is revised to fit the specifications of the centrifuge. A one layer ‘benchmark’ situation is created to check the different calculation methods. The reaction of the ‘centrifuge’ and ‘benchmark’ soil profiles to the new loading situation is calculated and can be checked with centrifuge measurements. Recreating a two layer soil profile, containing stiff and soft clay, is done in the centrifuge. Msettle, a Hand Calculation and the Plaxis Soft Soil model give an accurate representation of the settlement in the physical model. The settlement in time seems to be described accurately as well. Calculations are done with a constant permeability. The “settlement in time” lines are calculated with Msettle and give a good image of the decrease in permeability during the performed centrifuge tests. The measured compression parameters for Kaolin Clay agree well with the values found in the literature. These compression parameters are tested in an oedometer test, and are given in a one dimensional stress space. Recalculation of the compression parameters into isotropic stress dependent parameters does not give the same settlement predictions. The used relationships given in the Plaxis 2 D Material Models manual do not seem to give an accurate relation. The performed direct shear box tests show that the peak friction on the pile-soil interface is mobilized at displacements of about one millimeter. Further shearing led to a decrease in maximum shear stress, the so called residual value. Geo-engineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Marine structures, {{offshore}} platforms and bridge piers are usually supported <b>on</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>piles.</b> These piles {{are subjected to}} lateral loading due to wind, waves and currents. Piles installed in marine or river environments are susceptible to scour depending on wave and current characteristics and soil types.

40|$|Static load tests <b>on</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> are {{generally}} {{carried out in}} order to determine load – the displacement characteristic of the pile head. For standard (basic) engineering practices this type of test usually provides enough information. However, the knowledge of force distribution along the pile core and its division into the friction along the shaft and the resistance under the base can be very useful. Such information can be obtained by strain gage pile instrumentation [1]. Significant investigations have been completed on this technology, proving its utility and correctness [8], [10], [12]. The results of static tests <b>on</b> instrumented <b>piles</b> are not easy to interpret. There are many factors and processes affecting the final outcome. In order to understand better the whole testing process and soil-structure behavior some investigations and numerical analyses were done. In the paper, real data from a field load test <b>on</b> instrumented <b>piles</b> is discussed and compared with numerical simulation of such a test in similar conditions. Differences and difficulties in the results interpretation with their possible reasons are discussed.

40|$|Most {{foundation}} {{solutions for}} transportation structures rely <b>on</b> deep <b>foundations,</b> often <b>on</b> <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> configured {{in a way}} most suitable to the problem at hand. Design of pile foundation solutions can best be pursued by clearly defining limit states and then configuring the piles {{in such a way}} as to prevent the attainment of these limit states. The present report develops methods for load and resistance factor design (LRFD) of piles, both nondisplacement and displacement piles, in sand and clay. With the exception of the method for design of displacement piles in sand, all the methods are based on rigorous theoretical mechanics solutions of the pile loading problem. In all cases, the uncertainty of the variables appearing in the problem and of the relationships linking these variables to the resistance calculated using these relationships are carefully assessed. Monte Carlo simulations using these relationships and the associated variabilities allow simulation of resistance minus load distributions and therefore probability of failure. The mean (or nominal) values of the variables can be adjusted so that the probability of failure can be made to match a target probability of failure. Since an infinite number of combinations of these means can be made to lead to the same target probability of failure, we have developed a way to determine the most likely ultimate limit state for a given probability of failure. Once the most likely ultimate limit state is determined, the values of loads and resistances for this limit state can be used, together with the values of the mean (or nominal) loads and resistances to calculate load and resistance factors. The last step in the process involves adjusting the resistance factors so that they are consistent with the load factors specified by AASHTO. Recommended resistance factors are then given together with the design methods for which they were developed...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} piles is quit complex and the {{estimation}} of carrying capacity is calculated fro m theoretical formula and load test results. The design resistance may be calculated using conventional static pile design theory. The pile founding depths should be predetermined before installation from a site geotechnical investigation. To ascertain the field per formance and estimate load carrying capacities of piles, in-situ pile load tests should be conducted. In this study, field pile load test data is analyzed to estimate the ultimate load for end bearing piles. The investigated site is about 100 × 110 m located in Alexandria, Egypt. Geotechnical investigations at the site are carried out to a maximum depth of 45 m. Four borings {{have been done in}} field. The tests are conducted at the site for two skelton structure buildings to be con structed <b>on</b> raft <b>foundation</b> rested <b>on</b> <b>piles</b> executed by continuous flight auger. Four pile load tests are performed on 600 mmdiameters and 27 mlengths. Ultimate capacities of piles are determined according to different methods. It i s concluded that the percentage of friction load carried by the shaft along the pile length is about 46 % of total load while the percentage of load carried by the end bearing is 54 % of total load. A new proposed method by the author is pre sented to calculate the ultimate capacity of pile from pile load test. The proposed method depends on the settlement of pile without taken into consideration the elastic deformation. An empirical formula is presented from the relationship between stress and settlement of pile due to friction and end bearing only after deducting the elastic deformation. How ever, the obtained results for the ultimate capacity of end bearing piles are considered to be more accurate than other methods. The proposed method appears to give bitter results that agrees well with the theoretical predictions. The pro posed method is easier, quicker and more reliable. </p...|$|R
