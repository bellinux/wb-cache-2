5|$|Stoneman and Burbridge {{continued}} on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men. Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped {{just so they}} could <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> volley into the Union cavalry.

5|$|A {{defining}} {{aspect of}} the series is the Personas, manifestations of a person's psyche. Many Personas used up to Persona 3 are inspired by Graeco-Roman mythology.

The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in Persona 3, they <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in Persona 4, they summon their Personas using Tarot cards; in Persona 5, they are summoned through the characters' masks.|$|E

5|$|Bramshill House, in Bramshill, {{northeast}} Hampshire, England, {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most important Jacobean prodigy house mansions in England. It was built in the early 17th century by Baron Edward la Zouche of Harringworth, but was partly destroyed by <b>fire</b> <b>a</b> few years later.

5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of <b>fire.</b> <b>A</b> pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 the Kaqchikel {{suffered}} from a plague of locusts.
