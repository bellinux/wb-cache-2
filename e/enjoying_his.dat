5|$|The Bangladeshisneeding 310 runs to make Australia bat againcounterattacked {{before the}} {{conclusion}} of day two. Despite losing Javed Omar, leg before wicket to McGrath for five, opening batsman Hannan Sarkar and their leading International run-scorer, Habibul Bashar took the score to 89. The pair scored at a run-rate of 3.98 runs per over, before the partnership was ended when Sarkar was caught behind for 35. This sparked a collapse, with Bangladesh bowled out for 178. Australian leg spinner Stuart MacGill took 5/65his seventh Test five-wicket haulas Australia won by an innings and 132 runs.

5|$|Nelson {{was dismayed}} by Spencer's decision, and {{declared}} that he would rather have received no title {{than that of a}} mere barony. He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of Naples, the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and the comforts he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> lifestyle in Naples, Nelson began to think of returning to England, but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E

The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold only 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track failed to appear on the Top 100.|$|E
25|$|The Riddle family, an old gentry family, {{consisted}} of old Thomas and Mary Riddle and their son, Tom Riddle, Esq.

They lived in a large house with fine gardens, but were unpopular amongst the local residents due to their snobbish attitudes.

25|$|As {{the broader}} musical climate soured on the arena-rock style {{that had been}} Petra's musical core, the band {{continued}} to revamp its style, breaking with the Elefante brothers {{for the first time}} in six records. Instead, Brown Bannister, who at the time had won eight Grammy awards as a producer and songwriter, mostly for Amy Grant, was brought in. The reason for the change was purely practical: the band, now consisting largely of middle-aged fathers living in Nashville, did not want to travel to California, where the Elefantes were based, to record an album. Also seeking a new musical direction, the band sought out Bannister after <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> work for White Heart earlier in the decade.|$|E
25|$|Charles' next club {{would be}} Welsh Football League side Porthmadog. Despite {{being a little}} known outfit, the club was bankrolled by a millionaire, and so Charles was paid a higher wage than he had {{received}} at Arsenal and Cardiff. They finished the 1965–66 season second in the Welsh League, behind Caernarfon Town. Despite <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> time in North Wales, {{he decided that he}} could not turn down an offer to return to the Football League by Port Vale, then managed by Stanley Matthews. Port Vale paid Porthmadog a £1,250 fee, and Charles made his Vale debut in a 1–0 defeat at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 3 February 1967. He played a further six games, including a rough encounter with Walsall, another one of Vale's rivals, before he decided to head back to Wales.|$|E
25|$|Sir James Paget had {{the gift}} of eloquence, {{and was one of}} the most careful and most {{delightful}} speakers of his time. He had a natural and unaffected pleasure in society, and he loved music. He possessed the rare gift of the ability to turn swiftly from work to play, <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> holidays like a schoolboy, easily moved to laughter, keen to get the maximum of happiness out of very ordinary amusements, emotional in spite of incessant self-restraint, and vigorous in spite of constant overwork. In him a certain light-hearted enjoyment was combined with the utmost reserve, unfailing religious faith, and the most scrupulous honour. He was all his life profoundly indifferent toward politics, both national and medical; his ideal was the unity of science and practice in the professional life.|$|E

25|$|In August, Button became {{embroiled in}} a {{contract}} dispute. On 5 August, Button chose to leave BAR and signed a two-year contract to return to Williams. This was surprising, as Button was <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> best season to date, while Williams had been struggling. BAR, however, insisted they {{had the right to}} exercise their option to keep Button. Button's management argued that the BAR option was not valid because it contained a clause allowing him to leave if BAR risked losing their Honda engines. They felt the new contract signed in the summer for Honda to supply engines to BAR was not definitive, and thus Button was free to move. The dispute went to Formula One's Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of BAR on 20 October, forcing Button to stay with the team. Two of the men at the centre of the dispute were soon removed from their positions: team principal David Richards was replaced by Nick Fry after Honda bought 45 percent of the BAR business; and Button separated from his manager John Byfield, saying he had been badly advised.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the naturalization procedures, Lazăr Șăineanu eventually renounced Judaism and accepted baptism in the Romanian Orthodox Church. His godfather was Take Ionescu, {{at the time a}} rising figure within the Conservative Party ranks. Ionescu himself served as Minister of Education, appreciating the scholar's insight and <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> company before taking his distance from him for reasons unknown. Șăineanu's case was again presented for Senate approval in December 1899, this time with a favorable review from the special parliamentary commission, and the motion for his naturalization was carried with 37 to 2 votes (or, according to Șăineanu, a 39-vote unanimity). Although the result was positive, the scientist was informed that a new procedure had just been passed with support from across the floor, specifying that naturalization could only be enforced by vote in a common session of the two chambers. The dossier was therefore submitted to another vote, on the last session of 1899, which again enlisted attacks from the antisemitic groups, before being canceled due to lack of quorum.|$|E
25|$|The band {{soon after}} began a {{longtime}} association with Blackout Records, who released {{some of their}} songs on the label's compilation Where the Wild Things Are, in 1989, along with a 7 inch Live At CBGB release. The following year, the band recorded their debut full length Just Can't Hate Enough. The record was engineered by Tommy Victor of Prong. As Victor also worked at CBGB, {{he was able to}} allow the band to record live at the famous bar in the morning and afternoon hours before shows were held. The record was released in Germany on Starving Missile Records, and later released stateside under the Blackout name. Just Can't Hate Enough quickly became one of the records that defined the new, heavier sound of hardcore that was emerging at the time, played by bands such as Biohazard and Killing Time, among others. The guitar tone and riffs, in particular, display a large heavy metal influence, especially from Swiss speed metallers Celtic Frost, who were allegedly one of Alan Blake's favorite bands. The band also became known for Bearer's no-nonsense stage personality, with some finding him offensive, and others <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> often blunt and obscenity filled humor.|$|E

25|$|Infuriated at {{the murderer}} for killing {{someone who was}} <b>enjoying</b> <b>his</b> {{hospitality}} and skeptical of Assa's guilt, Wolfe determines to identify the true culprit. He, along with Archie and Saul Panzer, travels to the offices of LBA and inspects a display of products from their clients, discovering a bottle of cyanide that he suspects was used to murder Assa; this confirms in Wolfe's mind the guilt {{of one of the}} executives. Confronting Burr, O'Garro and Hansen, Wolfe lays out {{the facts of the case}} and accuses Burr of murdering both Dahlmann and Assa. Burr is the only man who had clear means and opportunity, and Wolfe speculates that he was driven to murder Dahlmann out of jealousy and fear over Dahlmann's skills eclipsing and threatening his position. Assa discovered the wallet that Burr stole from Dahlmann to cover his tracks, and Burr murdered him to silence him. When Burr tries to throw guilt on O'Garro, O'Garro reveals that Wolfe is correct. Burr is convicted of murder, but the remaining LBA executives challenge Wolfe's fee, arguing that as the thief and murderer Burr presumably exposed himself when he sent out the letters containing the final answers. In response, Wolfe reveals in confidence that he will be adding onto his bill the price of a used typewriter that has been disposed of in the East River, implying that he was in fact responsible for sending out the letters and saving them from humiliation after all.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enjoying</b> <b>his</b> {{time at the}} Staff College, Dempsey's first posting after Camberley was as a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) to the Military Secretary, {{where he}} became {{responsible}} for the careers of all officers below the rank of colonel, having access to their annual confidential reports. Dempsey, by now a major (having been promoted in September 1932), held this post until late January 1934, when he handed over to Brian Horrocks upon receiving an appointment as brigade major of the 5th Infantry Brigade. The brigade, commanded by Brigadier Victor Fortune (Francis Nosworthy from 1935), formed part of the 2nd Division, then commanded by Major General Archibald Wavell, was serving in Aldershot Command and took part in numerous large-scale military maneouvres throughout Dempsey's time as brigade major and, after handing over again to Brian Horrocks in February 1936, {{he returned to the}} 1st Battalion of his regiment, taking command of HQ Company. The battalion, then stationed in Shorncliffe, Kent, was serving as part of the 10th Brigade of the 4th Division, and shortly after Dempsey's return, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Eric Miles. The following year Dempsey attended a brief course at the Senior Officers' School at Sheerness, before being posted to South Africa, where he served as a GSO2 with the Defence Forces of the Union of South Africa, a posting which he enjoyed. Relinquishing that post in late January 1938, he returned to England soon after to succeed Miles as Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshires, and receiving a promotion to lieutenant colonel. The battalion, still with the 10th Brigade, was both lacking in modern equipment and severely understrength, although, with the possibility of another war in Europe, the situation slowly changed and new equipment and reservists began arriving.|$|E
