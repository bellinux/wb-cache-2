5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing <b>gas-tight</b> doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gas-tight</b> {{connections}} between the flexible hoses and rigid fittings are made by using crimped hose clips or ferrules, {{often referred to as}} 'O' clips, over barbed spigots. The use of worm-drive hose clips or Jubilee clips is specifically forbidden in the UK and other countries.|$|E
25|$|The Class III cabinet, {{generally}} only {{installed in}} maximum containment laboratories, is {{specifically designed for}} work with BSL-4 pathogenic agents, providing maximum protection. The enclosure is <b>gas-tight,</b> and all materials enter and leave through a dunk tank or double-door autoclave. Gloves attached to the front prevent direct contact with hazardous materials (Class III cabinets are sometimes called glove box). These custom-built cabinets often attach into a line, and the lab equipment installed inside is usually custom-built as well.|$|E
25|$|The shell's {{explosive}} {{was contained}} in two compartments, {{separated by a}} wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuses was mounted in the wall, with {{the other in the}} base of the shell. The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap – a highly unusual feature for the time – and the side had grooves that engaged with the rifling of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper driving bands provided a <b>gas-tight</b> seal against the gun barrel during firing.|$|E
25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a <b>gas-tight</b> door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
500|$|The first {{gas chamber}} at Auschwitz II–Birkenau was the [...] "red house" [...] (called Bunker 1 by SS staff), a brick cottage {{converted}} to a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the windows. It was operational by March 1942. A second brick cottage, the [...] "white house" [...] or Bunker 2, was converted some weeks later. According to Höss, Bunker 1 held 800 victims and Bunker 2 held 1,200 victims. These structures were in use for mass killings until early 1943. At that point, the Nazis decided to greatly increase the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, originally designed as a mortuary, with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing <b>gas-tight</b> doors, vents for the Zyklon B to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas afterwards.

2500|$|The Japanese {{produced}} some unusual and advanced features. The third group of Fubukis introduced a unique splinterproof torpedo tube turret (later retrofitted), allowing the tubes to be reloaded in action. [...] In addition, they introduced splinterproof, <b>gas-tight</b> turrets for the 5-inch guns, {{far ahead of}} their time. To increase comfort, the forecastle was raised and the bridge enlarged and enclosed, to offer protection against weather in the Pacific. Furthermore, in line with Japan's evident preference for two stacks, Fubukis had an unusual siamesed design.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{continuing}} problems with sensitive vertical seismographs is the buoyancy of their masses. [...] The uneven changes in pressure caused by wind blowing on an open window can easily change {{the density of the}} air in a room enough to cause a vertical seismograph to show spurious signals. [...] Therefore, most professional seismographs are sealed in rigid <b>gas-tight</b> enclosures. [...] For example, this is why a common Streckeisen model has a thick glass base that must be glued to its pier without bubbles in the glue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{individual}} fortifications {{were typically}} built in rock on valley sides. [...] Where {{this was not}} suitable, concrete was used for protection, {{with a minimum of}} openings and three to five metres of concrete thickness. [...] Combat blocks were to the front, with ammunition rooms behind. [...] Underground galleries connected the combat blocks and their support areas, such as the utility rooms, barracks, storage and command centres, with the main entry farthest to the rear. Combat areas were isolated {{from the rest of the}} structure by <b>gas-tight</b> doorways. [...] Units built after 1939 were designed to operate independently, cut off from utilities and supplies.|$|E
60|$|From the {{magazine}} amidships a covered canvas gallery with aluminium treads on its floor and a hand-rope, ran back underneath the gas-chamber to the engine-room at the tail; but along this Bert did not go, and from first to last {{he never saw}} the engines. But he went up a ladder against a gale of ventilation--a ladder that was encased {{in a kind of}} <b>gas-tight</b> fire escape--and ran right athwart the great forward air-chamber to the little look-out gallery with a telephone, that gallery that bore the light pom-pom of German steel and its locker of shells. This gallery was all of aluminium magnesium alloy, the tight front of the air-ship swelled cliff-like above and below, and the black eagle sprawled overwhelmingly gigantic, its extremities all hidden by the bulge of the gas-bag. And far down, under the soaring eagles, was England, four thousand feet below perhaps, and looking very small and defenceless indeed in the morning sunlight.|$|E

50|$|In the {{apparatus}} a fixed volume of sample oil is directly {{drawn from a}} sample tube into a degassing vessel under vacuum, where the gases are released. These gases are isolated using a mercury piston to measure its volume at atmospheric pressure and subsequent transfer to a gas chromatograph using a <b>gas-tight</b> syringe or auto-sampler.|$|E
50|$|A piston is a {{component}} of reciprocating engines. It {{is located in a}} cylinder and is made <b>gas-tight</b> by piston rings. Its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In two-stroke engines the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall.|$|E
50|$|As regards {{specifications}} for the <b>gas-tight</b> armour, the required thickness remained at sixty millimetres, but a requirement was added that appliqué armour construction techniques not be used, {{along with a}} detail requirement that the armour could be cast — with the sections connected by bolts or, preferably, gudgeons — or electrically welded. A requirement that automatic fire-extinguishers be present also was added.|$|E
50|$|The vent-sealing tube {{accurately}} {{fits into}} a chamber formed {{at the end}} of the vent, and is held in place by the gun lock or some similar means. The force of the explosion expands the tube against the walls of its chamber, while the internal structure of the tube renders it <b>gas-tight,</b> preventing any escape of gas through the vent.|$|E
