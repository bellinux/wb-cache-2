40|$|In high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) process of aluminium alloys cast alloy soldering severely damages tool surfaces. It hampers casting ejection, reduces the casting quality and decreases the overall production efficiency. Thin ceramic PVD (physical vapor deposition) coatings applied on tool surfaces successfully reduce these effects. However, their performance is still not recognised for surfaces with various topographies. In this investigation, soldering tendency of Al-Si-Cu alloy toward EN X 27 CrMoV 51 steel, plasma nitrided steel, CrN and TiAlN duplex PVD coatings is evaluated using <b>ejection</b> <b>test.</b> The coatings were prepared {{to a range of}} surface roughness and topographies. After the tests sample surfaces were analysed by different microscopy techniques and profilometry. It was found that the ejection performance is independent of the chemical composition of investigated materials. After the ejection, the cast alloy soldering layer was found on surfaces of all tested materials. This built-up layer formed by effects of mechanical soldering, without corrosion reactions. Coated samples displayed a pronounced dependence of ejection force on surface roughness and topography. By decreasing roughness, ejection force increased, which is a consequence of intensified adhesion effects. Presented findings are a novel information important for efficient application of PVD coatings intendent for protection of HPDC tools...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInk-jet {{printing}} (IJP) is a {{rapid prototyping}} method {{which is very}} promising for the manufacturing of multilayer hybrid circuits. Before the formulation of inks, the first step aims to ensure the stability of dielectric powder sus-pensions with the specifications required for the IJP process in terms of solid content, particle size, rheology, and stability versus sedimentation. A commercial glass silicate powder currently used as a dielectric material was studied during an attrition milling (i) for low ceramic loading (3 vol. %) and (ii) for significant ceramic loading (20 vol. %) with different dispersants: polyelectrolytes with carboxylate groups, and sulfate groups. The milling step impact on the surface chemistry of the powder was investigated in both cases. A potassium polycarboxylate {{was found to be}} the most efficient dispersant, and the optimization of the dispersant rate was carried out through zeta potential measurements, viscosity, dispersant adsorbed rate, and sedimentation tests. An attempt of corre-lation between some of these properties is proposed. The preliminary <b>ejection</b> <b>tests</b> obtained with an ink prepared from an optimized suspension allowed to generate a wide range of drop velocity (0. 7 to 4. 2 m/s) and drop diameter (47 to 56 μm), which will be useful in a further step to optimize the characteristics of green ink-jet printed dielectric layers...|$|R
40|$|Gradual solar {{energetic}} particles (SEPs) {{are associated}} with interplanetary (IP) shock driven by coronal mass <b>ejections.</b> <b>Testing</b> theories/models that are built around shock acceleration mechanisms is difficult due {{to the complexity of}} SEP fluxes acquired by single-point measurements. To circumvent this, we correlate fast-forward shock Mach numbers derived from a 1. 5 D magnetohydrodynamics simulation with the intensity of solar energetic oxygen (O) and helium- 4 (^ 4 He) particles acquired by instruments aboard the ACE spacecraft during a series of coronal mass ejections in 2003 (October 28 - 31). A good correlation at the 5 % significance level is found for O and ^ 4 He with energy (E) > ~ 10 MeV n^(- 1), with the peak correlation coefficient r = 0. 82 for O (E = 63. 8 - 89. 8 MeV n^(- 1)) and r = 0. 77 for ^ 4 He (E = 18. 0 - 29. 4 MeV n^(- 1)), respectively, for hourly averaged data. This result not only bolsters the causal relationship between IP fast shocks and SEPs, but also suggests that the Mach number of IP shocks {{is one of the major}} controlling parameters for the intensity of SEPs measured in the near-Earth space...|$|R

40|$|Stemming {{is used in}} {{blasting}} operations to help contain explosive gases as long as possible. Stemming can reduce airblast, improve fragmentation, and reduce the chances of hot explosive gases igniting methane and dust explosions in underground mines. Stemming is required in underground coal mines but is generally not used in underground metal and nonmetal mines. Some underground metal and nonmetal mines are classified as gassy and can require special blasting procedures {{such as the use}} of stemming to minsure the safety of miners. The types and amounts of stemming material that are desirable in underground metal and nonmetal mine blasting to ensure good or improved fragmentation while containing the hot gases are largely unknown. This Bureau of Mines research examined the effectiveness of differing lengths of stemming by measuring stemming ejection times as related to burden movement. With properly stemmed blasts, stemming is contained until some burden movement has occurred. Test blasts at two surface limestone quarries were evaluated using high-speed photography. For the conditions of these tests, a stemming length of at least 26 charge diameters was found to prevent premature stemming <b>ejection.</b> In <b>tests</b> with stemming lengths of 16 charge diameters, the stemming was effective but there was early venting of hot gases through fractures in the rock.
