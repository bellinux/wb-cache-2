40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{a case study}} regarding the structural optimization of a typical <b>gear</b> <b>bracket</b> used in automobiles. The functional specifications mimic those found in real <b>gear</b> <b>brackets,</b> {{both in terms of}} geometry and boundary conditions, including the loading, thus a direct comparison with such existing brackets can be made. The optimization procedure uses an original implementation of genetic algorithms, as found in the Object-Oriented Genetic Algorithm framework for MATLAB. For the evaluation of solutions, the FEA software Abaqus was used, in conjunction with the scripting language Python. The results show the methodology can lead to lighter parts while keeping the same strength and rigidity requirements. It also allows the automation of a task that would otherwise require important design efforts, without guaranteeing the same quality of solutions...|$|R

50|$|If {{a simple}} gear train has three gears, {{such that the}} input gear GA meshes with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> GI which in turn meshes with the output gear GB, then the pitch circle of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> rolls without {{slipping}} on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this gear ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the gears GA and GB engage directly. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an idler gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} idler gear.|$|R
5000|$|Two manual transmissions, a three-speed and three-speed with {{overdrive}} were available, {{as well as}} three-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission.

50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> {{which does}} not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an [...] gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be {{referred}} to as a reverse idler. For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears.|$|R

Servo-assisted 12 in Girling disc brakes were now installed on the front wheels and Burman recirculating ball power steering was standardised with a turning circle reduced by 4'6". A BorgWarner type DG automatic gearbox was fitted which incorporated a lever on the facia to hold <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> at 35, 45, 55, and 65 m.p.h.|$|R

The two to one speed reduction to the camshafts {{takes place at the}} first stage of the gear train; all the remaining gears between the first <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> and the gears at the camshafts are idlers.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine block}} is {{constructed}} of aluminum with fiber-reinforced metal sleeve. A timing chain drives an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear,</b> which drives the cams. The pistons are forged aluminum. The intake plenum was designed with minimal volume for fast engine response, and a 14 lb flywheel was fitted until 2004. A high-flow catalyst is supplied {{along with an}} exhaust air-injection system, which greatly decrease catalyst light-off time and cold emissions.|$|R
40|$|The Offset Compound Gear Drive is an in-line, discrete, {{two-speed}} device {{utilizing a}} special offset compound gear that has both an internal tooth configuration on the input end and external tooth configuration on the output end, thus {{allowing it to}} mesh in series, simultaneously, with both a smaller external tooth input gear and a larger internal tooth output gear. This unique geometry and offset axis permits the compound gear to mesh with the smaller diameter input gear and the larger diameter output gear, {{both of which are}} on the same central, or primary, centerline. This configuration results in a compact in-line reduction gear set consisting of fewer gears and bearings than a conventional planetary gear train. Switching between the two output ratios is accomplished through a main control clutch and sprag. Power flow to the above is transmitted through concentric power paths. Low-speed operation is accomplished in two meshes. For the purpose of illustrating the low-speed output operation, the following example pitch diameters are given. A 5. 0 pitch diameter (PD) input gear to 7. 50 PD (internal tooth) <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> (0. 667 reduction mesh), and a 7. 50 PD (external tooth) <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> to a 10. 00 PD output gear (0. 750 reduction mesh). Note that it is not required that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> on the offset axis be of the same diameter. For this example, the resultant low-speed ratio is 2 : 1 (output speed = 0. 500; product of stage one 0. 667 reduction and stage two 0. 750 stage reduction). The design is not restricted to the example pitch diameters, or output ratio. From the output gear, power is transmitted through a hollow drive shaft, which, in turn, drives a sprag during which time the main clutch is disengaged...|$|R
30|$|Linear motor {{is a kind}} of {{electrical}} equipment which can directly convert the electrical energy to linear movement. Compared with traditional rotating machine, the drive system of linear motor works without the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gearing,</b> which simplifies the driver system, and makes its linear velocity unlimited and moving process without mechanical touch. In addition, the noise level of linear motor is very low. For all these characteristics, linear motor is widely applied to high-speed ground transportation [1, 2, 3, 4].|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinders}} of the adhesion and cogwheel drives {{have the}} same diameters (Ø 560 mm). The difference in volume (after expulsion from the adhesion system, the steam doubles its volume) is compensated for because the cogwheel drive turns twice as fast. The driving cogwheel is housed in a special frame, that lies above {{the second and third}} axle. The higher cogwheel drive and the lower cogwheel are coupled via an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> with a transmission ratio of 1:2.43.|$|R
40|$|TutorialDuring {{operation}} of compressor trains by a {{variable speed drive}} system (VSDS), integer and non-integer harmonic currents are generated in the inverter. Via the electrical system of the inverter and the motor, an excitation torque is transferred across the motor air gap into the main mass of the motor rotor. The frequency of this excitation may cause torsional resonances. Due to the rapid increase in excitation frequency of integer harmonics, intersections with relevant torsional natural frequencies (TNFs) can in general be avoided within the operating speed range. In contrast, the intersections of the noninteger harmonic excitation frequencies, also called interharmonics, with TNFs within the operating speed range may have an essential impact on the vibration behaviour of the rotating equipment. This aspect has to differentiate between two train configurations. The first are direct driven trains and the second, trains including an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear.</b> For direct driven trains, only fatigue problems have to be considered. In trains with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear,</b> on top of that, interaction of torsional and lateral movement may {{have a negative effect}} on the lateral vibration behaviour of the gear rotors. The main focus of this publication is on a simple but effective method for turbo compressor applications that allows avoiding main resonances within the operating speed range caused by intersections of interharmonic excitations with relevant TNFs. This method is based on detailed knowledge of the inverter behaviour and possible design options of the motor itself. This in-depth understanding was developed by correlating numerical and experimental results based on dynamic torque measurements of real turbo compressor trains. During this investigation the mechanically relevant torsional excitations were identified. Therefore, the different types of inverters and their corresponding characteristics had to be analyzed and understood in detail. This knowledge, in combination with possible motor designs, with regard to the number of pole pairs and the most common train configurations (direct driven and/or trains including <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears),</b> is incorporated in this report...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable transmission members having mating crown gears, driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a driven member. The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> for driving <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, crown gear sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple torque driver mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity. Prior torque drivers such as 'click-type' torque wrenches do not actually limit torque application but only provide an audible warning that the limit has been reached...|$|R

The {{wheelbase}} of the Model TT was 125 in, compared to 100 in for the Model T. It was often equipped with an accessory gearbox, such as the Ruxtell or Jumbo gearboxes, which allowed the truck to have <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> between low and high, useful for hill climbing.|$|R

These are used for applications where extreme mechanical positioning accuracy and high cycling capability are needed. The micro speed unit combines a “main” conical rotor brake motor for rapid speed and a “micro” conical rotor brake motor for slow or positioning speed. The intermediate gearbox allows a range of ratios, and motors of different speeds can be combined to produce high ratios between high and low speed.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the heel-toe-double-clutch is to {{downshift}} more than one gear to use engine braking in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear.</b> This provides maximum braking and optimal engine speed for exiting the corner while causing the least wear of the entire drive train. While this is not double clutching in the conventional sense, the term is used to describe this technique since the clutch pedal is pressed more than once. Note that racers will sometimes skip gears during downshifts depending on the vehicle speed {{as there is no}} need to shift through every gear when significant speed has been lost.|$|R

25|$|In a south-pointing chariot, {{according}} to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other road wheel.

The pointing doll was connected (possibly through <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears)</b> to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.|$|R
