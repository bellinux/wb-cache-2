25|$|Some {{observers}} {{predict that}} the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further {{to the point that}} it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, Ladino or Judeo-Arabic. The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

As a result, the Coast Guard can no longer operate military aircraft like it <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Nevertheless, current helicopters are outfitted with latest generation U.S. night vision equipment, reserved for U.S. armed forces and the armies of their allies and thus the only civilian registered aircraft in the world, so equipped.|$|E
25|$|Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley): An adventurous 10-year-old girl used to fine {{living in}} Montreal, {{including}} a nanny, {{must learn to}} adjust to Avonlea's simpler life. Her mother, Ruth King—sister to Hetty, Alec, Roger, and Olivia—died of tuberculosis when Sara was a toddler. When Sara's father runs into trouble, he arranges to have Sara and her nanny, Louisa, stay in Avonlea for a while. Sara stays without her nanny and lives with her single aunts, Hetty and Olivia, at Rose Cottage. In seasons three-five, Sara mostly concerns herself with matchmaking in Avonlea, which causes much controversy within the conservative hamlet. After season five, Sarah Polley left the show. In the middle of season six, Sara reappears, and both Louisa and Aunt Hetty start planning her future without consulting her. Sara, yearning to become a writer, though, has applied to a prestigious writing school in Paris. In the end, Louisa and Hetty accept Sara's plan. Sara later returns for Felicity's wedding in the series finale, but {{does not appear in}} the reunion film, An Avonlea Christmas. However, Felicity mentions something Felix and Sara <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> while trying to comfort a terrified Janet when Felix is listed as missing in action.|$|E
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine as they <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

500|$|... "Dreamlover" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, first released on July27,1993 by Columbia Records, as the lead single from Carey's third studio album Music Box (1993). It was written by Carey and Dave Hall, and was produced by the pair and Walter Afanasieff. The song incorporates {{a sample of the}} hook from [...] "Blind Alley" [...] by The Emotions into its melody and instrumentation. [...] "Dreamlover" [...] helped Carey's transition into the pop music market, a choice made following the mixed reception to her previous studio effort Emotions (1991), which featured gospel and 1960s soul influences. Lyrically, the song pictures a protagonist calling for a perfect lover, her [...] "dreamlover," [...] who will whisk her away into the night and not disillusion her like her exes <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though in}} the past Putin had rarely hesitated to blame the Chechen separatists for acts of terrorism, this time he avoided linking the attack with the Second Chechen War. Instead, he blamed the crisis on the [...] "direct {{intervention}} of international terrorism", ignoring the nationalist roots of the crisis. The Russian government sources initially claimed that nine of the militants in Beslan were Arabs and one was a black African (called [...] "a negro" [...] by Andreyev), though only two Arabs were identified later. Independent analysts {{such as that of}} the Moscow political commentator Andrei Piontkovsky said Putin at this moment tried to minimize the number and scale of Chechen terrorist attacks, rather than to exaggerate them as he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Putin appeared to connect the events to the US-led [...] "War on Terrorism", {{but at the same time}} accused the West of indulging terrorists.|$|E

2500|$|In early nineteenth-century Britain, {{catastrophism}} {{was adapted}} {{with the aim}} of reconciling geological science with religious traditions of the biblical Great Flood. In the early 1820s English geologists including William Buckland and Adam Sedgwick interpreted [...] "diluvial" [...] deposits as the outcome of Noah's flood, {{but by the end of}} the decade they revised their opinions in favour of local inundations. Charles Lyell challenged catastrophism with the publication in 1830 of the first volume of his book Principles of Geology which presented a variety of geological evidence from England, France, Italy and Spain to prove Hutton’s ideas of gradualism correct. He argued that most geological change had been very gradual in human history. [...] Lyell provided evidence for Uniformitarianism; a geological doctrine that processes occur at the same rates in the present as they <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and account for all of the Earth’s geological features. Lyell’s works were popular and widely read, the concept of Uniformitarianism had taken a strong hold in geological society.|$|E

The Queensboro Bridge runs across Roosevelt Island, but no longer has a passenger elevator connection to it, as it <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> [...] The abrupt termination of the island on its north end is due to an extension of the 125th Street Fault.|$|E

[...] In addition to the low line rates forced on US transcriptionists, US MTs are often paid as ICs (independent contractors); thus, the nationals save on employee insurance and benefits offered, etc. Unfortunately, for the state of healthcare-related administrative costs in the United States, in outsourcing, the nationals still charge the hospitals the same rate as they <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> for highly qualified US transcriptionists but subcontract the work to non-US MTs, keeping the difference as profit.|$|E
