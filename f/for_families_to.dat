5|$|IWGC war cemeteries {{featured}} {{grass and}} flowers within a walled area, intended to resemble an English garden; almost all were constructed around a War Stone and a Cross of Sacrifice, described {{in more detail}} below. The style varied slightly by architect and location, but typically the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments, sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion. The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs. The graves proved controversial: initially they were marked by wooden crosses but, after some argument, it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier's next of kin. Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name, regiment, date of death, a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the next of kin. Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s. British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials, the limited options <b>for</b> <b>families</b> <b>to</b> individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC in determining how the soldiers were buried.|$|E

Even during slavery, however, many African-American families managed to maintain strong familial bonds.

25|$|On 12 January 2010, Haiti {{suffered}} a devastating earthquake, magnitude 7.0 with a death toll {{estimated by the}} Haitian government at over 300,000, and by non-Haitian sources from 50,000 to 220,000. Aftershocks followed, including one of magnitude 5.9. The capital city, Port-au-Prince, was effectively leveled. A million Haitians were left homeless, {{and hundreds of thousands}} starved. The earthquake caused massive devastation, with most buildings crumbled, including Haiti's presidential palace. The enormous death toll made it necessary to bury the dead in mass graves. Most bodies were unidentified and few pictures were taken, making it impossible <b>for</b> <b>families</b> <b>to</b> identify their loved ones. The spread of disease was a major secondary disaster. Many survivors were treated for injuries in emergency makeshift hospitals, but many more died of gangrene, malnutrition, and infectious diseases.|$|E

25|$|These {{statistics}} {{shed some}} interesting facts about education in Pakistan; the gender disparity in education {{is much lower}} in urban places vis-à-vis rural areas. One of the possible explanations of this pattern is relatively stronger dominance of tribal, feudal and patriarchal traditions in rural areas. Moreover, {{there are very few}} employment opportunities for women in rural areas, and thus, there is very little financial incentive <b>for</b> <b>families</b> <b>to</b> send their girls to schools. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that, despite the meagre representation of females in the education sector, the level of achievement of female students is consistently far higher than that of their counterpart male students. Girls generally outclass boys in examination, and they are also higher achievers in universities. Unfortunately, the majority of the girls never get an opportunity to develop their educational capabilities.|$|E

500|$|The basic letter {{shapes of}} Gill Sans {{do not look}} {{consistent}} across styles (or even in the metal type era all the sizes of the same style), especially in Extra Bold and Extra Condensed widths, while the Ultra Bold style is effectively a different design altogether and was originally marketed as such. Digital-period Monotype designer Dan Rhatigan, author of an article on Gill Sans's development after Gill's death, has commented: [...] "Gill Sans grew organically... takes a very 'asystematic' approach to type. Very characteristic of when it was designed and of when it was used." [...] (At this time the idea that sans-serif typefaces should form a consistent family, with glyph shapes as consistent as possible between all weights and sizes, had not fully developed: it was quite normal <b>for</b> <b>families</b> <b>to</b> vary as seemed appropriate for their weight until developments such as the groundbreaking release of Univers in 1957.) ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Clarence Waldron from Jet, Cole said the idea of recording a Christmas album started after {{a telephone call from}} producer and longtime friend Michael Masser, with whom Cole had worked on the song [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] from her 1980 album Don't Look Back and her 1989 single [...] "Miss You Like Crazy". Cole described the telephone call from Masser as unexpected; Masser told her, [...] "I've got this beautiful Christmas song I wrote just for you". When they met, Messer played [...] "No More Blue Christmas"; after the session they both agreed to record a Christmas album. Cole described the decision to form a Christmas album as leaving her [...] "running around in April, looking for Christmas songs". Cole expressed hope that the album would remind her fans about [...] "the true spirit of the holiday season". She wanted it to communicate that Christmas is [...] "a time <b>for</b> <b>families</b> <b>to</b> reflect and not just wait until the holidays to be a family". Cole's twin sister Timolin Cole said, [...] "Christmas Eve has always been a magical time with Natalie" [...] when she could connect with family over holiday traditions.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert {{had also}} been engaged by a club called East Gloucestershire, based in Cheltenham, which played minor cricket. The {{explanation}} for Gilbert's disappearance was {{to be found in}} a match he played for the club on 4 and 5 June 1886. Before the second day's play, Gilbert arrived early at the ground and went into the pavilion. Because several sums of money had recently gone missing from the pavilion, a policeman was hidden in the team's dressing room and he saw Gilbert searching clothes and stealing money. On being confronted, Gilbert produced the coins, one of which had been marked so that it could be identified. The East Gloucestershire match continued, but Gilbert's name was omitted from the published scorecard; the wickets he had taken on the first day were credited to [...] "Smith", and either only ten players were listed or Gilbert's position in the batting order was taken by [...] "Mr E. L. Even", who did not bat. Gilbert had been selected for Gloucestershire's first-class match against Sussex on 7 June, but he was dropped from the side and his place taken by a player making his only appearance in the side. Gilbert was in Police Court while the match was taking place, charged with theft. He admitted stealing from two men and expressed remorse. According to the report in The Times, he stated that if he were forgiven, he would move to Australia; his solicitor argued that Gilbert had been [...] "harassed and worried" [...] for some time and was suffering from erysipelas and could barely control his own behaviour. His solicitor requested that any punishment should allow Gilbert to go overseas, but Gilbert was sentenced to 28days imprisonment. Gilbert's family then arranged for him to move to Canada; {{at the time it was}} common <b>for</b> <b>families</b> <b>to</b> send disgraced members to distant parts of the British Empire to minimise scandal.|$|E
