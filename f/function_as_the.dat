5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> primary source of power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles {{that are responsible for}} developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E

5|$|During {{the almost}} ten years it served as the capitol, Congress Hall {{witnessed}} many historic events including the admittance of three new states. The United States Bill of Rights was ratified at Congress Hall in 1791. The second Presidential inauguration of George Washington {{took place in the}} House chamber in 1793, as did inauguration of John Adams in 1797. Congress also used the time to establish the First Bank of the United States, the Federal Mint, and the United States Department of the Navy. The Jay Treaty, which secured a temporary peace with Great Britain, was also ratified at Congress Hall in 1796. After the capital moved to Washington, Congress Hall returned to its original <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia County Courthouse and served as the location of both state and federal courts during the early 19th century. Also designed by Samuel Lewis, the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey was built in 1796 and modeled after Congress Hall.|$|E

This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek, the Third US Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) in the theater of operations.

Its <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Poland made a {{recovery}} under Mieszko's son, Duke Casimir I (r. 1039–1058), known to {{history as the}} Restorer. After returning from exile in 1039, Casimir rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's territorial integrity through several military campaigns: in 1047, Masovia was taken back from Miecław, a Polish noble who tried to detach the region from {{the rule of the}} Polish monarch, and in 1054 Silesia was recovered from the Czechs. Casimir was aided by recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of feudalism and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of Greater Poland after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to Kraków and replaced the old Piast capitals of Poznań and Gniezno; Kraków would <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nation's capital for several centuries.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{continue}} to debate whether Chacoan organization {{was based on}} primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> region's ceremonial center. Because there has been little to no modern excavation in the canyon, the question remains largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase {{to the north of the}} hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E

The fortress itself was outfitted with additional defenses, including arrow slits and narrow openings, which were extended to employ the use of cannon. During Ridwan rule, the Qaysariyyah Market in Gaza's al-Daraj quarter was reconstructed as was the Hamam al-Sammara bathhouse and the former Khan az-Zayt caravansary. Bahram Pasha ordered the construction of the main sabil ("fountain") in Gaza in the mid-16th-century.|$|E
5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E
5|$|By the war's end in 1945, Bruce {{had become}} {{tired of the}} High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's {{successor}} Ben Chifley {{that he would not}} object to being replaced in the position. In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China that could evolve into a new international body with a similar <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work {{came to the attention of}} Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.|$|E
