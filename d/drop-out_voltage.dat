50|$|An LDO is {{characterized}} by its <b>drop-out</b> <b>voltage,</b> quiescent current, load regulation, line regulation, maximum current (which is decided {{by the size of}} the pass transistor), speed (how fast it can respond as the load varies), voltage variations in the output because of sudden transients in the load current, output capacitor and its equivalent series resistance. Speed is indicated by the rise time of the current at the output as it varies from 0 mA load current (no load) to the maximum load current. This is basically decided by the bandwidth of the error amplifier. It is also expected from an LDO to provide a quiet and stable output in all circumstances (example of possible perturbation could be: sudden change of the input voltage or output current). Stability analysis put in place some performance metrics to get such a behaviour and involve placing poles and zeros appropriately. Most of the time, there is a dominant pole that arise at low frequencies while other poles and zeros are pushed at high frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{demand for}} low-voltage, low {{drop-out}} (LDO) regulators is increasing {{because of the}} growing demand for portable electronics, i. e., cellular phones, pagers, laptops, etc. LDO’s are used coherently with dc-dc converters as well as standalone parts. In power supply systems, they are typically cascaded onto switching regulators to suppress noise and provide a low noise output. The need for low voltage is innate to portable low power devices and corroborated by lower breakdown voltages resulting from reductions in feature size. Low quiescent current in a battery-operated system is an intrinsic performance parameter because it partially determines battery life. This paper discusses some techniques that enable the practical realizations of low quiescent current LDO’s at low voltages and in existing technologies. The proposed circuit exploits the frequency response dependence on load-current to minimize quiescent current flow. Moreover, the output current capabilities of MOS power transistors are enhanced and <b>drop-out</b> <b>voltages</b> are decreased for a given device size. Other applications, like dc-dc converters, can also {{reap the benefits of}} these enhanced MOS devices. An LDO prototype incorporating the aforementioned techniques was fabricated.

40|$|A Low <b>Drop-Out</b> (LDO) <b>voltage</b> {{regulator}} {{with both}} capacitor-less and high power supply rejection (PSR) bandwidth attributes is highly admired for an integrated {{power management system}} of mobile electronics. The capacitor-less feature is demanded for realizing more compact device. The high PSR bandwidth is essential for being used with high frequency switching regulators. These two attributes are of strong trade-off because usually a capacitor-less LDO requires Miller Compensation which greatly limits the PSR bandwidth. This thesis presents a LDO design with both capacitor-less and high PSR bandwidth attributes. The proposed LDO structure incorporates external compensation which is gifted for extended PSR bandwidth. A capacitance multiplier (CM) of high multiplication factor (? 100) is designed to externally compensate the LDO without an external off-chip capacitor. In the proposed LDO circuit, NMOS is used as the pass transistor for system stabilization. Triple-well NMOS and Zero-Vt NMOS are used as pass transistors in the two main LDO designs. The design with the triple-well NMOS pass transistor aims at higher PSR bandwidth with lower power consumption. The design with Zero-Vt NMOS pass transistor eliminates {{the necessity of a}} charge pump for driving the gate of a NMOS pass transistor. Implemented in IBM 0. 18 ?m technology, the LDO with triple-well NMOS achieves - 40 dB PSR to 19 MHz with 265 ?A current consumption.

This dissertation focuses on new system architectures and design techniques to reduce area and minimize quiescent power while achieving high performance. Experimental results from prototype circuits to verify theory are shown. Firstly, basics on low <b>drop-out</b> (LDO) <b>voltage</b> regulators are provided. Demand for system-on-chip solutions has increased the interest in LDO voltage regulators {{that do not require}} a bulky off-chip capacitor to achieve stability, also called capacitor- less LDO (CL-LDO) regulators. Several architectures have been proposed; however, comparing these reported architectures proves difficult, as each has a distinct process technology and specifications. This dissertation compares CL-LDOs in a unified manner. Five CL-LDO regulator topologies were designed, fabricated, and tested under common design conditions. Secondly, fundamentals on DC-DC buck converters are presented and area reduction techniques for the external output filter, power stage, and compensator are proposed. A fully integrated buck converter using standard CMOS technology is presented. The external output filter has been fully-integrated by increasing the switching frequency up to 45 MHz. Moreover, a monolithic single-input dual-output buck converter is proposed. This architecture implements only three switches instead of the four switches used in conventional solutions, thus potentially reducing area in the power stage through proper design of the power switches. Lastly, a monolithic PWM voltage mode buck converter with compact Type-III compensation is proposed. This compensation scheme employs a combination of Gm-RC and Active-RC techniques to reduce the area of the compensator, while maintaining low quiescent power consumption and fast transient response. The proposed compensator reduces area by more than 45 % when compared to an equivalent conventional Type-III compensator. Finally, basics on class-D audio amplifiers are presented and a clock-free current controlled class-D audio amplifier using integral sliding mode control is proposed. The proposed amplifier achieves up to 82 dB of power supply rejection ratio and a total harmonic distortion plus noise as low as 0. 02 %.

Novel system architectures and new circuit design techniques are introduced to achieve the required goals in terms of small silicon area and power consumption {{while at the same}} time achieve high performance. Four key building blocks in power management and a switchable harmonic mixer with pre-amplifier and poly-phase generator as a core part of a millimeter wave receiver are proposed, implemented and experimentally measured. First, two externally compensated low <b>drop-out</b> <b>voltage</b> regulators (LDOs) with high power supply rejection (PSR) at high frequencies are presented. Complete PSR analysis is included together with detailed measurement results. The LDOs achieve a PSR of - 56 dB at 10 MHz with a dropout voltage of only 0. 15 V. They are implemented on different CMOS processes, 0. 13 micrometers and 90 nm, where they occupy small active areas of 0. 049 mm^ 2 and 0. 015 mm^ 2, respectively. Second, an output-capacitorless LDO is presented. The LDO employs a novel topology that is adaptive to load current variations to ensure stability at light load condition and to provide fast transient response and high PSR. It is implemented in 90 nm CMOS technology, and it uses a small on-chip capacitance of only 0. 95 pF. Measurements show that LDO achieves a fast settling time of 0. 25 microseconds and high PSR of - 50 dB at 1 MHz while occupying an active area of 0. 016 mm^ 2. With dropout voltage of 0. 15 V, the LDO achieves a load regulation of 58. 3 microV/mA for a load current step of 120 mA. Third, a buck converter working at high switching frequency (10 / 20 MHz) and using small on-chip and off-chip passive components is presented.

40|$|Software-defined radio {{receivers}} (SDRs) have become popular to accommodate multi-standard wireless services using a single chip-set solution in mobile telecommunication systems. In SDRs, the signal is down-converted to an intermediate frequency and then digitalized. This approach relaxes the specifications {{for most of}} the analog front-end building blocks by performing most of the signal processing in the digital domain. However, since the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is located {{as close as possible to}} the antenna in SDR architectures, the ADC specification requirements are very stringent because a large amount of interference signals are present at the ADC input due to the removal of filtering blocks, which particularly affects the dynamic range (DR) specification. Sigma-delta (??) ADCs have several benefits such as low implementation cost, especially when the architecture contains mostly digital circuits. Furthermore, continuous-time (CT) ?? ADCs allow elimination of the anti?aliasing filter because input signals are sampled after the integrator. The bandwidth requirements for the amplifiers in CT ?? ADCs can be relaxed due to the continuous operation without stringing settling time requirements. Therefore, they are suitable for high?speed and low?power applications. In addition, CT ?? ADCs achieve high resolution due to the ?? modulator?s noise shaping property. However, the in-band quantization noise is shaped by the analog loop filter and the distortions of the analog loop filter directly affect the system output. Hence, highly linear low-noise loop filters are required for high-performance ?? modulators. The first task in this research focused on using CMOS 90 nm technology to design and fabricate a 5 ^(TH) ?order active-RC loop filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 MHz for a low pass (LP) CT ?? modulator. The active-RC topology was selected because of the high DR requirement in SDR applications. The amplifiers in the first stage of the loop filter were implemented with linearization techniques employing anti-parallel cancellation and source degeneration in the second stage of the amplifiers. These techniques improve the third-order intermodulation (IM 3) by approximately 10 dB; while noise, area, and power consumption do not increase by more than 10 %. Second, a current-mode adder-flash ADC was also fabricated as part of a LP CT ?? modulator. The new current-mode operation developed through this research makes possible a 53 % power reduction. The new technology also lessens existing problems associated with voltage-mode flash ADCs, which are mainly related to voltage headroom restrictions, speed of operation, offsets, and power efficiency of the latches. The core of the current-mode adder-flash ADC was fabricated in CMOS 90 nm technology with 1. 2 V supply; it dissipates 3. 34 mW while operating at 1. 48 GHz and consumes a die area of 0. 0276 mm^(2). System-on chip (SoC) solutions are becoming more popular in mobile telecommunication systems to improve the portability and competitiveness of products. Since the analog/RF and digital blocks often share the same external power supply in SoC solutions, the on-chip generation of clean power supplies is necessary to avoid system performance degradation due to supply noises. Finally, the critical design issues for external capacitor-less low drop-out (LDO) regulators for SoC applications are addressed in this dissertation, especially the challenges related to power supply rejection at high frequencies as well as loop stability and transient response. The paths of the power supply noise to the LDO output were analyzed, and a power supply noise cancellation circuit was developed. The power supply rejection (PSR) performance was improved by using a replica circuit that tracks the main supply noise under process-voltage-temperature variations and all operating conditions. Fabricated in a 0. 18 ?m CMOS technology with 1. 8 V supply, the entire proposed LDO consumes 55 ?A of quiescent current while in standby operation, and it has a <b>drop-out</b> <b>voltage</b> of 200 mV when providing 50 mA to the load.
