5|$|Some <b>eukaryotic</b> cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but <b>eukaryotic</b> flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the {{flagellum}} whips in a circle. The <b>eukaryotic</b> flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms that {{includes}} microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other <b>eukaryotic</b> life kingdoms of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} of metagenomic data {{analysis}} requires the execution of certain pre-filtering steps, including the removal of redundant, low-quality sequences and sequences of probable <b>eukaryotic</b> origin (especially in metagenomes of human origin). The methods available {{for the removal of}} contaminating <b>eukaryotic</b> genomic DNA sequences include Eu-Detect and DeConseq.|$|E
5|$|Within <b>eukaryotic</b> cells DNA is {{organized}} into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated {{in the process}} of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. <b>Eukaryotic</b> organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the <b>eukaryotic</b> chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} by {{researchers}} of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the Oregon State University indicates that the SAR11 clade of bacteria shares a relatively recent common ancestor with the mitochondria existing in most <b>eukaryotic</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, so if {{a species of}} archaea exists {{in more than one}} form, all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and <b>eukaryotic</b> systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent <b>eukaryotic</b> enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Arp2/3 {{complex is}} a seven-subunit protein complex that {{plays a major}} role in the {{regulation}} of the actin cytoskeleton. It is a major component of the actin cytoskeleton and is found in most actin cytoskeleton-containing <b>eukaryotic</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|As {{the major}} {{defining}} characteristic of the <b>eukaryotic</b> cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin {{has been the subject}} of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale gene {{transfer}} has also occurred between {{the ancestors of}} <b>eukaryotic</b> cells and bacteria, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal {{gene transfer}}s between bacteria and archaea.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>eukaryotic</b> cell types {{usually have}} a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the {{maturation}} of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.|$|E
5|$|Of <b>eukaryotic</b> groups, the protists {{are most}} {{commonly}} unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that {{are not easy to}} classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many <b>eukaryotic</b> microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{transcript}} RNAs {{are often}} modified by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap {{are added to}} <b>eukaryotic</b> pre-mRNA and introns are removed by the spliceosome.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The <b>eukaryotic</b> cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by <b>eukaryotic</b> cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. <b>Eukaryotic</b> ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical <b>eukaryotic</b> cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|The core of {{the complex}} has a ring {{structure}} consisting of six proteins that all {{belong to the same}} class of RNases, the RNase PH-like proteins. In archaea there are two different PH-like proteins (called Rrp41 and Rrp42), each present three times in an alternating order. <b>Eukaryotic</b> exosome complexes have six different proteins that form the ring structure. Of these six <b>eukaryotic</b> proteins, three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein and the other three proteins are more similar to the archaeal Rrp42 protein.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus is an {{organelle}} {{found in}} <b>eukaryotic</b> cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for <b>eukaryotic</b> cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the <b>eukaryotic</b> cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles <b>eukaryotic</b> than {{bacterial}} transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the <b>eukaryotic</b> RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are <b>eukaryotic</b> and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of <b>eukaryotic</b> cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and <b>eukaryotic</b> cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of <b>eukaryotic</b> cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the <b>eukaryotic</b> cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many <b>eukaryotic</b> processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to <b>eukaryotic</b> RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} {{may help}} to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and may provide evidence {{of the presence of}} <b>eukaryotic</b> cells, the type from which all multicellular organisms are built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios {{may help to}} explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by <b>eukaryotic</b> cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
5|$|In <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms, pre-mRNA is {{transcribed}} in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other <b>eukaryotic</b> initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and <b>eukaryotic</b> {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two {{cellular}} locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of <b>eukaryotic</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex <b>eukaryotic</b> cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>eukaryotic</b> non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in {{intermediary}} forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms have {{electron}} transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, plants have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in the}} mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with <b>eukaryotic</b> DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Plant Hybridization is more commonplace {{compared}} to animal hybridization. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most <b>eukaryotic</b> organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses {{replicate}} their genomes by reverse transcribing DNA copies {{from their}} RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. Retrotransposons also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another, and telomerase contains an RNA {{that is used}} as template for building the ends of <b>eukaryotic</b> chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α subunits. In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β subunits have high sequence identity to archaeal and <b>eukaryotic</b> β subunits, whereas the α sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|E
5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which {{with a long history}} of use to investigate issues in <b>eukaryotic</b> cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for <b>eukaryotic</b> protein production.|$|E
