By 15 June, the troops <b>had</b> <b>advanced</b> {{to the edge of}} Texass gun range; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range, the starboard torpedo blister was flooded with water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the fire mission. With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June, Texas left Normandy for England on 18 June.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1918, the German Army {{had been}} fought to a {{standstill}} after its Spring Offensive and the Allies had sought to take the initiative. Accordingly, the Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, with an attack on Amiens which {{marked the beginning of}} a series of advances by the Allies that ultimately ended the war.

Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Center, had crossed the Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank. The two panzer armies now trapped four Soviet armies and parts of two others.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the Red Army <b>had</b> <b>advanced</b> to the Potsdamerplatz, and all {{indications}} were {{that they were}} preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life. After midnight on 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker. Afterwards Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his {{last will and testament}}. He signed these documents at 04:00 and then retired to bed (some sources say Hitler dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all sources agree on the timing of the signing).|$|E
5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{was built}} in either the 1220s or the 1230s by Llywelyn the Great, {{at the base of}} the Llanberis Pass, {{overlooking}} the lake of Llyn Padarn in North Wales. Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles, instead using undefended palaces called , or courts. From the late 11th century onwards, the Normans <b>had</b> <b>advanced</b> into Wales, taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century some timber and earthwork castles began to be built, but in small numbers.|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Eileen {{gave birth}} to a son, T'ing Chung; she withdrew from the {{landscape}} architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the Bauhaus, a European architectural movement that <b>had</b> <b>advanced</b> the cause of modernist design. The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of these, Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.|$|E
