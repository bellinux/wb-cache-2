5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{classification}} is {{a critical}} component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, <b>Genus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species.</b> For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
30|$|The {{families}} which {{collected from}} the carcasses are as follows: Agromyzidae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Calliphoridae (three subfamilies, three genera <b>and</b> sex <b>species),</b> Dolichopodidae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Drosophilidae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Ephydridae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Fanniidae (one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Muscidae (two subfamilies, three <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> four <b>species),</b> Phoridae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Piophilidae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Psychodidae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> Sarcophagidae (two subfamilies, two genera <b>and</b> three <b>species),</b> Sphaeroceridae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species),</b> <b>and</b> finally Ulidiidae (one subfamily, one <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> only one <b>species).</b> Only seven of which (Calliphoridae, Fanniidae, Muscidae, Phoridae, Piophilidae, Sarcophagidae and Ulidiidae) are of forensic importance or necrophagous. Other families are the following: Drosophilidae, Psychodidae, Agromyzidae, Dolichopodidae, Ephydridae, and Sphaeroceridae are of minor importance as forensic indicators.|$|R

5|$|Chinese paleontologists {{discovered}} a partial skull and {{skeleton of a}} small theropod (IVPP V4878) in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China in the mid-1960s. In 1977, Dong Zhiming described this specimen, which was recovered from the Subashi Formation in Shanshan County, as a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species,</b> Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis. Gregory Paul recognized Shanshanosaurus as a tyrannosaurid in 1988, referring it to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Dong and Currie later re-examined the specimen and deemed {{it to be a}} juvenile of a larger species of tyrannosaurid. These authors refrained from assigning it to any particular genus but suggested Tarbosaurus as a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurin {{specimens}} {{from the}} Prince Creek Formation of Alaska formerly assigned to Edmontosaurus sp. {{have been given}} their own <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> name, Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis. However, the identification of Ugrunaaluk as a separate genus was questioned by a 2017 study from Hai Xing and colleagues, who regarded it as a nomen dubium indistinguishable from other Edmontosaurus. Edmontosaurus was also reported from the Javelina Formation of Big Bend National Park, western Texas based on TMM 41442-1, but was later referred to Kritosaurus cf. navajovius by Wagner (2001), before being assigned to Kritosaurus sp. by Lehman et al. (2016).|$|E
5|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri Filhol was {{the first}} to scientifically describe a species of Pachylemur; he named Lemur insignis and Lemur intermedius in 1895 {{on the basis of a}} few subfossil bones. Descriptions of other species now placed in Pachylemur quickly followed. In 1899, Guillaume Grandidier named a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species,</b> Palaeochirogalus jullyi, on the basis of two teeth from Antsirabe, central Madagascar, which he thought similar to dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus). In 1903, Grafton Elliot Smith placed this species in the genus Lemur (as Lemur jullyi), and in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a synonym of Lemur insignis.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Thomas Bolliger {{described}} some {{teeth of}} Seorsumuscardinus from the Swiss locality of Tägernaustrasse (MN 4; early Miocene, see MN zonation) as an indeterminate dormouse (family Gliridae) perhaps related to Eomuscardinus. Six years later, Hans de Bruijn named the new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> Seorsumuscardinus alpinus {{on the basis}} of material from Oberdorf in Austria (also MN 4) and included fossils from Tägernaustrasse and from Karydia in Greece (MN 4) in Seorsumuscardinus. In 2007, Jerome Prieto and Madeleine Böhme named Heissigia bolligeri as a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> from Affalterbach in Bavaria (MN 5, younger than MN 4), and referred the Tägernaustrasse material to it, but failed to compare their new genus to Seorsumuscardinus. Two years later, Prieto published a note to compare the two and concluded that they were referable to the same genus, but different species. Thus, the genus Seorsumuscardinus now includes the species Seorsumuscardinus alpinus from MN 4 and S.bolligeri from MN 5. Prieto provisionally placed the Tägernaustrasse material with S.alpinus. He also mentioned Pentaglis földváry, a name given to a single upper molar from the middle Miocene of Hungary, which is now lost. Although the specimen shows some similarities with Seorsumuscardinus, published illustrations are too poor to confirm the identity of Pentaglis, and Prieto considered the latter name to be an unidentifiable nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a fragmentary fossil {{of another}} species of this {{same group of}} oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina. It was {{initially}} identified as a possible second species of Noronhomys {{on the basis of}} the presence of a crest on the upper first molar, the mesoloph, but the specimen is different from Noronhomys vespuccii in other respects, and in 2008 it was described as a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species,</b> Carletonomys cailoi, related to Noronhomys and associated genera.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are thought}} to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is paraphyletic. Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. Isthminia panamensis is an extinct <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Piña, Panama.|$|E

5|$|The Solnhofen Specimen (unnumbered specimen) was {{discovered}} in the 1970s near Eichstätt, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum in Solnhofen, it originally was classified as Compsognathus by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich Müller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species,</b> Wellnhoferia grandis. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, <b>genus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>species.</b> Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Colugos are a {{small group}} of Southeast Asian gliding mammals closely related to the primates. Their fossil record is {{exceptionally}} poor. Although Paleogene groups such as the Plagiomenidae are considered by some to be closely related to colugos, no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo family, Cynocephalidae, had been reported until 1992. In that year, Stéphane Ducrocq and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the Eocene of Thailand as a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> of colugo, Dermotherium major. In 2000, however, Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that Dermotherium might not be a colugo, since the fossil is so poorly preserved that few traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported dermopteran features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other placental groups. Mary Silcox and colleagues reaffirmed the colugo affinities of Dermotherium in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in molar morphology.|$|E

5|$|Lambeosaurus has a {{complicated}} taxonomic history, beginning in 1902 with Lawrence Lambe's naming of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as Trachodon marginatus. Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids {{from the same}} rocks in the 1910s, {{in what is now}} known as the late Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Dinosaur Park Formation. Lambe assigned two new skulls to T. marginatus, and based on the new information, coined the genus Stephanosaurus for the species in 1914. Unfortunately, there was very little to associate the skulls with the scrappy earlier marginatus material, so in 1923 William Parks proposed a new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe: Lambeosaurus lambei (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869).|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{systems of}} plant {{identification}} were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species)</b> {{by making a}} series of choices between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or {{more closely related to}} the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, British {{paleontologist}} Guy Pilgrim described {{two species}} from the Miocene {{of what is}} now India and Pakistan, Sivanasua palaeindica from Chinji (Pakistan) and Sivanasua himalayensis from Haritalyangar (India). He attributed both to Sivanasua, a carnivoran genus otherwise known from Europe. The next year, American scientist G. Edward Lewis described the new <b>genus</b> <b>and</b> <b>species</b> Indraloris lulli from Haritalyangar, which he provisionally allocated to the family Lorisidae. The generic name, Indraloris, combines the name of the god Indra with the generic name Loris, and the specific name, lulli, honors Richard Swann Lull, at the time director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. It was not until 1968 that American anthropologist Ian Tattersall noted that Pilgrim's Sivanasua species had been misidentified; he suggested that Sivanasua himalayensis was probably the same as Indraloris lulli, but left the affinities of Sivanasua palaeindica open. Tattersall, who also described additional material of Indraloris, continued to regard the animal as a lorisid.|$|E
