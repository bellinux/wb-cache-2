5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE {{was also}} {{given the right}} to fly its first {{international}} scheduled flights {{for the first time}} in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession to fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Tromsø to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993.|$|E

5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, British Airways held a {{promotion}}al contest {{to mark the}} 10thanniversary of the airline's move into the private sector.

5|$|In the Diptera (true flies), {{there is}} only one pair of {{functional}} wings, with the posterior pair of wings are reduced to halteres, which help the <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> sense its orientation and movement, as well as to improve balance by acting similar to gyroscopes. In Calyptratae, the very hindmost portion of the wings are modified into somewhat thickened flaps called calypters which cover the halteres.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together.

30|$|The {{potential}} for these <b>flies</b> <b>to</b> serve as environmental indicators {{is demonstrated by}} the cosmopolitan character of the group, {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>flies</b> <b>to</b> environmental variables and the simplicity of collecting them (Parsons 1991; Foote and Carson 2004).|$|R
50|$|By May 2008, Volare <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> 20 {{destinations}} in Europe. Volare's {{charter and}} leisure subsidiary Air Europe <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> other long-haul destinations. With {{the fusion of}} Alitalia-CAI and Air One later on that year, however, Air Europe was discontinued.|$|R
5|$|Jet Airways was {{expected}} to begin service to Newark via Brussels in June 2005. In March 2005, the airline submitted an application to the United States Department of Transportation; however, the application was opposed by Nancy Heckerman, CEO of a US registered company Jet Airways Inc., based in Bethesda, Maryland, alleging trademark infringement and connections to terrorist outfit Al Qaeda. Jet Airways rebuffed the claims. Asmin Tariq, a contractor working for the airline as a security agent at Heathrow airport was implicated in the foiled terror plot on 10 August 2006 to blow up several transatlantic airliners belonging to three different US airlines. Subsequently, the Governments of UK and Singapore inquired security-related information from the Ministry of External Affairs on Jet Airways; clearance was further delayed to <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the US. The US State Department gave the go-ahead for the airline to <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the US on 15 November 2006.|$|E

These attributes could still be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|National Airlines' New York-Miami route {{was usually}} flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601.
