50|$|In 2007, a CIA source {{reported}} seeing Bin Laden in Tora Bora, {{a significant proportion}} of the ISR assets available in the theatre converged on the area, the initial plan based around a small <b>helicopter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>force</b> soon expanded to include Green Beret ODAs and a Ranger element to provide a cordon for the SEALs. Eventually the operation was launched under the cover of Air Force bombing, but after fruitless searching through the mountains, {{there was no sign of}} him.|$|E
50|$|The Experimental Military Unit (EMU) was a joint Australian-American company-sized <b>helicopter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>force</b> which {{operated}} {{during the}} Vietnam War. The unit {{was created in}} 1967 following a request from the United States military for Australia to send more helicopter pilots to the conflict. As the only available personnel were from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Fleet Air Arm (with Australian Army and RAAF pilots already heavily committed), the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam (RANHFV) was formed and integrated into the 135th Assault Helicopter Company of the United States Army. The EMU unit name was selected by the Americans as a backronym for the Australian bird, a choice which amused the Australians: despite being large, fast, and highly mobile, the emu cannot fly.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, CIA and JSOC {{planners}} presented four {{plans for}} Operation Celestial Balance: a Tomahawk cruise missile strike, an airstrike, {{an attack by}} Little Bird helicopter gunships or attempt to capture the target by a <b>helicopter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>force</b> of SEALs. The President chose the second option, but as the USMC AV-8B Harrier approached its release point it reported a malfunction in its targeting system, so 8 helicopters flown {{by members of the}} 160th SOAR launched from a US Navy ship carrying a team of DEVGRU operators and took down the target. In Yemen, Admiral McRaven at JSOC argued for an [...] "Iraq-style Task Force" [...] to be deployed to hunt al-Qaeda cells in the country, but his requests was denied by both the Pentagon and the Yemenis, instead airstrikes were the preferred option. However JSOC and the CIA were permitted to establish a small command centre in the capital.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{transport}} load restrictions of <b>helicopters,</b> air <b>assault</b> <b>forces</b> are usually light infantry, though some armored fighting vehicles, like the Russian BMD-1 {{are designed to}} fit most heavy lift <b>helicopters,</b> which enable <b>assaulting</b> <b>forces</b> to combine air mobility with {{a certain degree of}} ground mechanization. Invariably the assaulting troops are highly dependent on aerial fire support provided by the armed helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft escorting the VTOL.|$|R
50|$|Oldendorf took part, from 13 April through 24 April in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise 98-1 (PAC JTFEX 98-1) off the Southern California coast. The {{aim of the}} {{exercise}} was to prepare naval forces to participate in joint operations with other U.S. forces. Naval operations included Maritime Interception Operations (MIO), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), various air strike and support missions, operational testing of various weapons systems, Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), logistics support, search and rescue, and command and control. An amphibious landing at Camp Pendleton, California, on 21 April, involved Navy surface and <b>helicopter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>forces,</b> U.S. Air Force aircraft, as well as units from Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|From 10 February through 21 February 1997, Merrill {{took part}} in Pacific Joint Task Force Exercise (PACJTFEX) 97-1, off the Southern California coast. The U.S. 3rd Fleet {{exercise}} involved 20 ships, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the [...] carrier battle group and [...] Amphibious Ready Group with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked. Army, Air Force, National Guard and Coast Guard units also participated. The exercise included various air strike and support missions, maritime interdiction operations, humanitarian operations, operational testing of weapons systems, logistics support, search and rescue, and command and control. Amphibious operations supporting the exercise culminated with an amphibious landing at Camp Pendleton, California, involving surface and <b>helicopter</b> <b>assault</b> <b>forces.</b> PAC JTFEX 97-1 {{was part of a}} series of exercises previously named [...] "FLEETEX". The change in name reflected the increasing focus on preparing naval forces for joint operations with other U.S. military services. During the previous several years this exercise placed increasing emphasis on incorporating joint procedures, planning, and command and control structures into task group training.|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. {{military}} {{received much}} criticism for its {{handling of the}} incident. In addition {{to the failure of}} intelligence to determine the whereabouts of the crew of the Mayaguez and the presence of a sizable hostile force on Koh Tang, the timing of the operation was questioned until it became clear that combat had been underway four hours before the crew was released. Within the services, the Marines in particular were critical of the ad hoc nature of the joint operation and the perceived pressure from the Administration for hasty action, although the success of Operation Frequent Wind had been the basis for many decisions made during the crisis. Vice Admiral George P. Steele, the Seventh Fleet commander, later stated that: [...] "The sad part of the Mayaguez is that we had sufficient force coming up with the Seventh Fleet, after it had been turned around from the evacuation of Vietnam stand down, to seize Southern Cambodia. I begged for another day or two, rather than commit forces piecemeal as we did .... The idea that we could use U.S. Air Force air police and Air <b>Force</b> <b>helicopters</b> as an <b>assault</b> <b>force</b> appears to me as ridiculous today as it did then." ...|$|R
