[...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no, Jack, bluster won't do with me. I was {{an officer}} in Chicago before ever <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook when I see one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it’s a most unaccountable thing," [...] {{said the}} dumbfounded Malcolm, turning round to the others. [...] "It’s {{the last time}} <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> house." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{issue as}} a man who is a Christian, ordained for 25 years, a gay man, in a {{committed}} relationship myself. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> meeting with the support of my partner Thomas, my family, my parish, my bishop, my diocese. And I have brought with me the very first Bible I received when I was just 4 years old. In it, in my handwriting, are the words, [...] "Today I gave Jesus my life." [...] It's dated March 29, 1962. I was eight years old.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{know what}} it means! It is not for {{pleasure}} that <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> villainous country! <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know what the game is! I will be told! Mademoiselle here--she tells me that her uncle has been lost, {{and now that he}} is ill. She will not let me see him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] she said, [...] "I really {{do not want to}} see him,--at least, not just yet. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> door because I wanted a little talk with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Becky almost {{laughed at}} her simplicity. [...] "Not to-day, love--some other time, when my trunks arrive from Leipzig, whence <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place--and a little drawing of him, which I made in happy days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{the first}} time I saw her, {{and that was very}} soon after <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> neighborhood. I knew as soon as she spoke to me that I would never marry any one else." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{one stage}} Mellish opened {{a speech by}} saying [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> platform, many of you will know that I have never been an anti-racialist". In 1976 Mellish argued that the Malawi Asians {{expelled}} by Hastings Banda {{should not be allowed}} to live in Britain despite possessing British passports: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, Anderson guest-starred {{as himself}} on {{an episode of}} WKRP in Cincinnati. The episode (titled [...] "Sparky"), {{features}} Anderson as a talk-show host on the fictional station. Eventually Anderson is let go, prompting him to say, [...] "I must be crazy. Every time <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> city, <b>I</b> get fired!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>came</b> up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{grinning}} shopman {{and kicked}} his stool aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, mates, when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> house I said to myself, `The Lord 'as {{given me}} success to-day in sellin' His word,'--you know, some of you, that I'm a seller of Bibles and Testaments?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, my dear," [...] {{said the}} Vicomtesse. [...] "Yes, he pardoned him. Mr. Temple {{was to have}} come to the city to-night with an officer. Mr. Ritchie and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> house together, and we found--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monseigneur," [...] he whimpered, [...] "I was {{choosing}} my {{way by the}} sun and the mountains, and it {{was thus}} that <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> impasse. For you may see, yourself, that the road ends here abruptly." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE GENERAL. I'm {{a miserable}} man. I'm really {{sorry to be}} a ridiculous old bore, Alice; but when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> house for a wedding--to these scenes--to--to {{recollections}} of the past-- always to give the bride to somebody else, and never to have my bride given to me--[he rises abruptly] May I go into the garden and smoke it off? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more, sir, thankee. I'm loaded fairly {{down to the}} water-line. Another grain would bust up the hatches; but if I might ventur' to putt forth a wish now, a glass o'--no? well, no matter, a drop o' water'll do. I'm well used to it now, havin' drunk {{enough to}} float a seventy-four since <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> city o' pirates." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet---- How did <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> have <b>this</b> odd {{corner in}} my brain? What is this lucid stillness?...|$|R
6000|$|... “Or,” pursued Poker, {{in a kind}} of despondent rapture, “or if I was to {{deny that}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> town to see and hear you, sir, what would it avail me? Or if I was to deny—” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have seen}} a few damaged shins and broken heads since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> location," [...] said Jonas, [...] "but such {{accidents}} occur chiefly among the Canadian French, who seem on the whole to be a clumsy set." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes! I know!" [...] The {{eyes of the}} man {{fell for}} an instant. [...] "I am not a German," [...] he said {{somewhat}} lamely. [...] "That is, I was born on the other side, but <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> country before I was twenty-one, and now I am an American." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A proper spirit?' {{said the}} Father. 'Yes, a proper spirit; a {{becoming}} spirit. <b>Is</b> it <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{that my son}} teaches me--ME--spirit!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adieu, Monsieur," [...] he whispered; [...] "milles tonneres, I {{have done}} one {{extraordinaire}} foolish thing when <b>I</b> am <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> house to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>I</b> <b>come</b> here for?" [...] {{repeated}} the man grimly, {{looking around the}} room; [...] "what did <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> yer comfortable home--this yer big ranch and to a rich woman like yourself for? Well, Mrs. Wade, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> get the six hundred dollars your husband robbed me of, that's all! I ain't askin' more! I ain't askin' interest! I ain't askin' compensation for havin' to run for my life--and," [...] again looking grimly round the walls, [...] "I ain't askin' more than you will give--or is my rights." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{falls to}} {{few of us}} to {{interview}} our better selves. My Utopian self is, of course, my better self--according to my best endeavours--and I must confess myself fully alive to the difficulties of the situation. When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> Utopia I had no thought of any such intimate self-examination.|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel it so, at least," [...] {{answered}} Redclyffe, [...] "and I {{assure you}} life {{has a new}} value for me since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place; for I have a deeper hold upon it, as it were,--more hope from it, more trust in something good to come of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, Lady," [...] said Sir Launcelot, [...] "you are gracious to me beyond measure! But I pray {{you tell}} me how <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place and by what means? For when I fell asleep {{yesterday}} at noon I lay beneath an apple-tree upon a hillside; and when I awoke--lo! I found myself in this fair chamber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Once {{every year}} <b>I</b> will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place, and call to thee,' said the Soul. 'It {{may be that}} thou wilt have need of me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{next time}} <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place, I'm {{going to get}} police {{protection}} or put my wagon on stilts. I got rid of everything, all right, but I didn't really sell a turnip. You see, those society women stormed my wagon, crawled over the wheels and crowded me off to respectable distance, say [...] When I got back the wagon was swept as clean as a good housewife's parlor, and there in a bushel basket was a quart of silver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Methinks I bring {{trouble and}} dole to every one," [...] said Myles, {{somewhat}} bitterly. [...] "It {{would have been}} better had <b>I</b> never <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place, methinks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I admired your father. He {{seemed to}} me to be {{everything}} that a lawyer should be. And years ago, when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> city a raw country boy from upstate, he represented and embodied for me all the fine traditions of the profession. But the practice of law isn't what it was in his day, Hugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is {{undoubtedly}} good," [...] said Tom. [...] "I {{never knew what}} it was to have a poor appetite until <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> wonderful land of yours, and I assure you that I will not pay it another visit in a hurry--although, upon the whole, I'm very well pleased to have hunted in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{guilty of}} no offense," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I have but sought to defend myself. I {{do not know}} why the woman has told you what she has. She can have no enmity against me, for never until <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> room in {{response}} to her cries for help had I seen her." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{meeting in}} an invidious position. I {{work for a}} Life and Pensions Brokerage and {{part of my job}} is to install pension {{arrangements}} for individuals, especially farmers. My task this evening however, is to discuss the situation of the self-employed and this I will endeavour to do impartially. I do this in the safe knowledge that there are individuals present, both in the general audience and on the platform, far more capable than I, in making the case of insurance interests...|$|R
6000|$|... 'THIS your Lock?' said Bradley, whose {{surprise}} had {{a genuine}} air; 'they told me, where I last inquired, {{it was the}} third <b>I</b> should <b>come</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> is only the second.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you spoiled all the lunch!" [...] wailed Codfish, {{looking around}} for his cap, which had been knocked off. [...] "Oh dear! I wish <b>I</b> hadn't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> out-of-the-way place!" ...|$|R
