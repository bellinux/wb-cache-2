Every day <b>he</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> prize and the Proud is devastated when the winning knight does not show up the next morning; particularly so since she learns from her cousin Jason every evening that the victorious knight has been none other than her 'strange or unknown young man'. Ipomadon has been careful to seek out this cousin every evening after the fighting to declare his identity. Well, not quite his complete identity.

500|$|In baseball, {{batting average}} (AVG) {{is a measure}} of a batter's success rate in {{achieving}} a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). In MLB, a player in each league wins the [...] "batting title" [...] each season for having the highest batting average that year. The American League (AL) winner is known as the [...] "Rod Carew American League Batting Champion", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the [...] "Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion". Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title. However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, <b>he</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> title. Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs. Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to [...]349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.|$|E
