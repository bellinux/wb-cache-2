40|$|This {{document}} {{captures the}} system architecture for a Component-Level Electronic-Assembly Repair (CLEAR) capability needed for electronics {{maintenance and repair}} of the Constellation Program (CxP). CLEAR is intended to improve flight system supportability and reduce the mass of spares required to maintain the electronics of human rated spacecraft on long duration missions. By necessity it allows the crew to make repairs {{that would otherwise be}} performed by Earth based repair depots. Because of practical knowledge and skill limitations of small spaceflight crews they must be augmented by Earth based support crews and automated repair equipment. This system architecture covers the complete system from ground-user to flight hardware and flight crew and defines an <b>Earth</b> <b>segment</b> and a Space segment. The <b>Earth</b> <b>Segment</b> involves database management, operational planning, and remote equipment programming and validation processes. The Space Segment involves the automated diagnostic, test and repair equipment required for a complete repair process.

40|$|Nowadays, earth {{stations}} for downloading data from LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites {{make use of}} large reflector antennas. These antennas pose a number of impairments regarding their mechanical complexity, lower flexibility, network efficiency and higher cost [1]. Furthermore, reflector antennas can track only one satellite at a time, so that {{the efficiency of the}} <b>earth</b> <b>segment</b> is reduced [2]. In order to improve the performance of traditional {{earth stations}}, the feasibility of other antenna technologies must be evaluated and one alternative are the conformal adaptive antennas based on multiple planar arrays as geodesic antenna array (GEODA) [3]. These antennas have several advantages over large dishes [4] and the efficiency to track several satellites simultaneously {{is a function of the}} number of antenna elements and the correct calibration of the antenna arrays. These antennas use adaptive beamforming algorithms with spatial reference to track the satellites, and the compute of a close approach of the spatial reference as well the direction of arrival depends on the calibration algorithm performance.

40|$|Satellite Communications and {{broadcasting}} {{is presently}} {{in a period}} of considerable change. In the fixed service there is strong competition from terrestrial fiber optic systems which have virtually arrested the growth of the traditional satellite market for long distance high capacity communications. The satellite has however made considerable progress in areas where it has unique advantages; for example, in point to multipoint (broadcasting), multipoint to point (data collection) and generally in small terminal system applications where flexibility of deployment coupled with ease of installation are of importance. In the mobile service, in addition to the already established geostationary systems, there are numerous proposals for HEO, MEO and LEO systems. There are also several new frequency allocations {{as a result of the}} WARC 92 to be taken into account. At one extreme there are researchers working on Ka band 20 / 30 GHz mobile systems and there are other groups who foresee no future above the L-band frequency allocations. Amongst all these inputs it is difficult to see the direction in which development activities both for satellites and for <b>earth</b> <b>segment</b> should be focused. However, as an aid to understanding, this paper seeks to find some underlying relationships and to clarify some of the variables...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the current}} regulatory {{regimes in the}} European Union [...] -in particular Germany [...] -and the United States governing the authorization of global mobile personal communications by satellite (GMPCS). Current satellite licensing regimes fail {{to take into account}} the international character of satellite telecommunications. The reliance on a national public interest standard does not properly address the interests of the community of states, industry and consumers and is not suitable to meet the aspirations of international space law. The international harmonization of frequencies and international standardization are indispensable for the introduction of these new services. The establishment of an international communications regulator with the power to adopt binding decisions if required is the most suitable way to address these problems. However, the development of an international public interest standard with clear policy objectives will be hard to achieve. With regard to the different aspects of ground segment licensing, a gradual approach is the best way to balance the different interests and concerns in this field. The International Telecommunications Union GMPCS MoU and the development of European regulations show a feasible way to achieve a regulatory regime that facilitates the introduction of these new services. Lighter regulations, possibly the introduction of one stop shopping procedures, mutual recognition of licenses and the introduction of general authorizations are measures that can and should be taken at the international level. The interdependence of earth and space segment licensing may lead to the understanding that some aspects of <b>earth</b> <b>segment</b> licensing should also be regulated at international level. The question will be whether States, industry and users are able to reconcile their interests and the sometimes opposing trends of international cooperation and international competition for the benefit of "all mankind"...|$|E

Given its intrinsic advantages, especially in Europe, a separate satellite network could lead to efficiency gains resulting from facility-based competition. Moreover, a satellite entrant may induce the terrestrial network operators to compete directly against each other. It may therefore offer {{a solution to the problem}} of network fragmentation in Europe. Moreover, its insensitivity to distance implies that a satellite competitor will foster universal service. It is therefore argued that Eutelsat, the main player in the European satellite market, should be separated from the national telecommunications organizations...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Global Exploration Roadmap (GER), the availability of large outposts orbiting in cis- and trans-lunar space to answer different functionalities is a mandatory preliminary step for the future solar system human exploration. The Moon is no longer perceived as a target to reach, but as a starting point and platform to be exploited as a step towards greater objectives. In this context, the European Space Agency proposed the ESA Moon Challenge, an International Student Contest challenging international teams, composed by University students from at least two continents, to design a mission scenario and operational concept for ESA's HERACLES concept study. This paper focuses on the main results and original aspects of the mission scenario proposed and designed by the Advanced Concepts for Moon Exploitation (ACME) team: a combination of large-scale lunar surface and trans-lunar space architectures is proposed, to produce and assemble key spacecraft components directly in space, enabling currently unfeasible deep space missions and more efficient Earth servicing space systems building up. The key motivation being the energetic requirement to launch massive elements from the Moon to be strongly reduced with respect to launch them from Earth. The mission includes three main building blocks: the automated Moon surface infrastructure, the orbiting manned station, located in the Earth-Moon Lagrangian Point 2 (EML 2) and the <b>Earth</b> <b>segment.</b> The first is composed by three further modules: (1) set of robots to collect regolith and feed the (2) In-Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) plants to extract the correct chemicals to either feed the (3) 3 D printers to produce basic spacecraft structural components (trusses, plates) or to synthetize rocket propellants (H 2, O 2, metals). The orbiting manned station is conceived to receive the lunar surface products and technologically advanced hardware coming from Earth and assemble them into operational space vehicles aimed to perform different exploration mission scenarios. The EML 2 station itself is designed to be modular, to launch from Earth small modules then enlarged and assembled in orbit, exploiting the in-situ produced structures as well. The paper reports the overall architecture design and operations strategy, pointing out the mandatory requirements; attention is then focused on the Moon surface modules definition and design; their feasibility is critically discussed according to the current Technology Readiness Level and the potential development plan. The cost effectiveness of the proposed scenario is highlighted, supported by the performed economic analysis to assess the validity of the proposed concept...|$|E
40|$|Rapidly {{growing demand}} for channel {{capacity}} and limitations in satellite power and frequency spectrum is urging the utilisation of higher frequency bands. Attentions are focused on 20 / 30 GHz and above which will provide many services due to large the available bandwidth and small size of <b>earth</b> <b>segment.</b> However, the main problem revolves around the severe attenuation by hydrometeors, specifically rain which significantly degrades communications quality. The available propagation data in 20 / 30 GHz bands in Europe is not sufficient for designing reliable communication systems. Olympus provides a unique opportunity for collection of long term propagation data to investigate the effects of hydrometeors at 12. 5, 20 and 30 GHz. An experimental arrangement has been established for 20 GHz beacon measurements at the University of Surrey. Copolar and cross polar measurements were taken but only the copolar attenuation data has been analysed. On 29 th May 1991 Olympus lost attitude and orbit control. In its absence the Russian satellite (MAYAK) transmission was recorded, after modification in the receiving equipment. Data recorded from the MAYAK beacon had large cyclic variation, a peak to peak variation of several decibels was observed which were removed at the data preprocessing stage. A limited data was collected from MAYAK since Olympus was restored in mid August 1991 and beacon measurements were continued as before. A few significant propagation events recorded using MAYAK are also presented in the thesis. Olympus showed peak to peak diurnal variation of few decibels which was removed by the data pre-processing software before any statistical analysis of the data. Another experimental arrangement for collection of weather data has also been established. A new time integration technique for calculation of rain rate using low resolution rain gauge has been introduced which produced better results and they were verified using rain attenuation prediction models. The limited data set obtained from Olympus and MAYAK beacons was compared with rain attenuation models as well as European and UK experimental results. Cranes rain attenuation prediction for Guilford yielded best fit to the measured data. There {{is also a good}} correlation with the other European measurements. However, comparison with the BTRL was not in full agreement because the BTRL measurements were taken uninterruptedly over a period of one year while the measurements taken at Guildford were short term and interrupted several times due to loss of Olympus, software and hardware development for alternative satellite. Long term data is required for more meaningful comparison. The system has been developed to receive and record data reliably. Data recording is in continuous progress more than one year's data has been obtained but only preliminary recorded data is analysed in this thesis...|$|E
