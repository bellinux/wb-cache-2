50|$|J. Strom Thurmond Dam, {{also known}} in Georgia as Clarks Hill Dam, is a concrete-gravity and {{embankment}} dam located 22 mi north of Augusta, Georgia on the Savannah River {{at the border}} of South Carolina and Georgia, creating Lake Strom Thurmond. U.S. Route 221 (and Georgia State Route 150 on the Georgia side of the state line) cross it. The dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1946 and 1954 {{for the purposes of}} flood control, hydroelectricity and <b>downstream</b> <b>navigation.</b> The concrete structure of the dam spans 1096 ft and rises 204 ft above the riverbed, housing a power plant with an installed 380 MW capacity. The Dam has prevented over $185,000 in estimated flood damage annually and also provides recreation, water quality, water supply, along with fish and wildlife management.|$|E

40|$|In 2003 an {{accessibility}} study {{based on}} real-time simulations for the S-class container ships of Maersk Sealand was performed at Flanders Hydraulics Research {{in cooperation with}} all involved parties (public and port authorities, pilots, tug and shipping company). The regulation for the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>navigation</b> on the Western Scheldt did not accept {{the arrival of a}} ship with length over all greater than 340 m. The paper describes two main research studies executed to fill in the gap of knowledge about the manoeuvring behaviour of container ships in shallow and confined water: the accessibility of Ultra Large Container Ships with a maximum capacity of 14, 000 TEU to the Western Scheldt and the accessibility of the Berendrecht Lock and Delwaide Dock located on the right bank of the port of Antwerp. An integrated simulation platform with mathematical models describing hydrodynamic (manoeuvrability, ship-bank and ship-ship interaction) and external (wind, current, tug assistance) forces and coupled ship manoeuvring simulators helped in evaluating the possibilities and limitations of head-on encounters, lock and turning manoeuvres. The combination of research and training has finally led to the arrival of the MSC Beatrice in April 2009. After a validation period of more than half a year, characterised by a constant adaptation of negotiated restrictions, a new regulation for the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>navigation</b> is being prepared...|$|E

40|$|The hydrologic {{regime of}} the Illinois River has been {{substantially}} altered by floodplain levees, navigation dams, and water diversion. Unnaturally frequent and untimely water level fluctuations, large and small, have decreased {{the productivity of}} many floodplain vegetation communities that provide important eco-logical services, including the moist-soil plant community. We simulated three scenarios, including two that were expected to benefit moist-soil plants: (1) existing conditions, with levees and navigation dams closed during the summer growing season; (2) levees opened to reconnect the river and its floodplain during the growing season; and (3) both the <b>downstream</b> <b>navigation</b> dam and the levees opened during the growing season. A 1 -dimensional hydraulic model generated daily hydrographs of the river at three positions in the 135 km study reach: (1) near the downstream dam, (2) {{in the middle of}} the reach, and (3) near the upstream dam. These hydrographs then were used to run a model that predicts the growth of moist-soil plants at a range of floodplain elevations. As expected, the model predicted that plants would grow over a larger area with levees open during the growing season than under the existing conditions, but the outcomes showed a strong location dependency. Moist-soil plant production would increase in the upper and mid-reach locations, but there would be no change near the downstream dam despite opening the levees. Modellin...|$|E

500|$|The {{drainage}} of Deeping Fen {{was again}} addressed in 1664, when the Deeping Fen Act awarded the Earl of Manchester and others [...] {{of land in}} return for the drainage works. They were also obliged to maintain the banks of the river, to ensure that both the Welland and the Glen were kept clean and free-flowing, and to ensure that no tolls were charged for navigation on any part of the river below East Deeping. The inadequacy of the outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task. They tried renting out the land they had been granted, but many tenants were unable to pay the rent, due to the poor state of the drainage which reduced crop yields. In April 1729, the Deeping Fen Adventurers received a letter from Captain John Perry, expressing the opinion {{that the only way to}} improve the drainage was to improve the river outfalls, and proposing the construction of scouring sluices on the river at Spalding, on Vernatt's drain at its outfall, and on the River Glen at Surfleet. Perry was an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, when he published his recommendations for the North Level of the Fens. His plans were approved, and the Adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly [...] in payment for the work. He sold one-third of the land to finance the project, and began work in 1730. Cowbit sluice on the Welland had six [...] wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel. At high tide, water was penned in Cowbit Wash, between banks which were set well back from the main channel. The bed of the river below the sluice was loosened by dragging wooden rollers with iron spikes over it. At low tide, the sluice gates were opened, and the flow scoured out the silt for some [...] <b>downstream.</b> A <b>navigation</b> lock was constructed beside the sluice, so that vessels could still gain access to the river above. Perry died in February 1733, and was buried in Spalding churchyard. The lock lasted until it was removed by the Welland commissioners in 1813.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} how hippocampal location-selective discharges might influence <b>downstream</b> structures for <b>navigation,</b> nucleus accumbens neurons {{were recorded in}} rats alternating between two tasks guided respectively by lit cues in the maze or by extramaze room cues. Of 144 phasically active neurons, 80 showed significant behavioral correlates including displacements, immobility prior to, or after reward delivery, as well as turning, similar to previous reports. Nine neurons were position-selective, 22 were sensitive to task and platform changes and 40 others were both. Although the accumbens neurons showed the same behavioral correlate in two or four functionally equivalent locations, these responses were stronger {{at some of these}} places, evidence for position sensitivity. To test whether position responses were selective for room versus platform cues, the experimental platform was rotated while the rat performed each of the two tasks. This revealed responses to changes in position relative to both platform and room cues, despite the fact that previous studies had shown that place responses of hippocampal neurons recorded in the same task are anchored to room cues only. After these manipulations and shifts between the two tasks, the responses varied among simultaneously recorded neurons, and even in single neurons in alternating visits to reward sites. Again this contrasts with the uniformity of place responses of hippocampal neurons recorded in this same task. Thus accumbens position responses may derive from hippocampal inputs, while responses to context changes are more likely to derive from other signals or intrinsic processing. Considering the accumbens as a limbic-motor interface, we conclude that position-modulated behavioral responses in the accumbens may be intermediate between the allocentric reference frame of position-selective discharges in the hippocampus and the egocentric coding required to organize movement control. The conflicting responses among simultaneously recorded neurons could reflect competition processes serving as substrates for action selection and learning...|$|R
40|$|The {{world of}} {{satellite}} navigation has known a constant evolution for several years. At {{the turn of}} the century, its craze resulted in a multitude of automated applications being released in both the commercial and industrial markets. All this occurred in areas as diverse as agriculture, construction, security and transport of all kinds. Through integration with complementary technologies and ever smaller achieved accuracy thresholds, eopositioning also managed to break through initially incompatible markets, such as hostile environments and confined spaces (e. g. in urban canyons, inside buildings, under the canopy, etc.). Indeed, recent technological and algorithmic advances can now mitigate or solve the traditional limitations of GPS, namely availability, integrity, accuracy and resistance to interference. With so much variety and changes, a universal and flexible approach is best suited as a basic structure of a satellite navigation receiver. The work herein therefore focuses on universal architectures for such channels, through various hardware modules forming the receiver. Although indispensable, upstream radio frequency modules and <b>downstream</b> software in <b>navigation</b> receivers are {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis. Following a comprehensive review of the specificities of each satellite signal, a list of their associated tracking techniques is classified. This information sets the stage for the architecture requirements of the targeted universal channels, which are broken up into three and divided into as many papers: 1) frequency domain acquisition, 2) match filter tracking and 3) solution augmentation with differential corrections. Various analyses and receiver configuration Tools enabling a flexible and efficient development platform are then presented, including the decoding of navigation messages, different approaches to compute the signal to noise ratio and the quantification level of the incoming signal. Since the project is ambitious, validation is based on experimentation with real signals, thus avoiding the additional development of complex multifrequency simulators for different constellations. Impacts and benefits of this patent-rewarded research are considerable, especially with the exponential growth of the market for mobile and wearable electronics. The thesis opens with a renewed old problem, namely the signal selection (rather than the satellite selection). It is revived by leveraging the universal channels to minimize the acquisition time with old signals, while maximizing the robustness of the solution by the gradual transition to modernized and new signals. In addition, this channel flexibility paves the way for cognitive and tactical receivers, enabling them to adapt to their environment or frequency conditions...|$|R
