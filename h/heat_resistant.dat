5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic olefin {{copolymers}} {{are prepared}} by copolymerization of ethene and cycloolefins (usually norbornene) produced by using metallocene catalysts. The resulting polymers are amorphous polymers and particularly transparent and <b>heat</b> <b>resistant.</b>|$|E

25|$|When skiing, the {{friction}} between the snow and skis causes wax to abrade and remain in the snow pack until spring thaw. Then the snowmelt drains into watersheds, streams, lakes and rivers, thereby changing the chemistry {{of the environment and}} the food chain. Perfluorocarbons in ski wax are <b>heat</b> <b>resistant,</b> chemically and biologically stable, and thus environmentally persistent.|$|E
25|$|ATK {{participated in}} a {{consortium}} {{to develop a new}} engine nozzle for the Boeing 787 designed to make its operation more environmentally friendly. The nozzle was made from oxide-oxide ceramic matrix composite (CMC).

25|$|Bioindicators {{can also}} be used to {{independently}} confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> microbe Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.|$|E
25|$|An {{accelerated}} climate {{simulation chamber}} was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time. Materials research into <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> ceramics {{for use in}} truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research {{that began in the}} nuclear reactors of the 1950s. In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects. The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding Reagan's economic policy of less government expenditure.|$|E

40|$|Special heat {{exchanger}} {{made out of}} polymer materials have been developed and applied in refrigeration systems. The initial purpose was to provide corrosion <b>resistant</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers for the rejection of heat into sea water for an improved efficiency compared to regular air cooling of A/C and refrigeration system condensers. Another application was the corrosion <b>resistant</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger for heat rejection or heat extraction to resp. from ground source water in A/C and heat pump installations. In a further step the polymer material {{have been used as}} solution {{heat exchanger}} (HEX) for ammonia/water absorption-resorption cycles with the advantage that this fluid pair allows cooling below 0 °C and that the resorption reduces the pressure level for a further extended application of polymer material heat exchangers. As a next option modified polymer HEX will be used as desorbers and absorbers in ammonia/water cycles. A further step leads to the application of polymer HEX equipment for evaporation and condensing in compression cycles with maximum pressure below 5 bar...|$|R

25|$|The Gaur {{population}} {{experienced a}} drastic decline of about 90% between the 1960s and 1990s due to poaching, commercial hunting, shrinking habitat, and the spreading of disease. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, the Gaur is a vulnerable species {{due to its}} declining population in Southeast Asia. Although the global Gaur population has declined by 30% over the past 30 years, the Gaur has a relatively stable population in India, due to protective efforts such as cryoconservation. The American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Integrated Conservation Research (ICR), and Advanced Cell Technology have made efforts to use cryopreserved specimens of the Gaur through artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and cloning, respectively. Hybridization with domestic cattle has been successfully achieved by ICR, {{in order to create}} higher yielding, <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> cattle.|$|E
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
500|$|Exhaust {{heat from}} the V-22's engines can {{potentially}} damage the ships' flight decks and coatings. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) devised a temporary fix of portable heat shields placed under the engines, and determined that a long-term solution would require redesigning decks with <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> coating, passive thermal barriers, and ship structure changes. Similar changes are required for F-35B operations. In 2009, DARPA requested solutions for installing robust flight deck cooling.
