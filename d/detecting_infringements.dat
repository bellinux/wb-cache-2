Existing solutions for <b>detecting</b> <b>infringements</b> in structured text such as source code {{are restricted to}} textual similarity comparisons of two pieces of work. In this paper, we examine authorship attribution {{as a means for}} tackling plagiarism detection. Given several samples of work from several authors, we attempt to correctly identify the author of work presented as a query. On a collection of 1 640 documents written by 100 authors, we show that we can attribute authorship in up to 67 % of cases.

40|$|Abstract Privacy is {{becoming}} a urgent issue in information systems nowadays because of the stringent requirements imposed by data protection regulations. Traditional security approaches based on access control and authorization are not adequate to address these requirements. The underlying fundamental problem is that those approaches are preventive and thus they {{are not able to}} deal with exceptions. In this paper, we present a practical privacy framework that shifts the problem of preventing infringements into a problem of <b>detecting</b> <b>infringements.</b> The framework is based on systematic log auditing, use of patterns and privacy metrics to detect and quantify infringements. Zusammenfassung Dieser Beitrag stellt ein praktisch umsetzbares Datenschutzrahmenwerk vor, welches auf die nachträgliche Entdeckung von Verstößen fokussiert. Der Ansatz basiert auf der systematischen Analyse von Ereignislogs und dient sowohl der Entdeckung als auch der Quantifizierung der Verstößen.

5000|$|Bumping {{is often}} {{described}} as happening behind the play, meaning that unless it occurs during a contest for the ball, it is not always the focus of television cameras or spectators. This can also makes it difficult for field umpires to <b>detect</b> <b>infringements.</b> An umpire will often call [...] "fair bump", or [...] "play on" [...] in response to a legal bump. If a bump is late and the player has already kicked the ball, then it often results in a relayed free kick, which is given to a player on the same team further towards their goal.|$|R

30|$|Welfare {{agencies}} play {{a crucial}} role for the use of sanctions, since they have substantial discretion. Whether or not a sanction is actually imposed, depends not only on the <b>detected</b> <b>infringement,</b> but also on the general sanction policy of the welfare agency. Some agencies have a high affinity for sanctions, while other agencies are more reserved. An important element for the agencies’ management in implementing a strategy is the definition of local guidelines (verhaltenslenkende Weisungen) for caseworkers. These guidelines are issued to control caseworker behavior in general. Specifically, in some agencies they may be used in order to induce caseworkers to impose sanctions frequently. Other welfare agencies might follow a milder sanction policy and refrain from encouraging or even discourage caseworkers from imposing sanctions. Therefore, the sanction strategy influences caseworkers’ actions and, consequently, creates variation in the use of sanctions across welfare agencies.|$|R
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} copyrights {{are protected}} by means of patents and nondisclosure agreements. In many cases however copyright laws cannot be effectively enforced due {{to the difficulty of}} proving or even <b>detecting</b> <b>infringement.</b> This problem is addressed in the paper using a scheme known as watermarking. The method consists of implanting a semi-transparent unique signature in the circuit's intrinsic structure, without disrupting its functionality. A formalization of the watermarking problem is presented in the context of hierarchical IC design. Algorithms are proposed for implanting and detecting watermarks. The concepts of robustness against forgery and theft tracking are analyzed and examples are presented to show the feasibility of the approach. 1 Introduction Employing well-known techniques, it is possible today to reverseengineer virtually any IC design, given a sufficient pool of samples and enough time.

30|$|The {{nationwide}} representative {{survey of}} laundry companies showed that, {{according to their}} own statements, about 40  % of companies, accounting for some 85  % of total employment, are covered by the minimum wage regulations. Evidently it is the target companies, those that obtain a high share of their turnover from commercial customers, that are mainly affected by the minimum wage regulations. However, it has become clear that there is also a grey area in which companies feel obliged to pay the minimum wage despite deriving a lower share of their turnover from commercial customers or, conversely, do not consider themselves covered by the regulations even though they put the share of their turnover from commercial customers at more than 80  %. This may be due to uncertainties about the criteria defining the scope of the minimum wage regulations and inadequate information or may possibly indicate active defiance of the regulations. The regulatory authorities also referred to similar definitional problems, which {{make it more difficult to}} <b>detect</b> <b>infringements.</b>|$|R

As currently there is no generally implemented authentification technology we have to monitor the content and relations of messages and Internet traffic to <b>detect</b> <b>infringements.</b> In this paper, we present recent research on Internet threats such as fraud or hampering critical information infrastructure. One approach concentrates on the rapid detection of phishing email, designed to make it next to impossible for attackers to obtain financial resources or commit identity theft in this way. Then we address how another type of Internet fraud, the violation of the rights of trademark owners by the selling of faked merchandise, can be semi-automatically solved with text mining methods. Thirdly, we report on two projects that are designed to prevent fraud in business processes in public administration, namely in the healthcare sector and in customs administration.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 96. 05 is a {{prospective}} randomized controlled trial comparing a single 8 Gy with 20 Gy in five fractions of radiotherapy (RT) for neuropathic pain due to bone metastases. This paper summarizes the quality assurance (QA) {{activities for the}} first 234 patients (accrual target 270). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Independent audits to assess compliance with eligibility/exclusion criteria and appropriateness of treatment of the index site were conducted after each cohort of approximately 45 consecutive patients. Reported serious adverse events (SAEs) {{in the form of}} cord/cauda equina compression or pathological fracture developing at the index site were investigated and presented in batches to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Finally, source data verification of the RT prescription page and treatment records was undertaken for each of the first 234 patients to assess compliance with the protocol. RESULTS: Only one patient was found conclusively not to have genuine neuropathic pain, and there were no detected 'geographical misses' with RT fields. The overall rate of <b>detected</b> <b>infringements</b> for other eligibility criteria over five audits (225 patients) was 8 % with a dramatic improvement after the first audit. There has at no stage been a statistically significant difference in SAEs by randomization arm. There was a 22 % rate of RT protocol variations involving ten of the 14 contributing centres, although the rate of major dose violations (more than +/- 10 % from protocol dose) was only 6 % with no statistically significant difference by randomization arm (P= 0. 44).
