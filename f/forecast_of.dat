40|$|Abstract—In {{view of the}} {{characteristic}} that the traffic system is a dynamic and time-varying parameter system, the multi-level recursive forecasting method is proposed, and the multi-level recursive <b>forecasting</b> model <b>of</b> road accidents is established in this thesis.

From June to November 2011, the ferry accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to a projection of 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, the ferry saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> 134,000 riders.|$|E
5|$|Météo-France issued their {{seasonal}} <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> cyclone {{activity for}} the basin on November 12. MFR predicted a slightly below average to average season, citing {{the effects of}} a very strong El Niño event. Compared to an average of ten moderate tropical storms that usually form in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 70% chance was given to the probability of six to ten named storms forming. A 20% chance was given to the formation of only five cyclones or less, and a 10% was given to an above average level of activity. MRF expected that an above average number of named storms would develop in the central region of the basin (from 60°E to 77°E), and that there would be lower than average activity to the east of 77°E. Activity near normal was expected west of 60°E. MFR also predicted that the motion of cyclones during the season would have a stronger meridional component than normal, having a tendency to track south quickly.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, {{after an}} {{extraordinarily}} active early season, the NOAA released an updated outlook on {{the remainder of}} the season, significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be 180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal confidence in the <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> above-normal activity. On August 5, 2005, Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update. Although neither the NOAA nor Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity. The actual ACE would prove to be 248 × 104 kt2— 277% of the median.|$|E

5|$|On June1, Klotzbach's team issued their updated {{forecast}} for the 2012season, predicting thirteen named storms and five hurricanes, of which {{two of those}} five would further intensify into major hurricanes. The university stated {{that there was a}} high amount of uncertainty concerning whether or not an El Niño would develop in time to hinder tropical development in the Atlantic basin. They also stated there was a lower than average chance of a major hurricane impacting the United States coastline in 2012. On June6, Tropical Storm Risk released their second {{updated forecast}} for the season, predicting fourteen named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. In addition, the agency called for an Accumulated Cyclone Energy index of 100. Near-average sea surface temperatures and slightly elevated trade winds for cited for lower activity compared to the 2010 and 2011hurricane seasons. Tropical Storm Risk continued with their <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> a near-average probability of a United States impact during the season using the 1950–2011 long-term normal, but a slightly below-average chance of a United States landfall by the recent 2002–2011 normal.|$|E

Also on June2, 2009, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) issued its first ever Atlantic hurricane season forecast. The FSU COAPS forecast predicted 8 named storms, including 4 hurricanes, and an ACE Index of 65.

5|$|The Hiroshima {{mission was}} {{followed}} by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> bad weather. This time, a Fat Man nuclear weapon was carried by B-29 Bockscar, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target. Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura, {{but by the time}} Bockscar arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yahata by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, Bockscar diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and had very little fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} {{erupted in the}} wake of the Great Recession around late 2009, and was {{characterized}} by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout. At the time, the European Commission released a <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse. The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debt-to-GDP ratios experienced by several European governments {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession. The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and potential growth; competitive weakness; liquidation of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).|$|E
