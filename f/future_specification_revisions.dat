40|$|Optimal {{control policy}} {{synthesis}} for probabilistic systems from high-level specifications is increasingly often studied. One major {{question that is}} commonly faced, however, is {{what to do when}} the optimal probability of achieving the specification is not satisfactory? We address this question by viewing the specification as a soft constraint and present a synthesis framework for MDPs that encodes and automates <b>specification</b> <b>revision</b> in a trade-off for higher probability. The method uses co-safe LTL as the specification language and quantifies the <b>revisions</b> to the <b>specification</b> according to userdefined proposition costs. The framework computes a control policy that optimizes the trade-off between the probability of satisfaction and the cost of <b>specification</b> <b>revision.</b> The key idea of the method is a rule for the composition of the MDP, the automaton representing the specification, and the proposition costs such that all possible <b>specification</b> <b>revisions</b> along with their costs and probabilities of satisfaction are captured in one structure. The problem is then reduced to multi-objective optimization on an MDP. The power of the method is illustrated though simulations of a complex robotic scenario...|$|R
