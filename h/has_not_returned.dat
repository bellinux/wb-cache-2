5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|William Petit, {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of the home invasion, is an endocrinologist in Cheshire. He survived when he escaped via a direct external exit from the basement despite his injuries.

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E

5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>returned.</b> In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E

The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug {{to return to the}} market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be no worse than those from ibuprofenthough the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> rofecoxib to the market.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{television}} {{personality and}} comedian Willie Revillame {{was the main}} eviction host of the show, along with young up-and-coming personalities Mariel Rodriguez and Toni Gonzaga.

25|$|Epstein {{also tried}} to {{cast doubt on the}} source of the polonium, {{suggesting}} that it was London rather than Moscow. Epstein claimed that the Transaero plane that Lugovoi and Kovtun flew on from Moscow to London on 16 October had no polonium traces. In fact, the Russian authorities refused permission for the British to inspect the aircraft in question. According to the Guardian, Russia's public health minister Gennady Onischenko, assured the British that no contamination was found on either plane. However, experts apparently managed to inspect one of the planes and found contamination where Lugovoi and Kovtun had been seated. The Russian then cancelled a scheduled flight to London by the other plane. The same plane <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>returned</b> to British airspace since.|$|E
