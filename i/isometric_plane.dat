5000|$|Since Rosen had {{recently}} departed for the Soviet Union, Einstein acted alone in promptly and thoroughly revising their joint paper. This third version was retitled On gravitational waves, and, following Robertson's {{suggestion of a}} transformation to cylindrical coordinates, presented what are now called Einstein-Rosen cylindrical waves (these are locally <b>isometric</b> to <b>plane</b> waves). This is the version that eventually appeared. However, Rosen was unhappy with this revision and eventually published his own version, which retained the erroneous [...] "disproof" [...] of the prediction of gravitational radiation.|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} was to gain an understanding as to how waves propagate through structures. Lamb 2 ̆ 7 s Problem was studied on an <b>isometric</b> half <b>plane,</b> where numerical results were obtained. The calculated wavefronts for this problem were in agreement to the numerical results. When a distributed pressure is applied on an <b>isometric</b> half <b>plane,</b> after a long period of time, the wavefronts look as if a point force was applied on the half plane. Waves propagating through an orthotropic material were obtained numerically; it was found that Huygens 2 ̆ 7 Principle cannot be used to calculate the wavefronts. 	The impact of spherical and cylindrical projectiles on glass plates was studied next. The waves introduced into the material were calculated using Finite Element Analysis, and compared to calculated wavefronts using Snell 2 ̆ 7 s Law, where they were found to be in agreement with one another. The effects of circular and square discontinuities were also studied, where a creeping wave that is produced after a wave propagates past a circular hole is explained. 	A sandwich beam was also modeled using FEA, where the wavefronts were obtained, and were found to be in agreement with calculated wavefronts. The displacement of the bottom layer of the sandwich beam was obtained numerically; {{it was found that the}} bending of the beam occurs at the same time as whether the middle layer is present or not...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{superposition}} of periodical structures. A structure is a space or time filled with discrete objects. It is periodical if there exist translations mapping the structure on itself. Only structures in a two-dimensional space are regarded. The main part investigates the <b>plane</b> <b>isometric</b> features of those superpositions. Single periodical structures as well as double periodical structures are considered. Another issue is the relation between superpositions and tilings. The technical applications of periodical structures eg in printing are also discussed. The last chapter looks on patterns similar to the superposition of periodical structures first in nature and then by mathematical methods...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a method to}} {{parameterize}} tubular surfaces onto the cylinder. The cylinder {{can be seen as}} the natural parameterization domain for tubular surfaces since they share the same topology. Most present algorithms are designed to parameterize disc-like surfaces onto the plane. Surfaces with a different topology are cut into disc-like patches and the patches are parameterized separately. This introduces discontinuities and constrains the parameterization. Also the semantics of the surface are lost. We avoid this by parameterizing tubular surfaces on, their natural domain, the cylinder. Since the cylinder is locally <b>isometric</b> to the <b>plane</b> we can do calculations on the cylinder without loosing efficiency. For speeding up the calculation we use a progressive parameterization technique, as suggested in recent literature. Together, this results in a robust, efficient, continuous, and semantics preserving parameterization method for arbitrary tubular surfaces...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} Müller–Šverák (J Differ Geom 42 (2) : 229 – 258, 1995) conformally {{immersed}} surfaces with finite total curvature were studied. In particular {{it was shown}} that surfaces with total curvature A 28 in dimension three were embedded and conformal to the plane with one end. Here, using techniques from Kuwert–Li (W 2, 2 -conformal immersions of a closed Riemann surface into R n. arXiv: 1007. 3967 v 2 [math. DG], 2010), we will show that if the total curvature A 28, then we are either embedded and conformal to the <b>plane,</b> <b>isometric</b> to a catenoid or isometric to Enneper’s minimal surface. In fact the technique of our proof shows {{that if we are}} conformal to the plane, then if n ≥ 3 and A 216 then Σ is embedded or Σ is the image of a generalized catenoid inverted at a point on the catenoid. In order to prove these theorems, we prove a Gauss–Bonnet theorem for surfaces with complete ends and isolated finite area singularities which extends a theorem of Jorge-Meeks (Topology 22 (2) : 203 – 221, 1983). Using this theorem, we then prove an inversion formula for the Willmore energy...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} of this dissertation {{is to develop}} a 'Seeing-Eye' video-based interface for the visually impaired to access environmental text information. We are concerned with those daily activities of the low-vision people involved with interpreting 'environmental text' or 'scene text' e. g., reading a newspaper, can labels and street signs. First, we discuss the devopement of such a video-based interface. In this interface, the processed image of a scene text is read by o®-the-shelf OCR and converted back to speech by Text-to-Speech(TTS) software. Our challenge is to feed a high quality image of a scene text for o®-the-shelf OCR software under general pose of the the surface on which text is printed. To achieve this, various problems related to feature detection, mosaicing, auto-focus, zoom, and systems integration were solved {{in the development of the}} system, and these are described. We employ the video-based interface for the analysis of video of lectures/posters. In this application, the text is assumed to be on a plane. It is necessary for automatic analysis of video content to add modules such as enhancement, text segmentation, preprocessing video content, metric rectification, etc. We provide qualitative results to justify the algorithm and system integration. For more general classes of surfaces that the text is printed on, such as bent or worked paper, we develop a novel method for 3 D structure recovery and unwarping method. Deformed paper is <b>isometric</b> with a <b>plane</b> and the Gaussian curvature vanishes on every point on the surface. We show that these constraints lead to a closed set of equations that allow the recovery of the full geometric structure from a single image. We prove that these partial di®erential equations can be reduced to the Hopf equation that arises in non-linear wave propagation, and deformations of the paper can be interpreted in terms of the characteristics of this equation. A new exact integration of these equations relates the 3 D structure of the surface to an image of a paper. In addition, we can generate such surfaces using the underlying equations. This method only uses information derived from the image of the boundary. Furthermore, we employ the shape-from-texture method as an alternative to the method above to infer its 3 D structure. We showed that for the consistency of normal vector field, we need to add extra conditions based on the surface model. Such conditions are are isometry and zero Gaussian curvature of the surface. The theory underlying the method is novel and it raises new open research issues in the area of 3 D reconstruction from single views. The novel contributions are: first, it is shown that certain linear and non-linear clues (contour knowledge information) are su±cient to recover the 3 D structure of scene text; second, that with a priori of a page layout information, we can reconstruct a fronto-parallel view of a deformed page from di®erential geometric properties of a surface; third, that with a known cameral model we can recover 3 D structure of a bent surface; forth, we present an integrated framework for analysis and rectification of scene texts from single views in general format; fifth, we provide the comparison with shape from texture approach and finally this work can be integrated as a visual prostheses for the visually impaired. Our work has many applications in computer vision and computer graphics. The applications are diverse e. g. a generalized scanning device, digital flattening of creased documents, 3 D reconstruction problem when correspondence fails, 3 D reconstruction of single old photos, bending and creasing virtual paper, object classification, semantic extraction, scene description and so on...|$|R
