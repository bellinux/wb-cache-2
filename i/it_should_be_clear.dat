25|$|The {{light source}} {{to be used}} should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light {{proceeding}} from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>clear.</b> J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, Modern Conjuring For Amateurs, that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists {{is the use of}} acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} quantum {{mechanical}} {{formulation of the}} Franck–Condon principle {{is the result of}} a series of approximations, principally the electrical dipole transition assumption and the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Weaker magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole electronic transitions along with the incomplete validity of the factorization of the total wavefunction into nuclear, electronic spatial and spin wavefunctions means that the selection rules, including the Franck-Condon factor, are not strictly observed. For any given transition, the value of P is determined by all of the selection rules, however spin selection is the largest contributor, followed by electronic selection rules. The Franck-Condon factor only weakly modulates the intensity of transitions, i.e., it contributes with a factor on the order of 1 to the intensity of bands whose order of magnitude is determined by the other selection rules. The table below gives the range of extinction coefficients for the possible combinations of allowed and forbidden spin and orbital selection rules.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the {{question}} may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some {{advocates of the}} free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Direck, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>clear</b> by this time, {{was a man}} of {{more than}} European {{simplicity}} and directness, and his intentions towards the young lady were as simple and direct and altogether honest as such intentions can be. It is the American conception of gallantry more than any other people's, to let the lady call the tune in these affairs; the man's place is to be protective, propitiatory, accommodating and clever, and the lady's to be difficult but delightful until he catches her and houses her splendidly and gives her a surprising lot of pocket-money, and goes about his business; and upon these assumptions Mr. Direck went to work. But quite early it was manifest to him that Cecily did not recognise his assumptions. She was embarrassed when he got down one or two little presents of chocolates and flowers for her from London--the Britling boys were much more appreciative--she wouldn't let him contrive costly little expeditions for her, and she protested against compliments and declared she would stay away when he paid them. And she was not contented by his general sentiments about life, but asked the most direct questions about his occupation and his activities. His chief occupation was being the well provided heir of a capable lawyer, and his activities in the light of her inquiries struck him as being light and a trifle amateurish, qualities he had never felt as any drawback about them before. So that he had to rely rather upon aspirations and the possibility, under proper inspiration, of a more actively serviceable life in future.|$|E
