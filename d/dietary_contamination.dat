Furthermore, what we eat is influenced by a complex web of drivers, including culture, politics, economics, and our built and natural environments. To date, public health initiatives aimed at improving food-related population health outcomes have primarily been developed within ‘practice silos’, {{and the potential for}} complex interactions among such initiatives is not well understood. Therefore, our objective was to develop a conceptual model depicting how infectious foodborne illness, food insecurity, dietary contaminants, obesity, and food allergy can be linked via shared drivers, to illustrate potential complex interactions and support future collaboration across public health practice silos. Methods We developed the conceptual model by first conducting a systematic literature search to identify review articles containing schematics that depicted relationships between drivers and the issues of interest. Next, we synthesized drivers into a common model using a modified thematic synthesis approach that combined an inductive thematic analysis and mapping to synthesize findings. Results The literature search yielded 83 relevant references containing 101 schematics. The conceptual model contained 49 shared drivers and 227 interconnections.

However, {{the consequences of}} functional response on parasite transmission remain largely unexplored. The rodents Microtus arvalis and Arvicola terrestris are the main preys of the red fox Vulpes vulpes in eastern France. These species are intermediate and definitive hosts of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis. We explored fox <b>dietary</b> and <b>contamination</b> responses to prey density variations. The dietary response differed between the two prey species: no response for M. arvalis and a type-III like (sigmoidal) response for A. terrestris with a possible interference with M. arvalis. Fox contamination response followed a type-II shape (asymptotic) for both species. We conclude that fox predation is species-specific and E. multilocularis transmission {{is likely to be}} regulated by a complex combination of predation and immunological factors.

Aflatoxin levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography after elution from the affinity column. In studies on rats injected with [14 C]aflatoxin B 1, we identified the major aflatoxin-DNA adduct, 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -(N 7 -guanyl) - 3 -hydroxy-aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 -N 7 -Gua), and the oxidative metabolites M 1 and P 1 as the major aflatoxin species present in the urine.

40|$|Aflatoxins are toxic {{secondary}} fungal metabolites that contaminate dietary staples {{in tropical}} regions; chronic {{high levels of}} exposure are common {{for many of the}} poorest populations. Observations in animals indicate that growth and/or food utilization are adversely affected by aflatoxins. This review highlights the development of validated exposure biomarkers and their use here to assess the role of aflatoxins in early life growth retardation. Aflatoxin exposure occurs in utero and continues in early infancy as weaning foods are introduced. Using aflatoxin-albumin exposure biomarkers, five major studies clearly demonstrate strong dose response relationships between exposure in utero and/or early infancy and growth retardation, identified by reduced birth weight and/or low HAZ and WAZ scores. The epidemiological studies include cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, though aflatoxin reduction intervention studies are now required to further support these data and guide sustainable options to reduce the burden of exposure. The use of aflatoxin exposure biomarkers was essential in understanding the observational data reviewed and will likely be a critical monitor of the effectiveness of interventions to restrict aflatoxin exposure.

30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{pathways}} by which PFC contamination of humans can take place including diet, food contact materials, non-food personal items, and indoor and outdoor air. Although a number of authors have attempted to calculate the contribution of these individual pathways to total contamination, the available data records are not presently adequate to allow sound conclusions to be drawn. In addition, the various authors have, to some extent, taken diverse approaches to the subject of <b>dietary</b> <b>contamination.</b> Some have assumed that consumption of fish and seafood are the main source of PFC contamination in humans, whereas others have postulated that, particularly in regions in which only small amounts of fish are eaten, meat and vegetables are the primary source. There is, however, a general consensus that dietary uptake represents the largest contribution. Nonetheless, {{it will be necessary to}} establish the contribution of various foodstuffs to total exposure by comparing the data from studies that systematically determine PFC contamination of a large number of edible products. Studies that are limited to local or regional products are not adequate to describe the global exposure scenario. Toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data of PFCs, aside from those for the so-called reference substances, PFOA and PFOS, are not consistent enough to allow a conclusive toxicological evaluation.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} in vivo exposure to low zearalenone levels on the anti-Müllerian hormone endocrine levels and the reproductive performance of cattle. Urine and blood samples and reproductive records were collected from two Japanese Black breeding female cattle herds with <b>dietary</b> zearalenone <b>contamination</b> below the threshold levels (< 1  ppm) at 30  days after calving. Urinary zearalenone, α-zearalenol and β-zearalenol concentrations were measured by chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and serum anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations were determined along with serum biochemical parameters. Urinary concentrations of α-zearalenol were significantly higher (p <  0. 05) in cattle in Herd 1 than in cattle in Herd 2, reflecting the different amounts of zearalenone in the diet of the two herds. Although the number of 5 -mm and 10 -mm follicles of the herds and their fertility after artificial insemination were similar, the serum anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations in herds 1 and 2 were 438. 9  ±  48. 6  pg/ml and 618. 9  ±  80. 0  pg/ml, respectively, with a trend towards a significant difference (p =  0. 053), which may indicate differences in the antral follicle populations between herds.

Histological examination revealed marked degenerative changes in the kidney and bursa and mononuclear cell infiltration was recorded in the liver of broilers exposed to OTA contamination. All of the above changes became more evident with the higher OTA level and with prolongation of experimental period.

40|$|Recently, many {{nutraceutical}} products {{containing the}} powdered or extracted parts of C. militaris have become available for health care. Due {{to the increased}} morbidity and mortality, poisonings {{associated with the use}} of herbs have raised the universal attention. Herein, we carried out the 28 -day repeated toxicity test in male and female ablactated rats (three weeks old) given C. militaris powder orally at 0 (control), 1, 2, and 3 [*]g/kg per day. Noticeable increments of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (ALT and AST) levels were observed for both sexes, suggestive of weak hepatic toxicity. Nephrotoxicity characterized by tubular epithelium degeneration and necrosis was observed at the high dose, and the male rats were more susceptible to renal toxicity than female rats. In addition, the genes and protein expressions of novel markers of kidney toxicity, such as kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1) were enlarged in the renal cortex and the urine. Moreover, C. militaris treatment significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. However, the ratio of glutathione oxidized form (GSSG) /glutathione reduced form (GSH) was increased by C. militaris treatment.

The experiments were performed in adult rats which received ash in the diet (5 %) and/or cadmium in drinking water (100 ppm) {{over a period of}} five weeks and in sucklings whose mothers were given the same treatment throughout pregnancy and lactation. In pharmacokinetic studies, 115 mCd was administered orally or intraperitoneally to determine the intestinal absorption, retention, and distribution. Cadmium toxicity (LD,O) was determined in different age groups of animals treated with ash for five weeks before a single oral or intraperitoneal administration of cadmium chloride. After intraperitoneal administration, " 15 "'Cd body retention decreased with age and was independent of the dietary treatment. Sucklings had a higher retention in the blood, carcass, and gut than adults. After oral administration, sucklings had a much higher body retention than adults regardless of the dietary treatment of their mothers. Cadmium toxicity was also independent of the dietary treatment. Most striking was a very high oral toxicity of cadmium in sucklings. It is concluded that the young might be at a special risk at the same level of environmental cadmium exposure because of the high oral cadmium toxicity at this age which is most probably due to a high cadmium retention in the gut. It is also concluded that the mixture of elements contained in ash is not likely to influence cadmium metabolism and toxicity in conditions of dietary exposure...|$|E
40|$|Aristolochic acid (AA) causes {{aristolochic acid}} {{nephropathy}} (AAN), first described in women in Belgium accidently prescribed Aristolochia fangchi in a slimming treatment, and also Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), through probable <b>dietary</b> <b>contamination</b> with Aristolochia clematitis seeds. Both nephropathies {{have a high}} risk of urothelial cancer, with AA being the causative agent. In tissues of AAN and BEN patients, a distinct DNA adduct, 7 -(deoxyadenosin-N 6 -yl) -aristolactam I (dA-AAI), has been detected. DNA adducts can be removed through DNA repair, they can result in mutations through erroneous DNA replication or they can cause cell death. The dA-AAI adduct induces AT to TA transversions in the tumor-suppressor TP 53 gene in experimental systems, matching TP 53 mutations observed in urothelial tumors from AAN cancer cases. Using thin-layer chromatography 32 P-postlabeling and mass spectrometric analysis we report the detection of dA-AAI in renal DNA from 11 Belgian AAN patients over 20 years after exposure to AA had ceased. Our results showed that dA-AAI is an established biomarker of AA exposure, and that this biomarker can be demonstrated to be persistent decades after a distinct AA exposure. Further, the persistence of dA-AAI adducts appears to be a critical determinant for the AA mutational fingerprint frequently found in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes recently identified by whole genome sequencing of AA-associated urothelial tumors. The potential for exposure to AA worldwide is high; the unprecedented long-term persistence of dA-AAI provides a useful long-term biomarker of exposure and attests to the role of AA in human urothelial malignancy. What's new? Aristolochic acid (AA), present in Aristolochia-derived herbal drugs frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, can cause aristolochic acid nephropathy and urothelial cancer. The true extent of AA exposure is unknown as reliable biomarkers are missing. This study demonstrates that premutagenic AA-DNA adducts, specifically 7 -(deoxyadenosin-N 6 -yl) -aristolactam I adducts, have an exceptionally long-term persistence in the renal DNA of aristolochic acid nephropathy patients and thus can serve as biomarkers to assess exposure to AA, even decades later. 2013 UICC.

The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to examine the influences of aqueous and <b>dietary</b> metal <b>contamination</b> on yellow perch liver and kidney metal accumulation; (2) to compare the seasonal and regional variations in gut content and tissue metal concentrations along the two gradients studied; and (3) to investigate the potential of metals for tissue accumulation under conditions of life-long chronic exposure. Our results suggest a greater aqueous than dietary influence on tissue metal concentrations for all metals examined except Cd, where the opposite was observed. Metals did not accumulate in older fish, except for Cd that accumulated with age in RN, but not S, fish. Regional, but also metal-specific differences in metal handling capacities are proposed. Fish from neither region appeared capable of regulating tissue Cd concentrations, but fish from both regions regulated Zn tightly. Sudbury fish appeared better at regulating tissue Cu, Ni, and perhaps also Se concentrations than RN fish, suggesting acclimation or selection for metal tolerance. There were several significant seasonal effects on tissue metal concentrations. However, close examination of the dataset does not allow proposing the presence of a season-linked mechanism explaining these variations, precluding a modeling approach and implying that repeat sampling within and among years is required for proper ecological risk assessment.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{statistical}} analysis of a stochastic model introduced in Bertail, Clémençon & Tressou (2008) for describing the phenomenon of exposure to a certain food contaminant. In this modeling, the temporal evolution of the contamination exposure is entirely determined by the accumulation phenomenon due to successive dietary intakes and the pharmacokinetics governing the elimination process in between intakes, {{in such a way that}} the exposure dynamic through time is described as a piecewise deterministic Markov process. Paths of the contamination exposure process are scarcely observable in practice, therefore intensive computer simulation methods are crucial for estimating the timedependent or steady-state features of the process. Here we consider simulation estimators based on consumption and contamination data and investigate how to construct accurate bootstrap con_dence intervals for certain quantities of considerable importance from the epidemiology viewpoint. Special attention is also paid to the problem of computing the probability of certain rare events related to the exposure process path arising in dietary risk analysis using multilevel splitting or importance sampling techniques.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} effects {{induced by}} feed contaminated {{with a lower}} or a higher concentration of -nonylpnenol (NP), 4 -tert-octylphenol (t-OP) or bisphenol A (BPA), three environmental endocrine disruptors, were assessed in juvenile sea bream liver. Histological analysis demonstrated that all these three xenobiotics induced hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis. These findings prompted analysis of {{the expression of the}} major molecules involved in lipid metabolism: peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (which is encoded by ppars), fatty acid synthase (encoded by fas), lipoprotein lipase (encoded by lpl) and hormone-sensitive lipase (encoded by hsl). The enzymes encoded by ppars and fas are in fact responsible for lipid accumulation, whereas lpl- and hsl- encoded proteins play a pivotal role in fat mobilization. The three xenobiotics modulated ppar mRNA expression: pparα mRNA expression was induced by the higher dose of each contaminant; pparβ mRNA expression was upregulated by the lower doses and in BPA 2 fish ppary mRNA overexpression was induced by all pollutants. These data agreed with the lipid accumulation profiles documented by histology. Fas mRNA levels were modulated by the two NP doses and the higher BPA concentration. Lpl mRNA was significantly upregulated in all experimental groups except for BPA 1 fish while hsl mRNA was significantly downregulated in all groups except for t-OP 2 and BPA 1 fish. The plasma concentrations of cortisol, the primary stress biomarker, were correlated with the levels of pepck mRNA level. This gene encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase {{which is one of the}} key enzymes of gluconeogenesis. Pepck mRNA was significantly overexpressed in fish exposed to NP 2 and both t-OP doses. Finally, the genes encoding cyclooxygenase 2 (cox 2) and 5 -lipoxygenase (5 lox), the products of which are involved in the inflammatory response, transcriptions were significantly upregulated in NP and BPA fish, whereas they were unchanged in t-OP specimens. The present findings suggest that <b>dietary</b> xenobiotic <b>contamination</b> can give rise to metabolic disorders also in fish and highlight the potential for their vertical transfer through the trophic levels and ultimately to humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} surveys the {{essentials}} of my research activity since my PhD thesis [53], which was mainly devoted to extend the use of recent advances in Computational Harmonic Analysis (such as wavelet analysis) for adaptive nonparametric estimation methods in the i. i. d. setting to statistical estimation based on Markovian data. As explained at length in [123], certain concentration of measure properties (i. e. deviation probability and moment inequalities over functional classes, specifically tailored for nonlinear approximation) are crucially required for taking advantages of these analytical tools in statistical settings and getting estimation procedures with convergence rates surpassing the ones of older methods. In [53] (see also [54], [55] and [56]), the regenerative method (refer to [185]), consisting in dividing Harris Markov sample paths into asymptotically i. i. d. blocks, has been crucially exploited for establishing the required probabilistic results, the long term behavior of Markov processes being governed by certain renewal processes (the blocks being actually determined by renewal times). But having constructed an estimator, estimation of the accuracy (measured by the variance, particular quantiles or any functional of the distribution function) of the computed statistic is next of crucial importance. In this respect and beyond its practical simplicity (it consists in resampling data by making i. i. d. draws in the original data sample and recompute the statistic from the bootstrap data sample), the bootstrap {{is known to have}} major theoretical advantages over asymptotic normal approximation in the i. i. d. setting (it automatically approximates the second order structure in the Edgeworth expansion of the statistic distribution). I then turned naturally to the problem of extending the popular bootstrap procedure to markovian data. Through the works I and Patrice Bertail have jointly carried out, the regenerative method was revealed to be not solely a powerful analytical tool for proving probabilistic limit theorems or inequalities, but also to be of practical use for statistical estimation: our proposed bootstrap generalization is based on the resampling of (a random number of) regeneration data blocks (or of approximation of the latter) so as to mimick the renewal structure of the data. This method has also been shown to be advantageous for many other statistical purposes. And {{the first part of the}} report strives to present the principle of regeneration-based statistical methods for Harris Markov chains, as well as some of the various results obtained this way, in a comprehensive manner. The second part of the report is devoted to the problem of learning how to order instances, instead of classifying them only, in a supervised setting. This dicult problem is of practical importance in many areas, ranging from medical diagnosis to information retrieval (IR) and asks challenging theoretical and algorithmic questions, with no entirely satisfactory answers yet. A possible approach to this subject consists in reducing the problem to a pairwise classification problem, as suggested by a popular criterion (namely, the AUC criterion) widely used for evaluating the pertinence of an ordering. In this context some results have been obtained in a joint work with Gabor Lugosi and Nicolas Vayatis, involving the study of U-processes: the major novelty consisting in the fact that here natural estimates of the risk are of the form of a U-statistic. However, in many applications such as IR, only top ranked instances are eectively scanned and a criterion corresponding to such local ranking problems as well as methods for computing optimal ordering rules with respect to the latter are crucially needed. Further developments in this direction have been considered in a (continuing) series of works in collaboration with Nicolas Vayatis. Finally, the last part of the report reflects my interest in practical applications of probabilistic concepts and statistical tools. My personal background lead me to consider first applications in finance. Although historical approaches are not preferred in this domain, I have been progressively convinced that nonparametric statistics could play a major role in analyzing the massive (of very large dimension and high-frequency) financial data for detecting hidden structure in the latter and gaining advantage of the latter in risk assesment or portfolio selection for instance. As an illustration, the works I have carried out with Skander Slim in that direction are described in a word in this third part. Recently, I also happened to meet applied mathematicians or scientists working in other fields, which may naturally interface with applied probability ans statistics. Hence, applications to Toxicology, and in particular to toxic chemicals dietary exposure, has also been one of my concern this last year, which I have spent in the pluridisciplinary research unity Metarisk of the National Research Agronomy Institute, entirely dedicated to dietary risk analysis. I could thus make use of my skills in Markov modelling for proposing a stochastic model describing the temporal evolution of the total body burden of chemical (in a way that both the toxicokinetics and the dietary behavior may be taken into account) and adequate inference methods for the latter in a joint work with P. Bertail and J. Tressou. This line of research is still going on and will hopefully provide practical insight and guidance for <b>dietary</b> <b>contamination</b> control in public health practice. It is also briefly presented in this last part. Besides, I have the great opportunity to work currently on the modelling of the AIDS epidemic with H. de Arazoza, B. Auvert, P. Bertail, R. Lounes and C. Tran based on the cuban epidemic data available, which form one of the most informed database on any HIV epidemic. While such a research project (taking place in the framework of the ACI-NIM "Epidemic Modelling") aims at providing a numerical model (for computing incidence predictions on short horizons for instance, so as to plan the quantity of antiretrovirals required), it also poses very challenging probabilistic and statistical problems, ranging from the proof for the existence of a quasi-stationary distribution describing the long term behavior of the epidemic to the diculties encountered due to the incomplete character of the epidemic data available. Unfortunately, they are not discussed here, presenting the wide variety of mathematical problems arising in this project without denaturing it would have deserved a whole report. Ce rapport présente brièvement l'essentiel de mon activité de recherche depuis ma thèse de doctorat [53], laquelle visait principalement à étendre l'utilisation des progrès récents de l'Analyse Harmonique Algorithmique pour l'estimation non paramétrique adaptative dans le cadre d'observations i. i. d. (tels que l'analyse par ondelettes) à l'estimation statistique pour des données markoviennes. Ainsi qu'il est éxpliqué dans [123], des résultats relatifs aux propriétés de concentration de la mesure (i. e. des inégalités de probabilité et de moments sur certaines classes fonctionnelles, adaptées à l'approximation non linéaire) sont indispensables pour exploiter ces outils d'analyse dans un cadre probabiliste et obtenir des procédures d'estimation statistique dont les vitesses de convergence surpassent celles de méthodes antérieures. Dans [53] (voir également [54], [55] et [56]), une méthode d'analyse fondée sur le renouvellement, la méthode dite 'régénérative' (voir [185]), consistant à diviser les trajectoires d'une chaîne de Markov Harris récurrente en segments asymptotiquement i. i. d., a été largement utilisée pour établir les résultats probabilistes requis, le comportement à long terme des processus markoviens étant régi par des processus de renouvellement (définissant de façon aléatoire les segments de la trajectoire). Une fois l'estimateur construit, il importe alors de pouvoir quantifier l'incertitude inhérente à l'estimation fournie (mesurée par des quantiles spécifiques, la variance ou certaines fonctionnelles appropriées de la distribution de la statistique considérée). A cet égard et au delà de l'extrême simplicité de sa mise en oeuvre (puisqu'il s'agit simplement d'eectuer des tirages i. i. d. dans l'échantillon de départ et recalculer la statistique sur le nouvel échantillon, l'échantillon bootstrap), le bootstrap possède des avantages théoriques majeurs sur l'approximation asymptotique gaussienne (la distribution bootstrap approche automatiquement la structure du second ordre dans le développement d'Edegworth de la distribution de la statistique). Il m'est apparu naturel de considérer le problème de l'extension de la procédure traditionnelle de bootstrap aux données markoviennes. Au travers des travaux réalisés en collaboration avec Patrice Bertail, la méthode régénérative s'est avérée non seulement être un outil d'analyse puissant pour établir des théorèmes limites ou des inégalités, mais aussi pouvoir fournir des méthodes pratiques pour l'estimation statistique: la généralisation du bootstrap proposée consiste à ré-échantillonner un nombre aléatoire de segments de données régénératifs (ou d'approximations de ces derniers) de manière à imiter la structure de renouvellement sous-jacente aux données. Cette approche s'est révélée également pertinente pour de nombreux autres problèmes statistiques. Ainsi la première partie du rapport vise essentiellement à présenter le principe des méthodes statistiques fondées sur le renouvellement pour des chaînes de Markov Harris. La seconde partie du rapport est consacrée à la construction et à l'étude de méthodes statistiques pour apprendre à ordonner des objets, et non plus seulement à les classer (i. e. leur aecter un label), dans un cadre supervisé. Ce problème difficile est d'une importance cruciale dans de nombreux domaines d' application, allant de l'élaboration d'indicateurs pour le diagnostic médical à la recherche d'information (moteurs de recherche) et pose d'ambitieuses questions théoriques et algorithmiques, lesquelles ne sont pas encore résolues de manière satisfaisante. Une approche envisageable consiste à se ramener à la classification de paires d'observations, ainsi que le suggère un critère largement utilisé dans les applications mentionnées ci-dessus (le critère AUC) pour évaluer la pertinence d'un ordre. Dans un travail mené en collaboration avec Gabor Lugosi et Nicolas Vayatis, plusieurs résultats ont été obtenus dans cette direction, requérant l'étude de U-processus: l'aspect novateur du problème résidant dans le fait que l'estimateur naturel du risque a ici la forme d'une U-statistique. Toutefois, dans de nombreuses applications telles que la recherche d'information, seul l'ordre relatif aux objets les plus pertinents importe véritablement et la recherche de critères correspondant à de tels problèmes (dits d'ordre localisé) et d'algorithmes permettant de construire des règles pour obtenir des 'rangements' optimaux à l'égard de ces derniers constitue un enjeu crucial dans ce domaine. Plusieurs développements en ce sens ont été réalisés dans une série de travaux (se poursuivant encore actuellement) en collaboration avec Nicolas Vayatis. Enfin, la troisième partie du rapport reflète mon intérêt pour les applications des concepts probabilistes et des méthodes statistiques. Du fait de ma formation initiale, j'ai été naturellement conduit à considérer tout d'abord des applications en finance. Et bien que les approches historiques ne suscitent généralement pas d'engouement dans ce domaine, j'ai pu me convaincre progressivement du rôle important que pouvaient jouer les méthodes statistiques non paramétriques pour analyser les données massives (de très grande dimension et de caractère 'haute fréquence') disponibles en finance afin de détecter des structures cachées et en tirer partie pour l'évaluation du risque de marché ou la gestion de portefeuille par exemple. Ce point de vue est illustré par la brève présentation des travaux menés en ce sens en collaboration avec Skander Slim dans cette troisième partie. Ces dernières années, j'ai eu l'opportunité de pouvoir rencontrer des mathématiciens appliqués et des scientifiques travaillant dans d'autres domaines, pouvant également bénéficier des avancées de la modélisation probabiliste et des méthodes statistiques. J'ai pu ainsi aborder des applications relatives à la toxicologie, plus précisément au problème de l'évaluation des risque de contamination par voie alimentaire, lors de mon année de délégation auprès de l'Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique au sein de l'unité Metarisk, unité pluridisciplinaire entièrement consacrée à l'analyse du risque alimentaire. J'ai pu par exemple utiliser mes compétences dans le domaine de la modélisation maarkovienne afin de proposer un modèle stochastique décrivant l'évolution temporelle de la quantité de contaminant présente dans l'organisme (de manère à prendre en compte à la fois le phénomène d'accumulation du aux ingestions successives et la pharmacocinétique propre au contaminant régissant le processus d'élimination) et des méthodes d'inférence statistique adéquates lors de travaux en collaboration avec Patrice Bertail et Jessica Tressou. Cette direction de recherche se poursuit actuellement et l'on peut espérer qu'elle permette à terme de fonder des recommandations dans le domaine de la santé publique. Par ailleurs, j'ai la chance de pouvoir travailler actuellement avec Hector de Arazoza, Bertran Auvert, Patrice Bertail, Rachid Lounes et Viet-Chi Tran sur la modélisation stochastique de l'épidémie du virus VIH à partir des données épidémiologiques recensées sur la population de Cuba, lesquelles constituent l'une des bases de données les mieux renseignées sur l'évolution d'une épidémie de ce type. Et bien que ce projet vise essentiellement à obtenir un modèle numérique (permettant d'effectuer des prévisions quant à l'incidence de l'épidémie à court terme, de manière à pouvoir planifier la fabrication de la quantité d'anti-rétroviraux nécéssaire par exemple), il nous a conduit à aborder des questions théoriques ambitieuses, allant de l'existence d'une mesure quasi-stationnaire décrivant l'évolution à long terme de l'épidémie aux problèmes relatifs au caractère incomplet des données épidémiologiques disponibles. Il m'est malheureusement impossible d'évoquer ces questions ici sans risquer de les dénaturer, la présentation des problèmes mathématiques rencontrés dans ce projet mériterait à elle seule un rapport entier...|$|E
40|$|A 24 -week feeding {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess whether males and females of Oreochromis niloticus exhibit differences in their hematological responses and organosomatic indices to <b>dietary</b> AFB 1 <b>contamination.</b> Triplicate groups of O. niloticus (initial body weight: 24. 1 ± 0. 6 [*]g) were fed with four diets (Diets 1 to 4) containing 0, 20, 200, and 2, 000 [*]μg AFB 1 kg− 1. A significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBC), and hematocrit (Hct) was observed in AFB 1 exposure groups, with the lowest levels recorded in the 2000 [*]μg AFB 1 kg− 1 treatment. A significant increase in mean white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, and lymphocytes was observed in AFB 1 exposure groups. No sex-related differences in RBC, WBC, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils levels were observed. However, hemoglobin and hematocrit values for female O. niloticus were significantly lower than those for male O. niloticus. Organosomatic indices showed that the relative liver, kidney, and spleen weights were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in the AFB 1 supplemented group than in the control group. However, the effect of aflatoxin on organosomatic indices {{does not depend on}} sex but rather depends on the dose of aflatoxin in the diet. These results provide useful information for monitoring changes in the health status of male and female O. niloticus...|$|R
30|$|Studies in {{a number}} of European {{countries}} (Netherlands, Hungary, Germany, Sweden, and Italy) show that the average aluminum dietary uptake per adult (not including job-related exposure) is between 1.6 and 13  mg per day. This amount corresponds to an exposure of 0.16 to 1.3  mg/kg body weight per week for an adult weighing 70  kg [1, 4] which is equivalent to 16 – 130 % of the TWI. It must be noted, however, that there are large differences in the average contamination between individual countries, and it is not always evident in the various studies whether or not drinking water was included in the calculations. A large variation in individual exposure certainly can be expected as a result of differences in environment, soil <b>contamination,</b> <b>dietary</b> habits, or the consumption of foods with additives that contain aluminum [1, 4]. Children consume more nourishment per body weight than adults and therefore represent the group with the highest potential for exposure to aluminum per kilogram body weight [1, 4]. Studies in France show that the estimated exposure for children between 3 and 15  years amounts to 0.7  mg/kg BW/week (corresponding to 70 % of the TWI), and for infants and toddlers between 1.5 and 4.5  years the exposure is 23  mg/kg BW/week (corresponding to 230 % TWI). In the UK, studies show that the value is 1.7  mg/kg BW/week for children in the age group of 4 – 18  years (corresponding to 170 % TWI).|$|R
40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion describes {{the influence of}} genetic parameters that have affected the welfare of commercial broilers. There {{is a lack of}} robust scientific data for Europe on welfare outcome indicators and these should be recorded independently and made publicly available. The major welfare concerns that have a genetic basis and that may interact with management factors to lead to poor welfare include skeletal disorders, contact dermatitis, ascites and sudden death syndrome. Most of these are linked with fast growth rates. There are also numerous interactions between the environment and the genetic traits that can seriously adversely affect welfare in areas such as lighting regimes, litter management, <b>dietary</b> deficiencies and <b>contamination,</b> air quality and temperature. In the risk assessment the probability of exposure to a hazard, and the magnitude of the poor welfare effects (consequences) of that exposure were estimated. The major risk scores were unbalanced body conformation, high stocking density, fast growth rate, low light intensity and wet litter. The top ranking environmental hazards were high stocking density, low light intensity and wet litter. It was recognised by the experts that probabilities vary from region to region, country to country and among different types of farming system. Recommendations include better data collection in Europe, greater selection strategies for improved welfare traits with birds being selected and tested for their subsequent rearing and production environments by the breeders. Finally, a high priority should be given to decreasing the proportion of birds with the higher gait scores, and to include contact dermatitis and other welfare traits in the selection schemes...|$|R
40|$|What impact does dietary {{exposure}} to aflatoxins has on hepatocellular carcinoma in India? Assessing {{the connection between}} aflatoxin contamination in the diets, Hepatitis B virus infection and liver cirrhosis through Hospital based study in Andhra Pradesh, India Chronic exposure to aflatoxins was shown to cause impaired growth in children, immune suppression and liver cirrhosis, interference in micronutrient metabolism and reduced human and animal productivity. Acute severe intoxication can result in death. Most importantly, aflatoxin was shown to interact synergistically with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) / Hepatitis C virus infection. It {{increases the risk of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), {{one of the most common}} cancers in the developing countries with > 400, 000 new cases per annum. A joint FAO and WHO committee concluded that reduced intake of aflatoxins in HBV endemic places will have a greater impact on reducing the incidence of HCC. This requires knowledge on the level of aflatoxin exposure in populations, <b>dietary</b> sources of <b>contamination</b> and household <b>dietary</b> practices leading to frequent food contamination in order to identify high risk groups and to develop preventive interventions to mitigate human exposure to aflatoxins. Aflatoxins in human body are metabolized by the liver enzymes and produces aflatoxin 8, 9 -epoxide, which reacts with albumin in the liver to form AFB 1 -albumin adducts that are major biomarkers found in peripheral blood. In order to protect human health it is important to be able to estimate aflatoxin-albumin adduct in human blood. Among many methods available for estimation immunochemical methods are simple, cost effective and adaptable to situations in developing countries. Hence this study is proposed to assess the aflatoxin exposure in Indian populations using ELISA which will lead to the development of preventive interventions to minimize the risk of liver disorders and HCC. This thesis is divided into 9 chapters containing subsections. Chapter 1 and chapter 2 contains the introduction and review of literature. Chapter 3 contains materials and methods for the development of antibodies to detect aflatoxin-albumin adduct in human blood samples. Chapter 4 contains Results. Chapter 5 and 6 contains discussion, summary and conclusion. Chapter 7 contains references, Chapter 8 contains appendix and Chapter 9 contains Annexure I, II and Master charts...|$|R
