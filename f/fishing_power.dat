But since the latter cannot be measured directly, a relative <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> of a vessel has been defined as the ratio of the catch per unit fishing time of the vessel to that of another fishing vessel taken as standard when both are fishing on the same ground and the same density of fish.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fishing vessels {{differ in}} fishing power—that is, in the {{quantity}} of fish they would catch per unit time if they were fishing {{at the same time}} and location—and there is a general trend of increasing <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> over time. Typically, <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> studies are limited to comparisons over 1 – 2 decades, but here I attempt to quantify this trend for English North Sea trawlers over the past 120 years. A review of fishing history shows how sailing trawlers, steam trawlers, and currently both motor otter trawlers and twin-beam trawlers have in turn dominated the trawl fisheries. A huge, overall increase in <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> has occurred but the trend has been all but linear: <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> has sometimes “leapt ” forward within a few years, but at times has also stagnated for decades. Compared with historical sailing trawlers, motor otter trawlers around the Millennium are estimated to have 50 times higher cod <b>fishing</b> <b>power,</b> and twin-beam trawlers to have 100 times higher plaice <b>fishing</b> <b>power.</b> However, this does not mean that fisheries have become more profitable, because increases in catch rates have lagged far behind those in <b>fishing</b> <b>power,</b> and everything points in the direction of great overcapacity of the current international North Sea trawling fleet...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>power,</b> which {{expresses the}} {{efficiency}} by which vessels {{have the potential}} to catch fish, has changed dramatically over the past decades to centuries. In historical ecology, two important reasons for studying <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> change include: (1) understanding change in the capacity (or overcapacity) of fishing fleets and their potential to exploit (or overexploit) fish stocks; and (2) interpreting catch-per-unit effort data over longer time-scales, especially if these are to be used as abundance proxies for marine populations. This chapter defines fishing power; summarises earlier work on the dynamics of North Sea trawling fleets; reviews available methods for analysing <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> change; and discusses some of the limitations and assumptions when analysing <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> data. More research on <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> dynamics is encouraged: this is expected to improve our understanding of the historical, environmental footprint of fisheries, as well as the long-term dynamics of our marine living resources and the fishing fleets that depend on these...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> concepts leads to a distinction between local <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> (at a given location). and overall <b>fishing</b> <b>power.</b> Overall <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> {{takes into account the}} ability to detect and quickly exploit rich areas. In order to estimate local <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> it is necessary t o compare the catches of different ships operating in neighbouring areas. Such a comparison performed on two ships will give an estimate of their relative fishing powers. The closer the two ships are, the more reliable will be the estimate. A weighting function must be used, and this function is related to the spatial heterogeneity of the fish density. Such a function is provided by the variogram as defined by Matheron (1965). -Overall fishing powers can be estimated using Robson's method (1966) where no division into spatial blocks is made: the fact that a ship is in a rich or a poor area must be related to the strategic component of its overall <b>fishing</b> <b>power.</b> A comparison between local and overall fishing powers may give a good insight of the strategic activity of the fishing fleet.

Linear mixed models {{were used to}} {{quantify}} <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> trends and study the effect of missing data encountered when relying on commercial logbooks. For this, Australian eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) harvests were analysed with historical (from vessel surveys) and current (from commercial logbooks) vessel data.

However, if gaps in vessel information had not originated randomly and skippers from the most efficient vessels were the most diligent at filling in logbooks, considerable errors would be introduced. Also, the buffering effect of complete years would be short lived as years with missing data accumulate.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} catch, trap <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> and reef fish trappability {{were investigated}} by experimental fishing with Antillean fish traps on west coast fringing reefs in Barbados. Commercial (small mesh) traps caught significantly more fish (by number and weight), caught significantly smaller fish, {{and caught a}} higher proportion of immature fish, than large mesh traps. <b>Fishing</b> <b>power</b> was significantly higher for commercial traps than for large mesh traps. These catch differences between trap types have serious implications for the management of the reef fish resource by the imposition of larger mesh sizes in the commercial fishery. The squeezability hypothesis and the visual image hypothesis were investigated as explanations for the lower <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> of large mesh traps. The lower <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> of large mesh traps results primarily from lower catch rates of fish in the 5. 5 - 6. 0 cm body depth size class. This result is strong support for the squeezability hypothesis as an explanation for the lower <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> of large mesh traps. Differences in the visual images of traps created by structural differences and biotic differences did not produce definitive differences in ingress rates to traps, suggesting that the visual image hypothesis is an inadequate explanation for the lower <b>fishing</b> <b>power</b> of large mesh traps. The trappability of reef fish differed substantially between species, but trappability differences were not correlated with species mobility, activity of the species in traps, gregariousness, or capacity of the species to squeeze through meshes. Predator-prey effects on trappability were negligible, but trappability was negatively correlated with percent reef cover of the substratum and with substratum rugosity. This suggests that traps are more attractive to fishes in areas where natural structural complexity is lower. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
