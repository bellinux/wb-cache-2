As of 2010, it sails under its original name, which is still transliterated into Latin alphabet from Russian, rather than Ukrainian language (cf. Vereshchahyn mentioned in the BBC article). In the 1990s Vereshchagino abandoned fishing business and switched to shipping small general cargoes from Turkey to Ukrainian ports. Independent Ukrainian media alleged that the owners of Vereshchagino are running a smuggling operation; Sarata, another ship of the same company, was involved in large-scale smuggling of ephedrine.|$|E

The Queensland Meat and Export Agency Company applied for funds to duplicate and upgrade both the Townsville and Eagle Farms works. The agents for Linde British Refrigeration, J Wildridge and Sinclair Ltd, were contracted to undertake the extension projects. The £30,000 extension at Ross River doubled the <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The four new store rooms could hold 200 tons each and the chilling room could hold 120 bullocks. Other additions included new engine and boiler houses, a fresh water reservoir and pumping station and additional slaughtering yards and pens. By the time the extensions were completed in April 1895, the meatworks {{was reported to have}} processed 50,000 head of cattle and 13,000 sheep since opening. An international study of the frozen meat trade, published in 1912, stated that the Townsville works of QME&A was the most up to date freezing works in existence in either hemisphere. It also had the largest capacity of any meatworks in Australasia at this time.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, an {{experimental}} work was investigated on nanorefrigerant. Nano Al 2 O 3 -PAG oil {{was used as}} nano-refrigerant in R 134 a vapour compression refrigeration system. An experimental setup was designed and fabricated in the lab. The system performance was investigated using energy consumption test and <b>freeze</b> <b>capacity</b> test. The results indicate that Al 2 O 3 nano refrigerant works normally and safely in the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system performance was better than pure lubricant with R 134 a working fluid with 10. 32 % less energy used with 0. 2 %V of the concentration used. The results indicate that heat transfer coefficient increases with the usage of nano Al 2 O 3. Thus using Al 2 O 3 nanorefrigerant in refrigeration system {{is found to be}} feasible. Evaporator is of coil type which is loaded with water. Service ports are provided at the inlet of expansion device and compressor for charging the refrigerant. The mass flow rate is measured with the help of flow meter fitted in the line between expansion device and drier unit. The experimental setup was placed on a platform in a constant room temperature.

This study analyses the potential of cold thermal energy storage (CTES) applying an indirect carbon dioxide system to reduce the electrical power needed by the freezing plant and to minimize the part load operation of the main compressor unit. Theoretical aspects are explained, a system concept is presented and industrial applications are discussed. As an example from the fish industry, a tunnel freezer is applied as a base case for the modelling, it freezes 30 t fish per day. A cascade process of ammonia and a carbon dioxide (CO 2) cycle is calculated for a 24 hours period.

40|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus was build {{according to}} the national standards of India [...] The performance of the refrigeration system depends upon the heat transfer capacity of the refrigerant. Normally R 12, R 22, R 600, R 600 a and 134 a are used as a refrigerant. This refrigerant heat transfer capacity is not so good and increase power consumption. Due to these limitation nanofluids are enhanced with the normal lubricant and increases the heat transfer capacity and reduces the power consumption. Aluminium oxide nanofluid is used for enhancing the heat transfer capacity of the refrigerant in the refrigeration System. In this experiment heat transfer enhancement was investigated numerically on the surface of a refrigerator by using Al 2 O 3 nano-refrigerants, where nanofluids could be a significant factor in maintaining the surface temperature within a required range. The addition of nanoparticles to the refrigerant results in improvements in the thermophysical properties and heat transfer characteristics of the refrigerant, thereby improving the performance of the refrigeration system. Stable nanolubricant has been prepared for the study. The experimental studies indicate that the refrigeration system with nano-refrigerant works normally. It is found that the <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity</b> is higher and the power consumption reduces by 11. 5 % when POE oil is replaced by a mixture of mineral oil and Aluminium oxide nanoparticles.

40|$|The lizard Lacerta vivipara has {{allopatric}} oviparous and viviparous populations. The cold hardiness {{strategy of}} L. vivipara {{has previously been}} studied in viviparous populations, but never in oviparous ones. The present study reveals that both the oviparous and viviparous individuals of this species are able {{to survive in a}} supercooled state at - 3 degrees C for at least one week when kept on dry substrates. The mean crystallisation temperatures of the body, around - 4 degrees C on dry substrata and - 2 degrees C on wet substrata, do not differ between oviparous and viviparous individuals. All the individuals are able to tolerate up to 48 - 50 % of their body fluid converted into ice, but only viviparous individuals were able to stabilize their body ice content at 48 %, and hence were able to survive even when frozen at - 3 degrees C for times of up 24 hours. Ice contents higher than 51 % have been constantly found lethal for oviparous individuals. This suggests that, in L. vivipara, the evolution towards a higher degree of freezing tolerance could parallel the evolution of the viviparous reproductive mode, a feature believed to be strongly selected under cold climatic conditions.

40|$|Background: Intralesional (IL) {{cryotherapy}} is a {{new technique}} {{for the treatment of}} keloid scars, in which the scar is frozen from inside. Two cryodevices are available, which were recently evaluated. Both devices showed promising results, but differed in clinical outcome. To explain these differences, more understanding of the working mechanism of both devices is required. Objective: This experimental study was designed to investigate and compare the thermal behavior of an argon gas- and a liquid nitrogen-based device. Thermal behavior constitutes: (1) minimum tissue temperature (°C), (2) the freezing rate (°C/min). The thermal behavior was measured inside and on the outer surface of the scar. Both devices were tested ex vivo and in vivo. Results: Ex vivo, when determining the maximum <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity,</b> the argon gas device showed a higher end temperature compared to the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 120. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 140. °C) and a faster freezing rate (argon gas: - 1300. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 145. °C/min). In vivo, measured inside the keloid, the argon gas device showed a lower end temperature than the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 36. 4. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 8. 1. °C) and a faster freezing rate (argon gas: - 14. 7. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 5. °C/min). The outer surface of the scar reached temperatures below - 20. °C with both devices as measured with the thermal camera. Conclusion: In conclusion, the argon gas device displayed a lower end temperature and a faster freezing rate in vivo compared to the liquid nitrogen device. Although this resulted in lower recurrence rates for the argon gas device, more hypopigmentation was seen compared to the liquid nitrogen device following treatment. Finally, the low outer surface temperatures measured with both devices, suggest that some hypopigmentation following treatment is inevitable...|$|E
40|$|Egyptian {{fish farming}} has {{witnessed}} a spectacular development {{resulting in an}} industry that is number 7 worldwide and number two in tilapia production. As such the industry is an important contributor to Egypt’s economy as well as a major provider of cheap fish protein. However, {{there are a number of}} developments that potentially could result in a stagnation or even collapse of the industry. Some important issues are: • Low fish prices and increasing fish production costs resulting in eroding profitability of farms and thus no investment in technology development and innovation. • Lack of processing and <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity</b> which results in an inability to access new export markets • Low priority of government, lack of legislation and harmonisation of legislation, no operational extension service, weak professional organisations and weak linkage between research and industry • Rather traditional farming technology (tilapia) including use of low quality feeds and wild fry (marine aquaculture). The IMARES/Wageningen UR study 1 illustrated that within the currently available land and water resources, Egypt can potentially increase its total tilapia production from 700, 000 tonnes to 1, 400, 000 tonnes, resulting in an increase in the economic value of the sector to over 1 % of the current GDP. In order to realize this potential, the first requirement is to increase the current farm profitability. When this is realized, capital will become available that allow farmers to invest into new production technologies, market innovations and new organisational structures, that will than result in more fish and new markets.

40|$|Background: Intralesional (IL) {{cryotherapy}} {{is a new}} promising {{technique for}} the treatment of keloid scars, in which the scar is frozen from inside. Multiple devices are available, mostly based on a simple liquid nitrogen Dewar system, which have a limited <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Argon gas-based systems ensure accurate and highly controlled freezing and have shown to be effective within the field of oncologic surgery. However, this technique has never been used {{for the treatment of}} keloid scars. Objective: This prospective study evaluates an argon gas-based system for the treatment of keloids in a patient population including all Fitzpatrick skin types with a 1 -year follow-up. Methods: Twenty-five patients with 30 keloid scars were included and treated with a device called Seednet (Galil Medical, Yokneam, Israel). Scar quality and possible scar recurrence were assessed before treatment and post treatment (6 and 12 months) with objective devices determining scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume, and patient's skin type. In addition, scars were evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Results: After 12 months, a significant volume reduction of 62 % was obtained, p Z 0. 05. Moreover, complaints of pain and itching were alleviated and scar quality had improved according to the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Scar pigmentation recovered in 62 % of all keloid scars within 12 months. Five out of 30 (17 %) scars recurred within 12 months, three of which had previously been treated with liquid nitrogen-based IL cryotherapy. Both recurrent and persistent hypopigmentation were mainly seen in Afro-American patients. Conclusions: IL cryotherapy with the use of an argon gas-based system proves to be effective in the treatment of keloid scars, yielding volume reduction and low recurrence rates. Although hypopigmentation recovered in most cases, it is strongly related to non-Caucasian patients. Finally, additional treatment of keloid scars previously unresponsive to IL cryotherapy is predisposed to a high recurrence rate. Trial number: NCT 02063243. Crow...|$|E
40|$|Winter injury of cool-season turfgrasses in {{northern}} climates {{is a significant}} issue, leading to losses in turf cover and subsequent increased inputs for recovery. Despite the different potential causes for winter injury, the overall level of plant freezing tolerance {{has been shown to}} account for a majority of the variation in winter survival of grasses. Freezing tolerance is achieved through cold acclimation, based on a series of physiological and biochemical changes that increase cell stability at freezing temperatures. Winter injury can result from insufficient cold acclimation, or rapid cold deacclimation triggered by temperature fluctuations or freeze-thaw cycles. Previous research has been mostly conducted to investigate the mechanisms associated with cold acclimation, limited research was applied to deacclimation resistance. In order to enhance winter survival, and reduce turf losses and recovery costs, {{a better understanding of the}} underlying factors associated with cold acclimation and deacclimation is necessary. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis research are to: (1) evaluate the carbon metabolism factors attributing to different <b>freezing</b> tolerance <b>capacity</b> associated with cold acclimation and deacclimation of annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass; (2) investigate the differences in hormone regulation of annual bluegrass and creeping bentgrass during cold acclimation and deacclimation; and (3) identify physiological changes in response to cold acclimation and deacclimation among perennial ryegrass genotypes contrasting in freezing tolerance. Overall, our research found that the fast up-regulation of carbon metabolism activities (chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis, respiration) during deacclimation was associated with losses in freezing tolerance. In addition, changes in hormone content, such as abscisic acid, auxin, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, at both leaf and crown level, contributed to differences in deacclimation resistance. Lastly, increased crown moisture content during deacclimation was also found to be responsible for the losses in freezing tolerance. Although these factors may aid in a faster recovery in response to temperature increases during late winter and early spring, these physiological changes may also make the plants more susceptible to freezing injuries if plants are once again exposed to freezing temperatures...|$|R

This investigation characterized freezing tolerance and protein expression of `Frontenac 2 ̆ 7 and `Seyval blanc 2 ̆ 7 grape cane tissues during the overwintering periods of autumnal cold acclimation, midwinter, and vernal deacclimation including dehydrin proteins that may be used to describe cultivar freezing tolerance. Controlled, laboratory freezing tests were conducted with field acclimated or deacclimated bark and xylem tissues from grape canes. SDS-PAGE profiles and immunoblots for dehydrins were used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess protein expression. `Frontenac 2 ̆ 7 bark tissues demonstrated a capacity to achieve greater freezing tolerance than xylem tissue in late acclimation and midwinter, which may have contributed to greater overall freezing tolerance during midwinter. On the other hand, `Seyval blanc 2 ̆ 7 showed a greater capacity for reacclimation after a freezing event during the observed deacclimation period. SDS-PAGE profiles showed a 36 -kDa protein expressed during the lowest air temperatures and when the lowest LT 50 values for `Frontenac 2 ̆ 7 tissues were observed, both occurring during the midwinter period. SDS-PAGE profiles showed a 36 -kDa protein expressed during the lowest air temperatures and when the lowest LT 50 values for `Frontenac 2 ̆ 7 tissues were observed.

40|$|Shipping, {{fishing and}} {{exploration}} activities in Arctic waters are endangered by ice accretion on critical structures causing various safety risks. Ulmatec Pyro {{have developed an}} anti-icing/de-icing system using waste heat circulation in a double pipe system, for hand railings, helicopter decks and stairway applications. The research objectives of this master thesis was to support Ulmatec Pyro in the design process, using theoretical models for design optimization, and to develop experimental facilities to verify their designs to meet the IMO Polar Code for ships operating in Arctic areas. The {{first part of the}} project investigated relevant literature and research on icing mechanisms and de-icing technologies. Atmospheric icing is a known problem for mobile units such as airplanes. However, marine icing is more complex since it involves saline water. Further, the marine icing process is more unpredictable with a periodic behavior caused by the weather conditions. Two different numerical models are developed, based on previous icing studies and combined with basic thermo- and fluid- dynamics. First, a simple 1 -dimensional steady state anti-icing model was developed using finite difference method (FDM) and lumped capacitance method (LCM). This model programmed in MATLAB code, is made for a given symmetrical double pipe geometry, and shows good correlations with experimental tests. The second model is made in COMSOL Multiphysics, where 2 -dimensional axisymmetric geometry is used. This model is able to handle transient as well as steady state conditions. The purpose of this model was to simulate de-icing processes. Comparing the steady state results, the CFD model and the simple 1 D model shows good correlations. The transient de-icing simulations results give good results within the assumptions that the water is entrapped in the ice. However, the de-icing experiments show that this model must be modified to give more realistic ice-melting behavior. These modifications include water draining giving insulation air layers between ice and pipe surface, and further include saline ice models. An experimental setup was designed and built for validating theoretical models, and further as a design verification lab for Ulmatec Pyro. The test lab was built inside a commercial freezing container, which turned out to have insufficient <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity</b> for the extreme Polar test conditions. Despite of these limitations, a series of experiments were conducted, providing valuable insight in the icing- and anti-icing processes. The experiments also showed that double pipes gave a more uniform surface temperature than a single pipe, and that it is favorable with a higher flow velocity in the annulus between the inner and outer pipe. The experiments confirm that the double pipe technology is giving a more uniform surface temperature along the pipe compared to a single pipe. Hence, a more efficient use of waterborne heat. The experiments also provided good validation of the theoretical simulation models within the available test conditions. De-icing tests also showed the complexity of the ice melting process. Hence, it gave {{a better understanding of the}} de-icing process and that more complex simulation models are needed. The experiments also provided valuable experience and information needed to upgrade the test rig for further testing with more extreme Polar conditions...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{is one of}} Norway’s main exports, and can {{be shipped}} fresh, frozen or dried. This thesis {{examines}} the freezing of fish in batch tunnels and ways to increase the energy efficiency of this process. A fish freezing plant {{on the west coast}} of Norway was used as a baseline case and measurements were made of the freezing system. Different aspects of this system were simulated, mainly using MATLAB. The focus was on the compressors and the freezing tunnels of an industrial refrigeration system. The compressors and the freezing tunnel fans are the largest consumers of electricity, but they are often not operated at the highest efficiency. An analysis of the compressor operation showed that it was far from optimal, with several compressors often operating at part-load simultaneously. These were screw compressors regulated by slide valves, which provide easy capacity control, but also have low energy efficiency. The refrigeration system had several different sized compressors, and the results showed {{that it was possible to}} run the system with only one compressor at part-load operation. The total coefficient of performance was improved by as much as 29 % for a low production period. A further analysis showed that installing a variable speed drive on one compressor would also improve energy efficiency and make capacity regulation straightforward. The freezing system included five batch freezing tunnels, each of which had a <b>freezing</b> <b>capacity</b> of more than 100 tonnes of pelagic fish. A typical freezing period lasted typically 20 h and decreased the fish temperature to - 18 ◦C or below. The main task was to develop a computer program that could simulate the freezing process and the refrigeration system and locate opportunities for improvement. The air velocities inside the freezing tunnel varied with location, which were pinpointed using the computational fluid dynamics software program Airpak. These velocities were used in freezing time calculations. It was shown that a guide blade installed in the air flow at a critical location improved the air velocity distribution compared with no guide blade. Without the guide blade, the freezing times of the products were between 16 h and 32 h, but with a guide blade they were between 17 h and 21 h, a span of only 4 h. These freezing times were calculated with a modified Plank’s equation. A numerical model was programmed in MATLAB and it was used to simulate the temperatures of the products. The model was a two-dimensional finite difference approximation of the heat conduction equation. The simulation results were compared to measured temperatures, to validate the model. The measured temperatures were also used for validation of another simulation program, programmed in Modelica. The final stage of this research involved testing different alternatives for reduced fan operation. The program for the product model was extended with models for calculating the energy consumption of the air fans and the compressors and using Airpak-simulated velocities. The air fan speed was reduced to 83 %, 67 %, 50 % and 33 % of full air fan speed. This was tested at 5 different points during the freezing period, to see how the freezing times were affected. Full air speed during the freezing period resulted in a total freezing time of 20 h. A reduction in air fan speed to 33 % after 8 h resulted in an increase in total freezing time of 10 hours (47 % longer) but reduced energy consumption to 73. 8 % of the baseline case. An alternative with only 4 h longer freezing time resulted in an energy consumption of 80. 5 % of the baseline case. It was assumed that the fans had variable speed drives. The effect of reduced air inlet temperature was also tested and the results show that this can reduce freezing times. The effect on the total energy consumption was not large and also depends on the rest of the refrigeration system. Issues raised by this thesis are relevant for future research. It is suggested that the main simulation program is expanded by incorporating more detailed models of the refrigeration system. Dynamic operation of the air fans is also a possibility, for example to gradually reduce fan speed with decreasing product heat load.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Solanum species {{differ in}} their degree of frost {{tolerance}} and cold acclimation capacity. Cultivated potato species of Solanum tuberosum L. are frost-sensitive, incapable of cold acclimation, and have a maximum freezing tolerance of – 3 °C. Solanum commersonii Dun is frost-tolerant and can survive to – 5 ºC pre-acclimation and – 10 ºC post-acclimation. Breeding attempts to improve potato freezing tolerance and cold acclimation capacity have been largely unsuccessful in S. tuberosum. Arabidopsis CBF genes encode cold-induced transcription factors {{that are involved in}} plant cold acclimation. In this study, S. tuberosum (cv. Umatilla) and S. commersonii (PI 243503 clone 13), were transformed with three Arabidopsis CBF genes (AtCBF 1 - 3) driven by either the constitutive 35 S or stress-inducible rd 29 A promoter to assess the role CBFs play in, and their effects on, potato freezing tolerance and cold acclimation capacity. Constitutive AtCBF 1 and AtCBF 3 overexpression increased freezing tolerance in S. tuberosum by 2 °C, and in S. commersonii by 4 °C, while AtCBF 2 failed to increase freezing tolerance. Cold acclimation capacity was improved for S. commersonii, but was absent from S. tuberosum. During cold treatment, leaves of wildtype S. commersonii, but not S. tuberosum, showed a significant thickening due to palisade cell lengthening and enlargement of intercellular spaces. Ectopic AtCBF 1 activity mimicked cold acclimation by increasing proline and total sugar content in S. commersonii in the absence of cold. An increased chlorophyll content of transgenic S. commersonii leaves coincided with an enhanced photosynthetic capacity that was maintained during cold treatment. However, constitutive expression of all three AtCBF genes caused a variety of negative phenotypic alterations, including the reduction or elimination of tuber production, limiting their agronomic potential. The stressinducible rd 29 A::AtCBF transgene versions had identical gains in <b>freezing</b> tolerance <b>capacity</b> while minimizing the negative phenotypic effects and allowing essentially normal tuber production levels. Ectopic AtCBF transgene expression was confirmed to induce expression of cold-regulated genes likely involved in potato frost tolerance under warm conditions. Collectively these results suggest an endogenous CBF pathway is involved in potato frost tolerance and cold acclimation. Cold-inducible overexpression of a CBF transgene may be a practical approach to improving frost tolerance while minimizing detrimental effects on tuber production in potato...|$|R

The structure of this material consists of one dimensional zig-zag chains of orbitally ordered S = 1 / 2 V 4 +. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show an unusual crossover from dominant ferromagnetic (θ = 17 K) to antiferromagnetic (θ = - 70 K) exchange at 120 K, which is attributed to ferromagnetic dimerisation driven by magnetic frustration. The magnetic moment also increases from 1. 81 to 2. 2 μB at the 120 K crossover. Heat capacity measurements confirm this scenario as the magnetic entropy tends towards 1 / 2 Rln 3 below 120 K before approximating to Rln 2 at high temperature. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and high resolution neutron powder diffraction show no bulk structural changes, but the b axis, along which the VO 6 chains run, shows an anomalous expansion below 120 K.

40|$|Optimizing {{cryopreservation}} protocols for nondomestic felids {{contributes to}} the successful development of assisted reproduction techniques and genetic resource banking. In this study, we describe a simple cryopreservation procedure for African lion (Panthera leo) ejaculates, which was tested with different packaging options and different sperm numbers per dose. By applying urethral catheterization and electroejaculation, 17 ejaculates with greater than 20 % motile and greater than 5 % progressively motile sperm were collected. A lyophilized extender (a modified egg yolk-Tes-Tris-fructose-glycerol medium) was rehydrated and added in one step at ambient temperature (∼ 25 °C) to semen, which was prediluted in cell culture medium M 199. After slow cooling of insulated samples to 15 °C in a refrigerator (4 °C), the samples were fast frozen {{over the surface of}} liquid nitrogen or in a dry shipper. Aliquots of 300 μL containing 20 × 106 sperm were frozen in cryovials and in 0. 5 -mL straws. Differences were observed in the total motility after thawing between vial (31. 5 ± 14. 1 %) and straw freezing (20. 1 ± 8. 6 %). However, the subpopulations of vital (22. 7 ± 7. 8 % for vial and 19. 8 ± 8. 5 % for straw) and progressively motile (10. 0 ± 7. 9 % for vial and 10. 0 ± 6. 4 % for straw) sperm after washing and 1 hour incubation at 38 °C were of similar magnitude, velocity, and linearity for both packaging options. After freezing of five ejaculates with 20, 60, and 100 × 106 sperm per dose, best results were achieved at the lowest concentration. In general, post-thaw results were highly variable (2. 2 % and 56. 5 % total motility) and not correlated to motility or morphology of the fresh semen. To further characterize semen quality, we assessed the protective potential of seminal fluid against oxidative stress, which might be challenged on <b>freeze</b> thawing. The <b>capacity</b> of seminal fluid to reduce radicals was measured in 10 semen samples by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and a spin-labeled fatty acid as a radical probe. Moreover, we determined the lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) as potential lipid oxidation products in the sperm and erythrocytes of the males. Individuals with a high radical reduction capacity in the seminal fluid and a low LPC content in their erythrocytes showed a better cryosurvival of sperm. This is a first indication that seminal fluid may affect the freezing potential of African lion ejaculates.

Magnetic properties were investigated by magnetisation, powder neutron diffraction {{and in the case of}} CoV 2 O 6, heat capacity measurements. The structure of these materials consists of linear chains of edge sharing MO 6 octahedra. Monoclinic MnV 2 O 6 is an isotropic antiferromagnet with TN = 20 K and a reduced magnetic coherence length due to 3 % Mn/V antisite disorder. The magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic edge-sharing chains with k = (0, 0, 1 / 2) and a refined Mn moment of 4. 77 (7) μB. The triclinic materials CoV 2 O 6 and NiV 2 O 6 are also antiferromagnetic with TN = 7 and 14 K respectively and both show metamagnetic type transitions. Unusually, M(H) isotherms recorded below 5 K for CoV 2 O 6 show a plateau at 1 / 3 of the saturation magnetisation. This feature, together with a long period modulated magnetic structure, is attributed to strong single ion (Ising) type anisotropy and nearest neighbour ferromagnetic exchange. Preliminary high pressure experiments on NiV 2 O 6 have confirmed a previously reported transition to a columbite phase at 6 GPa and 900 °C. The high pressure polymorph is also antiferromagnetic with TN = 2. 5 K. The previously uncharacterised perovskite, PbRuO 3 has been prepared using high pressure/temperature synthesis techniques (10 GPa, 1000 °C). Synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements show that the room temperature structure is orthorhombic, Pnma. A first order orbital ordering transition occurs at 75 K with an associated metal insulator transition. Below 75 K, the dxz orbitals are preferentially occupied and the structure is orthorhombic Imma. The transition may be driven by an increase in antiferroelectric Pb 2 + displacements, whcih reach a peak at ~ 125 K. A further structural transition to a larger monoclinic cell is also identified at 9. 7 K. The physical properties and crystal structures of two low dimensional lead manganese oxides have also been investigated. Acentric Pb 2 MnO 4, which has a structure consisting of edge sharing chains, is antiferromagnetic with TN = 18 K. Powder neutron diffraction shows the magnetic structure consists of antiferromagnetic chains with k = (0, 0, 0) and a refined Mn moment of 2. 74 (2) μB. The crystal point group allows piezoelectricity and the magnetic point group symmetry allows piezomagnetism. We speculate that coupled magnetic and electric properties may be observed in this material. The layered material, Pb 3 Mn 7 O 15, with a structure consisting of 1 / 2 filled Kagomé layers has also been studied. Single crystals were prepared by a flux growth method and polycrystalline material was prepared by the ceramic method. Powder neutron and synchrotron x-ray diffraction studies show that the single crystals are hexagonal and that the polycrystalline material is orthorhombic. Furthermore, heat capacity measurements show that the hexagonal single crystal material undergoes a glassy magnetic transition. In contrast, powder neutron diffraction shows that the orthorhombic polycrystalline material has coherent long range magnetic order. These differences are attributed to an oxygen deficiency in the polycrystalline magnetic order. These differences are attributed to an oxygen deficiency in the polycrystalline material.
