Following earlier efforts by Beiruti families, the Mohammad Al-Amin Association was created in the 1950s in order to replace the Zawiya with a mosque, {{in the name of the}} Prophet Mohammad, and acquire more land. The project never materialized. It took decades of {{preparation}} to obtain sufficient land adjacent to the old Zawiya to build the new mosque.
