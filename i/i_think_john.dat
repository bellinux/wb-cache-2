2500|$|Gail Simone, {{who worked}} with Byrne on The All New Atom in 2006, {{described}} Byrne as [...] "very opinionated; a lot of artists are opinionated, and I'm okay with that. Actually, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E
6000|$|MAGGIE [scared]. And now, if you'll {{come with}} me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> has {{something}} {{he wants to}} talk over with Lady Sybil. [Recovering and taking him on.] Or would you prefer, John, to say it before us all? ...|$|E

6000|$|And now a widow I must mourn [...] Departed joys that ne'er return; [...] No comfort but {{a hearty}} can [...] When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> on <b>John</b> Highlandman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} of your opinion, Hewlett; and <b>I</b> fully <b>think</b> <b>John</b> {{would be best}} out of the way, poor fellow. I will inquire for a good master for him." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus much I {{could not}} refrain from saying, not that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Bull is very often {{right in his}} controversies with ourselves, but because I think, in this case, he is; and because I believe it far safer, in the long run, for a nation, or an individual, to have justice on his side, than always to carry his point.|$|E
60|$|So I {{decided to}} put John to the test. It had been my habit every morning after he put his coat on {{to go to the}} office to let John have one kiss, just one weeny kiss, to keep him happy all day. So this day when he was getting ready I bent my head over a big bowl of flowers and pretended not to notice. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> must have been hurt, as I heard him steal out on tiptoe.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{did make}} some notes, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> about <b>John</b> Edmunds, did you not?' inquired Mr. Wardle, who {{appeared}} very desirous to draw his friend out, for the edification {{of his new}} visitors.|$|R
6000|$|... "That seems sensible," [...] {{declared}} Patsy, [...] "and we won't lose time {{waiting for}} our own car to follow by freight. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Uncle <b>John,</b> <b>I</b> can be ready by next Tuesday." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Hughes wrote teenage {{characters}} so {{honestly and}} authentically, but something has gotten {{lost in translation}} since then. Today, {{it feels like a}} lot of teenage characters are written very clean or flashy and that just wasn’t my reality growing up in the new millennium. Growing up is messy.|$|E
5000|$|I heard a {{story from}} a guy who {{recorded}} with John in New York, {{and he said that}} John would sometimes get lazy. But then he'd hear a song of mine where he thought, 'Oh, shit, Paul's putting it in, Paul's working!' Apparently 'Coming Up' was the one song that got John recording again. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> just thought, 'Uh oh, I had better get working, too.' I thought that was a nice story.

5000|$|Movieline found Cummins in 2009, still healthy. [...] "It {{was a great}} part", {{she said}} of Laurie Starr. [...] "It was a {{brilliant}} story from a brilliant writer. We {{had a very good}} director and a great cameraman. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Dall and myself were in those days quite well-suited in the parts we had." [...] The film played at the British Film Institute in London in February 2009. At the screening, Cummins viewed the film with an audience {{for the first time in}} six decades.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you were}} settled here, I should feel more comfortable. <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} <b>think,</b> <b>John,</b> {{that if you}} would fix yourself I would give the property up to you altogether and go away with my books into some town. Cambridge, perhaps, would {{do as well as}} any other.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We, also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> cousin <b>John,</b> were agreeably {{struck with}} the same usage in Germany. From feeling a species of {{nervousness}} {{at the sight of}} a cross, I came to love to see it; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you must have undergone a similar change; for I have discovered no less than three among the ornaments of the great window of the entrance tower, at the Wigwam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had thought}} of him.

50|$|Burstall did the {{adaptation}} himself, which was largely {{faithful to the}} play. He felt that the film was weak {{in the first half}} setting up characters. Burstall:I was trying to take the ocker stuff and cross it, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Powers' play was, with anthropology. Before I rehearsed the cast, I got them to read 'The Territorial Imparity of the Native Aid'. I wanted it to be seen not just as ockerism but as anthropology. But the only people who got that were the French. It was bought in France and it's done terribly well there - much better than it ever did in Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Stickles {{was cast}} in Shortbus in 2003 from amongst some 400 actors who {{submitted}} audition tapes for the film, which was initially known as [...] "Sex Film Project." [...] No script had been written prior to casting and the story was built out of improvisational sessions once the cast was in place. The voyeuristic aspect of Caleb's character grew in part out of Stickles's own interests at the time. [...] "I was exploring sex clubs {{at the time and}} not necessarily participating but watching from afar. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Cameron Mitchell was attracted to the idea of this whole voyeuristic aspect of the character. ... How far would you go to touch somebody from afar?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well. Then I suppose I may {{arrange to}} go. <b>I</b> did not <b>think,</b> <b>John,</b> that <b>I</b> should be turned {{out of your}} father's house so soon after your father's death. I did not indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'd {{rather not}} try,' {{answered}} brother John, winking hard, as he stroked the little head beside him, which, by the bye, looked very like a ragged, yellow door-mat. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> brother <b>John</b> winked hard, but I can't be sure, for I know I did; {{and for a}} minute {{there seemed to be}} a dozen little newsboys dancing before my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so, <b>John.</b> <b>I</b> {{have nothing}} against them. I don't believe they could come down at night without being heard; I feel sure they could not get into the shop without that stiff bolt making a noise. Still, as it is {{possible}} they may be concerned in the matter, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, now we have it in good train for getting {{to the bottom of}} it, it would be well to keep the matter altogether to ourselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, Hughes {{retired from}} the public eye and {{moved back to the}} Chicago area. Hughes was {{considerably}} shaken by John Candy's sudden death of a heart attack that same year. [...] "He talked a lot about how much he loved Candy—if Candy had lived longer, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> would have made more films as a director," [...] says Vince Vaughn, a friend of Hughes. In the years following, Hughes rarely granted interviews to the media save a select few in 1999 to promote the soundtrack album to Reach the Rock, an independent film he wrote. The album was compiled by Hughes's son, John Hughes III, and released on his son's Chicago-based record label, Hefty Records. He also recorded an audio commentary for the 1999 DVD release of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|$|E
5000|$|Of the way Tom Wolfe's {{story was}} adapted, Brian De Palma said, [...] "The initial concept {{of it was}} incorrect. If you're going to do The Bonfire of the Vanities, {{you would have to}} make it a lot darker and more cynical, but because it was such an {{expensive}} movie we tried to humanize the Sherman McCoy character - a very unlikeable character, much like the character in The Magnificent Ambersons. We could have done that if we'd been making a low-budget movie, but this was a studio movie with Tom Hanks in it. We made a couple of choices that in retrospect were wrong. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Lithgow would have been a better choice for Sherman McCoy, because he would have got the blue-blood arrogance of the character." ...|$|E
50|$|Ted Was {{claims he}} {{originally}} {{turned down the}} male lead:It's one of those pictures that everyone {{had a bit of}} a cackle about. Then I had a great meeting with Lorenzo Semple, one of the screenwriters, and I could see that a lot of guys were taking this picture very seriously. I went over to Africa and I met John Guillermin, the director, and he embraced all my ideas about strengthening and broadening the character. I thought {{if you were going to}} have a heroine, a fabulous figure like Sheena, she'd have to fall in love with someone who was as great from his own element - it wouldn't work if she fell in love with a schmuck. John agreed. He's a tough cookie and uncompromising in his vision. He either says, 'That's a pile of crap and it won't be in my picture,' or he goes for it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John,</b> who also made King Kong, takes fantastic stories and then grounds them in a reality he finds a lot of time in the geographic locations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right off shore! If {{one knew}} where all them blackguards of rear admirals and post captains {{were to be}} found, <b>I</b> don't <b>think,</b> Sir, <b>John,</b> that you would care much about paying those fifty {{thousand}} promises?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2008, former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney was {{reportedly}} {{asked by a}} session musician which bands he enjoys in the current music scene. The response was the Barenaked Ladies: [...] "Their harmonies are right on. They could outsing us {{any day of the}} week. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>John</b> and myself ever had the sort of range they do." [...] McCartney added that he would not mind recording with the band in the future.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am right}} {{glad to hear}} you speak so warmly of Tresham, Sir John, for I regard him as my special protege, and am pleased indeed to find that at this outset of his career he has proved himself not only a brave knight, but full of resource, and quick at invention. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Sir <b>John,</b> that these two young knights have shown {{themselves}} well worthy of receiving the honour of secular knighthood." ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 31, 2014, Drive Like Jehu reunited for a {{performance}} at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion in San Diego's Balboa Park, accompanied by San Diego Civic Organist Dr. Carol Williams. The collaboration was facilitated by Dang Nguyen, who co-owns Bar Pink in San Diego's North Park neighborhood with Reis {{and sits on the}} Spreckels Organ Society board of directors. [...] "In February or March 2014, we discussed possibilities and the topic of Jehu came up; that's where it started," [...] said Nguyen. [...] "It was a project they wanted to bring back together. Because, after Hot Snakes and Rocket the Crypt reunited {{in the last couple of}} years, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> and Rick felt that to do something at the organ pavilion was worth getting back together for." [...] Reis expressed enthusiasm for the organ's sound, saying [...] "I especially love the way the low-end sound on the organ is so massive. When I go see organ concerts in the park, I want to collaborate with that sound and with Carol. It's not necessarily a 'good idea,' but it's an idea I feel strongly about, and it's such a San Diego thing." [...] According to Williams, [...] "the point of the concert is to open up the (musical) boundaries, not to be narrow. The organ needs a future and any opportunities like this, I really look forward to." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with online magazine Pennyblackmusic, Appleton told interviewer Carl Brookstein that the band's shared influences include Pink Floyd, the Velvet Underground, the Only Ones, Can, Cocteau Twins and Brian Eno. He told Brookstein {{that he was}} [...] "very {{caught up in the}} music being put out by 4AD" [...] in the 1980s, including Rema-Rema, Mass, the Wolfgang Press, Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance, even prior to participating with the label's supergroup This Mortal Coil. He said, [...] "Hearing 'Song to the Siren' for the first time was a monumental moment for me, and It'll End in Tears was stunning... This Mortal Coil are there in the Breathless melting pot, music that's so beautiful and fragile". Appleton noted a preference for female singers, citing Elizabeth Fraser and Billie Holiday as key vocal influences, while hailing Kate Bush as having [...] "the most amazing musical imagination". He also said, [...] "I am not a huge fan of many male singers, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> Grant has a stunning voice and I've listened to David Sylvian since I was a teenager". He further cited the Only Ones' Peter Perrett as his favourite lyricist, and Mark Cox of Mass and the Wolfgang Press as his favourite keyboard player. Appleton also noted Peter Hook and Jah Wobble as influences on Neufeld's bass playing, and Tom Verlaine, Neil Young, Maurice Deebank and John Perry as guitarist Mundy's top influences.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} The Effigies {{develops}} in three discernible periods, each {{marked by a}} different lead guitarist. The Effigies' original lineup consisted of John Kezdy (vocals), Earl [...] "Oil" [...] Letiecq (guitar), Paul Zamost (bass) and Steve Economou (drums). By 1984 Letiecq’s distractions had estranged him from the group, and {{in the words of}} Zamost, “we had problems with our guitar player. We had to switch guitar players....” Minor Threat guitarist Lyle Preslar made inquiries about joining the band. Robert O’Connor replaced Letiecq as lead guitarist and this second lineup released two LPs, Fly on a Wire, and Ink. These albums were engineered and co-produced with the band by Iain Burgess, and were distinguished from the recordings of the first lineup by their sublimated aggression and comparatively muted rhythms. They also hinted at another growing division in the band. As Burgess put it, [...] "they got a lot of heat for the change in musical direction to some degree on the latter two albums that I worked on, Ink and Fly on a Wire. I think both of which have some really f*****g good songs on them, and some are, well, in my opinion, just not all that marvelous. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>John</b> (Kezdy) would say the same thing. I’m sure he likes all the songs, but some of it we could have done better." [...] It was at this stage the band began getting tagged with the ill-fitting post-punk and post-hardcore labels.|$|E
6000|$|LADY CAROLINE. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not, <b>John.</b> Well, you couldn't {{come to a}} more charming {{place than}} this, Miss Worsley, though the house is {{excessively}} damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a little lax about the people she asks down here.

5000|$|Sometime in December 2008, McCartney {{was asked}} by a session {{musician}} which bands he enjoys in the current music scene. The response was surprising, when he replied his favourite band was the Canadian band, Barenaked Ladies. [...] "Their harmonies are right on.

6000|$|... "Why I {{remember}} that my Lord Gosford's gentleman never wore a livery, nor can I {{say that he}} dressed exactly after the manner of Johnson. Every member had his body servant, {{and they were not}} unfrequently taken for their masters. Lady Juliana, too, after the death of her nephew, had one or two attendants out of livery, and in a different fashion from your attire. Peter, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> with <b>John</b> Moseley there, we must alter you a little for the sake of appearances." ...|$|R
