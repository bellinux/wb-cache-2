The walls of the room were usually painted too. There was generally a small and very coarse carpet under the table, and sometimes one before the fireplace. The doors were massive; and the locks and hinges upon them, and also the andirons and the shovel and tongs, were of the most ancient and curious construction. The first thing which the children did, on being ushered into one of these old halls, was to walk all about, and examine these various objects in detail. Rollo made drawings of a great many of them in his <b>drawing</b> <b>book,</b> to bring home and show to people in America.|$|E

40|$|A $k$-page <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> of a graph $G=(V,E) $ {{consists}} of a linear ordering of its vertices along a spine and an assignment of each edge {{to one of the}} $k$ pages, which are half-planes bounded by the spine. In a <b>book</b> <b>drawing,</b> two edges cross if and only if they are assigned to the same page and their vertices alternate along the spine. Crossing minimization in a $k$-page <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> is NP-hard, yet book drawings have multiple applications in visualization and beyond. Therefore several heuristic <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> algorithms exist, but there is no broader comparative study on their relative performance. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark set of challenging graph classes for <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> algorithms and provide an extensive experimental study of the performance of existing <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> algorithms.
