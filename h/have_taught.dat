5|$|According to Hindu legend Ramanuja (1017–1137), {{the leading}} expounder of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, visited the temple. One of his disciples placed Ramanuja's sandals {{along with the}} image of Varadarajar. Ramanujar became furious at this, for which the disciple {{explained}} that for Ramanuja Varadarajar is god, but for him, Ramanuja is supreme.

5|$|Rishabhanatha is {{credited}} in Jainism to have invented and taught fire, cooking, and all skills needed {{for human beings}} to live. In total, Rishabhanatha is said to <b>have</b> <b>taught</b> seventy-two sciences to men, and sixty-four to women. According to Paul Dundas, Rishabhanatha in Jain mythology is thus not merely a spiritual teacher but one who founded knowledge in its various forms and a form of culture hero for the current cosmological cycle.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha is {{stated in}} Jain texts to <b>have</b> <b>taught</b> his {{daughter}}s Brahmi and Sundari, the Brahmi lipi (ancient Brahmi script) and {{the science of}} numbers (Ank-Vidya) respectively.

5|$|After the 1953 {{championship}} wrapped up, Katsura and Matsuyama gave {{an exhibition}} together in Long Beach, California (advertisement at right). The format was 100 points at balkline, {{followed by a}} race to 40 at three-cushion and then a trick shot exhibition. Katsura crushed her teacher, 100–11 and 100–3 at balkline, but Matsuyama won both the three-cushion matches, 40–34 and 40–39. This was Katsura and Matsuyama's last close interaction. After returning to Japan, Matsuyama {{suffered a heart attack}} and died on December 20, 1953.

5|$|Born in Exeter around 1125, Baldwin {{was the son}} of Hugh d'Eu, Archdeacon of Totnes, and a {{woman of}} unknown name who later became a nun. Gervase of Canterbury's story that he was from an even humbler {{background}} has been shown by modern scholarship to stem from bias on the medieval chronicler's part. It is possible that he studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope Urban III. Robert Warelwast, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law. Baldwin was also said to <b>have</b> <b>taught</b> at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record. In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of Robert of Chichester, Bishop of Exeter.|$|E
