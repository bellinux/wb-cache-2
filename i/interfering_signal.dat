2500|$|One design {{common in}} early days, called a [...] "loose coupler", {{consisted}} of a smaller secondary coil inside a larger primary coil. The smaller coil was mounted on a rack {{so it could be}} slid linearly in or out of the larger coil.

Adding tone or digital squelch to a radio system does not solve interference issues, it just covers them up. The presence of <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> should be corrected rather than masked. <b>Interfering</b> <b>signals</b> masked by tone squelch will produce apparently random missed messages.

30|$|As {{some of the}} {{received}} <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> may {{be strong}} enough to decode, successive interference cancellation allows receivers to decode packets that arrive concurrently. The strongest signal can be decoded and subtracted from the collision, allowing the decoder to recognize weaker <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> and decoding them as well. The procedure can be repeated iteratively, as long as the collided signals have different strengths [23, 24].|$|R

50|$|Satellite {{geolocation}} is {{the process}} of locating the origin of a signal appearing on a satellite communication channel. Typically, this process is used to mitigate interference on communication satellites. Usually, these interference signals are caused by human error or equipment failure, but can also be caused by deliberate jamming. Identifying the geographical location of an <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> informs the mitigation activity.|$|E

5000|$|When an <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> is present, it can {{contribute}} {{to the level of the}} spurious signals. Stronger interference generates stronger spurious signals. The interference may be at a different frequency than the signal of interest, but the spurious signals caused by that interference can show up at the same frequency as the signal of interest. It is these spurious signals that degrade the ability of the receiver by raising the MDS.|$|E
30|$|Interference {{alignment}} (IA) {{is one of}} {{the techniques}} to effectively mitigate interference in wireless networks [1]. It is introduced as a linear precoding technique that aligns the <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> in time, frequency, or space. The key idea is to align the <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> into one-dimensional subspace at each receiver by designing precoding and postcoding vectors, so that the desired signal can be obtained in the interference-free signal subspaces.|$|R

50|$|A {{twisted pair}} has two wires of a cable twisted around each other. This can be {{demonstrated}} by putting {{one end of a}} pair of wires in a hand drill and turning while maintaining moderate tension on the line. Where the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> has a wavelength that is long compared to the pitch of the twisted pair, alternate lengths of wires develop opposing voltages, tending to cancel the effect of the interference.|$|E
50|$|Other {{techniques}} such as adding an <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> to the video or audio began {{to be used as}} the simple filter solutions were easily bypassed. As the technology evolved, addressable set-top boxes became common, and more complex scrambling {{techniques such}} as digital encryption of the audio or video cut and rotate (where a line of video is cut at a particular point and the two parts are then reordered around this point) were applied to signals.|$|E
5000|$|A phase switch is {{a device}} used to {{increase}} the discrimination and sensitivity of an interferometer, especially at radio frequencies; an extra half-wave path difference is switched in, at well defined frequency, between the two <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> sources. In-phase signals then become out of phase and vice versa, so that the signal output becomes modulated by the switching frequency, and can be more easily filtered from the internally generated noise. (The discrimination is highest for sources which are small compared with the interferometer-fringe spacing) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} adaptive {{antenna system}} was implemented to study the performance of adaptive arrays {{in the presence of}} weak <b>interfering</b> <b>signals.</b> It is a sidelobe canceler with two auxiliary elements. Modified feedback loops, which decorrelate the noise components of the two inputs to the loop correlators, control the array weights. Digital processing is used for algorithm implementation and performance evaluation. The results show that the system can suppress <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> which are 0 to 10 dB below the thermal noise level in the main channel by 20 to 30 dB. When the desired signal is strong in the auxiliary elements the amount of interference suppression decreases. The amount of degradation depends on the number of <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> incident on the communication system. A modified steering vector which overcomes this problem is proposed...|$|R

The models can analyze multiple <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> under different fading scenarios. Incoherent addition of summing multiple <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> is assumed. We propose an approximate method {{that uses the}} generalized Gram-Charlier series to analyze the error of the reference model. The approximate method is not only simple but also with neglectable errors. The methods proposed could be very useful in practical system design and analysis. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{geophysical}} applications sensors {{are used}} to measure and record the seismic signals. Many filtering techniques are available in which one output waveform is produced with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the individual sensor recordings. Velocity filters are designed to remove <b>interfering</b> <b>signals</b> by exploiting {{the difference between the}} travelling velocities of desired seismic waveform and undesired <b>interfering</b> <b>signals.</b> In contrast to the one dimensional output produced by multi-channel filtering, velocity filters produce a two-dimensional output.|$|R
50|$|Coaxial cable {{insulation}} may degrade, requiring {{replacement of the}} cable, especially if it has {{been exposed to the}} elements on a continuous basis. The shield is normally grounded, and if even a single thread of the braid or filament of foil touches the center conductor, the signal will be shorted causing significant or total signal loss. This most often occurs at improperly installed end connectors and splices. Also, the connector or splice must be properly attached to the shield, as this provides the path to ground for the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An XPIC {{typically}} acts {{on one of}} the received signals [...] "C" [...] {{containing the}} desired signal as dominant term and uses the other received [...] "X" [...] signal too (containing the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> as dominant term). The XPIC algorithm multiplies the [...] "X" [...] by a complex coefficient and then adds it to the received [...] "C". The complex recombination coefficient is adjusted adaptively to maximize the MMSE as measured on the recombination. Once the MMSE is improved to the required level, the two terminals can switch to high-order modulations.|$|E

5000|$|This circuit had two advantages. [...] One {{was that}} {{by using the}} correct turns ratio, the {{impedance}} of the antenna could be matched to the impedance of the receiver, to transfer maximum RF power to the receiver. Impedance matching was important to achieve maximum receiving range in the unamplified receivers of this era. [...] The coils usually had taps which could be selected by a multiposition switch. The second advantage was that due to [...] "loose coupling" [...] it had a much narrower bandwidth than a simple tuned circuit, and the bandwidth could be adjusted. [...] Unlike in an ordinary transformer, the two coils were [...] "loosely coupled"; separated physically so not all the magnetic field from the primary passed through the secondary, reducing the mutual inductance. This gave the coupled tuned circuits much [...] "sharper" [...] tuning, a narrower bandwidth than a single tuned circuit. In the [...] "Navy type" [...] loose coupler (see picture), widely used with crystal receivers, the smaller secondary coil was mounted on a rack which could be slid {{in or out of}} the primary coil, to vary the mutual inductance between the coils. [...] When the operator encountered an <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> at a nearby frequency, the secondary could be slid further out of the primary, reducing the coupling, which narrowed the bandwidth, rejecting the <b>interfering</b> <b>signal.</b> A disadvantage was that all three adjustments in the loose coupler - primary tuning, secondary tuning, and coupling - were interactive; changing one changed the others. So tuning in a new station was a process of successive adjustments.|$|E
50|$|Essentially {{there are}} two types of {{interference}} sources in the 800 MHz band: The LTE base stations and the mobile terminals — handsets, tablets, dongles — which are sometimes close to TV equipment. Although the base stations may be relatively far away from the TV equipment they may be adjacent to the TV antenna, or if further away they may be in the 'beam' of the TV antenna, i.e. in the direction which the TV antenna points, and considerably closer than the TV transmitter which it is desired to receive resulting in a high level of <b>interfering</b> <b>signal</b> in the TV system. In the case of apartments, hotels, schools, colleges, offices, etc. with communal TV antenna systems the base station may be very close indeed, even on the same roof.|$|E
