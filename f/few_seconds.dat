5|$|The waning {{crescent}} Moon had set a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> after 15:00 on 14 April {{and would}} not rise again until 04:37 (ship's time) on 15 April, shortly after {{the arrival of the}} Carpathia.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 17–98 {{consist of}} a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of silence each: track 17 is 9 seconds, tracks 18-97 are 4 seconds each, and track 98 lasts 5 seconds.|$|E
50|$|To {{illustrate}} then, without {{accounting for}} the effects of rotation, proximity to the Earth's gravitational well will cause a clock on the planet's surface to accumulate around 0.0219 <b>fewer</b> <b>seconds</b> over a period of one year than would a distant observer's clock. In comparison, a clock {{on the surface of the}} sun will accumulate around 66.4 <b>fewer</b> <b>seconds</b> in one year.|$|R

5|$|Initially, ground {{observers}} {{confirmed that}} pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure GNSS Flight Recorders that record the position every <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> from GPS satellites. These recording devices now provide the {{proof that the}} turn-points have been reached.|$|E
5|$|The {{first cut}} of X2 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, due to violent shots with Wolverine when Stryker's army storms the X-Mansion. A <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> were cut {{to secure a}} PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed {{the ball on the}} head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into the roof of the net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely had time to restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> later.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} sought-after lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial, The Tenth Planet, which ends with the First Doctor's {{regeneration}} into the Second. The only portion of the episode still in existence, bar a few poor-quality silent 8mm clips, is the final 27 seconds, comprising the regeneration itself and a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> leading up to it. The sequence had been shown in a 1973 episode of Blue Peter, and was retained in that show's archive.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated {{near where the}} atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields {{by as much as}} one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> every few minutes, while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E
60|$|A <b>few</b> {{precious}} <b>seconds</b> {{in making}} the soldiers understand what he wanted, a <b>few</b> more <b>seconds</b> to command them to obey for they stood as a phalanx against the gate, thinking the praefect mad in desiring to enter the arena--a <b>few</b> more <b>seconds</b> and Taurus Antinor was at last in the arena, shouting to the hunted man to have at the brute with his hands.|$|R

50|$|From early 2009, Shamrock Buses {{invested}} in buying a <b>few</b> <b>second</b> hand single deck low floor buses {{for the bus}} services run on contract to Bournemouth and Poole Borough Councils. These are used on route 8, which the company began operating when Poole-based independent Roadliner collapsed in August 2009.|$|R
5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf merges with another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a runaway reaction, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> without flapping their wings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the figure}} to the right, the enzyme {{produces}} E* {{rapidly in the}} first <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of the reaction. The rate then slows as steady state is reached. This rapid burst phase of the reaction measures a single turnover of the enzyme. Consequently, the amount of product released in this burst, shown as the intercept on the y-axis of the graph, also gives the amount of functional enzyme which {{is present in the}} assay.|$|E

5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even for just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, {{up to and including}} blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. After a <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> the train is released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|E
50|$|The {{roller mill}} was {{designed}} and built by the founders, D. R. Julian, A. C. Mauney, James C. McCanless and Napoleon B. McCanless. The original building was three stories tall and built in a Second Empire style, Victorian construction; one of the <b>few</b> <b>Second</b> Empire style buildings with industrial use in North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the release}} of this single, on February 27, 2014, all of the band's social media outlets were blacked out with no reason given.

50|$|Lee {{ran for a}} seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1940 Alberta general {{election}} as a Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of Taber. Lee faced a tough fight in the election as did not secure a clear majority on the first vote count. Despite getting <b>few</b> <b>second</b> choice preferences he earned enough to finish first.|$|R
5|$|With just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> {{remaining}} in the first half, {{there appeared to be}} little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E
5|$|Within a <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> a {{substantial}} {{fraction of the}} matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova. An outwardly expanding shock wave is generated, with matter reaching velocities {{on the order of}} 5,000–20,000km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light. There is also a significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of −19.3 (or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase {{the energy of the}} particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
25|$|He {{played a}} <b>few</b> <b>Second</b> XI games for Worcestershire in 1972, but his {{first-class}} debut came against the touring New Zealanders at Worcester in late April 1973.
