5|$|Arsenal {{struggled}} to regain fluency {{in the second}} half, as their opponents dominated play. In the 53rd minute, United scored to make it 4–3; Charlie Mitten's flick in the area was diverted into the Arsenal net by Lionel Smith for an own goal. United fashioned further chances through Burke and Rowley, but for large periods {{of the second half}} the Arsenal defence stood firm. Jones' headed goal was rule out for offside, after which the match descended into a contest between United's attack and Arsenal's defence. Jimmy Delaney came closest to equalising late on, when he <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> and missed by inches.|$|E
25|$|The 21st Regiment of Infantry boldly {{advanced}} {{against the}} French Column, with {{a determination to}} check its further progress; but soon found itself charged in flank by cavalry that had <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> {{from the head of}} a column which, by the glimmering of its armour, even amidst the twilight, proclaimed itself a formidable body of Cuirassiers. It was, in fact, Milhaud's whole heavy cavalry corps, which had effected its passage {{on the other side of}} the village.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, the Prussian Cavalry having rallied, and reformed, {{in their}} turn began to drive back the French. Again {{the thunder of}} their hoofs approached, and again the flying host whirled past the Marshal and his anxious friend; whereupon the latter, eagerly {{watching}} his opportunity as the pursuers came on, <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> and seizing the bridle of a noncommissioned officer of the 6th Uhlans, named Schneider, ordered him and some Files immediately following, to dismount and assist in saving Blücher. Five or six powerful men now raised the heavy dead charger, while others extricated their commander, senseless and almost immoveable. In this state they placed him on the noncommissioned officer's horse. Just as they moved off, the French was again pressing forward with renewed speed, and Nostitz had barely time to lead the Marshal, whose senses were gradually returning, to the nearest Prussian infantry, which gladly received the party, and, retiring in perfect order, bade defiance to the attacks of its pursuers.|$|E

25|$|One more {{test flight}} was {{conducted}} at the Island Grounds in 1914, when J. W. Madley, a water works engineer, tested an aircraft assembled by him. He flew it over the Red Hills reservoir to inspect works and shot a couple of aerial photographs of the reservoir from the aircraft. This incident kindled an interest in flying among prominent residents of the city, resulting in {{the arrival of a}} set of aviators in 1911 to display the flying machines they had brought with them to India as a marketing initiative. The aviators included Baron de Caters and Jules Tyck. On 15 February 1911, Tyck flew in a Blériot aeroplane in front of the public. The aircraft was wheeled out by eight men with Tyck seated inside the craft wearing an oilskin coat and goggles. The men held the plane till its engine revved up and then let go, and the craft <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> about 20 yards before rising into the air. In the air, the craft made a straight flight only for about three-quarters of the length of the ground and descended due to poor weather. Tyck flew again the next day, this time reaching a height of 2,400feet, which was witnessed by the then Governor of Madras Sir Arthur Lawley. Two days later, on 18 February, another demonstration was given by Baron de Caters, when he flew his aircraft in public.|$|E
2500|$|With Geoff Pullar {{unable to}} play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role {{he did not}} relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at {{backward}} short-leg, who <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead {{and the sky was}} clear, so there was no chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14-15 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but [...] "Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then he rolled over and sat up, still clutching the ball." [...] Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is a juggler's trick," [...] said De Vaux, <b>darting</b> <b>forward</b> and {{snatching}} up {{the portion}} of the cushion which had been cut off, as if to assure himself of the reality of the feat; [...] "there is gramarye in this." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{turned and}} faced him. The blood rushed to my cheek. 'Harold!' I cried, <b>darting</b> <b>forward.</b> My joy overcame me. He folded {{me in his}} arms. I allowed him, unreproved. For {{the first time he}} kissed me. I did not shrink from it.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} recognised {{his friends}} immediately; and, <b>darting</b> <b>forward</b> and seizing Mr. Pickwick by the hand, dragged {{him to a}} seat with his usual impetuosity, talking all the while {{as if the whole}} of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction.|$|R

60|$|I turned, and Miss Ingram <b>darted</b> <b>forwards</b> {{from her}} sofa: the others, too, {{looked up from}} their several occupations; for {{at the same time}} a {{crunching}} of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've missed, after all!"
