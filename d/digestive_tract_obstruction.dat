40|$|ObjectiveDuring {{the past}} 20 years, open repair {{has been the}} chief {{intervention}} for pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Endovascular repair has become an alternative for patients with ruptured AAA or other acute disease complications. The present study, however, attempted to use a common stent graft with the fenestration technique, rather than a customized one, in an emergency situation, to treat a giant pararenal AAA complicated by upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction,</b> and assessed the results. MethodsA patient with a pararenal AAA was admitted emergently, with complications of upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction,</b> including a tumor-like dilated segment of the abdominal aorta, 0. 5 -cm inferior to the ostia of the bilateral renal arteries, with a maximum diameter of 10. 1 cm and a length of 18. 5 cm. The patient underwent endovascular repair with a fenestrated endovascular stent graft to open the bilateral renal arteries 1 week later in an emergency situation. ResultsNo stenosis occurred at the openings of bilateral renal artery {{as a result of}} the stent, and the AAA was completely occluded. The patient experienced greatly ameliorated abdominal pain and upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction.</b> At the 1 -year follow-up examination, no exceptional symptoms were observed. ConclusionThese results showed that for patients with a pararenal AAA who are unfit for open repair, or for those who cannot wait longer than 6 weeks for a customized fenestrated stent graft to be made, emergency field fenestration is feasible and successful, based on selection of the proper patient and accurate intraoperative localization...|$|E

Surgical fenestration by resection of the lymphocele wall was performed as a treatment for the upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction.</b> A considerable number of bowel obstructions caused by compression of a lymphocele have been described in the literature: Most lympoceles affect the colon due to their location in the pelvic or lower paraaortic region. Therefore, large lymphoceles are frequently associated with clinical symptoms of lower bowel obstruction with constipation, lower abdominal pain and distension of the abdomen. In our case the large extension of the lymphocele from the left cranial renal pole up to the right diaphragm had led to a compression of the duodenum with clinical symptoms typically encountered in patients with a duodenal stenosis by e.g. pancreatic head cancer or patients with a gallstone ileus.|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{two dogs}} were {{operated}} on {{in order to}} evaluate the mucosal regeneration of the serosal patch at the gastroesophageal junction. The operation began with a cardiotomy involving one centimeter of the esophagus and two centimeters of the stomach, originating an elliptical serosal surface three centimeters long and one centimeter large. turned to the digestive lumen. The animals were divided into four groups of eight dogs each and named: 1, 2, 3 and 4; they were sacrificed after one, two, four and eight weeks respectively. The results were evaluated by post-operative clinical aspects, macro and microscopic analysis. Post-operative morbidity was low, without signs of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction.</b> Macroscopically, the patch area at the first week became an ulcerated lesion, with a necrotic bottom; at the second and fourth weeks there was a progressive reduction of the ulcer, from its boundaries to the center, until the complete healing at the eighth week. Microscopically, the serous membrane disappeared early and it was replaced by inflamatory cells and severe neovascular formation, which fitted as a bed to the epithelial proliferation. The neo-epithelization occurred from the periphery {{to the center of}} the lesion. At the esophagus this process was completed within two weeks, with multiple layers of cells; at the stomach, within four weeks, with an unicellular epithelium. The corium, showing an inflamatory reaction at the first week, with fibrinoid necrosis and polimorphonuclear cells, changed to a fibroblastic proliferation with mononuclar cells at the second and fourth weeks and, finally, to fibrosis at the eighth week. In the animals sacrificed lately there was regeneration of the smooth muscle layer of the esophagus. At electronic microscopy, the neo-epithelium of the esophagus had all the layer which constitute the normal esophageal epithelium. Trinta e dois cães foram submetidos ao tamponamento seroso da junção esofagogástrica, com o objetivo de investigar experimentalmente o processo de reparação mucosa. A operação constou de cardiotomia, interessando um centímetro do esôfago e dois centímetros do estômago. Esta secção foi obliterada pelo fundo gástrico, originando uma superfície serosa elíptica, voltada para o lúmen, com três centímetros de comprimento por um centímetro de maior largura. Os animais foram divididos em quatro grupos de oito cães cada (Grupos: 1, 2, 3 e 4), sacrificados após uma, duas, quatro e oito semanas respectivamente. Os resultados foram avaliados quanto aos aspectos clínicos, pós-operatórios, e da análise macro e microscopicas dos espécimes obtidos. A evolução pós-operatória mostrou pequena morbidade, sem sinais de obstrução do trato digestivo. Ficou demonstrado à macroscopia, que a área do tamponamento exibe, na primeira semana, aspecto de lesão ulcerada, com fundo necrótico; na segunda e quarta semanas houve redução da área cruenta, até a completa cicatrização, melhor observada na oitava semana. À microscopia, a membrana serosa desapareceu precocemente, dando lugar a infiltrado inflamatório com intensa neoformação vascular, que serviu de leito para a proliferação epitelial.

The symbiotic A. veronii bv. sobria strain proliferated well and persisted for at least 7 days inside the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> In contrast, the proliferation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited inside the animal compared to growth in the in vitro control, indicating that the ingested blood was modified within the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> However, both strains were able to persist in the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> for at least 7 days. For an Escherichia coli strain, the viable counts decreased approximately 1, 000 -fold within 42 h. The decrease of viable E. coli could be prevented by interfering with the activation of the membrane-attack complex of the complement system that is present in blood. This suggests that the membrane-attack complex remained active inside H. medicinalis and prevented the proliferation of sensitive bacteria.

Selective oropharyngeal decontamination only aims to eradicate respiratory tract colonization. In a recent study, selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination were associated with lower day- 28 mortality, when compared to standard care. Furthermore, selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination {{was associated with a}} lower incidence of intensive care unit-acquired bacteremia caused by gram-negative bacteria. We quantified the role of intestinal tract carriage with gram-negative bacteria and intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia. DESIGN: Data from a cluster-randomized and a single-center observational study. SETTING: Intensive care unit in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Patients with intensive care unit stay of > 48 hrs that received selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination (n = 2, 667), selective oropharyngeal decontamination (n = 2, 166) or standard care (n = 1, 945). INTERVENTIONS: Selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination or selective oropharyngeal decontamination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Incidence densities (episodes/ 1000 days) of intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia were 4. 5, 3. 0, and 1. 4 during standard care, selective oropharyngeal decontamination, and selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination, respectively, and the daily risk for developing intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteria bacteremia increased until days 36, 33, and 31 for selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination, standard care, and selective oropharyngeal decontamination and was always lowest during selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination. Rectal colonization with gram-negative bacteria was present in 26 % and 71 % of patient days during selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination, respectively (p <. 01). Irrespective of interventions, incidence densities of intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia was 4. 5 during patient days with both intestinal and respiratory tract gram-negative bacteria carriage.

40|$|The {{accidental}} {{capture of}} sea turtles with longline {{is a frequent}} event in the Mediterranean sea. Frequently hooks are located in oral cavity or oesophagus and surgical removal is relatively easy; whereas in many other cases hooks and especially lines are located in lower <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> often causing severe damages, as serious injuries on the intestinal wall. Recently, effective surgical techniques have been proposed for hook and line extraction from different districts of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The access to the coelomic cavity through the prefemoral soft tissues allows the removal of hooks and lines from the caudal portions of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> and it is often employed in conjunction with cervical or axillary approach, if one or more hooks are located in oesophagus or stomach and lines cross the entire <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> In this study, the left inguinal approach is compared to the right one, and results are reported concerning 97 turtles treated by these routes for the extraction of foreign bodies from <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The surgical approach through soft tissues of the right inguinal region was performed in 63 turtles. In 23 cases a unique approach {{was used to remove}} hooks lodged in the lower <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> and lines extended through the entire <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> In 40 cases this approach was performed together with cervical and left axillary surgical approaches, to remove hooks lodged in oesophagus or stomach, and lines crossing the lower <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The surgical approach through the soft tissues of the left inguinal region was performed in 34 turtles. This technique was employed as a single approach in 5 cases to remove hooks stopped in the pyloric portion of the stomach, and in 10 cases to remove lines crossing the entire <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> In the remaining 19 cases the left inguinal approach was employed additionally to the cervical one, to remove hooks lodged in the oesophagus and lines extended through the entire <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> To remove hooks located in the intestine, we chose the side closest {{to the site of the}} foreign body. To remove line crossing all the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> the choice of the side access was initially random, but experience showed how the right inguinal approach is to be preferred. Indeed, we tested how this approach allows the exteriorization of longer tracts of intestine, whereas with the left inguinal approach is often difficult to expose the tract between jejunum and ileum, because this portion is more subject than others to plication, intussusceptions and severe lacerations of walls, because of the major tensions that line induces there. To guarantee the survival of the patient, our direct experience show definitely how it is important to operate as soon as possible, in particular when it could be present a line in the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The choice of the surgical approach appears crucial to solve lifethreatening situations, in which lines cross the entire digestive tube...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundRight {{ventricular}} outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{can be a}} {{cause of}} hemodynamic instability {{but it has not}} been described in non-congenital cardiac surgery. MethodsThe prevalence of right ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction</b> was retrospectively studied in 670 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Significant right ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction</b> was diagnosed if the right ventricular systolic to pulmonary artery peak gradient was more than 25 mm Hg. The diagnosis was based on measurement of the right ventricular and pulmonary artery systolic pressure through the paceport and distal opening of the pulmonary artery catheter. To further validate the prevalence and the importance of right ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction,</b> 130 patients were prospectively studied over a 12 -month period. ResultsIn the retrospective cohort, 6 patients (1 %) undergoing various types of cardiac surgical procedures were found to have significant dynamic right ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction</b> with a mean gradient of 31 ± 4 mm Hg (26 to 35 mm Hg). In the prospective study significant dynamic right ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction</b> was identified in 5 patients (4 %) (average peak: 37 ± 15 mm Hg; range: 27 to 60 mm Hg). The typical transesophageal echocardiography finding was end-systolic obliteration of the right ventricular outflow tract. In patients with significant dynamic right ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction,</b> hemodynamic instability was present in 10 / 11 patients (91 %). ConclusionsRight ventricular outflow <b>tract</b> <b>obstruction</b> is easily diagnosed using the paceport of the pulmonary artery catheter and should be considered as a potential cause of hemodynamic instability especially when transesophageal echocardiography reveals systolic right ventricular cavity obliteration...|$|R
5000|$|Riftia develop from a free-swimming, pelagic, {{non-symbiotic}} trochophore larva, which enters juvenile (metatrochophore) development, becoming sessile {{and subsequently}} acquiring symbiotic bacteria. [...] The symbiotic bacteria, on which adult worms depend for sustenance, are {{not present in}} the gametes, but are acquired from the environment via the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> transiently connects from a mouth {{at the tip of}} the ventral medial process to a foregut, midgut, hindgut and anus. After symbionts are established in the midgut, it undergoes substantial remodelling and enlargement to become the trophosome, while the remainder of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> has not been detected in adult specimens.|$|R
