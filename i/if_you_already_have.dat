5000|$|Fans and EA {{developers}} both view Madden NFL 06 as [...] "the undisputed lemon of the franchise", {{because of}} the concurrent shift from the Xbox and PlayStation 2 to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The passing cone was so unpopular that it disappeared in Madden NFL 09. Reviewers criticized the game's lack of new features and lackluster soundtrack (a recurring complaint), claiming the game plays very similarly to Madden NFL 2005 if the QB Vision cone is turned off. GameSpot gave the mobile version a score of 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "a decent game of football with a solid statistical foundation. It breaks new ground for the franchise and promises future installments for football fans. However, this edition definitely shows EA's wireless inexperience and wasn't the stunner it should have been. In particular, the game's visuals are a disappointment. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a V Cast phone, Madden 06 isn't {{a bad way to}} go. It's just not the killer app that forces an upgrade." [...] Similarly, IGN gave the same version seven out of ten, saying that the game [...] "was developed not internally, but by a development house called Finite Monkeys. And it ultimately feels like they were rushed to get this game on the decks by [...] "Madden Tuesday." [...] This is unfortunate, because I {{think a lot of people}} will download the game hoping to have a [...] "Madden experience" [...] on their handset, and just end up with an average football game, albeit one with above-average visuals and spoken commentary." ...|$|E
