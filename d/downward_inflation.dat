40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the problem of}} inflation volatility in Australia and deploys quarter-on-quarter CPI-inflation data over the period 1949 q 3 – 2013 q 4 to investigate the proposition of a feedback relation between inflation and inflation volatility in this country. The paper adopts the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) modelling technique to estimate simultaneously the conditional mean and the conditional variance of inflation and their interrelations in a dynamic context. A bivariate Granger-causality test is then conducted {{to determine whether a}} causal relation exists between inflation and inflation volatility, as measured by the estimated conditional variance of inflation. The empirical results suggest the presence of a feedback relation between inflation and inflation volatility with a positive (adverse) impact of inflation volatility on the rate of unemployment. A second finding of the paper, based on the preferred exponential GARCH (1, 1) model, is that inflation shock has an asymmetric impact on inflation volatility. A negative (<b>downward)</b> <b>inflation</b> shock is found to have a larger effect on the log of the conditional variance of inflation than the effect of a positive inflation shock of the same magnitude. These are the key findings of the paper. The concluding section summarises its other findings and draws some of the implications for Australian monetary policy...|$|E

The fraction of workers facing wage increases that are due to nominal, but mostly real wage rigidity is substantial. The extent of real rigidity rises with inflation, whereas the opposite holds for nominal rigidity.

Previous studies of whether inflation "greases the wheels" {{of the labor market}} ignore inflation's potential for disrupting wage patterns in the same market. This paper outlines an institutionally-based model of wage-setting that allows the benefits of <b>inflation</b> (<b>downward</b> wage flexibility) to be separated from disruptive uncertainty about inflation rate (undue variation in relative prices). Our estimates, using a unique 40 -year panel of wage changes made by large mid-western employers, suggest that low rates of inflation do help the economy to adjust to changes in labor supply and demand. However, when inflation's disruptive effects are balanced against this benefit the labor market justification for pursuing a positive long-term inflation goal effectively disappears...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have {{documented}} extensive downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR) for job stayers in many OECD countries. However, DNWR for individual workers may induce downward rigidity or "a floor" for the aggregate wage growth at positive or negative levels.

DNWR may also lead to a positive growth in aggregate wages because of changes in relative wages. We explore industry data for 19 OECD countries, over the period 1971 - 2006. We find evidence for floors on nominal wage growth at 6 percent and lower in the 1970 s and 1980 s, at one percent in the 1990 s, and at 0. 5 percent in the 2000 s.

The paper ends by a brief survey of empirical evidence, and a discussion of whether labour markets may adapt to a low inflation environment. Economists and practitioners now agree that monetary policy should aim at low inflation. Yet a number of economists and observers have argued that if monetary policy aims at inflation that is too low, this may involve considerable costs for society (Tobin, 1972, Holden, 1994, Akerlof, Dickens and Perry, 1996, 2000, the Economist, 2003). A key concern is that under low or zero <b>inflation,</b> <b>downward</b> rigidity of nominal wages may induce higher wage pressure, involving higher equilibrium unemployment. Other economists have countered this view, arguing that any downward nominal wage rigidity that may exist is the result of an inflationary environment, and that society will adapt to a zero inflation policy without large and persistent effects on output and unemployment (Ball and Mankiw, 1994, Gordon, 1996).

40|$|In {{this paper}} key {{points in the}} {{development}} of the present Swedish inflation-targeting strategy are analysed. Since the implementation of the inflation target strategy began in 1993, three different phases are distinguished: the establishment of the inflation target, the communication of explicit inflation forecasts, and, finally, the introduction of distribution forecast targeting. In practice, distribution forecast targeting involves presenting a main scenario for future inflation, and assessments of both the degree of uncertainty in the forecast and the magnitude of the upside and downside risks in the main scenario in quarterly inflation reports. While inflation targeting in Sweden has been succesful in reducing both inflation and private sector inflation expectations, aggregate demand as well as supply shocks and temporary factors have also exerted a <b>downward</b> influence on <b>inflation</b> in the 1990 s. It is therefore premature to distinguish any improvements in the inflation-output trade-off. It is likely, however, that the increased credibility of the inflation target has resulted in both a lower average inflation level and lower inflation variability.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} macroeconomic developments of the past decade has been the widespread decline in inflation despite declines in unemployment rates. For the United States, these seemingly contradictory developments have been reconciled in terms of three factors: (1) an acceleration in productivity, (2) structural changes in labor markets that lowered the natural unemployment rate (NAIRU), and (3) improved credibility of monetary policy. Here we ask whether comparable factors were at work in foreign industrial countries. To address this question, we empirically characterize the relationship between inflation, the unemployment rate, and structural factors using an extended Phillips curve model with quarterly data through 1994. By undertaking counterfactual simulations from 1995 to 2001, we quantify the separate contributions of unemployment-rate movements, labor-market reforms (that affected the NAIRU), and productivity developments on inflation. In line with previous work on the United States, we find that productivity advancements were the main structural factor reducing inflation in the United States. For foreign countries, persistent labor-market slack was the main factor exerting <b>downward</b> pressure on <b>inflation.</b> This persistence stemmed, in part, from structural reforms that lowered the NAIRU while the unemployment rate was declining.

An examination of the distribution of inflation rates across the range of goods and services that compose the index suggests that <b>downward</b> pressures on <b>inflation</b> are relatively high by historical standards. The personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI) is a widely followed measure of U. S. inflation based on personal income data published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Over the past 12 months, the prices of consumer goods and services measured by the PCEPI have increased 1. 3 %. This is a relatively low level of headline inflation, but by no means the lowest reading ever recorded. In the 12 months ending July 2009, PCEPI prices declined 1 %. Only one year before that, in July 2008, 12 -month PCEPI inflation reached 4. 5 %, its peak for the decade. These big swings are in large part attributable to volatile food and energy prices.

An examination of alternative measures of labor market conditions suggests that the “normal ” unemployment rate may have risen as much as 1. 7 percentage points to about 6. 7 %, although much of this increase is likely to prove temporary. Even with such an increase, sizable labor market slack is expected to persist for years. In the past, the U.

"The concern was that the rationing of consumer goods evident in prior years had led to an excess of purchasing power in households. Price liberalization was expected to lead to a jump in consumer prices as households tried to exercise their purchasing power. But after the Soviet Union dissolved, a new concern emerged: a ruble shortage. Throughout the ruble currency area, governments and state enterprises could not get enough rubles to pay wages and pensions. As a result, households were unable to make the purchases they wanted to make. Ruble shortages contributed greatly to the progressive deterioration of the ruble area, from its beginning with fifteen members to its present membership of two. The names given to these two episodes - the"ruble overhang"and the"ruble shortage"- are misleading, because they are both manifestations of the same phenomenon. In both cases, forced savings led to a reduction in purchasing power and <b>downward</b> pressure on <b>inflation.</b> The difference was in the mechanism that induced forced saving. For the ruble overhang, the government maintained price rigidity; there was nonprice rationing of output that was insufficient to satisfy demand at those rigid prices.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{sovereign}} debt crisis in Europe, a crisis entirely felt also in the direct relation between credit institutions, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) adopted a monetary policy strategy meant to determine the reinforcement of its image, by initiating {{in the autumn of}} 2011 a new series of reduction of the monetary policy interest rate and implicitly the appropriate resizing of liquidity conditions. By increasing the role of liquidity adjustment, the European Central Bank (ECB) succeeded to determine in the money market the decrease of interbank rate interests under the interest rate level of monetary policy. The direct inflation targeting strategy used by the European Central Bank in applying its monetary policy has the first criterion of implementation the expression of inflation target in terms of â€žheadline inflationâ€ (consumer price index - CPI) given that the economic market in Romania is familiar with this indicator. Also, the main criterion considered by the investment segment of the market to achieve capital infusions in economic transactions is represented by the consumer price index, this one ensuring the necessary transparency related to the effects of inflation phenomenon. A strong argument supporting the use of consumer price index in monetary policy is represented by its upward flexibility towards the limited effectiveness of monetary aggregates in sizing inflationary anticipations. The <b>downward</b> slope of <b>inflation</b> phenomenon, in whose depreciation the evolution of consumer price index, whose positive trend surprised the European Central Bank, played a significant role, determined adjustments in the monetary policy strategy of the National Bank of Romania {{and at the same time}} the achievement of the inflationary target proposed with a direct effect on the monetary policy interest rate. The same measure to reduce the key interest rate is outlined in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank and it is mainly due to the decrease of inflation phenomenon, although at the end of 2011 important quantities of liquidities were introduced in the financial system. It remains to be analysed to what extent the inflation phenomenon will be possible to manage under the conditions of the renewal of economic instability in the euro area and to which direction this aspect will influence the monetary policy of the National Bank of Romania...|$|R
40|$|Since the double-digit {{inflation}} of the 1970 s, the Federal Reserve {{has consistently}} pursued {{the goal of}} price stability in the United States. And, since {{the second half of}} 2002, the year-to-year increase in the core Consumer Price Index (that is, excluding the relatively volatile food and energy components) has been below 2 %, which, according to Fed Governor Bernanke, is probably the de facto equivalent of price stability (Bernanke 2003). This development in the U. S. economy inflation dynamics is unambiguously an important achievement. However, last year, as the prospects for growth remained uncertain, there were concerns that the <b>downward</b> tendency of <b>inflation</b> might continue, posing a remote, but still possible, risk that the inflation rate could fall to a level that is too low. For instance, the balance-of-risks statement issued {{at the close of the}} FOMC meeting on May 6, 2003, recognized explicitly that the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. This Economic Letter examines the distinct features of deflation, discusses why it is a matter of concern to the public and to policymakers in general, and looks at the recent experience of the inflation and deflation in the U. S. and other countries. What is deflation? Let’s first be clear about the definition of deflation. Deflation refers not to falling prices anywhere in the economy, but to a decline in the general price level across the economy. In other words, it is a decline in the price level, not a decline in the growth rate of the price level. The latter is often referred to as “disinflation, ” which means a decline in the rate of inflation. It also is useful to be clear that, for the purposes here, one need not make a strict distinction between the low inflation and the deflation. Part of the reason is that, in reality, it is hard to distinguish between very low inflation and modest deflation. This is because inflation as measured by regular price indices is often biased upward; for instance, according to statistical analysis, the annual inflation rate as measured by core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is probably biased upward by about 0. 5 percentage point, and the bias can be even a bit higher when measured by cor...|$|R

The strong upturn {{after the end of}} the recession of 1992 - 93 faltered as early as in the first half of 1995 on account of unstable exchange rates, high interest rates, and restrictive fiscal policies. Demand and production remained flat until the first half of 1996. The recovery setting in then, slow and fragile at first, was mostly driven by an expansion in exports. Import demand from important trading partners of the EU, mainly the USA and East-Central Europe, was lively; at the same time, the competitive position of European exporters vis-à-vis the dollar area improved with the strengthening of the dollar. Trade between the member countries of the EU is also estimated to have expanded at a lively pace. Production expectations and business climate indicators in manufacturing improved markedly since the middle of the year. The austerity policy pursued by the majority of the EU countries at the same time – public deficits had soared after the recession of 1992 - 93 – tended to depress each country's domestic consumption and investment demand and, by dampening import demand, also export demand in other EU countries, an effect that was reinforced by the tight linkage between the EU economies. Consumer confidence was subdued in most countries. Economic growth in Europe was too weak to relieve the strains in the labor market; employment stagnated and the unemployment rate rose to 11 percent. The development of the labor market was more favorable in those countries with an above-average expansion of production and demand, such as Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U. K. The highest increase in the unemployment rate, by about ¾ percentage point, was recorded in Germany, France, and Sweden. The slow growth in revenues and the rise in expenditures on unemployment relief, both a result of the weakness in economic activity, impeded fast progress in the consolidation of public sector budgets. Despite comprehensive discretionary measures with regard to taxes and expenditures, public sector deficits declined only marginally to 4 ½ percent of GDP (1995 5 percent). Inflation continues to follow a <b>downward</b> trend. The <b>inflation</b> rate was 2 percent in the EU on average. The decrease was particularly pronounced in countries with high inflation; in Italy, the rate of price increase declined from 5. 6 percent in December 1995 to 2. 7 percent in December 1996. The risk of an upturn in inflation is very low in the current economic situation. Wirtschaftstendenzen in der EU 1996.

40|$|Essay 1 : Expectation-Driven House Prices, Debt Default and Inflation Dynamics We {{contribute}} to the literature on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with housing collateral by including shocks to house price expectations. We also incorporate endogenous mortgage defaults that are rarely included in DSGE models with housing collateral. We use this model to {{study the effects of}} variations in house price expectations on macroeconomic dynamics and their implications for monetary policy. Model simulations show that an increase in expected future house prices leads to a decline in mortgage default rate and interest rates on household and business loans, whereas it leads to an increase in house prices, housing demand, household debt, business debt, bank leverage ratio and economic activity. In contrast to previous studies, we find that inflation is low during a house price boom. Finally, we show that monetary policy that takes into account household credit growth reduces the volatility of output and dampens a rise in housing demand, household debt and bank leverage ratio that enhances financial stability. However, a central bank that reacts to household credit growth increases the volatility of inflation. Essay 2 : House Price Expectations, Boom-Bust Cycles and Implications for Monetary Policy This essay examines the role of household expectations about future house prices and their implications for boom-bust cycles and monetary policy. Our findings are as follows. First, waves of optimism and pessimism about future house prices generate boom-bust cycles in house prices, financial activities (household debt, business debt, bank leverage, interest rates on household and business loans) and the real economy (housing demand, consumption, employment, investment and output). Second, we find that inflation declines during a house price boom and increases during a house price burst. Third, we find that monetary policy that reacts to household credit growth reduces the magnitude of boom-bust cycles and improves household welfare. Fourth, we find that the case for taking into account household credit growth becomes stronger in an economy in which the bank capital to asset ratio requirement is low, interest rates on loans and deposits adjust immediately to changes in the policy rate, or the household sector is highly indebted. Essay 3 : Credit Disruptions and the Spillover Effects between the Household and Business Sectors This essay examines the effects of credit supply disruptions in a New Keynesian DSGE model with housing collateral and working capital channels. A tightening of business credit conditions creates negative spillovers from the business sector to the household sector through labor income and housing collateral channels. A tightening of household credit conditions has negative spillover effects on the business sector via the housing collateral channel. We find that spillovers are more sensitive to changes in leverage where the shock occurs. A negative business credit shock creates upward pressure on inflation, whereas a negative household credit shock creates <b>downward</b> pressure on <b>inflation.</b> The working capital channel magnifies the response of inflation to a business credit shock, whereas it dampens the response of inflation to a household credit shock...|$|R
