Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E

25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of this enquiry <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> much more had been done than I had been aware of, when I first {{published}} the Essay. The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.|$|E
25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few {{women and children who}} told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.|$|E
25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural tour de force of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E

25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Polish {{immigrants}} were the lowest paid white ethnic {{group in the}} United States. A study of immigrants before World War <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in Brooklyn, New York, the average annual income was $721. The average for the Norwegians residing there was $1142; for the English, $1015, for the Czechs, $773; but for the Poles, only $595. A study by Richard J. Jensen at the University of Illinois found that despite the pervasive narrative of anti-Irish discrimination in the U.S., in reality, NINA signage was very rare and first-generation Irish {{immigrants were}} about average in job pay rates during the 1880s and certainly above average {{by the turn of}} the century. Despite the absence of explicit ethnic discrimination in job advertisements, immigrant Poles were higher on the index of job segregation measures than the Irish in both the 1880s and the 1930s.|$|E

They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> such a {{pendulum}} actually was {{used during the}} Spanish and German inquisitions.

[...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E
