Crows and ravens are quickly killed by this disease, so their deaths are an <b>early-warning</b> <b>system</b> when West Nile virus arrives {{in an area}} (as are horse and other bird species deaths). One of the first signs that West Nile virus first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.|$|E
25|$|The Missile Defense Alarm System, or MIDAS, was an American {{system of}} 12 early-warning {{satellites}} that provided limited notice of Soviet {{intercontinental ballistic missile}} launches between 1960 and 1966. Originally intended {{to serve as a}} complete <b>early-warning</b> <b>system</b> working in conjunction with the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, cost and reliability concerns limited the project to a research and development role. Three of the system's 12 launches ended in failure, and the remaining nine satellites provided crude infrared early-warning coverage of the Soviet Union until the project was replaced by the Defense Support Program, which served as a successor program. MiDAS represented one element of the United States's first generation of reconnaissance satellites that also included the Corona and Samos series. Though MiDAS failed in its primary role as a system of infrared early-warning satellites, it pioneered the technologies needed in successor systems.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy's 1936 Naval Programme {{authorised}} {{the construction}} of two aircraft carriers.

He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of <b>early-warning</b> <b>system.</b> Lacking that, there was nothing to prevent land-based aircraft from attacking them, especially in confined waters like the North Sea and Mediterranean. This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage. The only way to do this was to completely armour the hangar in which the aircraft would shelter, but putting so much weight high in the ship allowed only a single-storey hangar due to stability concerns. This halved the aircraft capacity compared with the older unarmoured carriers, exchanging offensive potential for defensive survivability.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{potential}} of new technologies and the improvements of <b>early-warning</b> <b>systems</b> since the 2004 Tsunami, damage and harm caused by disasters do not stop to increase. There is a clear need for better integrating the fragmented landscape of researchers and practitioners working on different aspects of decision support for disaster risk reduction and response. To demonstrate and discuss the advantages of integrated systems, we will focus in this paper on vulnerabilities and <b>early-warning</b> <b>systems.</b> While vulnerabilities are mostly used to allocate risk management resources (preparedness), <b>early-warning</b> <b>systems</b> are designed to initiate the response phase. Indicator models {{have been used as}} a part of disaster risk reduction frameworks, and in the design of <b>early-warning</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper we analyse the commonalities and differences between both, and outline how an integrated system that understands vulnerability assessments as part of both risk reduction programs and early-warning shall be designed in future...|$|R

500|$|Attached to New Guinea Force, {{the company}} was {{conceived}} by Major Donald Small, Chief Signals Officer of the 8th Military District, who, having experienced the Japanese air raids on Rabaul, observed {{that the lack of}} an effective <b>early-warning</b> <b>system</b> around New Britain had resulted in the defenders being caught by surprise when attacked. By employing volunteers from Army units stationed in the area, he planned a network of observation posts, each equipped with a wireless transmitter to screen Port Moresby around a [...] radius, providing early warning of air raids, in addition to data on their size, height and strength. The decision of the territory administration to withdraw the civilian wireless operators following the entry of Japan into the war had also left holes in the coastwatching network, reducing its effectiveness. In the nine days following the fall of Rabaul, hasty arrangements were made by Small to assemble an ad hoc group of volunteer infantrymen with only a little signals training using civilian wireless equipment for deployment to the north coast with the assistance of two Short Sunderland flying boats from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).|$|E

2500|$|While CH {{was being}} {{installed}} in the UK, the Germans were working on their own radar systems and had deployed an excellent <b>early-warning</b> <b>system</b> known as [...] "Freya". But the complexity of relaying {{the information from the}} radars to the fighters had not been addressed, and was apparently never seriously considered at the time. During the Battle of the Heligoland Bight in 1939, over 100 German aircraft were scrambled to meet a small force of RAF bombers, but less than half of these found them. This was in spite of a Luftwaffe Freya detecting the raid while still one hour out, there was no way for this unit to communicate with the fighters. The only radar reports to reach them came from a naval Freya near the target, too late to improve matters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the potential of}} earthquake <b>early-warning</b> <b>systems</b> for transport lines. The interdisciplinary work focuses on rapidly producing an alert map during an ongoing earthquake {{as well as providing}} a damage map immediately after the strong-motion phase that visualizes potential damages to the railway infrastructure. In order to meet these application requirements, a service-oriented architecture based on geospatial standards is specified. This ensures the portability of the system architecture to different geographic regions as well as a potential transfer to other natural disasters and infrastructure systems.
