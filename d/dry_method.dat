40|$|The high {{potential}} of health beneficial polyphenols and antioxidants in cocoa beans {{has been a}} major topic for research in recent years. The large-scale application of cocoa beans for health beneficial compounds is relatively unexplored {{and it needs to be}} widely utilized by pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. Processing methods such as fermentation and drying are major deterrents for recovering high polyphenols in cocoa beans. Hence, it was the intention of this work to introduce the application of hot water blanching pre-treatment and various <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> for producing polyphenols rich cocoa beans by using unfermented beans. The studies incorporated the application of various <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> such as oven, adsorption, vacuum, freeze and sun <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> on cocoa beans. The studies compared the ability of these <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> to preserve the bioactive capacities namely, total polyphenolic contents and antioxidants activity after hot water blanching. The potential of adsorption, vacuum and freeze <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> for recovering high polyphenols content are useful in comparing it with the conventional cocoa <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> such as oven and sun <b>drying</b> <b>methods.</b> For the studies on oven drying of cocoa beans, the drying parameters (T= 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C) used were similar to the conventional hot air drying parameters used in industries. The total polyphenolic contents of fermented cocoa beans dried at 70 °C was found to be the highest. The polyphenols degradation kinetics for oven <b>drying</b> <b>method</b> of cocoa beans was determined using first-order reaction kinetics model based on various drying temperatures and durations of drying. The studies on drying kinetics of fresh cocoa beans dried using oven, vacuum, adsorption and sun <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> were successfully analysed. It was found that adsorption drying and vacuum <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> <b>dried</b> cocoa beans faster than oven and sun <b>drying</b> <b>methods.</b> Two respective falling rate periods were recorded by adsorption and vacuum drying. The effective diffusivities were determined and were found to be in accordance to that of published literatures. Hot water blanching pre-treatment were performed for fresh and fermented cocoa beans (whole beans and half cut). Blanching pre-treatment method was found to show significantly higher total polyphenolic contents when compared with unblanched cocoa samples. The optimal blanching parameter (90 °C for 5 min) obtained for fresh beans were subsequently used for experiments involving fresh cocoa beans. The total polyphenolic contents and antioxidant activity of blanched and unblanched cocoa beans were analysed. Results showed that both adsorption and vacuum <b>drying</b> <b>methods</b> showed high recovery of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidants on comparison with freeze dried cocoa samples, which was used as a benchmark in quality analysis of food products. High polyphenols contents were achieved after the blanching and drying treatments and were noted to be significantly higher on comparison with published literatures. Sensory analysis of both blanched and unblanched cocoa beans were analysed after drying using various <b>drying</b> <b>methods.</b> The results for unfermented cocoa beans showed high astringency flavour attributes which further confirmed the high contents of polyphenols in cocoa beans. The cocoa and acidic flavour attributes were recorded to be less owing to the unfermented nature of cocoa beans. The results obtained provides a gateway towards the use of advanced drying technology in cocoa industry. The potential of blanching pre-treatment to mediate high recovery of cocoa polyphenols after drying has been proven through this work. The processing methods used in the current study can be implemented in on-farm cocoa processing, making it a more sustainable farming option...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} pinning insect {{specimens}} is a <b>dry</b> <b>method</b> {{to preserve and}} display collections and requires special entomological equipment to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off. Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point {{they will be more}} brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just {{to the right of the}} mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning.

This new method will allow increase industrial use of ash: as long as it remains dry, it can be used in road construction, building materials, agriculture etc. The new Dry Ash Removal System is connected to the railway, which makes it possible to ship the dry ash to clients both by rail and by road. DARS potentially allows the shipping to clients of all of the ash produced by the power plant, namely up to five million tonnes per year. All ash that is not immediately requested by clients, is transported by a 4.5 km-long closed pipe conveyor belt to the ash lagoon, where ash stacks are levelled and compressed, preventing dry ash from flying away. Finally, a layer of loam is applied to the stack surface, and green grass is seeded.|$|E
