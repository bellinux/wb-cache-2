5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the <b>end</b> <b>part</b> of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E

25|$|The cyclic prefix, {{which is}} {{transmitted}} during the guard interval, {{consists of the}} end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval, and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol. The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy {{of the end of}} the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM demodulation with the FFT. In some standards such as Ultrawideband, in the interest of transmitted power, cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval. The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the <b>end</b> <b>part</b> of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion.|$|E
500|$|Memorial Park, the {{northern}} part of which has existed as parkland since the 19th century, as shown by the ordnance Survey maps of 1864 and 1867, was formally laid out after World War II was extended after the floods of 1968. It covers [...] of woodland and grass alongside the River Chew. It commemorates the war dead of Keynsham and includes facilities including two children's play areas, a skateboard park, multi-sport area, bowling green, public toilets, a bandstand and refreshment kiosk. The formal gardens within the park are adjacent to the River Chew with the Dapps Hill Woods at its western <b>end.</b> <b>Part</b> of the park is known locally as Chew Park because of its proximity to the River and another area, close to Keynsham Abbey as Abbey Park. The park received the Green Flag Award in 2008/09, and again for 2009/10.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Dale {{replaced}} Peter Davison in {{the lead}} role of King Arthur in the London West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at the Palace Theatre.

It was not his first experience in musical theatre because he appeared in a 1984 Australian production of Applause, but Dale found the comic timing of the part to be the hardest task. [...] "On stage, the battle is to find all of the humorous moments and not skip over them. [...] There's an art to Python humour and I'm aiming to try and get every single joke just right." [...] He was succeeded in the role by Sanjeev Bhaskar on 23 June 2008.|$|E
