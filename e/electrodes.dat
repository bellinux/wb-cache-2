5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile <b>electrodes,</b> coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. <b>Electrodes</b> containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen <b>electrodes,</b> are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. <b>Electrodes</b> coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two <b>electrodes</b> to apply {{pressure}} and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed <b>electrodes,</b> wheel-shaped <b>electrodes</b> roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E

The auxiliary <b>electrode</b> tries to keep the reference <b>electrode</b> at a certain reduction potential and to do this it has to balance the working <b>electrode.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{time taken}} for a muscle {{supplied}} by the pudendal nerve to contract {{in response to an}} electrical stimulus applied to the sensory and motor fibers can be quantified. Increased conduction time (terminal motor latency) signifies damage to the nerve. 2 stimulating <b>electrodes</b> and 2 measuring <b>electrodes</b> are mounted on the examiner's gloved finger ("St Mark's electrode").|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different <b>electrodes,</b> the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns <b>electrodes</b> with a four- or five-digit number. Covered <b>electrodes</b> made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze <b>electrodes,</b> implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill <b>electrodes,</b> implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
25|$|The SHE <b>electrode</b> can be {{connected}} to any other <b>electrode</b> by a salt bridge to form a cell. If the second <b>electrode</b> is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the standard <b>electrode</b> potential for the <b>electrode.</b> The standard <b>electrode</b> potential for the SHE is zero, by definition. The polarity of the standard <b>electrode</b> potential provides information about the relative reduction potential of the <b>electrode</b> compared to the SHE. If the <b>electrode</b> has a positive potential {{with respect to the}} SHE, then that means it is a strongly reducing <b>electrode</b> which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a standard <b>electrode</b> potential of 0.337 V). Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the <b>electrode</b> is more oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO4 where the standard <b>electrode</b> potential is −0.76 V).|$|R

5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated <b>electrodes.</b> Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early <b>electrodes</b> from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating <b>electrodes</b> while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E

On the other hand, a catalyst-coated glassy carbon (GC) <b>electrode</b> (3  mm in diameter) was employed as the working <b>electrode.</b> Before the preparation of the working <b>electrode,</b> the GC <b>electrode</b> was polished using an alumina slurry of 0.05  μm.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide an {{overview}} of current debate on the monophasic action potential (MAP) recording technique, specifically whether the depolarizing or the reference <b>electrode</b> is responsible for recording the MAP waveform. A literature search was made using key words including monophasic action potential, MAP, electrophysiological basis, recording <b>electrode,</b> depolarizing <b>electrode,</b> contact <b>electrode,</b> indifferent <b>electrode,</b> and reference <b>electrode.</b> References from articles were screened for additional relevant papers. Articles published by the different experimental groups claim that depolarizing <b>electrode,</b> but not reference <b>electrode,</b> records MAPs from the myocardium. This can be more accurately described when considering biophysical theory, which states that MAP is a bipolar signal with contributions from not only the depolarizing <b>electrode</b> but also remote activation at the reference <b>electrode.</b> It is not meaningful to claim that one is the recording <b>electrode</b> because potential differences must be measured between two points in space. Nevertheless, the MAP technique is useful for assessing the local electrical activity of the myocardium in contact with the depolarizing <b>electrode.</b> It is important to have the recording <b>electrode</b> in close proximity with the reference <b>electrode</b> to minimize contamination from far-field signals. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, <b>electrodes</b> of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use <b>electrodes</b> with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel <b>electrodes</b> are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E

An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable <b>electrodes</b> must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special <b>electrodes</b> have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
