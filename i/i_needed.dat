5|$|<b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character <b>I</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{underlay}} {{the termination}} of the longest period of peace the Eastern Roman and the Sassanid Empire ever enjoyed. The Persian king Kavadh <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> money to pay his debts to the Hephthalites who had helped him regain his throne in 498/499. The situation was exacerbated by recent changes {{in the flow of}} the Tigris in lower Mesopotamia, sparking famines and flood. When the Roman emperor Anastasius I refused to provide any help, Kavadh tried to gain the money by force.|$|E

In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E
25|$|As {{the founder}} of a new royal dynasty, Charles <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to build a royal {{residence}} that could function as {{the seat of his}} government. He commissioned architect Pietro de Caulis to design the Castel Nuovo (1279–87), which was to serve as the residence of the kings and queens of Naples. Charles I provided funding for the rebuilding of the Franciscan church of San Lorenzo Maggiore, an early example of the Neapolitan adaptation of the French Gothic style. While the tracery designs at San Lorenzo Maggiore were inspired by the French Gothic church of Saint Denis, its “cavernous nave and its unarticulated walls” show the influence of Italian Franciscan churches.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} months of World War I, Kars was a key {{military}} objective for the Ottoman army. Ismail Enver who pushed the Ottoman Empire into World War <b>I,</b> <b>needed</b> a victory against the Russians to defend his position. He collected an army on the eastern border. The army was badly defeated under Enver's command at the Battle of Sarikamish January 2, 1915 against Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich. This defeat was more due to the winter weather and bad planning, given the fact that Russians were actually preparing to evacuate Kars. With the loss of the eastern army, Ottoman defenses crumbled with further small battles and the Russian army succeeded in advancing as far west as Erzincan.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{have much}} time. July was half through, and <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{to get a}} new forty-odd-person team assembled, trained, and {{deployed}} prior to Butler's arrival in Iraq on August 2. We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>needed</b> good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E

500|$|EMI's Parlophone label {{released}} Rubber Soul on 3 December 1965, with [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone" [...] sequenced as the penultimate track. In the United States – where Capitol Records typically {{altered the}} content of the Beatles' albums, reducing the number of songs and using single A- and B-sides to create further album releases – the track instead appeared on the North American album Yesterday and Today in June 1966. The song was widely considered to be Harrison's best composition to date; according to music critic Richie Unterberger, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone" [...] and [...] "Think for Yourself", which also appeared on the UK version of Rubber Soul, were the first Harrison-written songs [...] "to really make people sit up and notice". In his review for the NME, Allen Evans described it as [...] "a quick-tempo up-beater" [...] and a [...] "more-ish track". McCartney later said he considered [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone" [...] to be the first of Harrison's [...] "landmark" [...] songs for the group.|$|E

500|$|Loup {{was born}} December 19, 1987, in Raceland, Louisiana. His father and {{grandfather}} influenced his baseball interest the most when he was young, {{and he says that}} it was [...] "just all baseball all the time", with [...] "a little football". Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. I was always doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and knew that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to work hard to get there. As a kid, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to be reminded of that sometimes." [...] His baseball role models growing up were Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} band's UK tour in December 1965, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone" [...] {{replaced}} [...] "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby", written by Carl Perkins, as Harrison's vocal {{spot in the}} Beatles' live shows. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone" [...] thereby became the only Harrison composition that the Beatles played in concert during their touring years. In addition, with the group finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} replicate their studio recordings in concert, it was one of only two Rubber Soul tracks that they performed live, the other being [...] "Nowhere Man". The song's inclusion in their set list throughout 1966 marked the only time that Harrison continued to use his Rickenbacker 360/12 on stage during the group's final year as live performers. In their concerts that year, McCartney introduced Indian-style melisma into his singing on [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone", similar to the vocal ornamentation he had used on the recording of Harrison's Revolver track [...] "I Want to Tell You". In a segment subtitled [...] "Beatlemania goes sour", the 1982 documentary The Compleat Beatles used a clip from the Beatles' ragged performance of the song, at the Budokan Hall in Tokyo, as an illustration of the growing division between the band as recording artists and live performers.|$|E
