A survey of past location studies was initially conducted to investigate the numerous models location analysts had employed in pinpointing the best site. Characteristics of past location models were subsequently analyzed and classified to identify their advantages and disadvantages, which were used as the bases for formulating the linear additive multi-attribute utility location model. The model assures quality of strategic decision-making on site selection via the multi-criteria evaluation of candidate locations. The prime strength of the model lies in its ability to incorporate subjective, judgmental inputs from management with objective, <b>factual</b> location <b>data</b> to recommend the best facility location...|$|R
