500|$|The {{question}} of whether the Citizenship Clause applied to persons born in the United States to Chinese immigrants first came before the courts in an 1884 case, In re Look Tin Sing. [...] Look Tin Sing was born in Mendocino, California in 1870, but after returning from a trip to China in 1884, he was barred from reentering the United States by officials who objected to his not having met the <b>documentation</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed at the time on Chinese immigrants. [...] Look's case was heard in the federal circuit court for California by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field and two other federal judges. [...] Lucy Salyer, a history professor at the University of New Hampshire, writes that Justice Field [...] "issued an open invitation to all lawyers in the area to give their opinions on the constitutional questions involved" [...] in the case. [...] Field focused on the meaning of the subject to the jurisdiction thereof phrase of the Citizenship Clause, held that Look was indeed subject to U.S. jurisdiction {{at the time of his}} birth despite the alien status of his parents, and on this basis ordered U.S. officials to recognize Look as a citizen and allow him to enter the United States. [...] The Look Tin Sing ruling was not appealed and was never reviewed by the Supreme Court. A similar conclusion was reached by the federal circuit court for Oregon in the 1888 cases of Ex parte Chin King and Ex parte Chan San Hee.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe steady {{consideration}} of requirements {{during the development}} of new products {{remains one of the most}} difficult and challenging tasks in every development process. Within these considerations, quality criteria are existing for the structured formulation and <b>documentation</b> of <b>requirements</b> in requirements lists. Existing approaches focus on the completeness of requirements during the product development process. But contrarily, the effectiveness and efficiency of product development processes are mainly influenced by a structurally conducted and systematic requirement acquisition and <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation</b> to form a reliable base for the entire development process and to support development of optimised products in special applications. The paper presents the results of a systematic literature analysis of existing quality criteria for the formulation of requirements. Often, quality criteria are not assigned with precise definitions for a clear conceptual understanding. They allow a large room for interpretation, for which reason they cannot be used as a uniform base for a systematic <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation.</b> However, quality criteria are partially competitive and even occasionally contradictory. Every developer who is involved in the acquisition and <b>documentation</b> of <b>requirements</b> is lost in the inscrutable jungle of quality criteria. In addition, the quality criteria are unstructured according to their content and formal structure. Furthermore, the paper offers a systematic and critically reflected reduction of existing quality criteria for the formulation and <b>documentation</b> of <b>requirements</b> that are differentiated according to content and formal structure of requirements. The paper provides a compacted spectrum of quality criteria without synonymously used quality criteria, underpinned with a differentiated conceptual understanding and prioritisation of each relevant quality criterion. Thus, a valuable base for the formally supported <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation</b> in the <b>requirements</b> list is provid- ed...|$|R

50|$|The {{need for}} <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation</b> is {{typically}} {{related to the}} complexity of the product, the impact of the product, and the life expectancy of the software. If the software is very complex or developed by many people (e.g., mobile phone software), requirements can help to better communicate what to achieve. If the software is safety-critical and can have negative impact on human life (e.g., nuclear power systems, medical equipment, mechanical equipment), more formal <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation</b> is often required. If the software is expected to live for only a month or two (e.g., very small mobile phone applications developed specifically for a certain campaign) very little <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation</b> may be needed. If the software is a first release that is later built upon, <b>requirements</b> <b>documentation</b> is very helpful when managing the change of the software and verifying that nothing has been broken in the software when it is modified.|$|R
