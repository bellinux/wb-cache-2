There exists the possibility that the operator may forget to close a valve located upstream of the <b>filling</b> <b>hose,</b> which is a crucial part of the procedure; if overlooked, this could result in adverse consequences, of greater effect to the operator in control. The primary human error of concern in this situation is ‘failure to close V0204 prior to decoupling filling hose’. The decoupling operation required to be conducted is a fairly easy task to carry out and does not require to be completed in conjunction with any further tasks; therefore is failure occurs it will have a catastrophic impact as opposed to displaying effects in a gradual manner.|$|R
50|$|On 17 December 2005 two firefighters from Tübingen, Germany, died {{inside a}} burning {{building}} {{when one of}} the hoses inside the building burst and they were left without extinguishing agent. In the following reconstruction of the tragedy, experts were surprised to find out that CAFS <b>filled</b> <b>hoses</b> are more likely to burst under heat because the foam is unable to cool the hoses sufficiently.|$|R
50|$|Corrugated hoses {{are used}} as economical, {{flexible}} connecting elements that permit movement, thermal expansion and vibrations, {{and that can be}} used as <b>filling</b> <b>hoses.</b> The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. Corrugated hoses are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or gases under pressure or as vacuum lines. They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and pressure resistance.|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or <b>filling</b> <b>hose.</b> Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|R
50|$|When diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} the gas inside them warms {{as a result}} of adiabatic heating. When the gas cools by losing heat to the surroundings, the pressure will drop as described by the general gas equation and Gay-Lussac's law. Divers, to maximise their dive time, generally want their cylinders filled to their safe capacity, the working pressure. To provide the diver with a cylinder filled to the working pressure at the nominal temperature of 15 or 20 °C, the cylinder and gas must be kept cool when filling or filled to a pressure such that when it cools it is at the working pressure. This is known as the developed pressure for the filling temperature. Health and safety regulations and pressure vessel design standards may limit the working temperature of the cylinder, commonly to 65 °C, in which case the cylinder must be filled slowly enough to avoid exceeding the maximum working temperature. Cylinders are often filled at a rate of less than 1 bar (100 kPa or 15 lbf/in²) per second to allow time for heat transfer to the surroundings to limit this increase in temperature. As a method to remove heat faster when filling the cylinder, some filling stations “wet fill” cylinders immersed in a bath of cold water. There is an increased risk of internal cylinder corrosion caused by moisture from the wet environment entering the cylinder due to contamination during connection of the <b>filling</b> <b>hose</b> during wet <b>filling.</b>|$|R

40|$|Permeation of {{chemicals}} {{through the walls}} of air-supply hoses used with respirators is an under-recognised problem in industry. Transport {{of chemicals}} through {{the wall of a}} hose occurs {{in the same manner as}} through gloves and chemical suits, driven by the chemical concentration gradient, but for air-supply hoses the chemical evaporating inside the air-supply hose is inhaled. A simple method based on the mathematical equivalence of <b>filling</b> a <b>hose</b> with a chemical to immersing it in a chemical has been developed. The method requires a short section of <b>hose</b> to be <b>filled,</b> plugged and weighed at intervals to determine the breakthrough time and permeation rate per meter.

50|$|Nozzles are {{attached}} to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle's <b>filling</b> inlet. The <b>hoses</b> are robust to survive heavy wear and tear, including exposure to weather and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the nozzle and hose to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler, although this is largely prevented today by the point-of-sale systems not allowing payment for fuel until the nozzle is returned to its petrol pump holder.|$|R
5000|$|... "Helitack" [...] {{is the use}} of {{helicopters}} to combat wildland fires. The helicopters are used for aerial firefighting (water bombing) and may be fitted with tanks or carry helibuckets. Helibuckets, such as the Bambi bucket, are usually filled by submerging the bucket into lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. Tanks fitted onto helicopters are <b>filled</b> from a <b>hose</b> while the helicopter is on the ground or water is siphoned from lakes or reservoirs through a hanging snorkel as the helicopter hovers over the water source. Helitack helicopters are also used to deliver firefighters, who rappel down to inaccessible areas, and to resupply firefighters. Common firefighting helicopters include variants of the Bell 205 and the Erickson S-64 Aircrane helitanker.|$|R
40|$|Compressed air foam fire {{suppression}} systems (CAFS) were tested to measure the potential safety risks involved with its use compared to water. CAFS are mainly used in wildland firefighting, but could {{be more effective than}} water at extinguishing fires in interior settings. The purpose of these tests was to conclude if CAFS are safe for use in structural firefighting when compared to water. The tests conducted included measuring the nozzle reaction force, force required to kink a hose, force of friction on different walking surfaces, and the time required for foam and water to separate within a pressurized segment of hose. Nozzle reaction force was measured at flow rates between 80 and 200 GPM for compressed air foam and water. At each flow rate, CAFS had a greater transient and steady reaction force than those measured for water. The force required to kink <b>hoses</b> <b>filled</b> with CAFS was significantly higher than <b>hoses</b> <b>filled</b> with water while flowing and static. On five different interior floor surfaces, the force of friction required to pull a 200 pound weighted fire boot decreased when wet with water and when covered with CAFS. The tendency for the foam structure to break down and separate within a hose was tested using a 32 foot clear PVC pipe apparatus. After being filled with compressed air foam and timing the separation of solution from water, results concluded that separation of foam occurs {{over a long period of}} time that does not pose a threat in a real life situation. The average time for homogeneous flow to re-establish after the allowed separation was 3. 6 seconds...|$|R
50|$|In June 1987, Diaz Herrera was {{forcibly}} retired by Noriega, who it {{was rumored}} felt threatened by Diaz who had grown in influence and respect within the Panamanian Defense Forces (FDP). Noriega justified the move based on the age of Colonel Diaz Herrera who turned 50 years old that month. Following his forced retirement, {{in an interview with}} Panama's leading opposition newspaper, La Prensa, Colonel Díaz made a strong declaration against Noriega. He accused Noriega of drug trafficking; of planning the assassination of his predecessor Omar Torrijos Herrera who negotiated the return of the Panama Canal with Jimmy Carter (Torrijos was Diaz Herrera's own cousin, and claimed Noriega had planted an explosive in the private aircraft of Torrijos {{with the help of the}} CIA); of ordering the killing of Hugo Spadafora, Diaz Herrera's personal friend; and of orchestrating fraud in the 1984 presidential election. These allegations led many people in Panama to protest, resulting in a suspension of constitutional protections and austere measure by the Noriega regime including arrest and detainment of protestors and opposition party leaders, government seizure of local television stations, and tear gassing of students and accused brutality of local citizens with batons, rubber <b>hoses</b> <b>filled</b> with sand, and shotguns filled with rock salt.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse {{alternative}} discharging methods of HVDC cables for a DC test in a real situation. It is necessary to research relevant data and consult contacts in order to solve the task. The project {{is based on the}} implementation of a developed system on the testing object and preceded by tests in the High Voltage Laboratory in Karlskrona. Simultaneously the main requirement is to completely exclude any human contribution in the discharging process of the DC cable and to maintain the highest safety standards in line with ABB policy. Currently the discharge process after DC testing is completed manually. Testing is carried out by increasing the voltage until the test voltage is reached and kept constant throughout the test period. Followed by switching off the voltage and allowing the cable to initially self-discharge, before it forces the discharge through the discharging water resistor. When the voltage is zero, cable termination ground by providing a secure grounding. Initially the cable charges out through self-discharge and this must continue down to the Uo. To avoid damaging the test object by maintaining the voltage for too long, discharge can begin after 45 minutes if the voltage drops below under 1, 2 Uo. The forced discharge occurs by an earth rod connecting the discharge resistance to the ground. Past tests have shown the occasional use of a linked up Water Conditioning Unit system consisting of the pump and filters to ground out by <b>hoses</b> <b>filled</b> with deionized water.

40|$|Increasing {{regulation}} {{on emissions}} {{and a general}} trend towards more environmentally friendly solutions has motivated the researchers {{to look for ways}} to make mobile machinery more efficient. Excavators particularly are a remarkable source of pollution due to the vast amount and the low efficiency of these machines. Excavators are ordinarily equipped with conventional, centralized hydraulic system, where main pump supplies volumetric flow for the whole system. This flow is directed from the pump to actuators through control valves, and the returning flow is directed into the tank. Conventional hydraulic system has numerous disadvantages. Many supportive functions are required, including pressure control and load-sensing functions. Even on idle mode, there are flow losses due to continuous circulation of fluid through valves. In addition, the distance between pumps and actuators may be long, which causes pressure loss and an additional weight of long <b>hoses</b> <b>filled</b> with fluid. One proposed improvement is the use of displacement-controlled hydraulics, in which the actuator control is realized by sophisticated pump control, instead of metering the flow in directional valves. In this work, the efficiency of a modified JCB micro excavator is studied. Excavator is fitted with pressure and position sensors, and the simulation model is verified with laboratory measurements. The literature on the topic is reviewed to find the best practises concerning the studies on mobile machinery efficiency, including standardized duty cycles. The hydraulic system of the excavator is modelled in Matlab Simulink, and the simulation model is utilized to calculate the power consumption of the excavator during a digging and loading and a levelling cycle. Further simulation study is produced by replacing the conventional hydraulic system with displacement-controlled units, namely direct-driven hydraulics, or DDH’s. The same duty cycles are performed with both systems, and the results are presented. The study shows a power loss of as much as 60 % in the directional valve group. A total power consumption of the DDH system is less than 10 % of the consumption of conventional system, during two different free-space duty cycles. Subsequently, results of this study will motivate for further research and manufacturing a working prototype...|$|R
