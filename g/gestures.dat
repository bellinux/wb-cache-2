5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} <b>gestures</b> which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the <b>gestures</b> (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic <b>gestures</b> are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent <b>gestures</b> three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

But that is not what we find. When <b>gesture</b> {{is produced}} on its own and assumes the full burden of communication, it takes on a language-like form. In contrast, when <b>gesture</b> is produced in conjunction with speech and shares the burden of com-munication with that speech, it takes on an unsegmented...|$|R
40|$|In the Gospel {{according}} to John, Jesus identifies Judas as the traitor {{in a highly}} dramatic fashion by handing him a morsel. Although Johannine scholars do not often comment on this <b>gesture,</b> in cases where they do, one finds a surprisingly wide range of interpretations, for example, it is interpreted as a <b>gesture</b> denoting Judas as an outsider, a <b>gesture</b> of friendship, a <b>gesture</b> indicating baptism or the eucharist, even a <b>gesture</b> indicating that Judas shares eucharist with the Satan. In this article the interpretation of this <b>gesture</b> is considered. After {{a discussion of the}} characterisation of Judas in the Gospel {{according to}} John, the <b>gesture</b> itself is considered. Its possible background in antiquity is discussed, which is then followed by an interpretation of the <b>gesture</b> as a <b>gesture</b> of friendship.

5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, <b>gestures,</b> and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and <b>gestures</b> such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of <b>gestures</b> and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—considering the {{deficiency}} of accurate hand <b>gesture</b> contour inaccessible and inefficiency in complex dynamic background in existing methods of hand <b>gesture</b> tracking, a two dimensional skin color probability forecast method is proposed. Based on this, a hand <b>gesture</b> segmentation method of multi-mode and a hand <b>gesture</b> tracking method of state estimation are extended. When hand <b>gesture</b> is segmented, {{to locate the}} accurate hand <b>gesture</b> position, this paper combines the Skin Color Probability distribution with the statistical motion information of image blocking. Then the hand region is initiated by the region growth method and the hand <b>gesture</b> segmentation is realized. When hand <b>gesture</b> is tracked, the pixel’s state model is built to estimate the state of pixels after watershed computation. Then the current blocking frame is adaptive threshold segmented and the hand <b>gesture</b> tracking is realized. Experiments show that this method has a strong anti-noise ability in complex background. In addition, it has a better application effect in segment and tracking the hand <b>gesture</b> contour accurately in a real-time way.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the effects of <b>gesture</b> {{instruction}} on the communication abilities of a student with autism. The multiple probe across settings of the single-case approach was conducted. The independent variable was <b>gesture</b> instruction, and the dependent variable was communication behaviour including the frequency of motoric <b>gesture</b> communication and deictic <b>gesture</b> communication. The participant accepted the experimental treatment of baseline, processing and maintenance phase one by one. Visual inspection was employed to assess the treatment effects of <b>gesture</b> instruction on this student. Results of this study showed that <b>gesture</b> instruction enhanced the frequency of the student’s deictic <b>gesture</b> communication behaviour. The treatment effects could be maintained for two weeks and be generalized to another situation. Additionally, <b>gesture</b> instruction decreased the frequency of the student’s motoric <b>gesture</b> communication behaviour and the treatment effects could be maintained for two weeks. After intervention, both teachers and parents interviewed indicated positive attitudes toward the <b>gesture</b> instruction, and confirmed the improvement on communication performance of this student...|$|R

40|$|Hand <b>gesture</b> {{interpretation}} {{is an open}} research problem in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), which involves locating <b>gesture</b> boundaries (<b>Gesture</b> Spotting) in a continuous video sequence and recognizing the <b>gesture.</b> Existing techniques model each <b>gesture</b> as a temporal sequence of visual features extracted from individual frames which is not efficient due to the large variability of frames at different timestamps. In this paper, we propose a new sub-gesture modeling approach which represents each <b>gesture</b> as a sequence of fixed sub-gestures (a group of consecutive frames with locally coherent context) and provides a robust modeling of the visual features. We further extend this approach {{to the task of}} <b>gesture</b> spotting where the <b>gesture</b> boundaries are identified using a filler model and gesturecompletion model. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) based methods and baseline <b>gesture</b> spotting techniques. 1...|$|R

5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual <b>gestures,</b> diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their <b>gestures</b> are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
