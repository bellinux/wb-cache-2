2500|$|Egyptologists {{who knew}} Omm Sety were {{impressed}} by her knowledge of ancient Egypt. Klaus Baer of the Oriental Institute commented that [...] "she had visions and worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods.

[...] Omm Sety was impressed by Hermann Junker, [...] "one of the elders of 20th century archaeology," [...] who had taught Selim Hassan. He advocated a more honest approach to the study of ancient Egyptian religion, believing that [...] "nobody had made a real effort to go deeply enough into it." [...] She admired his open-mindedness, especially since Junker was also a Catholic priest. [...] One noted Egyptologist, who didn't wish to be named, commented [...] "I was deeply shocked when, one night, <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> <b>a</b> party given by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry behind the Great Pyramid...and there under the full moon was Dorothy Eady belly dancing!

With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence.--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.|$|E
