The education tax, imposed after the 1972 Moscow summit of superpower leaders Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev, emboldened those who criticized the Nixon administration’s policy of Detente for downplaying concerns for human rights. Nixon's handling of the issue of Soviet Jewish emigration and US National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger's reluctance to broach the subject disappointed US Jewish activists.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the tax manipulation decision-making process—both legal uses of tax deductions and illegal tax evasion—this brief looks at the impact of gain/loss framing. Analysis of tax data confirms that tax decisions are influenced by “loss aversion. ” For instance, taxpayers are more likely to pursue tax reduction activities when they make a loss smaller, as compared to when they make a gain larger. The brief looks at tools that policymakers have at their disposal for both deterring tax evasion and making <b>exiting</b> <b>tax</b> incentives maximally effective. The brief discusses instances when such gain/loss framing interventions might be deployed, and provides estimates around the size of the revenue responses they may generate. The author estimates that if tax filers who face losses experienced the lower motivation to manipulate shown by those facing gains, annual tax revenue would increase by $ 1. 4 billion. Even attempts at marginal interventions, though smaller in predicted effects, might be financially worthwhile. [URL]...|$|R

This paper provides broader evidence of the impact of plant relocations using confidential establishment level data from the U. S.

40|$|Already {{for some}} years, exit {{taxation}} {{has been a}} hot topic, especially within the EU. While this form of taxation is widely accepted in the international sphere, it remains arguable whether it infringes the freedom of establishment and/or capital movement.

The analysis and comparison of the nature of an <b>exit</b> <b>tax,</b> mainly its tax base, and the alleged <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> currently allowed in the EU demonstrate that, as a matter of fact, when speaking of an accepted <b>exit</b> <b>tax,</b> the ECJ is prescribing a new allocation of taxing rights between the Member States...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> {{legislation}} in Chapter 22. § 5 p. 4 IL states that businesses who change its tax residence to another Member State within the EES are taxed as having its assets {{sold at the}} time of the change of domicile. This legislation was declared incompatible with the freedom of establishment in case RÅ 2009 ref. 30 due to the fact that businesses who changed tax residence were treated worse than businesses that remained within the Member State of origin. Of importance for the outcome of the case was the fact that ECJ had declared <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> incompatible with the freedom of establishment in two previous cases. In connection with RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the Commission also addressed requirements for Sweden to abolish the restrictive legislation through a reasoned opinion. In the aftermath of RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the legislator drafted a suggestion for new legislation which aimed to make the exit tag {{legislation in}} IL compatible with the freedom of establishment. The legislator made clear that the communication from the Commission on exit taxation was of great significance in formulating the legislation, particularly the requirement from the Commission that <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> ought not to lead to immediate tax consequences for the businesses. The suggested legislation made businesses able to defer payment of the <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> by introducing a new chapter in SBL. Thus did not the wording of the <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> legislation in IL change. The suggested legislation was heavily criticized by the respondents in the preparatory legislation and also in legal doctrine. The legislation was, however, adopted and the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL came into force 1 January 2010. The question that arises is whether this addition to the <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> legislation is a sufficient action to achieve the objective of the legislation. It can be concluded that the situation for businesses changing tax residence is not significantly affected by the introduction of the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL. The fact remains that business changing tax residence still are adversely affected due to the fact that taxation occurs on the exit date, which can have the effect of these businesses being taxed in an earlier phase than resident businesses. Consequently the legislation continue to impose immediate tax consequences in certain cases. The fact that the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by placing the time of taxation at the real disposal of the assets makes the legislation disproportionate. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the conditions which the deferment is associated with should be seen as proportionate either. Due to the fact that it is ascertain that the conditions in some cases can be costly in terms of valuation costs and that the purpose of the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by applying directives in the field of mutual assistance and recovery of claims instead of an annual deferment procedure. The conditions could therefore be considered disproportionate in relation to the purpose of the legislation. Nevertheless, the main reason for arguing that the Swedish <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> legislation should be considered as incompatible with the freedom of establishment is the fact that the legislation does not take full account of the taxed assets potential decrease in value, capable of arising after the businesses transfer of tax residence. Through ECJ-case law it can be noted that decrease in value must be taken into account by either the state of origin or the host state to be considered proportionate. The Swedish <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> legislation is therefore incompatible with the freedom of establishment in all cases where the host state does not take notice of such decrease in value...|$|E

Our key finding is that induced structural change in favor of the less energy intensive, more labor intensive industries is more pronounced under imperfect competition than under perfect competition.

40|$|M. Comm. (International Taxation) Under the South African {{income tax}} system, para 12 of the Eighth Schedule states that, {{when a person}} ceases to be a resident, he/she is deemed to have {{disposed}} of his/her worldwide assets (subject to certain exclusions) at market value the day before he/she terminates his/her residency. Such deemed disposal triggers {{a capital gains tax}} charge. Commonly referred to as the ‘exit tax’, it has been in place since the introduction of capital gains tax on 1 October 2001. A recent ruling in the Supreme Court of Appeals found that according to article 13 of a double tax agreement (hereafter “DTA”) based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Model Tax Convention, a deemed disposal is regarded as an alienation of property, and (provided the exclusions do not apply) exclusive taxing rights are given to the Resident State. This has the effect to include the deemed disposal rules relating to exit taxes under this article and potentially override the application of an <b>exit</b> <b>tax</b> under domestic legislation. The override of exit taxes based on a DTA can deprive a country of its fair share of taxes and there is no protection for a country’s tax base.

A number of placebo and falsification tests suggest that our inferences are not confounded by other factors. For example, the results are specific to the mediating variable used, and our identification strategy is sharpened by a triple-difference specification which rules out alternative fiscal explanations and an instrumental variables technique that leverages instruments found to influence tax policy by the political economy literature.
