Much of what follows about the battle itself is modern supposition.|$|E
25|$|The role of OSM as an {{inflammatory}} mediator was clear {{as early as}} 1986. Its precise effect on the immune system, as with any cytokine, <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> However, two schools of thought are emerging: The first proposes that OSM is pro-inflammatory; whilst the other holds the opposite view, claiming OSM is anti-inflammatory. It {{is important to note}} that before 1997 differences in human and murine OSM receptor usage were unknown. As a result, several investigators utilised human OSM in mouse assays and thus any conclusion drawn from the results of these experiments will be representative of LIF, i.e. signalling through gp130/LIFR complexes.|$|E

500|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{says that}} a dispute between Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, and Karl Hundason began when Karl Hundason became [...] "King of Scots" [...] and claimed Caithness.

2500|$|Within {{works by}} Frege and Bertrand Russell, are ideas {{influential}} to {{the invention of}} truth tables.

Besides Frege and Russell, others credited with having ideas preceding truth-tables include Philo, Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Ernst Schröder. Others credited with the tabular structure include Jan Łukasiewicz, Ernst Schröder, Alfred North Whitehead, William Stanley Jevons, John Venn, and Clarence Irving Lewis.

Hranislav had {{to spend at least}} a few years imprisoned in Constantinople before Michael's son and next Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos released him. Andronikos desired to make use of Hranislav's military talents and elevated him to the status of megas tzaousios.

2500|$|The {{place of}} the divi among state deities <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> They had {{precedent}} in the di parentes, who were elevated to [...] "godhead" [...] by their sons and accorded ancestral rites, but dead ancestors, no matter how honoured, remained manes of the underworld. A mortal did not normally possess the divine power (numen), which according to Gradel [...] "can also be synonymous with deus". Official divi were politico-religious creations of the senate {{or at least the}} senate played a formal role in their creation. As long as the correct rituals and sacrifice were offered, the divus would be received by the heavenly gods as a coelicola (a dweller in heaven), a lesser being than themselves. What the divus was supposed to be or do in heaven was left to imagination, not theology. Popular belief held that the divus Augustus would be personally welcomed by Jupiter but in Seneca's Apocolocyntosis, the unexpected arrival of Augustus' equally divine descendant Claudius creates a problem for the Olympians. They have no idea who or what he is and when they find out, they cannot think what to do with him. Seneca's sarcastic wit, an unacceptable impiety towards a deus, freely portrays the divus Claudius as just a dead, ridiculous and possibly quite bad emperor.|$|E
2500|$|First, the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004, require {{undertakings}} with 50 or {{more employees}} to inform and consult on probable {{developments in the}} enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies. Employees must voluntarily initiate an [...] "information and consultation procedure". If they do, but employers cannot find a negotiated agreement, a [...] "standard procedure" [...] model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having {{the right to be}} consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council. A negotiated agreement can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue [...] "with a view to reaching an agreement". This is [...] "an obligation to negotiate", similar to a duty to bargain in good faith. To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a [...] "pre-existing" [...] council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees. If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants to keep it that way, a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure. For example, in Stewart v Moray Council, after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on information and consultation. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer's claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to £75,000 for failure to comply with the rules, though it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> this is sufficient to ensure an [...] "effective remedy" [...] under EU law.|$|E

60|$|The rest of {{the history}} of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell is a history of his Parliaments. His first one not {{pleasing}} him at all, he waited until the five months were out, and then dissolved it. The next was better suited to his views; and from that he desired to get--if he could with safety to himself--the title of King. He had had this in his mind some time: whether because he thought that the English people, being more used to the title, were more likely to obey it; or whether because he really wished to be a king himself, and to leave the succession to that title in his family, <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> He was already as high, in England and in all the world, as he would ever be, and I doubt if he cared for the mere name. However, a paper, called the 'Humble Petition and Advice,' was presented to him by the House of Commons, praying him to take a high title and to appoint his successor. That he would have taken the title of King there is no doubt, but for the strong opposition of the army. This induced him to forbear, and to assent only to the other points of the petition. Upon which occasion there was another grand show in Westminster Hall, when the Speaker of the House of Commons formally invested him with a purple robe lined with ermine, and presented him with a splendidly bound Bible, and put a golden sceptre in his hand. The next time the Parliament met, he called a House of Lords of sixty members, as the petition gave him power to do; but as that Parliament did not please him either, and would not proceed to the business of the country, he jumped into a coach one morning, took six Guards with him, and sent them to the right-about. I wish this had been a warning to Parliaments to avoid long speeches, and do more work.|$|E
