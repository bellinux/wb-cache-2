25|$|Polling {{throughout}} the primary campaign consistently showed Dean either in first place, or second behind <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt.</b> However, last minute surges by rivals John Kerry and John Edwards {{as well as}} negative campaigning between the Dean and Gephardt campaigns resulted in an 11th hour slump for both campaigns. In a poll released by the Des Moines Register just before Caucus Day, Dean registered in third place with 20%, behind Kerry with 26%, and Edwards with 23%, but ahead of <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> with 18%.|$|E

25|$|On July 11, Gingrich {{met with}} senior Republican {{leadership}} {{to assess the}} situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, {{there would be a}} new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as {{the only member of the}} leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of a 1996 Ethics Committee probe of then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, which cited the Speaker for {{providing}} false information under oath to a House committee, Leach broke ranks with tradition and voted against his party's nominee for Speaker in the subsequent Congress. In one of the few occasions in the 20th century when any party division was recorded on the initial leadership organizing votes on the House floor, he voted for the former Republican leader, Bob Michel, and received two votes himself, causing Leach to take a distant third in the contest for Speaker of the 105th Congress behind Gingrich and the Democratic nominee, <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress {{sought to}} simplify the tax system by {{eliminating}} many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and {{reducing the number of}} tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the decrease in deductions and decrease in rates, raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.|$|E

5000|$|The Oprahization of {{politics}} {{refers to the}} tendency for politicians to characterize themselves as having lived a life of suffering and tragedy {{as a means of}} appealing to the emotions of voters. This was embodied by the phrase [...] "I feel your pain", used by Bill Clinton during the 1992 United States Presidential Election. Other examples include Clinton's sharing of his life with an abusive and alcoholic stepfather, Al Gore's references to his son's car accident and sister's lung cancer, and House Representative <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt's</b> frequent recollection of weathering his son's childhood cancer as proof that he was committed to universal health care.|$|R
50|$|From 1997-98, Plouffe {{served as}} Democratic leader <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt's</b> Deputy Chief of Staff. In 1999-2000, as {{executive}} director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Plouffe led Democrats to gains that came within several thousand votes of winning back the House. He also led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to unusually high fundraising amounts, during his tenure at the DCCC. In the winter of 2000, Plouffe joined AKPD Message and Media but left briefly to serve as a strategist for Gephardt's unsuccessful Presidential bid. He returned to the firm and became a partner in February 2004. Beginning in 2003, Plouffe and fellow AKPD partner David Axelrod worked on Barack Obama's 2004 Illinois Senate campaign, beginning his association with Obama. Plouffe worked with Axelrod on the successful 2006 campaign of Deval Patrick for Governor of Massachusetts.|$|R
25|$|After Hart {{withdrew from}} the race, no clear frontrunner emerged before the {{primaries}} and caucuses began. The Iowa caucus was won by <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt,</b> who had been sagging heavily in the polls until, {{three weeks before the}} vote, he began campaigning as a populist and his numbers surged. Illinois Senator Paul M. Simon finished a surprising second, and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis finished third. In the New Hampshire primary, Dukakis came in first place, Gephardt fell to second, and Simon came in third. In an effort to weaken Gephardt's candidacy, both Dukakis and Tennessee Senator Al Gore ran negative television ads against Gephardt. The ads convinced the United Auto Workers, which had endorsed Gephardt, to withdraw their endorsement; this crippled Gephardt, as he relied heavily on the support of labor unions.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Carnahan {{ran for the}} 3rd Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives {{which was}} vacated by {{retiring}} U.S. Representative and former House Minority Leader and co-founder of the New Democratic Coalition <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt.</b> Carnahan narrowly won a crowded primary field of ten Democratic candidates in 2004 with 22.9 percent of the vote, finishing with less than 1,800 votes ahead of his nearest rival, political activist Jeff Smith, who garnered 21.3 percent. In the general election Carnahan faced Republican candidate William J. Federer, an author and Religious Right activist who had previously run against Gephardt on several occasions. The election was somewhat closer than expected. However, St. Louis's strong Democratic tilt (a Republican had not represented this district or its predecessors since 1949) helped Carnahan win with 53 percent of the vote. The district reverted to form in 2006 and Carnahan was reelected with 65 percent of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and {{continued}} through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs {{who died in a}} plane crash, and <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with Speaker Newt Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert.|$|E
5|$|Affleck has {{supported}} {{a number of}} other Democratic politicians.

He made donations to the presidential campaigns of both Dennis Kucinich and Wesley Clark in 2003. In 2005, he donated to the campaign fund of Deval Patrick, a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts. In 2006, Affleck contributed to Cory Booker's Newark mayoral campaign, and introduced Congressmen Joe Courtney and Chris Murphy at rallies in Connecticut. He donated to the 2008 Congressional campaign of Pennsylvania's Patrick Murphy, and to the 2010 Senate campaign of Kirsten Gillibrand. Affleck hosted a 2012 fundraiser for Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, endorsed her in a Progressive Change Campaign Committee video, and made a campaign donation. In 2013, he hosted a fundraiser for Senate candidate Cory Booker, and made donations to the campaigns of both Booker and Alison Lundergan Grimes. He donated to the campaign of Senate candidate Kamala Harris in 2015, and to the Congressional campaign of Melissa Gilbert in 2016.|$|R
2500|$|Carnahan’s first {{campaign}} for political office was in 1990, when he unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the 8th Congressional District against Republican U.S. Representative Bill Emerson, losing by 14 points, 57% to 43%. [...] Prior to challenging Emerson, {{by his own}} telling the then-32-year-old Carnahan had already [...] "been active in government and politics {{for most of my}} adult life." [...] Carnahan was active in several of his late father’s political campaigns, including successful bids for state treasurer (1980) and lieutenant governor (1988), and an unsuccessful race for governor (1984). [...] In January 1980, Carnahan slept for five days on the floor outside the Secretary of State’s Office in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, to ensure that his father’s name would be first on the ballot for Missouri State Treasurer when filing opened on January 8. [...] Said Carnahan, [...] "A lot of people get football tickets this way. [...] It’s {{going to be a long}} five days, so I guess we’ll get some sleeping bags and a TV in here." [...] And in 1984, when his father ran for state treasurer, Carnahan made stump speeches for him across Missouri. [...] Carnahan also had already worked for Missouri House Speaker Bob F. Griffin, Missouri Secretary of State Jim Kirkpatrick, and Missouri House Majority Leader Tony Ribaudo; had served on the executive committee of the Missouri Democratic Party; and, was the deputy Missouri campaign manager for <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt’s</b> 1988 presidential campaign.|$|R
500|$|By August 1987, Biden's campaign, whose {{messaging}} {{was confused}} due to staff rivalries, {{had begun to}} lag behind those of Michael Dukakis and <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt,</b> although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls.

Kinnock's speech included the lines: ...|$|E
500|$|In the Senate, Bradley {{acquired}} {{a reputation for}} being somewhat aloof and was thought of as a [...] "policy wonk", specializing in complex reform initiatives. Among these was the 1986 overhaul of the federal tax code, co-sponsored with <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt,</b> which reduced the tax rate schedule to just two brackets, 15 percent and 28 percent, and eliminated many kinds of deductions. Domestic policy initiatives that Bradley led or was associated with included reform of child support enforcement; legislation concerning lead-related children's health problems; the Earned Income Tax Credit; campaign finance reform; a re-apportioning of California water rights; and federal budget reform to reduce the deficit, which included, in 1981, supporting Reagan's spending cuts but opposing his parallel tax cut package, one of only three senators to take this position. He sponsored the Freedom Support Act, an exchange program between the republics of the former Soviet Union and the United States.|$|E
500|$|The National Journal {{reported}} that McGovern {{has been able}} to use his Capitol Hill experience to help position himself as [...] "a power broker in the Democratic caucus." [...] In 2001, the dying Moakley asked <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> to help McGovern attain a seat on the Rules Committee, which schedules much of the legislation for the House floor. He didn't receive that next seat, but was given a commitment for the next available Democratic seat. While on the Rules Committee, McGovern was able to use his experience with House procedures to his advantage. With Republicans comprising the majority of the panel, he [...] "showed a sharp partisan edge as he embraced parliamentary maneuvers that led to cries of outrage" [...] from House GOP members. McGovern is currently in position to take over the top Democratic position on the Rules Committee when Rep. Louise Slaughter retires.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Hastert's firm Dickstein Shapiro and the {{lobbying}} firm of former House majority leader-turned lobbyist <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> split a $1.4 million annual lobbying {{contract with the}} government of Turkey. In April 2013, Hastert and Gephardt traveled with eight members of Congress to Turkey, with all expenses paid by the Turkish government. While members of Congress are generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had [...] "meticulously" [...] followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and Gephardt [...] "allowed those members of Congress who were there to have a fuller experience." [...] A National Journal investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which [...] "lobbyists who can't legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, several House Republicans {{attempted}} to replace him as Speaker, claiming Gingrich's public image was a liability. The attempted [...] "coup" [...] began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told {{his chief of staff}} to warn Gingrich. On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as {{the only member of the}} leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.|$|E
500|$|Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark {{leading the}} Democratic field of {{candidates}} or as {{a close second}} to Howard Dean with the Gallup poll having him in {{first place in the}} presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. [...] The John Edwards campaign brought on Hugh Shelton—the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to [...] "integrity and character issues"—as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the Iowa caucuses, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The 2004 Iowa caucuses marked {{a turning point in the}} campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt</b> garnered results far lower than expected, and John Kerry and John Edwards' campaigns benefited in Clark's absence. Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, including a tie for third place with Edwards in the New Hampshire primary and a narrow victory in the Oklahoma primary over Edwards. However, he saw his third-place finishes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South, a focus of his campaign. He withdrew from the race on February 11, 2004, and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 13. Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign's biggest mistakes, saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that [...] "everything would have been different if we had [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Both the issuing and {{the lifting}} of the tariffs caused {{controversy}} in the United States. Some of the president's political opponents, such as Democratic House Representative <b>Dick</b> <b>Gephardt,</b> criticized the plan for not going far enough. For some of the president's conservative allies, imposing the tariff was a step away from Bush's commitment to free trade. Critics also contended that the tariffs would harm consumers and U.S. businesses that relied on steel imports, and would cut more jobs than it would save in the steel industry. Supporters of the tariffs believed that U.S. steel producers were being harmed by a [...] "surge" [...] of steel imports endangering the viability of American steel companies.|$|E
