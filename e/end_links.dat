60|$|Tethers, Hobbles, and Knee-halters.--Cattle may {{be secured}} at night by being tethered, hobbled, knee-haltered, or driven into an {{enclosure}} made of bushes. The {{nature of the}} country, and what dangers are apprehended, determine which plan is most advisable. A knee-haltered horse has a good change of escape if he scents a wild beast that is creeping up to him; for he can gallop, though with labour, to a short distance. A hobbled horse has no chance at all; though, indeed, they {{have been known to}} fight desperately with their teeth and feet, and learn to be cunning and watchful. If the hobbles are of iron, and made like handcuffs, it is hardly possible for robbers--at all events for savages--to unlock or cut them. A horse that is hobbled or knee-haltered, can graze during the night; but if tied up or pounded, his grass must be cut for him. A horse may be successfully hobbled with a stirrup-leather, by putting its middle round one fetlock, then twisting it half-a-dozen times, and, lastly, buckling it round the other fetlock. The hobble used by Mr. Gregory takes into five separate pieces, viz., two fetlock straps, a1, a2; a chain, b, having a swivel point, c, in the middle; and two double pot-hooks, d1, d2, which pass through eyes in the fetlock straps, and also through the <b>end</b> <b>links</b> in the chain. The two ends of both, d1 and d2, are thickened and pierced, so as to admit of tying a thong across their mouths, as shown on one side of d2. The fetlock strap is made of a strip of thick leather, folded lengthways down its middle, and having its edges sewn together. The sewn edge should always be the uppermost, when on the horse's legs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] We {{explore the}} use of {{compression}} methods to improve the middleware-based exchange of information in interactive or collaborative distributed applications. In such applications, good compression factors {{must be accompanied by}} compression speeds suitable for the data transfer rates sustainable across network links. Our approach combines methods that continuously monitor current network and processor resources and assess compression effectiveness, with techniques that automatically choose suitable compression techniques. By integrating these techniques into middleware, there is little need for end user involvement, other than expressing the target rates of data transmission. The resulting network- and useraware compression methods are evaluated experimentally across a range of network links and application data, the former ranging from low <b>end</b> <b>links</b> to homes, to wide-area Internet links, to high <b>end</b> <b>links</b> in intranets, the latter including both scientific (binary molecular dynamics data) and commercial (XML) data sets. Results attained demonstrate substantial improvements of this adaptive technique for data compression over non-adaptive approaches, where better compression methods are used when CPU loads are low and/or network links are slow, and where less effective and typically, faster compression techniques are used in high end network infrastructures.

40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of a wireless system can be significantly improved by using multiple antenna elements at the transmitter and/or the receiver side. The major problems of such systems are high cost and complexity due {{to more than one}} radio frequency (RF) chains at both <b>end</b> <b>links.</b> An effective technique to reduce this overhead is to allow the transmitter and/or the receiver to select an optimum antenna subset according to some optimization criterion. In this paper we analyze coded multiple-input/multiple output (MIMO) systems with antenna selection at the transmitter side. We propose an optimum selection criterion to minimize the Bit Error Ratio (BER) when a channel adapted quasi-orthogonal space time code (QSTBC) and a low complexity zero forcing receiver (ZF) are used. We show that antenna selection is a promising low-cost technique that provides additional diversity and coding gain and therefore improves the system performance even if the simple linear receiver is used.

40|$|AbstractThe cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibits epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC). Evidence has accumulated that both Cl− transport through CFTR Cl− channels {{and the first}} nucleotide binding domain (NBF 1) of CFTR are crucial for inhibition of ENaC. A PDZ binding domain (PDZ-BD) at the C-terminal <b>end</b> <b>links</b> CFTR to scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins, which have been suggested {{to play an important}} role in activation of CFTR and eventually inhibition of ENaC. We eliminated the PDZ-BD of CFTR and coexpressed Na+/H+-exchange regulator factors together with CFTR and ENaC. The results do not support a role of PDZ-BD in inhibition of ENaC by CFTR. However, inhibition of ENaC was closely linked to Cl− currents generated by CFTR and was observed in the presence of Cl−, I− or Br− but not gluconate. Therefore, functional NBF 1 and Cl− transport are required for inhibition of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes, while the PDZ-BD is not essential...|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{globally}} integrated Emerging technologies, {{the current}} Internet protocols uses packet-level mechanisms having end to <b>end</b> <b>links</b> {{to detect and}} react to congestion. But the regulation of best-effort traffic and congestion control is largely left to the Queue Management. Drop-tail, Random Early Detection (RED) and Random Exponential Marking are quite effective in reducing packet losses under certain level of congestion and are insufficient to ensure overall network stability. At times of high congestion, {{not only does the}} end user experience very poor performance, but also a lot of network resource is wasted due to retransmissions and aborted connections. Hence, it is required to propose a new efficient AQM (Active Queue Management) scheme known as Exponential Random Early Detection (E-RED) to reduce the packet loss even at more congestion time. The proposed probability calculation approach for congestion control in an ERED framework is implemented with probability marking capabilities. We had implemented ERED algorithm and compared with the RED algorithm during packet loss in congestion control at various time intervals. The experimental result shows that our proposed approach E-RED outperforms RED. The experimental result also shows the packet loss for the nodes at various time intervals, Queue sizes and bandwidth...|$|E
