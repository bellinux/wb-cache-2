25|$|On 12 September 2012, the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled in}} favor of Nada, citing that Nada's human rights had been violated, {{in the context of the}} European Convention on Human Rights. In this ruling the {{government}} of Switzerland was ordered to pay Nada 30,000 Euros in damages, for their treatment of him as a person placed — with no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> — on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist by the United States.|$|E
25|$|No {{member of}} the Committee had the {{essential}} sophistication that comes with experience {{in the trial of}} criminal cases....The high positions in the community held by the members of the Committee obscured {{the fact that they were}} not really qualified to perform the difficult task assigned to them. He also thought that the Committee, particularly Lowell, imagined it could use its fresh and more powerful analytical abilities to outperform the efforts of those who had worked on the case for years, even finding <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> that professional prosecutors had discarded.|$|E
25|$|Often, teenage couples {{engage in}} sexual conduct {{as part of an}} {{intimate}} relationship. This may occur before either participant has reached the age of consent, or after one has but the other has not. In the latter case, in most jurisdictions, the person who has reached the age of consent is guilty of statutory rape. In some jurisdictions (such as California), if two minors have sex with each other, they are both guilty of engaging in unlawful sex with the other person. The act itself is prima facie <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> when one participant is incapable of legally consenting.|$|E

25|$|Presumptions whereupon persons may be committed, and, much more, {{convictions}} whereupon persons may {{be condemned}} as guilty of witchcrafts, ought certainly {{to be more}} considerable than barely the accused person's being represented by a specter unto the afflicted; inasmuch as it is an undoubted and notorious thing, that a demon may, by God's permission, appear, even to ill purposes, {{in the shape of}} an innocent, yea, and a virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made in the sufferers, by a look or touch of the accused, to be an infallible <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> but frequently liable to be abused by the Devil's legerdemains.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, he {{graduated}} from the Military Academy of the General Staff. He became commander of the 34th Motor Rifle Division at Yekaterinburg. In March 2004, Surovikin was accused by Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Chibizov of beating him up for voting for the wrong candidate. In April, division deputy commander for armaments Colonel Andrei Shtakal shot himself after being criticized by Surovikin. In both cases, a military prosecutor found no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> From June 2004, he led the 42nd Guards Motor Rifle Division, stationed in Chechnya. On several occasions when subordinate commanders committed crimes, including after the Borozdinovskaya operation, Surovikin justified his actions. He was the {{chief of staff of the}} 20th Guards Army from 2005. In April 2008, he became the army commander. In November 2008, Surovikin became head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff. In January 2010, he became chief of staff of the Volga–Urals Military District, which soon became part of the Central Military District.|$|E

500|$|After the Court {{issued its}} {{decision}} in Schmerber, a split of authority emerged in lower courts {{with regard to}} whether the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination prohibited {{the use of a}} suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> The United States Supreme Court resolved this split in authority in South Dakota v. Neville, where the Court held that prosecutors could use a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> and the introduction of this evidence at trial does not violate the suspect's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Writing for the Court's majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concluded that [...] "the state did not directly compel respondent to refuse the test" [...] and that a [...] "simple blood-alcohol test is so safe, painless, and commonplace" [...] a suspect would not feel coerced to refuse the test. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall, in which he argued that the Court in Schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.|$|E
500|$|Although some {{perceive}} the settlement as {{an admission of}} guilt, the settlement agreement specifically stated that Jackson admitted no wrongdoing and no liability and legally, a settlement cannot be used as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> in future civil and criminal cases. The settlement payment was [...] "for alleged personal injuries arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of intentional or wrong acts of sexual molestation." [...] In the settlement, both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public {{but it did not}} prevent the Chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation. The settlement document adamantly states there is no admission of wrongdoing on Jackson's part and no admission of molestation or immodesty and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from the complainants, even if they were to testify against Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Dalrymple {{analyses}} {{the media}} attention and reaction to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and how certain media interpreted a perceived lack of emotion {{on the part of}} the girl’s parents as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> Dalrymple writes that the [...] "demand that emotion should be shown in public, or be assumed not to exist and therefore indicate a guilty mind, is now not an uncommon one", and cites two similar cases involving Joanne Lees and Lindy Chamberlain. Dalrymple then analyses the outcry from the public and the media to the lack of emotion shown by the Queen after the death of Princess Diana, and contends that [...] "the tabloid newspapers carried out what can only be called a campaign of bullying against the sovereign" [...] and that those gathered outside Buckingham Palace were [...] "bullying rather than expressing any genuine grief". He concludes by asserting that the sentimentality shown by both the media and the public “was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself".|$|E

500|$|The wager {{of battle}} {{was not always}} {{available}} to the defendant in an appeal of murder. If the defendant was taken in the mainour (that is, {{in the act of}} committing his crime), if he attempted to escape from prison, or if there was such strong <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> that there could be no effective denial, the defendant could not challenge. Similarly, if the plaintiff was a woman, above 60years of age, a minor, lame or blind, he or she could decline the challenge, and the case would be determined by a jury. Peers of the realm, priests, and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged. If the actual battle took place, it would occur in judicial lists, [...] square, following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery. If the defendant was defeated, and if he was still alive, he was to be hanged on the spot; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him. However, if he defeated his opponent, or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset, he would go free. If the plaintiff said the word craven ("I am vanquished"), and gave up the fight, he was to be , deprived of the privileges of a freeman, and was liable for damages to his successful opponent.|$|E
500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his right to remain silent, nor {{that he did not want}} to talk to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> corroborating the conviction.|$|E

2500|$|During the witch-trials {{in early}} modern Europe, {{individuals}} {{were employed to}} help aid in the discovery and conviction of witches. These individuals were given the title [...] "witch finders". Perhaps the most famous witch finder was a man named Matthew Hopkins (c. 1620-1647), {{who claimed to be}} the [...] "Witch Finder General". Hopkins' writings reached the height of their popularity during the English Civil War (circa 1645), and contributed {{to the use of the}} witches' mark as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt.</b> The record shows that two Scottish women disguised themselves as men, known as [...] "Mr. Dickson" [...] and [...] "Mr. Peterson", so they, too, could become witch-finders.|$|E
2500|$|Both wrote {{dozens of}} letters asserting their innocence, insisting {{they had been}} framed because they were anarchists. Their conduct in prison {{consistently}} impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote {{to the head of}} an investigatory commission that he had seen no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> or remorse on Sacco's part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, [...] "nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along." [...] Vanzetti developed his command of English {{to such a degree that}} journalist Murray Kempton later described him as [...] "the greatest writer of English in our century to learn his craft, do his work, and die all in the space of seven years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Massiah rule {{is also to}} be {{contrasted with}} the voluntariness {{standard}} of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and {{regardless of whether the}} suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> or to impeach the defendant's testimony. The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v. Connelly. Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances. [...] "Voluntary" [...] carried its everyday meaning - the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion. After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct. Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.|$|E
