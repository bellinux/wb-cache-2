5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment on some of the Orkney islands, but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> the total 160 years earlier.|$|E

By the time of John Sherman's birth, Charles had just been appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Convective banding {{features}} developed late on October13. The JTWC upgraded {{the depression}} to {{a tropical storm}} and gave it the name Ivan. Early the next day, the JMA also upgraded Ivan to a tropical storm. Later on October14, Ivan passed roughly 100km (65mi) south of Guam and subsequently intensified. Several hours afterwards, the JMA upgraded Ivan to a typhoon. During a 24-hour span, Ivan's winds increased from 120km/h (75mph) to 270km/h (165mph), making it a Category 5 super typhoon, the <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> the season. Late on October17, Ivan attained its peak intensity with winds of 295km/h (185mph) and an official barometric pressure of 905hPa (mbar). However, the JTWC reported an unofficial pressure of 872hPa (mbar), which would tie Ivan for the second strongest tropical cyclone worldwide with Typhoons Gay, Angela, Joan, Keith, Zeb and Hurricane Patricia.|$|E

5|$|John Stainer was the <b>eighth</b> <b>of</b> nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.|$|E
