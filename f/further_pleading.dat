[...] Because of deals between the band's label, EMI (through Capitol Records), and YouTube, the video was not embeddable, {{nor was it}} viewable across the globe, frustrating many fans and music industry professionals who wanted to post the video on their blogs. The band, led by singer Damian Kulash, explained the label's rationale via the band's blog and through an op-ed piece in The New York Times. [...] According to Kulash, EMI disallowed the embeddable play of the video because they only receive royalties for views on the YouTube site itself.

To which they pleaded in defence Parliament’s order for raising £3,000 by sale of his wood (perhaps the ordinance for funding Colonel Harvey’s regiment of horse was never fulfilled). Whetcombe <b>further</b> <b>pleaded</b> that he had only cut and sold decayed timber and undergrowth. Arthur Barnardiston was appointed, and shortly after Mr. Richard Greaves, of Lincoln’s Inn held the office, and was directed to keep court on Lord Petre’s estate. Nevertheless, by 1651, Petre’s liabilities, with sequestration, were twenty times his income, and although the liabilities were not all due immediately, the fourth lord was under pressure that was not manageable.|$|R

5000|$|On 6 June, it was {{announced}} that the trial would start on 25 November and was expected to last a month. A previous application for the court venue to be moved outside Wales was denied. On 26 November, Watkins pleaded guilty to attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13, but not guilty to rape. This was accepted by the prosecution. He <b>further</b> <b>pleaded</b> guilty to three counts of sexual assault involving children and six involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal. Watkins' victims included a baby boy, and he sent an SMS text message to the mother of one, saying: [...] "If you belong to me, so does your baby." [...] South Wales Police's investigation into Watkins, codenamed [...] "Operation Globe", required the cooperation of GCHQ to decrypt a hidden drive on his laptop, which was then found to contain video of his abuses.

40|$|Historically, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the execution of sentences passed at the level of international courts and tribunals. Capital punishment was still used, and custodial sanctions were imposed in the relevant states. It was not until the 1990 s, with the creation of the ad hoc tribunals, that the execution of sentences also became a task for international tribunals, in cooperation with, and by means of transferring the sentenced person to, a state which had committed itself to executing the sentence. The basic principles of these vertical transfer, or execution of sentence, procedures, as is also the case {{at the level of the}} ICC, are characterized by a system logic, with a limited role for the sentenced person. Nonetheless, minimal human rights and international standards for the execution of sentences (as agreed upon at the level of the UN) are respected. The authors investigate if and to what extent the interests of the sentenced person could be better pursued and enhanced during vertical procedures for the execution of sentences; they therefore take a clear-cut rehabilitation and social integration perspective. Given the dominant representation of EU member states among states willing to execute sentences passed by international tribunals and courts, the authors moreover wonder whether practice should not evolve towards reflecting the obligatory compliance of these states with, besides the UN standards, additional (sometimes wider, more precise and higher) Council of Europe and EU standards. This would be reflected in the policies of the tribunals and courts (especially the ICC) relating to the conclusion of sentence execution agreements with states, as well as in the actual case-based decisions in which particular sentence execution states are chosen. The authors <b>further</b> <b>plead</b> for the conclusion of a bilateral EU-ICC agreement on the execution of sentences, since this would constitute an important contribution to international justice, and one that is likely to make the reintegration and rehabilitation of offenders (a greater) part of it...|$|R
5000|$|Up to that time, {{defendants}} acquitted {{by reason}} of insanity had faced no certain fate and had often been released back to the safe-keeping of their families. Parliament speedily passed the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 to provide for the indefinite detention of insane defendants (and the Treason Act 1800 {{to make it easier to}} prosecute people for attempts on the life of the king). Hadfield later inspired <b>further</b> use of <b>pleading</b> insanity several years later during the case of Colonel Edward Despard. Hadfield was detained in Bethlem Royal Hospital for the rest of his life, save for a short period when he escaped. He was recaptured at Dover attempting to flee to France and was briefly held at Newgate Prison before being transferred to the new insane asylum Bethlehem Hospital (or Bedlam, as it was known). He died there of tuberculosis in 1841.|$|R
40|$|A {{drug that}} is {{effective}} in one group of patients may have a reduced or no effect in other patients. Similarly, the risk for side effects differs between patients. The discipline of pharmacogenomics studies how genetic variation in the population can influence this drug response. In this thesis, we have used multiple approaches to examine these challenges and opportunities in pharmacogenomics: we studied variants with well-established functional effects, used specialized genotyping chips focusing on cardiovascular genes or rare variation, and increased sample sizes by meta-analyzing studies. Thematically, we have focused on common diseases: atherosclerosis, asthma, and high blood pressure. Chapter 1 of this thesis is the General Introduction. In Chapter 2 we review current evidence for associations between genetic variability and differences in response to statins and ACE-inhibitors. Here, we show that the (initial) enthusiasm for possible applications of pharmacogenetic research {{has resulted in a}} high number of publications. Many of these studies, which combine genetics with pharmacology, are of low quality, at least in the field of statin pharmacogenetics. This results in false-positive findings and non-replication. Chapter 3 describes three new studies into the pharmacogenetics of statin response. In all studies, we combined evidence from several independent studies, and explored how the polymorphisms change the response to statins. Results of these studies indicated that there is a small, but statistically significant effect of genetic variation on statin efficacy. Chapter 4 presents candidate gene (array) approaches to asthma and lung function pharmacogenetics. Again, the effects of genetic variation on the response to drugs in this disease area are small. The thesis concludes with the General discussion, which provides a general discussion of the findings in a broader perspective, commenting on the implications for clinical practice, methodological challenges and opportunities, and making recommendations for future research. The ideal of ‘personalized medicine’, where every patient receives a tailored treatment, is difficult to achieve due to the small effect sizes, a generally favorable response, and the added difficulty of a need for genotyping. It therefore seems unlikely that it will become the norm in the coming years, especially for common diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, or asthma. We have also seen that there are still many, yet unused, possibilities to improve the current pharmacogenomic research methods, and {{to have an impact on}} medicine. Much of this pharmacogenomic research will aid start-ups and established pharmaceutical companies in establishing targets for pharmacological action. Pharmacogenomics can also help to get market approval for drugs, if there are problems with side effects or a lack of efficacy in a genetically-defined subgroup of patients. We <b>further</b> <b>plead</b> for a larger role for multiethnic research in pharmacogenetic research. With a systematic and hypothesis-free approach we have learned a great deal about human biology and disease in the last decade. It is time to turn this knowledge into new and improved therapies...|$|R
50|$|As a congressman, Gallagher {{became an}} activist against {{government}} surveillance of citizens, and chaired the Invasion of Privacy Subcommittee. Gallagher was {{a critic of}} the tactics of Federal Bureau of Investigation chief J. Edgar Hoover (whom he compared to Soviet secret police administrator Lavrentiy Beriya) and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Gallagher was approached by attorney Roy Cohn, who asked him on behalf of Hoover to hold hearings which would shift the blame for government surveillance from Hoover to Kennedy. Gallagher refused. When media accounts surfaced, including in Life magazine, which contained alleged leaked material from FBI wiretaps suggesting that Gallagher was connected to the mafia, Gallagher accused Hoover of fabricating the stories to hound him from public life. Cohn met with Gallagher again, demanding on Hoover's behalf that he resign or face <b>further</b> allegations. Gallagher <b>plead</b> guilty in 1972 to tax evasion and perjury.|$|R
40|$|This study examined, {{within the}} South African context, the {{prevalence}} of mental retardation in a forensic observation setting, and the impediments of and successes to forensic rehabilitation. The {{results of the study}} indicated that a significant amount of forensic observation patients (25. 16 %) are ultimately diagnosed as being mentally retarded, with 39. 24 percent of such offenders being found unfit to <b>plead.</b> <b>Further</b> 32. 91 percent of the same sample was found to be not responsible for their actions. A link was also drawn between the mentally retarded offender and violent offenses. The advantages and disadvantages of a current rehabilitative process are discussed in light of alternate community-based forms of rehabilitation that are being implemented in other countries, for example the United States of America, with a view towards investigated their usefulness and adaptability to South African circumstances. The findings of the study have implications for mental health professionals working within forensic settings concerning the future management of mentally retarded offenders, particularly within the rehabilitative process...|$|R
6000|$|Fourth Privilege. Since {{that which}} goeth before is true, it follows, that he that entereth his plea against the {{children}} must needs be overthrown; for always before just judges {{it is the}} right that taketh place. Judge the right, O Lord, said David; or, [...] "let my sentence come forth from thy presence," [...] according to the law of grace. And he that knows what strong ground, or bottom, our Advocate has for his pleadings, and how Satan's accusations are without sound foundation, will not be afraid, he speaking in Christ, to say, I appeal to God Almighty, since Christ is my Advocate by the new law, whether I ought to be condemned to death and hell for what Satan pleads against me by the old. Satan urgeth that we have sinned, but Christ pleads to his propitiatory sacrifice; and so Satan is overthrown. Satan pleads the law of works, but Christ pleads the law of grace. <b>Further,</b> Satan <b>pleads</b> the justice and holiness of God against us; and there the accuser is overthrown again. And to them Christ appeals, and his appeal is good, since the law testifies to the sufficiency of the satisfaction that Christ has made thereto by his obedience (Rom 3:22, 23). And also, since by another covenant, God himself has given us to Jesus Christ, and so delivered us from the old. Wherefore you read nothing as an effect of Satan's pleading against us, but that his mouth is stopped, as appears by Zechariah 3; and that he is cast; yea, cast down, as you have it in Revelation 12.|$|R

He had been so intently earnest! The nature of the man was so eager and true! But yet, in spite of all that had been said, of all the fire in his eyes, and life in his words, and energy in his actions, he had at last seen that his aspirations were foolish, and his desires vain. It could not otherwise be that she and Mary should pass these hours in such calm repose without an allusion to the disturbing subject!

5000|$|In 870, Emperor Yizong's {{favorite}} daughter Princess Tongchang died. In anger, Emperor Yizong executed some 20 {{of imperial}} physicians who {{were unable to}} save her, and further had some 300 of their family members arrested. Liu initially requested the advisory officials, whose responsibilities were to correct the emperor's behavior, to submit petitions to ask for lenience on their behalf, {{but none of the}} advisory officials dared to do so, so Liu himself did, drawing Emperor Yizong's displeasure. Subsequently, both he and the mayor of Jingzhao, Wen Zhang (溫璋), met with Emperor Yizong to <b>further</b> to <b>plead</b> for these prisoners' case; Emperor Yizong had them ejected from his presence. Soon thereafter, Liu was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and Wen committed suicide. A number of other officials who were friendly with Liu were demoted, as was the chief imperial scholar Zheng Tian, who drafted an edict that outwardly rebuked Liu but was instead praising Liu for his frugality, thus angering the chancellor Lu Yan, who bore a grudge against Liu. At instigation by Lu and Princess Tongchang's husband Wei Baoheng, Liu was further accused with conspiring with the imperial physicians to poison Princess Tongchang, and Liu was thereafter demoted to be the prefect of Kang Prefecture (康州, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong), and yet later the census officer at Huan Prefecture (驩州, in modern Nghệ An Province, Vietnam). [...] The edict announcing that demotion was drafted by Li Yu (李庾), at Lu's behest, using extremely harsh language that suggested that Liu would next be put to death. It was said that the people of the empire all lamented the false accusations, and the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), Zhang Gongsu, submitted a petition defending Liu. In apprehension, Lu did not dare to have Liu put to death.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} failure. That {{is how the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) {{has been}} described by legal scholars and disability advocates alike. The statute was widely expected to help prevent disability discrimination in employment, but it has not fully achieved its intended purpose because of the narrow interpretation of the ADA by the courts. Congress recently sought to restore the employment protections of the ADA by amending the statute. Interpreting the complex and comprehensive amendments to the ADA will be a difficult task for the federal courts. Complicating matters <b>further,</b> the proper <b>pleading</b> standard for disability claims was left in disarray after the U. S. Supreme Court’s decisions in 2007 in Twombly v.

This Article examines the impact of the Bell Atlantic decision on ADA claims and proposes a unified analytical framework for alleging disability discrimination that satisfies recent case law, the ADA amendments, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The proposed model would streamline the pleading process for disability claims and provide a blueprint for litigants and courts in analyzing cases under the revised ADA...|$|R

Departing from this principle, the Court in Twombly required the pleading of facts that demonstrate the plausibility of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim. This Article explicates and offers {{a critique of the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s new jurisprudence of plausibility pleading. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s new understanding of civil pleading obligations does not merely represent an insufficiently justified break with precedent and with the intent of the drafters of Rule 8.

Ultimately, the imposition of plausibility <b>pleading</b> <b>further</b> contributes to the civil system 2 ̆ 7 s long slide away from its original liberal ethos towards an ethos of restrictiveness more concerned with efficiency and judicial administration than with access to justice.
