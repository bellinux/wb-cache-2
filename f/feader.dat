40|$|Legume-based {{temporary}} grasslands, {{common in}} ruminant farms in France and other European areas, can ensure high-quality forage production and nitrogen self-sufficiency. Improving their persistence, i. e. maintaining {{their ability to}} produce high-quality forage beyond 4 - 5 years, requires managing equilibrium among forage species, which remains a challenge. This communication relates the initial results of a historical survey on vegetation dynamics in sown grasslands (<b>Feader</b> SOS-Protein- 4 AgeProd-SP 3). Longterm grasslands {{can be found in}} a wide range of free-draining soil and oceanic climate conditions. Sward dynamics of these long term grasslands are presented and discussed in relation with their management...|$|E
40|$|The {{positive}} effect of new legal rules improving the ex situ conservation actions on protected plants is analysed in the Valencian Community (Spain), comparing {{the data of}} seed germination tests made by the Valencian Wildlife Service (Servicio de Espacios Naturales y Biodiversidad) on the species strictly protected by a new regional Decree, entering in force in 2009. The amount of tested species after the enforcement of this Decree (years 2009 - 2011, x= 35, 000 ± 9, 644 species/year) is significantly different (F 13, 2 = 0, 132; p= 0, 013) than the pre-Decree period (1995 - 2008, x= 6, 500 ± 3, 503 species/year). If only new species tested are compared -so not considering the data on formerly tested species- {{the difference between the}} pre-Decree time (2, 286 ± 1, 978 new species/year) and the post-Decree period (14, 333 ± 7, 767 new species/year) is also significant (F 13, 2 = 0, 065; p= 0, 001).

40|$|The main {{oceanic and}} local {{environmental}} traits forcing the glass eel Anguilla anguilla (L., 1758) recruitment to the southernmost European estuary, the Guadalquivir (SW Spain), were studied during nine successive migration seasons (June 1997 –December 2006) using a fishery-independent experimental survey at three sampling {{sites in the}} estuary. A clear seasonal pattern was observed: density was highest between late autumn and spring with two migration peaks, and lowest during summer. Short-term (inter-month) changes in glass eel density were partially driven by local environmental variables, such as estuarine turbidity, local rainfall and water temperature. Long-term (inter-annual) changes were positively correlated with oceanic factors related to recruitment success (NAO index and primary production at the spawning area) {{as well as local}} environmental factors (westerly and southerly wind mixing indices and rainfall). Spatial changes in glass eel density within the estuary depended on tidal and light situations although maximum densities were mainly observed at diurnal and/or nocturnal flood tides. Although the decrease in the abundance of European glass eels has been widely known since the 1980 s, during this study {{there was no evidence of}} a declining trend, probably because of an insufficiently long time series.

40|$|Neospora caninum {{has been}} {{detected}} only sporadically {{in cases of}} ovine abortion, and it has therefore traditionally been considered as an unimportant parasite in small ruminants. This study was carried out {{with the aim of}} identifying the pathogen causing serious reproductive problems on a commercial sheep farm. Sera from all rams and ewes tested negative for antibodies against Border disease virus, Schmallenberg virus and Coxiella burnetii, and infections by these agents were therefore ruled out. Nevertheless, seropositivity to N. caninum and/or Toxoplasma gondii was detected, although the seroprevalence was higher in the case of N. caninum. The percentage of lambings and the number of lambs per dam were significantly lower in ewes that were seropositive to N. caninum while no effect on these parameters was detected in ewes that were seropositive to T. gondii. There was also no evidence of infection by T. gondii in the foetal/lamb tissues analyzed by PCR and/or immunohistopathological techniques. On the contrary, the DNA of N. caninum was detected in 13 out of 14 foetuses/lambs descendant from dams seropositive to this parasite. Characteristic lesions caused by N. caninum and/or its antigen were also detected. Genotyping of the N. caninum DNA revealed only two closely related microsatellite multilocus genotypes. The results clearly demonstrate that infection by N. caninum was the cause of the low reproductive performance of this sheep flock.

40|$|Agro-hydrological {{models have}} {{increasingly}} become useful and powerful tools in optimizing water and fertilizer application, and {{in studying the}} environmental consequences. Accurate prediction of water dynamics in such models is essential for models to produce reasonable results. In this study, detailed simulations were performed for water dynamics of rainfed winter wheat and barley grown under a Mediterranean climate over a 10 -year period. The model employed (Yang et al., 2009. J. Hydrol., 370, 177 - 190) uses easily available agronomic data, and takes into consideration of all key soil and plant processes in controlling water dynamics in the soil-crop system, including the dynamics of root growth. The water requirement for crop growth was calculated according to the FAO 56, and the soil hydraulic properties were estimated using peto-transfer functions (PTFs) based on soil physical properties and soil organic matter content. Results show that the simulated values of soil water content at the depths of 15, 45 and 75 cm agreed with the measurements well with {{the root of the}} mean squared errors of 0. 027 cm 3 cm- 3 and the model agreement index of 0. 875. The simulated seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) ranged from 208 to 388 mm, and grain yield was found to correlate with the simulated seasonal ET in a linear manner within the studied ET range. The simulated rates of grain yield increase were 17. 3 and 23. 7 kg ha-l for every mm of water evapotranspired for wheat and barley, respectively. The good agreement of soil water content between measurement and simulation and the simulated relationships between grain yield and seasonal ET supported by the data in the literature indicates that the model performed well in modelling water dynamics for the studied soil-crop system, and therefore {{has the potential to be}} applied reliably and widely in precision agriculture. Finally, a two-staged approach using inverse modelling techniques to further improve model performance was discussed.

40|$|Owing to conducive {{economic}} conditions and a suitable climate Andalucía {{has become the}} largest olive oil producing area in the world. However, extensive rill and severe gully erosion are threatening sustainability. To conserve the soil, land management strategies have to be implemented that minimize erosion and enhance {{at the same time}} rain water conservation to safeguard crop yields. An indicator of soil quality and the success of soil management will be organic matter content (OM—%). There is therefore a need to measure, map, manage and monitor its content. Proximal sensors such as electromagnetic induction instruments may be useful in mapping this because the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa—mS/m) is related to clay, salinity and mineralogy, which influence organic matter content. In this research we collect data from a single frequency and multiple-coil DUALEM- 21 along a transect and across an olive grove in the “La Manga” catchment in Setenil de las Bodegas in the southwest of Spain. We inverted the data using EM 4 Soil software and developed calibrations between estimates of true electrical conductivity (σ—mS/m) with depth against measured OM % using the quasi- 2 d algorithm along a single transect. We did this by using a fitted linear regression model and by varying the forward modelling algorithm (cumulative function and full solution), inversion algorithm (S 1 and S 2) and damping factor (λ) to determine a suitable electromagnetic conductivity image for 2 -d and 3 -d mapping. Our results along a detailed transect showed promise and suggest differences in OM content could be mapped down a topographic sequence. We applied this calibration to a quasi- 3 d model across the entire olive grove and to predict OM at various depths. The results across the olive grove were compromised in some locations and within geomorphological complex locations in the landscape, such as near the erosion gully where frequent erosion and deposition occurs. We conclude that better results may have been achieved if more detailed ECa data collection was undertaken in and around the gully and also across a larger extent.
