We rely on the transaction cost economics (TCE) model, while controlling for age, educational background, and trust of the SME executive in the external accountant. A survey was developed to investigate the outsourcing by Belgian SMEs both of routine (entry of <b>invoices,</b> interim <b>reporting)</b> and non-routine (period-end accounting, preparation of financial statements) accounting tasks. For the routine accounting tasks, frequency {{was significantly associated with}} outsourcing. Meanwhile, for non-routine accounting tasks, asset specificity and frequency were significantly associated. High-frequency tasks were associated with lower levels of outsourcing. Similarly, higher asset specificity was associated with lower levels of outsourcing. Furthermore, the educational background of the CEO, as well as the CEOs level of trust in the external accountant, was significantly associated with outsourcing, confirming the upper echelon theory. Having a more educated CEO was associated with lower levels of outsourcing, both for routine and non-routine accounting tasks...|$|R

Current systems lack the functionality needed by the stakeholders to effectively and efficiently forecast port-visit costs.

The capabilities of the application provide stakeholders with a valuable tool to analyze port-visit requirements and costs trends...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{programme}} management to align, coordinate and manage {{a portfolio of}} construction projects to deliver benefits {{that would not be}} achievable if the projects were managed independently in a turbulent economic environment, limitations of project management, and increasing stakeholder expectations cannot be over emphasised. In the construction industry, the implementation of programme management has been bedevilled with major challenges of which the North West Department of Public Works (DPW) CAPEX programme is no exception. The CAPEX programme has been noted for delivering fewer infrastructure projects as planned in terms of budget, time, and other expectations. The research documented in this treatise thus examined the existing programme management approach of the North West DPW CAPEX programme with respect to generally accepted standards and practices. A mixed research approach was used to identify problems such as delays in payment of works, poor reporting standards, improper planning of works, procurement difficulties, and inadequate management structures. The results point to excessive bureaucratic processes, improper information management systems and lack of commitment and ownership towards government works as the major underlying causes of the programme predicaments. Dogmatic implementation of government’s black economic empowerment policies and inadequate in-house capacity were also contributing factors. The research findings imply that effective processes should be laid for prompt payment of works certificates and <b>invoices.</b> Improved <b>reporting</b> standards and proper planning of the programme as a whole and its constituent projects is necessary for the attainment of stipulated goals. In particular, it is crucial to ensure that adequate management considerations in terms of capacity, infrastructure, structures and expertise are put in place while the procurement processes should be continually reviewed for programme success purpose...|$|R
