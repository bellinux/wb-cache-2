While the paschal mozzetta fell out of use during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, it was {{returned}} to use in 2008 by Pope Benedict XVI.|$|E
25|$|Federal style furniture, made by Georgetown {{craftsman}} William King, Jr., {{was added}} to the East Room by President James Monroe in 1818. (First Lady Elizabeth Monroe's involvement was limited to choosing drapery fabric for the room). King produced 24 armchairs and four sofas, all made of mahogany. The total cost was $1,408. The furniture was not upholstered, and sat along the walls largely unused. The King furniture was finally upholstered in blue <b>damask</b> <b>silk</b> in 1829 {{in the first year of}} the Jackson administration. Monroe also purchased (for $80) a marble bust of George Washington by the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi, which remained in the East Room probably until the Kennedy redecoration in 1962 (when it was moved to the Blue Room). Monroe also purchased in 1817 for the fireplace mantels four gilt bronze candelabra, designed and manufactured by the French bronzemaker Pierre-Philippe Thomire.|$|E
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red <b>damask</b> <b>silk.</b> The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense".|$|E
25|$|Technology permitting, Robert Denning would happily {{return to}} the nineteenth century. Since he can't, he devotes himself to re-creating– with {{international}} mixes of opulent furniture– the sumptuous interiors of his favorite era, using <b>damask,</b> <b>silks,</b> and taffetas.|$|R

In 1917, {{to assist the}} war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork melted down for ammunition.|$|R

500|$|The {{house at}} Althorp was a [...] "classically beautiful" [...] red brick Tudor building, but its {{appearance}} was radically altered, starting in 1788, when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes. Mathematical tiles {{were added to}} the exterior, encasing the brick, and four Corinthian pilasters {{were added to the}} front. The grand hall entrance to the house, Wootton Hall, was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "the noblest Georgian room in the county". The Great Dining Room in the east wing extension of the house was added in 1877 to designs by John Macvicar Anderson, its walls hung with faded, red <b>damask</b> <b>silk.</b> Numerous fireplaces and furnishings were brought to Althorp from Spencer House in London during the Blitz for safekeeping and still remain. The Picture Gallery stretches for [...] {{on the first floor of}} the west wing, and is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor oak woodwork and ambiance in the mansion. It has an extensive collection of portraits, including Anthony van Dyck's War and Peace, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II, and many others. Some £2 million was spent on redecorating the house in the 1980s, during which time most of the religious paintings of Althorp were sold off.|$|E
500|$|The tabards of the {{different}} officers can be distinguished {{by the type of}} fabric used to make them. A tabard of a King of Arms is made of velvet and cloth of gold, the tabard of a Herald of satin and that of a Pursuivant of <b>damask</b> <b>silk.</b> The tabards of all heralds (Ordinary and Extraordinary) are inscribed with the Sovereign's royal arms, richly embroidered. It was once the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards with the sleeves at the front and back, in fact in 1576 a pursuivant was fined for presuming to wear his tabard like a herald but this practice was ended during the reign of James II. Until 1888 all tabards was provided to the heralds by the Crown, however in that year a parsimonious Treasury refused to ask Parliament for funds for the purpose. Ever since then heralds either paid for their own tabards or bought the one used by their predecessors. The newest tabard was made in 1963 for the Welsh Herald Extraordinary. A stock of them is now held by the Lord Chamberlain, from which a loan [...] "during tenure of office" [...] is made upon each appointment. They are often sent to Ede & Ravenscroft for repair or replacement. In addition, heralds and pursuivants wear black velvet caps with a badge embroidered.|$|E
60|$|From {{the inner}} hall a footman ushered him across an ante-chamber {{to a room}} on the right, which {{proved to be the}} library, and was his lordship's {{habitual}} retreat. It was a spacious, pillared chamber, very richly panelled in <b>damask</b> <b>silk,</b> and very richly furnished, having long French windows that opened on a terrace above the garden.|$|E
2500|$|New {{types of}} looms and weaving {{techniques}} {{also played a}} part. Plain-woven or tabby silks had circulated in the Roman world, and patterned <b>damask</b> <b>silks</b> in increasingly complex geometric designs appear from the mid-3rd century. Weft-faced compound twills were developed not later than 600, and polychrome (multicoloured) compound twills became the standard weave for Byzantine silks {{for the next several}} centuries. Monochrome lampas weaves became fashionable around 1000 in both Byzantine and Islamic weaving centres; these fabrics rely on contrasting textures rather than colour to render patterns. [...] A small number of tapestry-woven Byzantine silks also survive.|$|R

60|$|The valises {{had already}} {{been brought to the}} rooms by another entrance, and Margaret and her {{daughter}} were charmed with their bedroom. A large ewer and basin of silver stood on a table which was covered with a white cloth, snowy towels hung beside it; the hangings of the bed were of <b>damask</b> <b>silk,</b> and the floor was almost covered by an Eastern carpet. An exquisitely carved wardrobe stood in one corner.|$|E
60|$|Within was a banqueting-table {{covered with}} thick white <b>damask</b> <b>silk,</b> with a border of gold {{about a foot}} in breadth, and before each guest was placed a napkin of the same fashion. The table, however, lacked none of the conveniences and luxuries and even {{ornaments}} of Europe. What can withstand the united influence of taste, wealth, and commerce? The choicest porcelain of France, golden goblets chiselled in Bond Street, and the prototypes of which had perhaps been won at Goodwood or Ascot, mingled with the rarest specimens of the glass of Bohemia, while the triumphant blades of Sheffield flashed in that very Syrian city whose skill in cutlery {{had once been a}} proverb. Around the table was a divan of amber-coloured satin with many cushions, so arranged that the guests might follow either the Oriental or the European mode of seating themselves. Such was the bower or tabernacle of Besso of Damascus, prepared to celebrate the seventh day of his vintage feast.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{we must not}} forget one who is already making that visit. Sir Vavasour Firebrace is seated in a spacious library that looks upon the Thames and the gardens of the Temple. Though piles of parchments and papers cover the numerous tables, and in many parts intrude upon the Turkey carpet, an air of order, of comfort, and of taste, pervades the chamber. The hangings of crimson <b>damask</b> <b>silk</b> blend with the antique furniture of oak; the upper panes of the windows are tinted by the brilliant pencil of feudal Germany, while the choice volumes that line the shelves are clothed in bindings which become their rare contents. The master of this apartment {{was a man of}} ordinary height, inclined to corpulency, and in the wane of middle life, though his unwrinkled cheek, his undimmed blue eye, and his brown hair, very apparent, though he wore a cap of black velvet, did not betray his age, or the midnight studies by which he had in a great degree acquired that learning for which he was celebrated. The general expression of his countenance was pleasing, though dashed with a trait of the sinister. He was seated in an easy chair, before a kidney table at which he was writing. Near at hand was a long tall oaken desk, on which were several folio volumes open, and some manuscripts which denoted that he had recently been engaged with them. At present Mr Hatton, with his pen still in his hand and himself in a chamber-robe of the same material as his cap, leant back in his chair, while he listened to his client, Sir Vavasour. Several most beautiful black and tan spaniels of the breed of King Charles the Second were reposing near him on velvet cushions, with a haughty luxuriousness which would have become the beauties of the merry monarch; and a white Persian cat with blue eyes and a very long tail, with a visage not altogether unlike that of its master, was resting with great gravity on the writing-table, and assisting at the conference.|$|E

During his pontificate Benedict wore the winter papal mozzetta and the paschal mozzetta, both of which had last been last worn by Pope Paul VI.

50|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, dress worn at court {{comprised}} {{gold and silver}} stuff, brocades, velvets and cloth coats. They were always embroidered, and worn with waistcoats generally of a different colour- gold or silver brocade, <b>damask,</b> <b>silk</b> or satin, heavily embroidered or laced in silver or gold. From the 1730s at least cloth was popular for court wear. By the 1780s dress was established as dark cloth or velvet, embroidered in silk or metal, single-breasted silk waistcoat (usually white), with the fronts curved away.|$|E
50|$|Levinus Vincent (1658 in Amsterdam - 8 November 1727 in Haarlem) {{was a rich}} Dutch {{designer}} and merchant of luxurious textiles, such as <b>damask,</b> <b>silk</b> and brocade.

Private officers of arms, such as still exist in Scotland, making use of tabards emblazoned with the coat of arms {{of the person who}} employs them. In the United Kingdom the different ranks of officers of arms can be distinguished by the fabric from which their tabards are made. The tabard of a king of arms is made of velvet, the tabard of a herald of arms of satin, and that of a pursuivant of arms of <b>damask</b> <b>silk.</b> The oldest surviving English herald's tabard is that of Sir William Dugdale as Garter King of Arms (1677-1686).|$|E
