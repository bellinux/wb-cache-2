25|$|Jemma Griffiths {{was born}} in Penarth, Wales, a small town near the Welsh capital, Cardiff on 18 May 1975. Jem {{originally}} found her passion for singing and songwriting whilst attending Stanwell School. During her early school years she explored her musical interests with the family piano, penning her first song {{at the age of}} thirteen. Jem has three siblings, older sister Chloe, (whose photograph appeared on Jem's first extended play <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Starts</b> Here...), younger sister Georgia, who provided vocals for the Welsh indie/punk band Weapons of Mass Belief alongside brother Justin, who also goes by the name Yestyn, of Glass Pear.|$|E
25|$|One {{of those}} 'big names' {{listening}} was Bruce Flohr, a top-level A rep for RCA Records and newly established ATO Records (known for introducing David Gray to American audiences). Upon meeting Jem, {{and listening to}} more of her demos, Flohr recalled thinking 'How do I not let this girl out the door without signing her?'. ATO Records quickly made the unanimous decision to offer her a recording contract. At that time {{there was no other}} label interest in her because her status as a studio only artist meant that she flew under the radar of most A She was subsequently signed to the label and on 13 October 2003 in preparation for the release of the full-length album, ATO released an extended play entitled, <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Starts</b> Here..., consisting of five adapted demos that Jem had initially recorded. In anticipation of the album release, Jem also relocated to Los Angeles, where she felt there was more opportunity for her to promote her work and explore her musical potential.|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>starts</b> with the stories for me." ...|$|E
