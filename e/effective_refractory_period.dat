Serial noninvasive electrophysiological testing was performed over 2 years in a subgroup of 485 patients. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics between patients with and those without device-detected atrial tachyarrhythmias during the first year. Patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias had longer paced (153 +/- 29 versus 145 +/- 28 ms; P= 0. 046) and sensed (128 +/- 46 versus 118 +/- 25 ms; P= 0. 06) P-wave durations and {{were more likely to have}} AF induced during electrophysiological testing (23. 5 % versus 13. 6 %; P= 0. 03).

50|$|In electrocardiography, {{during a}} cardiac cycle, once an action {{potential}} is initiated, {{there is a}} period of time that a new action potential cannot be initiated. This is termed the <b>effective</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> (ERP) of the tissue. This period is approximately equal to the absolute refractory period (ARP), it occurs because the fast sodium channels remain closed until the cell fully repolarizes.During this period, depolarization on adjacent cardiac muscles does not produce a new depolarization in the current cell as it has to refract back to phase 4 of the action potential before a new action potential can activate it. ERP acts as a protective mechanism and keeps the heart rate in check and prevents arrhythmias, and it helps coordinates muscle contraction. Anti-arrhythmic agents used for arrhythmias usually prolong the ERP.

50|$|Pilsicainide {{is a drug}} used {{clinically}} in Japan {{to treat}} cardiac arrhythmias. It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel {{that contributes to the}} rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. Pilsicainide is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. Pilsicainide binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application(3). The affinity of pilsicainide for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent {{on the state of the}} channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its inactivated state as opposed to resting or open(4), thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis(5). Binding of pilsicainide selectively inhibits the channel(6), preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential(6). Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent(7), and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. Pilsicainide also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner(8). The effects of pilsicainide have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time(9). This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent(10).A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. Pilsicainide has been proven successful in treating both ventricular(11) and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects(12). It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia(14). It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual(15). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re-entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation(16). Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation(17). Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the <b>effective</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>period.</b> Pilsicainide suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period(18). Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore pilsicainide treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of pilsicainide effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with pilsicainide is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation).|$|E

C) (FUNCTIONAL REFRACTORY PERIOD - <b>EFFECTIVE</b> <b>REFRACTORY</b> <b>PERIOD)</b> /EFFECTIVE REFRACTORY PERIOD. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IS FAVOURED BY THE SCHORT <b>EFFECTIVE</b> <b>REFRACTORY</b> <b>PERIOD</b> AND THE DELAYED ATRIAL CONDUCTION AND IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTED BY THEIR RATIO? THE VERY SHORT <b>EFFECTIVE</b> <b>REFRACTORY</b> <b>PERIOD</b> ALTHOUGH PERMITS THE LABORATORY INDUCTION OF THE ARRHYTHMIAS IT PREVENTS THE SPONTANEOUS ATRIAL FIBRILLATION BECAUSE IT TENDS TO DIMINISH THE TIME WINDOW WITHIN WHICH THEPROPER INDUCING EXTRA SYSTOLE MAY APPEAR. ON THE OTHER HAND, SPONTANEOUS ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, NONINDUCIBLE IN THE LABORATORY MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING REST OR SLEEP. ...|$|E
40|$|Electrophysiologic {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} in 13 patients with symptomatic WPW syndrome. The <b>effective</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of the right atrium (AERP), the antegrade <b>effective</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of the accessory pathway (AP-ERP) during sinus rhythm and at different cycle length, the shortest RR-intervals with preexcitation during atrial fibrillation (RR-AF) {{and the appearance of}} block in the AP during incremental atrial pacing have been measured. The data collected during sinus rythm (SR) and at different pacing rates were analyzed and compared. During SR (cycle length 851 +/- 157 ms) AERP measured 263 +/- 56 ms and AP-ERP 309 +/- 55 ms. At a cycle length of 450 - 550 ms, AERP measured 221 +/- 36 ms and AP-ERP 250 +/- 35 ms, and at a cycle length of 400 - 450 ms AERP was 213 +/- 35 ms and AP-ERP 230 +/- 42 ms. The mean RR-AF was 253 +/- 35 ms. A significant correlation was found between AERP and AP-RP at a cycle length of 400 - 450 ms (r = 0. 92), but not between AP-ERP and RR-AF at any cycle length. Block in the AP occurred at a mean pacing cycle length of 280 +/- 42 ms. The electrophysiologic measurements of patients with syncope did not differ from patients without syncope in our group. The data show that in patients with a long AP-ERP (greater than 290 ms) during SR an increase of the heart rate leads to a significant shortening of the AP-ERP. No relevant correlation was found between AP-ERP and mean RR-AF. Patients with AP-ERP shorter than RR-AF appear to be a high-risk subgroup for ventricular fibrillation during AF...|$|R
40|$|Tocainide, a newly {{released}} class IB antiarrhythmic agent, has membrane stabilizing and electrophysiologic characteristics {{similar to those}} of lidocaine, but it can be prescribed for oral administration. Investigational studies in both animals and humans have shown tocainide's effectiveness for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in chronic and acute settings. The drug has nearly 100 % bioavailability after oral administration and an effective half-life of 9 to 37 hours (mean, 15 hours). Antiarrhythmic efficacy {{is similar to that of}} other class I medications currently in use. Serious side effects most frequently involve the central nervous or gastrointestinal system and occur in 10 % to 20 % of patients. Tocainide has minimal negative inotropic effects and a tendency to shorten <b>effective</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{electrophysiologic}} {{properties of}} bepridil, a {{calcium channel blocker}} with additional effects on fast response tissues, were investigated in 10 patients with atrioventricular accessory pathways. Seven patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and three had concealed atrioventricular pre-excitation. A dose of 4 mg/kg was administered intravenously over five minutes. Bepridil increased the AH interval and the functional <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> of the atrioventricular node. The <b>effective</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of the right atrium and right ventricle were also increased. Bepridil prolonged refractoriness in the accessory pathway both in the anterograde and retrograde direction. After bepridil administration {{it was impossible to}} induce reciprocating tachycardia electrically in two patients because of conduction block in the normal pathway. On the other hand, the zone of tachycardia was often increased after bepridil. Nevertheless, the heart rate during tachycardia was slowed by depression of conduction in both the normal and accessory pathways. The findings of this study provide a basis for the antiarrhythmic action of bepridil in patients with atrioventricular accessory pathways...|$|R
