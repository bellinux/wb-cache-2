Meanwhile, the British, who viewed their defeat at Majuba as an aberration, forged ahead with their desire to <b>federate</b> the Southern African colonies and republics. They saw this as the best way to come to terms with the fact of a white Afrikaner majority, as well as to promote their larger strategic interests in the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of {{an increasing number}} of important products of the Quoit Brooch ″school″ in northern France, however, shows that neither the style, nor the forms of jewellery are purely insular developments and that they cannot be linked with any particular ethnic group. An alternative theory has therefore been advanced that they are associated with broadly Germanic, mercenary or <b>federate</b> forces employed in the defence of both southern Britain and northern Gaul in the 5th century, who identified themselves and their status by the creation of innovative metalwork in late Roman tradition.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation {{of the use}} of Anglo-Saxons as foederati or <b>federate</b> troops {{has been}} seen as coming from burials of Anglo-Saxons wearing {{military}} equipment of a type issued to late Roman forces, which have been found both in late Roman contexts, such as the Roman cemeteries of Winchester and Colchester, and in purely 'Anglo-Saxon' rural cemeteries like Mucking (Essex), though this was at a settlement used by the Romano-British. The distribution of the earliest Anglo-Saxon sites and place names in close proximity to Roman settlements and roads has been interpreted as showing that initial Anglo-Saxon settlements were being controlled by the Romano-British.|$|E
25|$|Alaric {{was again}} {{declared}} {{an enemy of}} the Emperor. The conspiracy then massacred the families of the <b>federate</b> troops (as presumed supporters of Stilicho, although they had probably rebelled against him), and the troops defected en masse to Alaric. The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate, and had no policy except hunting down supporters of Stilicho. Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter. Heraclianus, a co-conspirator of Olympius, became governor of the Diocese of Africa, where he controlled the source of most of Italy's grain, and he supplied food only in the interests of Honorius's regime.|$|E

The British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious lines with the Christians to Ethiopia and the Muslims to Sudan. This, however, caused great controversy. Then, in 1952, the UN decided to <b>federate</b> Eritrea to Ethiopia, hoping to reconcile Ethiopian claims of sovereignty and Eritrean aspirations for independence. About nine years later, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie dissolved the federation and annexed Eritrea, triggering a thirty-year armed struggle in Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} New South Wales {{refers to the}} history of the state of New South Wales and the area's {{preceding}} Indigenous and British colonial societies. The Mungo Lake remains indicate occupation of parts of the New South Wales area by Indigenous Australians for at least 40,000 years. The English navigator James Cook became the first European to map the coast in 1770 and a First Fleet of British convicts followed to establish a penal colony at Sydney in 1788. The colony established an autonomous Parliamentary democracy from the 1840s and became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 following a vote to <b>Federate</b> with the other British colonies of Australia. Through the 20th century, the state was a major destination for an increasingly diverse collection of migrants from many nations. In the 21st century, the state is the most populous in Australia, and its capital, Sydney is a major financial capital and host to international cultural and economic events.|$|E
25|$|Theodosius {{had to face}} a {{powerful}} usurper in the West; Magnus Maximus declared himself Emperor in 383, stripped troops from the outlying regions of Britannia (probably replacing some with <b>federate</b> chieftains and their war-bands) and invaded Gaul. His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces, where {{he was responsible for}} the first official executions of Christian heretics. To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia, Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control. In 387 Maximus invaded Italy, forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East, where he accepted Nicene Christianity. Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces, and hordes of Goths, Huns, and Alans followed Theodosius. Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as Augustus of the West, but Theodosius refused, gathered his armies, and counterattacked, winning the civil war in 388. There were heavy troop losses {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Later Welsh legend has Maximus's defeated troops resettled in Armorica, instead of returning to Britannia, and by 400, Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae rather than by imperial authority.|$|E

25|$|Catherine Hills {{suggests}} {{it is not}} necessary to see all the early settlers as <b>federate</b> troops, and that this interpretation has been used rather too readily by some archaeologists. A variety of relationships could have existed between Romano-British and incoming Anglo-Saxons. The broader archaeological picture suggests that no one model will explain all the Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain and that there was considerable regional variation. Settlement density varied within southern and eastern England. Norfolk has more large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries than the neighbouring East Anglian county of Suffolk; eastern Yorkshire (the nucleus of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira) far more than the rest of Northumbria. The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, but we should not assume that all of these were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later Viking settlers, may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.|$|E
500|$|Following Malayan {{independence}} from Britain in 1957, proposals to <b>federate</b> {{the states of}} Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei, and Singapore led to tensions with Indonesia. In late-1962 the Indonesian president, Sukarno, had begun military operations {{in an attempt to}} destabilise the new state, including an attempt to seize power in the independent enclave of Brunei in December. Following the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, hostilities grew with military activity increasing along the Indonesian side of the border in Borneo, as small parties of armed men began infiltrating Malaysian territory on propaganda and sabotage missions. Carried out by Indonesian irregular [...] "volunteers", these operations continued throughout 1963. However, by 1964 Indonesian regular army (TNI) units had also become involved.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Ofsted {{recommended}} that Lincolnshire County Council review schools with under 600 pupils. Two years later, the Council's education officers suggested {{that some of}} these schools merge, close or <b>federate</b> to make them more economical. One such school was Lafford High in Billinghay, which had been under-performing in GCSE and A-level league tables. St George's became federated with Lafford and another small village school, Aveland High in Billingborough in 2005 and 2006 respectively. A plan to merge them into an Academy was announced the following year; Coteland's School in Ruskington was allowed to opt-in. When David Veal retired as headteacher of Coteland's in 2007, the school joined the federation; with that, Paul Watson became executive head of all four schools. Despite improvements, the village schools were performing below the national average and Aveland was one of the lowest performing schools academically in Lincolnshire. The County Council began consulting parents in 2008 about closing Lafford due to falling numbers. Despite denials from Watson, parents complained that he had lost [...] "passion" [...] for the school and that St George's [...] "cherry-picked" [...] the most able pupils. After a heated meeting with them in 2008, Watson resigned as Principal at Lafford and the school closed in 2010.|$|E

500|$|In the Second World War, the Japanese Army invaded and {{occupied}} Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore {{for over three}} years. During this time, ethnic tensions were raised and nationalism grew. Popular support for independence increased after Malaya was reconquered by Allied forces. Post-war British plans to unite the administration of Malaya under a single crown colony called the [...] "Malayan Union" [...] met with strong opposition from the Malays, who opposed the weakening of the Malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the ethnic Chinese. The Malayan Union, established in 1946, and consisting of all the British possessions in the Malay Peninsula {{with the exception of}} Singapore, was quickly dissolved and replaced on 1 February 1948 by the Federation of Malaya, which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection. During this time, mostly Chinese rebels under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. The Malayan Emergency lasted from 1948 to 1960, and involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by Commonwealth troops in Malaya. On 31 August 1957, Malaya became an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations. After this a plan was put in place to <b>federate</b> Malaya with the crown colonies of North Borneo (which joined as Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore. The date of federation was planned to be 31 August 1963 so as to coincide with the anniversary of Malayan independence; however, federation was delayed until 16 September 1963 in order for a United Nations survey of support for federation in Sabah and Sarawak, called for by parties opposed to federation including Indonesia's Sukarno and the Sarawak United Peoples' Party, to be completed.|$|E
500|$|Kennel {{was born}} in 1925 to a Mennonite family who lived in Chassey-Beaupré. His father was a farmer and mayor of the city, and Kennel was {{expected}} to run the family farm when he was older. At age20, Kennel developed an interest in pastoral ministry and attended theological training at the Bible Institute of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1945–46, training that was later completed by studies at the European Mennonite Bible School in 1948–49. While still a farmer, he became a Mennonite missionary in the Meuse, Marne and Haute-Marne departments. In 1960, he discovered Pentecostalism through Roma missions, notably the Life and Light Evangelical Roma Mission (Mission Évangélique Tsigane [...] "Vie et Lumière"); he was attracted to this form of Christianity, since it emphasized missionary zeal and legitimized his ministry. He founded an evangelical group in his city, which caused conflict with his family, other religious leaders and his neighbors. In the early 1960s, Kennel became pastor of the church at Joinville; he conducted humanitarian activities on his farm, providing relief to homeless, former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics. In 1964, he also directed the church of Saint-Dizier; three years later, he decided to give up farming to fully devote himself to religious activities. In 1975 he was appointed treasurer of the Federation of Free Evangelical Pentecostals, and elected president seven years later. Under Kennel's leadership of the Pentecostal Church of Besançon, the church quickly opened many places of worship in Northern and Eastern France; Kennel trained pastors among his converts (including his son Étienne, who was ordained in 1981), {{and sent them to}} direct the new assemblies. In 1989 Kennel legally registered the Evangelical Missionary Federation, whose purpose was to <b>federate</b> all the churches (then composed of over thirty pastors).|$|E

To contemporaries of Confederation the con- prefix indicated a strengthening of the centrist principle compared to the American federation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Federated</b> {{queries are}} regular {{relational}} queries accessing data {{on one or}} more remote relational or non-relational data sources, possibly combining them with tables stored in the <b>federated</b> DBMS server. Their execution is typically divided between the <b>federated</b> server and the remote data sources. Outdated and incomplete statistics have a bigger impact on <b>federated</b> DBMS than on regular DBMS, as maintenance of <b>federated</b> statistics is unequally more complicated and expensive than {{the maintenance of the}} local statistics; consequently bad performance commonly occurs for <b>federated</b> queries due to the selection of a suboptimal query plan. To solve this problem we propose a progressive optimization technique for <b>federated</b> queries called POP/FED by extending {{the state of the art}} for progressive reoptimization for local source queries, POP [4]. POP/FED uses (a) an opportunistic, but risk controlled reoptimization technique for <b>federated</b> DBMS, (b) a technique for multiple reoptimizations during <b>federated</b> query processing with a strategy to discover redundant and eliminate partial results, and (c) a mechanism to eagerly procure statistics in a <b>federated</b> environment. In this demonstration we showcase POP/FED implemented in a prototype version of WebSphere Information Integrator for DB 2 using the TPC-H benchmark database and its workload. For selected queries of the workload we show unique features including multi-round reoptimizations using both a new graphical reoptimization progress monitor POPMonitor and the DB 2 graphical plan explain tool. 1...|$|R
