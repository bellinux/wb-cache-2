5|$|With {{his eldest}} son dead, Henry rearranged {{the plans for the}} succession: Richard was to be made king of England, albeit without any actual power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would have to retain Brittany, as he held it by marriage, so Henry's {{favourite}} son John would become the duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard, however, refused to give up Aquitaine; he was deeply attached to the duchy, and had no desire to exchange this role for the meaningless one of being the junior King of England. Henry was furious, and ordered John and Geoffrey to march south and retake the duchy by force. The short war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation at Westminster in England at the end of 1184. Henry finally <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> way in early 1185 by bringing Eleanor to Normandy to instruct Richard to obey his father, while simultaneously threatening to give Normandy, and possibly England, to Geoffrey. This proved enough and Richard finally handed over the ducal castles in Aquitaine to Henry.|$|E

25|$|Oswald made a cameo {{appearance}} in the first animated sequence with both sound and color (two-strip Technicolor), a 2½-minute animated sequence of the live action movie The King of Jazz (1930), produced by Laemmle for Universal.

The Oswald cartoons then returned to black-and-white, except for the last one, The Egg Cracker Suite (1943), released {{as a part of the}} Swing Symphonies series. Egg Cracker was also the only Oswald cartoon to use three-strip Technicolor. But before he was permanently retired, Oswald made a cameo {{appearance in}} The Woody Woodpecker Polka (1951), also in three-strip Technicolor, which by then had become the norm in the cartoon industry.

25|$|Despite being {{introduced}} as heels, the group quickly became favorites {{of the audience}} and eventually began acting as faces. They received strong approval from the audience even during their debut, which occurred in Tucson, Arizona. The Mexicools' first PPV debut was on July 24 at The Great American Bash, defeating bWo in a six-man tag team match. During December 2 edition of SmackDown!, Super Crazy and Psicosis competed in an over the top rope battle royal against 5 other tag teams. The pair managed to win and earned themselves a match against MNM at Armageddon for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Unfortunately for the Mexicools, MNM lost the tag team titles before their match. Not long after, Super Crazy and Psicosis became the only Mexicools left in WWE, as Juventud was released from WWE on January 6, 2006. Super Crazy and Psicosis continued to wrestle as a tag team, but Crazy <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> push as a singles competitor, eventually earning himself #1 contendership for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. By June, 2006 Super Crazy's partnership with Psicosis on SmackDown! began to crumble when Psicosis repeatedly abandoned Crazy during incidents with monster heel The Great Khali. This resulted in the pairing splitting up and then engaging in a short-lived feud after Psicosis turned heel. After the breakup, both Psicosis and Super Crazy disappeared off WWE programming.|$|E
25|$|D.C. United's sudden turn in {{fortunes}} {{continued in}} the team's final home regular-season match, against cellar-dwelling Chicago Fire. United broke through {{late in the first}} half, when Pontius won a race, beating two defenders and the Fire's goalie, Jon Busch to the ball and then rounding the goalie and slotting home the first goal. Midway through the second half, Boswell scored with a header on a corner kick taken by Espindola. A few minutes later, Espindola <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> goal, with an assist to DeLeon, when a sharply taken shot was deflected just inside the near post. A 4-0 scoreline was completed when a deflected shot came to Saborio in the 6-yard box, and the Costa Rican striker's shot beat the Fire 'keeper. The four-goal margin was the team's largest margin of victory since August 2011. The team would close out the regular season in Columbus, part of MLS' first Decision Day. Going into this final day, United held a one-point lead over Columbus for second place in the Eastern Conference, but four teams would be playing with a chance at claiming second place and a bye through the first round of MLS playoffs. That prize would depend on the results in Columbus and in a match being played at the same time between visiting Montreal and host Toronto. As United geared to play the MLS regular season finale, CONCACAF group play concluded. Thanks to a goal surrendered by the Los Angeles Galaxy on the last kick of their game in Guatemala, D.C. United would carry the #2 seed into the CONCACAF quarterfinals, matching them against the #7 seed, Queretaro F.C. in early 2016.|$|E
500|$|William Moseley as Peter Pevensie. In a {{departure}} from the novel, Peter has a rivalry with Caspian. Moseley explained, [...] "Peter's <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> issues to deal with, and Caspian's <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> issues to deal with, and when neither is willing to compromise, there's bound to be friction. Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said, and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over, so that causes some of it. That's really what happens. And it's a lot about humility. I think they both have to learn a certain humility [...] and that's really what a great king needs is to be humble, to listen to his people, to be willing to compromise, and they start off as these sort of angry teenagers, and become kings at the end." [...] In real life, the two actors got on well together. Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter, having gone back to school between shooting both films. He trained for three months in New York City to improve his performance and his physicality.|$|E

500|$|Powderfinger {{spent less}} money {{producing}} Double Allergic than on their previous works. Previously, the band {{had worked with}} Tony Cohen, whom Fanning stated was expensive due to his success in the industry. For Double Allergic the band chose Tim Whitten, a less well known producer, and because the band knew what they intended to do {{as they entered the}} studio they managed to spend less despite the improved sound. Middleton commented on Whitten's capabilities in the recording studio, saying [...] "He's what a band looks for in a producer/engineer, because he's <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> ideas", but stating that Whitten would also listen to and appreciate the band's ideas.|$|E
500|$|Bart had {{originally}} been envisioned as [...] "a much milder, troubled youth given to existential angst who talks to himself", but the character was changed based on Cartwright's voice acting. Groening has credited several different figures with providing inspiration for Bart: Matt Groening's older brother Mark provided much of the motivation for Bart's attitude. Bart was conceived as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening describes Bart as [...] "what would happen if Eddie Haskell [...] <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> show". Groening has {{also said that he}} found the premise of Dennis the Menace disappointing and was inspired to create a character who was actually a menace.|$|E
