With the advent of time technology has provided tremendous advancements on its consumption, generation and distribution, one such area for its improvement is in its billing system and data mining approach has given a large scope for its improvement in billing system. Our existing electricity board billing system is obsolete and time consuming. The approach here is based on consumption because we cannot rely on the meter reading as it might give faulty readings as the meter may be mutilated or damaged manually and their might be large differences between power consumption and the amount billed. This approach here also checks on electricity theft and helps in maintaining the <b>electricity</b> <b>billing</b> standards.

We propose ANNOT, a system to automate electricity data annotation leveraging cheap wireless sensor nodes. Characteristic sensory stimuli captured by sensor nodes placed next to appliances are translated into appliance operating state and correlated to the electricity data, autonomously generating the annotation of electricity data with appliance activity. The system is able to facilitate the acquisition of appliance signatures, training data and validate the monitoring output.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on economic development {{in the context of}} South Asia. In the first essay, I study how power outages impact large scale manufacturing firms. First, I use monthly <b>electricity</b> <b>billing</b> data from large scale manufacturing firms in Pakistan to characterize how these firms respond to interruptions in electricity supply. I show that firms differentially adjust on-grid capacity utilization based on their sensitivities to increases in fuel costs. Next, I incorporate the empirical results into a dynamic model of utilization adjustment and self-generation in response to power outages and estimate structural cost parameters. Finally, I use my estimates to determine the magnitude of cost increases that firms incur. My results suggest that between January 2010 to March 2012, no firm in my sample had a cost increase above 1 %. During quarters of high numbers of outages, the cost increases for most firms is below 3 %. In my sample, firms in the chemical and textile industries are impacted by power outages more than firms, of similar size, in other industries. In the second essay, I examine the impact of power outages on the likelihood of manu- facturing firm exit. Again, I use proprietary <b>electricity</b> <b>billing</b> data for manufacturing firms in Pakistan to determine the month of exit and merge this with monthly outage data during the period 2009 - 2012. I find that power outages disproportionately increase the exit proba- bility of small firms (both in the formal and informal sector). For each 100 hours of power outages, the probability of small firm exit increases by over 6 %. This result is consistent with existing evidence on the impact of power disruption on various measures of firm health as well as research on the cost impact of outages on large scale manufacturing and suggests that policies which target small firms are more likely to alleviate the detrimental effects of power disruption. In the third essay, I study how religious holidays impact the incidence of violence between Hindus and Muslims in India and I analyze how violence impacts vote share. By exploiting variation in the timing of religious holidays - because Hindu and Muslim holidays follow Sanskrit and Lunar calendars, respectively - I show that religious holidays and the interaction of Hindu and Muslim holidays positively affect the incidence of violence. Next, I consider the usefulness of violence by studying the electoral effects of violence on vote share. I find that violence before an election is associated with electoral gains...|$|E

The meter carries out the calculation of the demand for the kWh consumption, being based on a staggered rate of domestic type of the Federal Commission of Electricity (C. F. E.) in Mexico. The prototype also presents voltage, current, power and time measurements. The instrument takes voltage and current samples of sinusoidal waves which are converted to digital in real time. The system {{is based on the}} microcontroller PIC 16 F 874 of the Microchip technology. All the measured and calculated parameters are visualized in a screen of liquid glass of 2 X 16 characters. There is a menu where the parameters are selected to be shown. As a protection, when the electric power supply fails, the meter stores the energy consumption and the remaining parameters in a EEPROM memory. The prototype was divided in four stages: data acquisition, signal conditioning, signal processing and visualization of results, and together, they are a prototype of a digital meter of electric energy for C.

40|$|Abstract—Autonomous demand {{response}} (DR) programs are scalable {{and result in}} a minimal control overhead on utilities. The idea is to equip each user with an energy consumption scheduling (ECS) device to automatically control the user’s flexible load to minimize his energy expenditure, based on the updated electricity pricing information. While most prior works on autonomous DR have focused on coordinating the operation of ECS devices {{in order to achieve}} various system-wide goals, such as minimizing the total cost of generation or minimizing the peak-to-average ratio in the load demand, they fall short addressing the important issue of fairness. That is, while they usually guarantee optimality, they do not assure that the participating users are rewarded according to their contributions in achieving the overall system’s design objectives. Similarly, they do not address the important problem of co-existence when only a sub-set of users participate in a deployed autonomous DR program. In this paper, we seek to tackle these shortcomings and design new autonomous DR systems that can achieve both optimality and fairness. In this regard, we first develop a centralized DR system to serve as a benchmark. Then, we develop a smart <b>electricity</b> <b>billing</b> mechanism that can enforce both optimality and fairness in autonomous DR systems in a decentralized fashion...|$|E

Additionally, the energy infrastructure is changing fundamentally. On the one hand, the installation of so called smart meters offers the possibility of more detailed monitoring and fine grained <b>electricity</b> <b>billing.</b> On the other hand, the amount of data produced within the power grid increases dramatically. Utility companies will use such data to increase prediction accuracy and to improve energy production, while consumers will more and more transform to prosumers. Within that environment the necessity of short-term predictions increases to improve the power grids stability. In this article, we respond {{to some of the}} challenges that energy consumers and providers face by an implementation of a prototypical recording, monitoring and analysis landscape that uses smart meter data. The challenges that this article tackles include: real-time energy consumption classification; mass energy consumption data classification; and early short-term energy consumption prediction. In extensive experiments on real-world data, we show that such challenges can be handled effectively.
