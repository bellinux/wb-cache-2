2500|$|A {{grey goo}} is another catastrophic scenario, which was {{proposed}} by Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation, has been analyzed by Freitas in [...] "Some Limits to <b>Global</b> <b>Ecophagy</b> by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations" [...] {{and has been}} a theme in mainstream media and fiction. This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks. [...] Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to [...] Chris Phoenix a [...] "So-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident". With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called green goo has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological organisms engineered through nanotechnology.|$|E

At one point, hominids become sapient, {{and go on to}} develop technology, including an evolving universal constructor machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of <b>global</b> <b>ecophagy</b> consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. Human extinction (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet. (The extinction-level event that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the Rabaul caldera, coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in Evolution are ponderous Romans, sapient dinosaurs, the last of the wild Neanderthals, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, symbiotic primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. In the book's epilogue, it is implied that the replicator machines sent by humans to Mars have developed sentience and high technology, unknowingly advancing the late mankind's legacy in the Universe.|$|E
