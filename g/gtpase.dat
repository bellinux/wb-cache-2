During the recent years, an increased awareness of a communication between signalling systems employing Ras-like <b>GTPases</b> and signalling systems employing calcium has emerged. For instance, the intensity of the activation of Ras-like <b>GTPases</b> is regulated by calcium-dependent mechanisms, acting on proteins that facilitate the activation or inactivation of the small <b>GTPases.</b> Other Ras-like <b>GTPases</b> have a direct influence on calcium signalling by regulating the activity of certain calcium channels.

During interphase, these proteins are located at the nuclear pores {{and participate in the}} nucleo-cytoplasmic transport.

25|$|SulA/FtsZ {{mediated}} filamentation: This is {{a mechanism}} to halt cell division and repair DNA. In the presence of single-stranded DNA regions, due to the action of different external cues (that induce mutations), the major bacterial recombinase (RecA) binds to this DNA regions and is activated {{by the presence of}} free nucleotide triphosphates. This activated RecA stimulates the autoproteolysis of the SOS transcriptional repressor LexA. The LexA regulon includes a cell division inhibitor, SulA, that prevent the transmission of mutant DNA to the daughter cells. SulA is a dimer that binds FtsZ (a tubulin-like <b>GTPase)</b> in a 1:1 ratio and acts specifically on its polymerization which results in the formation of non-septated bacteria filaments.

Like other β-tubulin isotypes, βIII-tubulin has a <b>GTPase</b> domain which plays an essential role in regulating microtubule dynamics. Differences between Class I (the most commonly represented and constitutively expressed isotype) and class III β-tubulin are limited to only 13aa within region 1-429aa, while all amino acids in region 430-450aa are divergent. These variations in primary structure affect the paclitaxel (a mimic of Nur77) binding domain on βIII-tubulin and may account for the ability of this isotype to confer resistance to Nur77-initiated apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Small <b>GTPases</b> (guanosine triphosphate, GTP) are {{involved}} in many critical cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, and migration. GTP loading and isoprenylation are two important post-translational modifications of small <b>GTPases,</b> and are critical for their normal function. In this study, we investigated the role of post-translational modifications of small <b>GTPases</b> in regulating endothelial cell inflammatory responses and junctional integrity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) treated with atorvastatin demonstrated significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -mediated IL- 6 and IL- 8 generation. The inhibitory effect of atorvastatin (Atorva) was attenuated by co-treatment with 100 µM mevalonate (MVA) or 10 µM geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by 10 µM farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Atorvastatin treatment of HUVECs produced a time-dependent increase in GTP loading of all Rho <b>GTPases,</b> and induced the translocation of small Rho <b>GTPases</b> from the cellular membrane to the cytosol, which was reversed by 100 µM MVA and 10 µM GGPP, but not by 10 µM FPP. Atorvastatin significantly attenuated thrombin-induced HUVECs permeability, increased VE-cadherin targeting to cell junctions, and preserved junction integrity. These effects were partially reversed by GGPP but not by FPP, indicating that geranylgeranylation of small <b>GTPases</b> {{plays a major role}} in regulating endothelial junction integrity. Silencing of small <b>GTPases</b> showed that Rho and Rac, but not Cdc 42, play central role in HUVECs junction integrity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our studies show that post-translational modification of small <b>GTPases</b> plays a vital role in regulating endothelial inflammatory response and endothelial junction integrity. Atorvastatin increased GTP loading and inhibited isoprenylation of small <b>GTPases,</b> accompanied by reduced inflammatory response and preserved cellular junction integrity...|$|R
25|$|Importin {{proteins}} bind their cargo in the cytoplasm, {{after which}} {{they are able to}} interact with the nuclear pore complex and pass through its channel. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin that causes it to dissociate from its cargo. The resulting complex of importin and Ran-GTP then translocates to the cytoplasm, where a protein called Ran Binding Protein (RanBP) separates Ran-GTP from importin. Separation allows access to a <b>GTPase</b> activating protein (GAP) that binds Ran-GTP and induces the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The Ran-GDP produced from this process now binds the nuclear transport factor NUTF2 which returns it to the nucleoplasm. Now in the nucleus, the Ran-GDP interacts with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which replaces the GDP with GTP, resulting again in Ran-GTP, and beginning the cycle anew.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proteins}} of the synaptic ribbon {{have also}} {{been found to be}} associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a <b>GTPase</b> expressed on synaptic vesicles that is important in priming synaptic vesicles. Immunostaining has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar synaptic ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself {{to the base of the}} synaptic ribbons and subsequently anchoring the synaptic ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These are shed during high rates of exocytosis. The only unique protein associated with the synaptic ribbon is RIBEYE, first identified in purified synaptic ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate synaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the synaptic ribbon.|$|E

How effectors distinguish between homologous Rab <b>GTPases</b> represents an unresolved problem {{with respect to the}} specificity of vesicular trafficking. Using a structural proteomic approach, we have determined the specificity and structural basis underlying the interaction of the multivalent effector rabenosyn- 5 with the Rab family. The results demonstrate that even the structurally similar effector domains in rabenosyn- 5 can achieve highly selective recognition of distinct subsets of Rab <b>GTPases</b> exclusively through interactions with the switch and interswitch regions. The observed specificity is determined at a family-wide level by structural diversity in the active conformation, which governs the spatial disposition of critical conserved recognition determinants, and by a small number of both positive and negative sequence determinants that allow further discrimination between Rab <b>GTPases</b> with similar switch conformations...|$|R
40|$|Regulation {{of plant}} cell wall {{deposition}} and patterning {{is essential for}} the normal growth and development of plants. Small <b>GTPases</b> play pivotal roles in the modulation of primary cell wall formation by controlling cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking. However, the functions of small <b>GTPases</b> in secondary cell wall development are poorly understood. Recent studies on xylem cells revealed that the Rho of plants (ROP) group of small <b>GTPases</b> critically participates in the spatial patterning of secondary cell walls. In differentiating xylem cells, a specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) /guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) pair facilitates local activation of ROP 11 to establish de novo plasma membrane domains.
