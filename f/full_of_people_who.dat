5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E
500|$|The Bajorans {{have been}} {{described}} as analogues for a variety of displaced peoples, with Star Trek novelist Keith DeCandido comparing them to [...] "Palestinians, Jews, Kurds, Haitians; the sad reality is that you can pretty much pick and choose. History is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have had their homes taken from them, forced to become refugees." [...] The Cardassian occupation of Bajor (the Bajoran homeworld) has been compared to the Holocaust, with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor. In his chapter [...] "Speakers for the Dead: Star Trek, the Holocaust, and the Representation of Atrocity" [...] within the book Star Trek as Myth, writer Matthew Wilheim Kapell compared the experiences and reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. He said that the impact on Ro represented the [...] "non-american view of the holocaust" [...] in that she does not fully recover from the trauma and continues to affect in, for example preventing her from connecting with her religious beliefs in [...] "The Next Phase". He explains that Kira is a far more [...] "Americanize" [...] character, acting as a [...] "resister and even liberator" [...] during the occupation. As a result, unlike Ro, Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma. Further commentary of Ro's relationship to religion have been made. In The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek, James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in [...] "The Next Phase" [...] to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri's Inferno.|$|E

[...] said Phil Van Aver, a member of Manhattan Community Board 3. Board 3 and the nonprofit social service organizations supported the goal of clearing Tompkins Square Park of the drug dealers, drunks, addicts and anti-social elements that considered it home. [...] Instead, the police riot ripped open old wounds about brutality and the neighborhood's housing problem many longtime residents faced. [...] "The police, by acting in the brutal fashion that they did, managed to link a small group of crazies to the legitimate sentiments of opposition to gentrification," [...] said Valerio Orselli, director of the Cooper Square Committee, a nonprofit housing group. [...] "Now the issue has become police brutality, not housing. It's set everyone back." ...|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on {{the content}} of the book, Mander has written: [...] With {{mounting}} astonishment and anguish, we discovered as many as 65 refugee colonies, 28 in Muzaffarnagar and 37 in Shamli, housing 29,328 residents, described in our report Living Apart. Even this does not represent the <b>full</b> numbers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could never return to the villages of their birth. Uncounted populations bought houses or rented homes in existing Muslim settlements, or permanently migrated out of these districts or even the state.

Young men again were here of various social origins, young Americans, treasonable clerks from other concerns, university young men, keen-looking, most of them, resolute, reserved, but on a sort of hair trigger, ready at any moment to be most voluble, most persuasive.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning we}} left Nongoma {{early in the}} hope of {{reaching}} Ulundi that evening if the Ivuna and Black Umfolozi Rivers proved fordable. As it chanced, although they were high, we were able to cross them, I seated on the horse which two of the Zulus led. Next we tramped for miles through the terrible Bekameezi Valley, a hot and desolate place which the Zulus swear is haunted.

40|$|The ageing of the {{population}} in Japan has become a problem. According to the research of differ-ent regions, where the ratio of the ageing population is above 25 %, it is found that the Japanese society is gradually turned to hyper-aged society.

This study is based on the background, with excessive reliance on their own vehicles and public transport problems arising from the abolition of public transportation in Kitakyushu as the area of this study.

The Conference was hosted and presented by the University of South Africa, the State Theatre, Pretoria, the City Council of Pretoria and the University of Pretoria from 19 - 25 July 1998. South African newspapers have been <b>full</b> <b>of</b> stories <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are claiming land which belonged to them and from which they were forcibly removed.

Buchu is an indigenous herb found in many parts of South Africa. The name “Buchu” comes from the Khoi language, the Khoi people having been the first to recognise its medical qualities. The opera was composed by the South African composer, Roelof Temmingh. The librettist, Michael Williams, was the director and David Scarr the conductor of the opera. The opera in three acts was sung in English and Afrikaans with English subtitles. The papers were donated to the Unisa Library by the Unisa Music Foundation in 1998. The material includes correspondence, vocal scores, scripts, libretto and the complete orchestral material. The conductor’s score is not included in the material.
