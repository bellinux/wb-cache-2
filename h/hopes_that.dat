5|$|Afterward, Bond {{admits to}} his spotter {{that he did}} not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be {{considered}} a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> M will fire him for it.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{provided}} more than $7million {{to fund the}} census, the largest pan-African aerial survey since the 1970s. The Great Elephant Census team is flying over 20 countries to survey the African savannah elephants with <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the accurate and up-to-date data will spur immediate protective actions and long-term conservation management plans.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Never mind that. Now it's a {{perfectly}} damnable {{thing for you}} to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your liver theory is true, because it amounts to <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> Craven will die an agonizing death. (This strikes Paramore as paradoxical; but it startles him.) But it's amiable and human to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your theory about Julia is right, because it amounts to <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> she may live happily ever after.|$|R

5|$|Johnston went to Washington in December in <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> Virginia {{would be}} readmitted to the Union. It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston {{was able to}} take his seat shortly afterward. The delay was due to a Congressional need to pass an act that would allow Virginia {{representation}} in the body.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the O Street Market {{was delayed}} {{for two years}} as the {{developers}} sought {{to meet the demands}} imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board.

5|$|Despite Swedish <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the Dutch {{would not}} enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty by sending a 45-ship relief fleet. On October 7, 1658 the Dutch fleet set sail from Vlie. Two weeks later, on October 22, it {{anchored}} northwest of Helsingør, unable to proceed for six days due to wind conditions. Wrangel suggested the Swedes should attack, but Charles X still wanted to avoid provoking the Dutch.|$|E

Byers <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> he will meet her at the convention.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} {{to reconcile the}} rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hopes</b> <b>that</b> {{the ballet}} {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> the show would be pulled off the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the stands of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by the situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and was created by Maeda in the <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> he {{would go on to}} be a memorable villain. Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.|$|E
