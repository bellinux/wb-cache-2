5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{acquisition}} of Burger King by TPG Capital in 2002, its new CEO Bradley (Brad) Blum set about reversing {{the fortunes of the}} company's advertising programs. The company reinstated its famous <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> motto and engaged Miami-based advertising agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B), which was known for having a hip, subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients. CP+B updated Burger King's image and changed its marketing strategy. The cups, bags and the company logo were redesigned with the intent to give and BK an appealing, culturally aware and modern image. Humorous statements, claims and product descriptions were printed on bags, product packaging and on in-store promotional materials, including a Burger King Bill of Rights, using the slogan <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Way.</b> CP+B created an advertising campaign that focused on television spots, print, web and product tie-ins.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{was founded}} in 1954, {{international}} fast food chain Burger King has employed many advertising programs. During the 1970s, its advertisements included a memorable jingle, the inspiration for its current mascot the Burger King and several well-known and parodied slogans, such as <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> and It takes two hands to hold a Whopper. From the early 1980s until approximately 2002, Burger King engaged a series of advertising agencies that produced many unsuccessful slogans and programs, including its least successful campaign, Where's Herb?.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> own <b>way.</b> Personally, I wouldn't trust a {{man like}} that. And, as for letting my {{daughter}} marry his son...!" ...|$|R
500|$|The CP+B {{produced}} Coq Roq advertisements {{followed a}} pattern of controversy for the company, as previous advertisements produced by CP+B had come under fire for perceived or overt sexual innuendo. An earlier example {{of this type of}} advertisement was a promotion for a LTO version of Burger King's TenderCrisp sandwich which featured Darius Rucker in a commercial singing a variant of Burger King's <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> jingle that featured a line about [...] "a train of ladies with a nice caboose," [...] where caboose was not referring to the last car of a train, but the buttocks of the actresses featured in the commercial. The issues raised by public interest groups in this instance came from complaints over the double entendres and sexual innuendo on the Coq Roq website. Pictures of scantily clad women posing as groupies of the band were featured in one section of the site and sported comments such as [...] "groupies love the Coq" [...] and [...] "Groupies love Coq". Protests from the public over the sexual innuendo of the comments forced BK to request CB+P to have content be changed to something more appropriate for a family oriented restaurant.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Lucy. <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> now. But you'll {{only have}} all the more to make up to me later," [...] said Pan, with {{resigned}} good nature.|$|E

50|$|Other {{prominent}} international {{fast food}} companies include Burger King, {{the number two}} hamburger chain in the world, known for promoting its customized menu offerings (<b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Way).</b> Another international fast food chain is KFC, which sells Chicken-related products and is the number 1 Fast Food company in the People's Republic of China.|$|E

50|$|Burger King has {{two of its}} own {{in-house}} national {{charitable organizations}} and programs. One is the <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> Foundation, a US-based non-profit (501(c)(3)) corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation, disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the US. The other charitable organization is the McLamore Foundation, also a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that provides scholarships to students in the US and its territories.|$|E

5000|$|That strange flower, the sun, Is {{just what}} you say. <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> <b>way.</b> The world is ugly, And the people are sad. That tuft of jungle feathers, That animal eye, Is {{just what you}} say. That savage of fire, That seed, <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> <b>way.</b> The world is ugly, And the people are sad. Perspectives or 'takes' on the world may be less or more insightful, ranging from 'the world is ugly' to a poetic take on the sun. Stevens has been {{understood}} as an idealist, denying {{the existence of a}} (mind-independent) external world, but that is not necessary. Apart from perspectives, there is nothing to say about the world. Saying introduces a perspective. That much can be gleaned from The Snow Man, which begins with beautiful perspectives ("Junipers shagged with ice," [...] etc.) and ends with a dramatic last line, stripping the perspectives down to nothing as the self loses its capacity to project itself onto the world. Neither [...] "Gubbinal" [...] nor [...] "The Snow Man" [...] means that the external world is an illusion, or a figment of imagination. They are testifying rather to the creative power of imagination. The poem says [...] "Have it your way", but it shows poetic possibilities that defy the banal perspectives.|$|E

40|$|Professor Kent Greenfield, Boston College Law School, {{delivers}} an Osgoode Guest Seminar on October 22, 2012. We are {{fixated on}} the idea of choice. Our political theory is based on the consent of the governed. Our legal system is built upon the argument that people freely make choices and bear responsibility for them. And what slogan could better express the heart of our consumer culture than 2 ̆ 2 <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> 2 ̆ 2 ? In this talk, Kent Greenfield explores unsettling questions about the choices we make. What if they are more constrained and limited than we like to think? If we have less free will than we realize, what are the implications for us as individuals and for our society...|$|E
6000|$|Fulkerson laughed. [...] "Well, well! <b>Have</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> own <b>way,</b> But {{the sight}} of your face in the patent {{outsides}} of the country press would be worth half a dozen subscribers in every school district throughout the length and breadth of this fair land." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wanted it to {{come over}} my mouth, I s'pose," [...] said the unfortunate Mr. Jobson. [...] "Well, <b>'ave</b> <b>it</b> <b>your</b> own <b>way.</b> Don't mind about me. What with the {{trousers}} and the collar, I couldn't pick up a sovereign if I saw one in front of me." ...|$|R

"That," [...] said Arnold of Sewa, [...] "I {{put down}} {{entirely to the}} fact that you and your friends, by not exercising tact, irritated the Governor, and made him unwilling to listen to anybody else.
