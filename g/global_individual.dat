These data suggests that {{the intensity of the}} commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{globalization}} forces companies and <b>individuals</b> to develop <b>global</b> mindsets. However, what a global mindset means {{on an individual}} level, how it relates to globalization, and which factors influence this mindset remains unclear. So far, research on this topic has been more conceptual than empirical. In this article we will describe the <b>individual</b> <b>global</b> mindset and its dimensions {{based on interviews with}} fifteen global leaders of three multinational companies. Our empirical study reveals that an <b>individual</b> <b>global</b> mindset is a way one perceives the world and the globalization of markets, people and companies. A global leader has a global mindset when this person has a positive attitude toward the above mentioned developments. The functions of an <b>individual</b> <b>global</b> mindset to a global leader are a means to structure the complex global reality and to provide guidelines for appropriate leadership behavior like formulating a global vision and interpersonal skills. Therefore, an <b>individual</b> <b>global</b> mindset is a way of thinking rather than behavior. In comparison with a domestic or an expatriate leader a global leader is considered to possess a broader perspective on the world, on markets, companies, and people.

5000|$|GRAI {{is one of}} two GS1 keys for asset identification. GRAI is used to {{identify}} returnable assets, the other being the <b>Global</b> <b>Individual</b> Asset Identifier. It is for re-usable packages or transport equipment, such as crates, bread trays, pallets or beer kegs. The GRAI enables returnable assets to be identified by type or individually for tracking or sorting purposes. In simple terms this means an asset that will be sent outside the company that contains, protects or transports physical items and will be used for multiple trips. The GRAI identifies the asset being used for the purpose of tracking its location and return. It can be used for tracking purposes only or as part of a hiring or rental system where companies collaborate on the use of these assets. The GRAI is an identification key that can be used globally {{to identify}} the asset. Detailed information regarding the asset will be recorded in a database and the GRAI is the key that provides the link to that information. It may be produced as a GS1-128 bar code, or held in a GS1 EPC tag or used in a database. It is also a United States Department of Defense-recognized Item Unique Identification (IUID) equivalent, and may be encoded in an IUID-compliant DataMatrix. [...] The function of a GRAI is to provide an identification point which can be used to retrieve information held in a database associated that particular asset. This information can show the asset type and optionally identify the particular asset uniquely if required.|$|E

Corrections were included for methodological deficiencies frequently enountered in past studies. Treatment variables were systematically monitored, and target behavior rates, levels of <b>global</b> <b>individual</b> functioning, general ward behavior, and off-ward behavior were assessed during baseline, implementation, and probe periods. Results indicated abrupt and substantial increases in performance of most target behaviors, significant improvements in <b>global</b> <b>individual</b> functioning (p less than. 025), positive changes in general ward behavior, and increases in social interaction during off-ward activities. The findings provide strong evidence for the efficacy of a token economy and indicate that the multiple-baseline design can be a useful method for evaluating token economy programs...|$|E

40|$|Gene {{expression}} is regulated in a context-dependent, cell-type specific manner. Condition-specific transcription {{is dependent on}} the presence of transcription factors (TFs) that can activate or inhibit its target genes (global context). Additional factors such as chromatin structure, histone or DNA modifications also influence the activity of individual target genes (individual context). The role of the <b>global</b> and <b>individual</b> context for post-transcriptional regulation has not systematically been investigated on a large-scale and is poorly understood. Here we show that <b>global</b> and <b>individual</b> context-dependency is a pervasive feature of microRNA-mediated regulation. Our comprehensive and highly consistent dataset from several high-throughput technologies (PAR-CLIP, RIP-Chip, 4 sU-tagging and SILAC) provides strong evidence that context-dependent microRNA target sites (CDTS) are as frequent and functionally relevant as constitutive target sites (CTS). Furthermore, we found the global context to be insufficient to explain the CDTS and that flanking sequence motifs provide individual context that is an equally important factor. Our results demonstrate that, similar to TF-mediated regulation, <b>global</b> and <b>individual</b> context-dependency are prevalent in microRNA-mediated gene regulation implying a much more complex post-transcriptional regulatory network than currently known. The necessary tools to unravel post-transcriptional regulations and mechanisms need to be much more involved and much more data will be needed for particular cell types and cellular conditions to understand microRNA-mediated regulation and the context-dependent post-transcriptional regulatory network...|$|R

40|$|In the {{schedule}} {{for the evaluation of}} individual quality of life (SEIQoL) the weights for five individualized quality of life domains have been derived by judgment analysis and direct weighting (DW). We studied the feasibility and validity of adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) as an alternative method to derive weights in 27 cancer patients and 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Further, we assessed the convergence between direct weights and weights derived by ACA, and their correlation with global quality-of-life scores. All respondents finished the ACA task, but one in five respondents were upset about the ACA task. Further, the task was vulnerable to judgment ‘errors’, such as inconsistent answers. The agreement between the two weights was low. Both weighted index scores were strongly correlated to the unweighted index score. The relationships between the index score and scores on a visual analogue scale for <b>global</b> <b>individual</b> quality of life and global quality of life were similar whether or not the index score was calculated with DW weights, with ACA weights, or without using weights. We conclude that, because weights did not improve the correlation between the index score and global quality of life scores, it seems sufficient to use the unweighted index score as a measure for <b>global</b> <b>individual</b> quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary African artists Yinka Shonibare, MBE and Djibril Diop Mambety {{investigate}} the intimate effects of colonial materiality at large, utilizing colonial era aesthetics {{in their work}} while circumventing its indexicality, finding instead new methods with which to discuss individual experience, the colonial, and the postcolonial. To address the psychological import of extant colonial material culture, I analyze these artists' particular negotiations of plural locales and temporalities in their respective bodies of work as methods of re-archiving the colonial tangible and built environments in terms of individual experience. Gender Studies scholarship on colonialism links psychology, in terms of power dynamics and sexuality, to nation-building, racism, and empire fatigue. This decoding of humanity's most large scale colonial projects and most intimate reactions in a grand sweep of analysis, to and fro, is a task partially taken up by Shonibare and Mambety.

40|$|Metamizole {{is an old}} {{analgesic}} agent. Its use {{is highly}} controversial due to its capacity to induce agranulocytosis, a rapid and severe fall of neutrophil granulocytes with risk of fatal outcome. Despite of this debate and {{withdrawal from the market}} in several countries, the use of metamizole increased {{in the last ten years}} in Switzerland as well as in Germany. The goal of this PhD-thesis project was therefore to improve our understanding of the clinical toxicity of metamizole. The work should contribute to a better understanding of the risk-benefit profile and promote the safe use of metamizole. In a first approach, we descriptively analyzed worldwide pharmacovigilance data concerning adverse effects related to metamizole. The main objective was to characterize spontaneously reported cases of hematological adverse drug reactions associated with metamizole as suspected drug regarding appearance, course, and severity of the reactions. The worldwide case safety reports were selected from the WHO <b>Global</b> <b>Individual</b> Case Safety Report Database (VigibaseTM), the national reports from the National Pharmacovigilance Database from Swissmedic.

40|$|Generally the {{position}} of different organs is determined by simple description following the anatomical elements surrounded them and such description could be developed and applied in surgical anatomy. Here, I present {{for the first time}} a theoretical three-dimensional ovary position in link with the global anatomical structure of each human female body. I advance the fact that ovaries are placed between two anatomical planes: a first plane of a frontal section touching at the top the internal edge of the manubrium sterni and at the bottom the convexity of the lumbar curvature of the spinal column and a second plane of a frontal section touching the two convexities of cervical and lumbar curvatures of the spinal column. Although during and after the first pregnancy ovaries become really slightly displaced they would keep the proposed three-dimensional position. The degree of accuracy of this theoretical position could be evaluated by using special combined techniques of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). If results will be positive, this finding would represent a new future view in particular fundamental anatomical studies where we will bring out the harmony between an organ position and the <b>global</b> <b>individual</b> anatomical structure...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the international linkages among local, country-specific stock market factors in order to better understand the dependence structure of increasingly integrated world financial markets. The seeming discordance between Fama and French (1998) and Griffin (2002) regarding the multi-factor model in the international stock markets motivates us to study the international relationship among local factors. With the individual stock data from the six major developed countries in the international stock market, we compose daily returns to the Fama-French three factors (i. e. market, size, and value) and the momentum factor over the period from January 2000 to June 2010. We investigate the international linkages among local stock market factors, focusing on their equilibrium relationship in the integrated world financial market. The cointegration analysis indicates that local factor indices, constructed from the cumulative factor returns, are cointegrated for each of the four factor classes. Thus, we conclude that local factors are globally bound to each other through a long-run equilibrium relationship and that although stock market factors may be local, rather than <b>global,</b> <b>individual</b> stock returns are driven by common global stochastic trends. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{framework}} for allocation {{of a global}} carbon reduction target among nations, in which the concept of “common but differentiated responsibilities ” refers to the emissions of individuals instead of nations. We use the income distribution of a country to estimate how its CO 2 emissions are distributed among its citizens, from which we build up a global CO 2 distribution. We then propose a simple rule to derive a universal cap on <b>global</b> <b>individual</b> emissions and find corresponding limits on national aggregate emissions from this cap. All of the world’s high-CO 2 -emitting individuals are treated the same, regardless of where they live. Any future global emissions goal (target and timeframe) can be converted into national reduction targets, which are determined by “Business as Usual ” projections of national carbon emissions and in-country income distributions. Reducing projected global emissions in 2030 by 13 GtCO 2, for example, would require the engagement of 1. 13 billion high emitters, roughly equally distributed in four regions: the U. S., the OECD minus the U. S. China, and the non-OECD minus China. We also modify our methodology to place a floor on emissions of the world’s lowest CO 2 emitters and demonstrate that climate mitigation and poverty alleviation are largely decoupled...|$|E

Psychomotricity, as a science that studies man in his totality, through the relationships that establishes with himself and the other ones, constitutes a pedagogic tool for the prevention and treatment of learning disabilities. Nowadays, psychomotor education works with <b>global</b> <b>individual,</b> in the motor, cognitive and affective plans, instead of emphasizing the areas with deficits in the development: the mechanical exercises were substituted by free or semi-directed activities, with expression of the creative potential of the student.
