Fecundity parameters (brood size, brood number, total number of young per reproductive female, and net reproduction rate) were highest at an optimal midrange temperature (15 °C).

A low <b>food</b> <b>level</b> reduced the effect of tem-perature on some growth and fitness parameters from those at a high <b>food</b> <b>level,</b> but T was still greater at the higher temperatures.

50|$|Siblicide is a {{consequence}} of sibling rivalry, and its occurrence may be due to a variety of factors, such as food shortages and limited parental care. Killing a sibling could be advantageous for an animal because it monopolizes more resources through the elimination of a competitor. Moreover, there are different types of siblicide. For example, obligate siblicide is the unconditional killing of a sibling. In species of birds that exhibit this behavior, the larger chick commits the act of siblicide. On the other hand, facultative siblicide refers to situations in which the death of a sibling does not always occur, but is usually motivated by environmental factors such as limited resources. Facultative siblicide is exhibited by the previously discussed case of the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). In this species, senior chicks may sometimes eliminate siblings when there are food shortages. During these shortages, chicks exhibit higher levels of pecking, but this aggression decreases when <b>food</b> <b>levels</b> are brought back to sufficient levels.In some species, parents have evolved behaviors to take advantage of siblicide to increase their own fitness. For example, the laughing gull exhibits asynchronous hatching patterns in order to cut parental losses. In this species, birds that lay their eggs at different times produce, on average, a larger number of fledglings per nest in comparison to birds with synchronous hatches. Staggered hatching creates chicks in different stages of growth. Older, and thus larger, chicks kill their younger siblings, reducing brood size and allowing the parent to concentrate efforts when food is scarce. Once the brood is reduced, sibling rivalry decreases because there are less competitors, benefitting the surviving offspring. This also benefits the parents by minimizing unproductive parental investment in offspring that are unlikely to be successful. This is especially advantageous during food shortages when parents are unable to adequately feed all offspring.|$|E

In this study, we examined the separate and combined effects of food availability and density on the agonistic behavior and life history of larval long-toed salamanders, Ambystoma macrodactylum. We designed a 2 × 2 factorial experiment in which larvae were raised with either a high or low density of conspecifics and fed either a high or low <b>level</b> of <b>food.</b> For each treatment, we quantified the amount of group size variation, biting, and cannibalism occurring.

Moreover, differences in <b>food</b> <b>level</b> at which larvae were reared re-sulted in higher within-group size variation and height-ened intraspecific biting while both density and <b>food</b> <b>level</b> contributed to increased cannibalism. We suggest that increased hunger levels and an uneven size struc-ture promoted biting among larvae in the low food treat-ments.

Litter performance was not influenced by the straw treatment. HN sows had the highest concentration of basal cortisol, but no treatment effects were found in increase of salivary cortisol concentrations in response to the ACTH challenge in second parity sows. It is concluded that provision of straw may buffer the adverse effects of a low <b>food</b> <b>level</b> on weight and back fat gain in group-housed pregnant sows, but has no effect on reproductive performance.

Over {{the next few days}} the river flooded, destroying the bridges and leaving Caesar stranded without food {{on the opposite side of}} the river from Afranius, who had a large stockpile of food and supplies. Afranius found out that a large supply convoy was approaching Caesar from Gaul. he set out to attack and capture it. Though he failed to capture it, he did force the convoy to retreat. Afranius and Petreius sent dispatches to Rome claiming victory, and announcing that the war was all but over. Despite this, Caesar constructed boats and transported a part of his cavalry force over to Afranius' side of the river. The cavalry set about harassing Afranius' supply lines, even annihilating a unit of republican reinforcements. Caesar constructed a bridge and began to harass Afranius' forces with his whole army. At the same time, several Iberian rulers pledged their support to Caesar's cause. Over the next weeks, Afranius attempted unsuccessfully to deal with the Caesarian harassment. Several siegeworks were begun by both Caesarian and republican troops. During this time, the adversaries were so close that they could talk amongst each other. The republican troops were convinced to surrender, with even Afranius' own son attempting to negotiate a surrender. Soon after this, several Caesarian troops were found to have wandered into the republican camp. Afranius and Petreius ordered their execution. At the same time, several republican troops had been seen wandering about in Caesar's camp. Caesar ordered these men treated with respect and sent back to Afranius.

The first discrepancy between data and theory could be explained by the existence of a maximum offspring size, combined with the difficulty of Daphnia to produce one egg less than was done in reality. The dependence of offspring size on maternal size could be explained by the higher likelihood of intraspecific competition when large (=old) females are present, and hence higher starvation risks for the offspring.

We measured metabolic rates and RNA/DNA ratios (an indicator of biosynthesis) concurrently in fed and unfed individuals of copepodite stages CII-CIII and CV subjected to two different pH levels representative of present day and the "business as usual" IPCC scenario (RCP 8. 5) prediction for the year 2100. The copepods responded more strongly to changes in <b>food</b> <b>level</b> than to decreasing pH, both with respect to metabolic rate and RNA/DNA ratio.

This interaction was absent for RNA/DNA, so the increase in metabolic rates were clearly not a reaction to changing biosynthesis at low pH per se but rather a reaction to increased metabolic costs per unit of biosynthesis. Interestingly, we did not observe this difference in costs of growth in stage CV. A 2. 5 times increase in metabolic costs of growth will leave the copepodites with much less energy for growth.

Population-level shifts in the PMRN are often interpreted to indicate genetic as opposed to phenotypic changes in maturation in fish.

Two-way {{analysis of variance}} revealed significant main effects (i. e., species, <b>food</b> <b>level)</b> for all life history features examined, as well as significant species x <b>food</b> <b>level</b> interactions for several life history characters (e. g., age at first reproduction and intrinsic rate of increase, r). Nested analysis of variance revealed significant species level effects for all life history characters examined, as well as significant clone level effects for all characters except r. Overall, species level effects explained approximately twice {{the proportion of the}} total variance for individual traits when compared with clone level effects (means of 32. 8 and 15. 8 %, respectively). Significant interspecific differences in breadth of response (i. e., niche breadth) were observed for estimates of r. D. galeata exhibited a significantly greater niche breadth across food treatments than D. hyalina; D. galeata x hyalina showed an intermediate response breadth, which was not significantly different from either parental species. The existence of considerable intraspecific (i. e., clonal) variation in several life history traits, implies that any interpretation of life history variation among members of hybrid species complexes may depend critically on the genetic (clonal) make-up of the populations examined. These results are discussed in reference to the coexistence of these taxa in nature...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{combined}} effect of fish kairomones and food {{conditions on the}} relative tail spine length (RTL) of five Daphnia taxa, and the interaction of these factors with the vertical distribution of the daphnids. The experiment was done in two large-scale indoor containers, the so-called plankton towers in Plön, Germany. We conducted a competition experiment in which <b>food</b> <b>level</b> {{and the presence of}} fish chemicals and later fish were varied. A strong response of RTL to fish kairomones (e. g., longer tail spines), significant differences in RTL between species, but no differences in RTL with water depth were found. Further, we observed that these Daphnia taxa produced a higher RTL only under high food conditions. This suggests that there is a cost related to the production of longer tail spines. In a preliminary study in lake Plußsee, we found that Daphnia had longer average RTL than in the towers. Further, we noted significant differences in RTL between the two sampling dates, which may be related to a lower <b>food</b> <b>level.</b> We also detected a strong inverse correlation between RTL and depth. We discuss the implications of these findings for the co-existence of co-occurring Daphnia species and their hybrid...|$|R
