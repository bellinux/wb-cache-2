2500|$|Cumin is {{sometimes}} confused with caraway (Carum carvi), another umbelliferous spice. Cumin, though, is hotter to the taste, lighter in color, and larger. Many European languages do not distinguish clearly between the two. Many Slavic and Uralic languages refer to cumin as [...] "Roman caraway". Examples include [...] – caraway, římský kmín – cumin; [...] – caraway, kmin rzymski – cumin; [...] – caraway, kumin – cumin; [...] – caraway, római kömény – cumin. [...] – caraway, roomankumina – cumin, although sometimes also called juustokumina, cheese caraway. In Norwegian, caraway is called both karve and kummin while cumin is spisskummen, from German Speis(e) meaning [...] "food". Similarly in Swedish and Danish, caraway is kummin/kommen, while cumin is spiskummin/spidskommen. In German, <b>Kümmel</b> stands for caraway and Kreuzkümmel denotes cumin.

40|$|In the {{literature}} {{it is argued}} that the relationship between parliament and government has changed due to increased polarization and party competition. In the Netherlands this change occurred from the mid- 1960 s onwards (Bovend’Eert and <b>Kummeling,</b> 2010; Andeweg, 1995). Party lines have become the main lines of political conflict, thus making the main form of executive-legislative interaction along party lines. According to scholars, commentators and the parliament itself, this has led to changed patterns of legislative oversight. This paper has two explicit goals: it offers a behavioral operationalization of King’s (1976) executive-legislative (party) modes and tests the hypothesis that executive-legislative relations have changed in the Netherlands. Contrary to the expectations, based on quantitative analysis of written questions in the period 1960 - 2011, no support is found for the hypothesis that the interparty modes have increased in this period in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Distribution of extrahepatic {{congenital}} portosystemic shunt morphology in predisposed dog breeds Lindsay van den Bossche, Frank G van Steenbeek, Robert P Favier, Anne <b>Kummeling,</b> Peter A J Leegwater and Jan Rothuizen For all author emails, please log on. BMC Veterinary Research 2012, 8 : 112 doi: 10. 1186 / 1746 - 6148 - 8 - 112 Published: 11 July 2012 Abstract (provisional) Background An inherited {{basis for}} congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (EHPSS) {{has been demonstrated}} in several small dog breeds. If in general both portocaval and porto-azygous shunts occur in breeds predisposed to portosystemic shunts then this could indicate a common genetic background. This study was performed to determine the distribution of extrahepatic portocaval and porto-azygous shunts in purebred dog populations. Results Data of 135 client owned dogs diagnosed with EHPSS at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University from 2001 ? 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. The correlation between shunt localization, sex, age, dog size and breed were studied. The study group consisted of 54 males and 81 females from 24 breeds. Twenty-five percent of dogs had porto-azygous shunts and 75 % had portocaval shunts. Of the dogs with porto-azygous shunts only 27 % was male (P?=? 0. 006). No significant sex difference was detected in dogs with a portocaval shunt. Both phenotypes were present in almost all breeds represented with more than six cases. Small dogs are mostly diagnosed with portocaval shunts (79 %) whereas both types are detected. The age at diagnosis in dogs with porto-azygous shunts {{was significantly higher than}} that of dogs with portocaval shunts (P...|$|R

60|$|Monday, 15th.--At {{the same}} hour we {{returned}} to the same maniap'. <b>Kümmel</b> (of all drinks) was served in tumblers; in the midst sat the crown prince, a fatted youth, surrounded by fresh bottles and busily plying the corkscrew; and king, chief, and commons showed the loose mouth, the uncertain joints, and the blurred and animated eye of the early drinker. It was plain we were impatiently expected; the king retired with alacrity to dress, the guards were despatched after their uniforms; and we were left to await the issue of these preparations with a shedful of tipsy natives. The orgie had proceeded further than on Sunday. The day promised to be of great heat; it was already sultry, the courtiers were already fuddled; and still the <b>kümmel</b> continued to go round, and the crown prince to play butler. Flemish freedom followed upon Flemish excess; and a funny dog, a handsome fellow, gaily dressed, and with a full turban of frizzed hair, delighted the company with a humorous courtship of a lady in a manner not to be described. It was our diversion, in this time of waiting, to observe the gathering of the guards. They have European arms, European uniforms, and (to their sorrow) European shoes. We saw one warrior (like Mars) in the article of being armed; two men and a stalwart woman were scarce strong enough to boot him; and after a single appearance on parade the army is crippled for a week.|$|E

There was never a more lively deputation. The whalerman was gapingly, tearfully tipsy; the courtier walked on air; the king himself was even sportive. Seated in {{a chair in the}} Ricks' sitting-room, he bore the brunt of our prayers and menaces unmoved. He was even rated, plied with historic instances, threatened with the men-of-war, ordered to restore the tapu on the spot--and nothing in the least affected him. It should be done to-morrow, he said; to-day it was beyond his power, to-day he durst not. [...] "Is that royal?" [...] cried indignant Mr. Rick. No, it was not royal; had the king been of a royal character we should ourselves have held a different language; and royal or not, he had the best of the dispute. The terms indeed were hardly equal; for the king was the only man who could restore the tapu, but the Ricks were not the only people who sold drink. He had but to hold his ground on the first question, and they were sure to weaken on the second. A little struggle they still made for the fashion's sake; and then one exceedingly tipsy deputation departed, greatly rejoicing, a case of brandy wheeling beside them in a barrow. The Rarotongan (whom I had never seen before) wrung me by the hand like a man bound on a far voyage. [...] "My dear frien'!" [...] he cried, [...] "good-bye, my dear frien'!"--tears of <b>kümmel</b> standing in his eyes; the king lurched as he went, the courtier ambled--a strange party of intoxicated children to be entrusted with that barrowful of madness.|$|E

60|$|Numbers {{of bottles}} were ranged {{down the middle}} of the tables, which were of bare wood without cloth. These contained, as Petroff told him, wines from various parts of Russia.

Besides these were tankards of Iablochin Kavas, or cider; Grushevoi Kavas, or perry; Malovinoi, a drink prepared from raspberries; and Lompopo, a favourite drink on the shores of the Baltic. The conversation naturally turned on student topics, of tricks played on professors, on past festivities, amusements, and quarrels. No allusion of any kind was made to politics, or to the matters of the day. Jovial songs were sung, the whole joining in chorus with great animation. At nine o'clock waiters appeared with trays containing the indispensable beginning of all Russian feasts. Each tray contained a large number of small dishes with fresh caviar, raw herrings, smoked salmon, dried sturgeon, slices of German sausage, smoked goose, ham, radishes, cheese, and butter.
