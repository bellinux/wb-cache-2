For example, the application of ammonium sulfate may increase the availability of some heavy metals in soils by lowering soil pH (Murányi et al. 1994). The effects of fertilization on soils are more obvious in a long-term fertilizer experiment field. Malhi et al. (1998) continuously applied ammonium nitrate at different rates for 27  years and determined the chemical properties of the soils (thin Black Chernozem, Typic Boroll). They found that ammonium nitrate application reduced soil pH, increased KCl-extractable aluminum (Al) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extractable iron (Fe), and affected the concentration of DTPA-extractable manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn).

When occurring in mixtures, these contaminants can have either antagonistic, neutral or synergistic effects; but little is known on their joint effects. We assessed the interaction effects of a mixture of assimilable and toxic contaminants on stream biofilms in a manipulative experiment using artificial streams, and following a factorial design <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels (low, medium or high) and either {{presence or absence of}} a mixture of emerging contaminants (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diclofenac, methylparaben, and sulfamethoxazole). We measured biofilm biomass, basal fluorescence, gross primary production and community respiration. Our initial hypotheses were that biofilm biomass and activity would: increase with medium nutrient concentrations (subsidy effect), but decrease with high nutrient concentrations (stress effect) (i); decrease with emerging contaminants, with the minimum decrease at medium nutrient concentrations (antagonistic interaction between nutrients subsidy and stress by emerging contaminants) and the maximum decrease at high nutrient concentrations (synergistic interaction between nutrients and emerging contaminants stress) (ii). All the measured variables responded linearly to the available nutrients, with no toxic effect at high nutrient concentrations. Emerging contaminants only caused weak toxic effects in some of the measured variables, and only after 3 – 4 weeks of exposure. Therefore, only antagonistic interactions were observed between nutrients and emerging contaminants, as medium and high nutrient concentrations partly compensated the harmful effects of emerging contaminants during the first weeks of the experiment. Our results show that contaminants with a subsidy effect can alleviate the effects of toxic contaminants, and that long-term experiments are required to detect stress effects of emerging contaminants at environmentally relevant concentrations...|$|R

We tested the interaction of temperature and nutrient status on the fitness of Eccritotarsus catarinensis, a biocontrol agent against the invasive aquatic weed, water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes. Several life history traits were evaluated on plants grown at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 °C) combined <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels: oligotrophic (low), mesotrophic (medium), and eutrophic (high). When the two factors are separated, all fitness traits decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing water nutrient levels. The combination of high temperature and low water nutrient status had a greater and significant negative effect on some fitness traits: lifetime fecundity, realized fecundity and nymphal survival. The relationship between insect fitness traits and water nutrient status followed different patterns depending on temperature: a monotonic, but non-linear response at 20 °C, where fitness was highest at medium water nutrient status and reduced at low and high water nutrient status; and a linear monotonic response at 25 °C, where fitness increased with increasing water nutrient status. At 30 °C fitness traits were equal on plants grown in water with high and medium nutrient status and lower on those grown in water with low nutrient status.

The 8 -week experiment {{was performed in}} mesocosms and simulated the conditions of an open-field phyto-treatment system located in a Mediterranean drained peatland (Tuscany, Italy). Peat was collected on the site, {{and one of the}} solutions mimicked drainage water flowing into it. Three hypotheses were tested: (i) the species chosen efficiently removed nutrients from both the solution and the substrate; (ii) peat contributed to the nutrient load; and (iii) the species chosen were suitable in the open-field system. Both species adapted well to the experimental conditions and demonstrated considerable ability to remove nutrients. P. vaginatum took up nitrogen more efficiently, mainly in conditions of high nutrient availability. We observed supplementary nutrient uptake by plants in the peat treatment.

40|$|Abstract. In {{multienvironment}} trials, {{the local}} spatial tendency within trials and the residual heterogeneity between trials can be jointly modeled {{in the context}} of mixed linear models. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the suitability of spatial models within trials and the residual heterogeneity between trials for multienvironment fertilizer trials. The research used field trials data of rice fertilization in Karawang and Kebumen region. Fertilizer treatments consist of fourteen levels of <b>fertilizer</b> type <b>with</b> <b>three</b> replications. In Kebumen region the research was conducted over two growing seasons. The experiment used a randomized complete block design. The results show that for single experiment the best model for Karawang and Kebumen 1 location was RCBCE power isotropic model, whilst for Kebumen 2 location was RCBCE power anisotropic model. In combined experiments the best model was CE power anisotropic model with heterogeneous residual variance across locations. Modeling of the local spatial tendencies using an analysis of variance including heterogeneous residual variances increased the ability to identify differences among treatments. Key-Words: randomized complete block design, multienvironment trials, local spatial, residual heterogeneity. 1...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{ecosystems}} {{are threatened by}} multiple anthropogenic stressors, which might be differentiated into two types: those that reduce biological activity at all concentrations (toxic contaminants), and those that subsidize biological activity at low concentrations and reduce it at high concentrations (assimilable contaminants). When occurring in mixtures, these contaminants can have either antagonistic, neutral or synergistic effects; but little is known on their joint effects. We assessed the interaction effects of a mixture of assimilable and toxic contaminants on stream biofilms in a manipulative experiment using artificial streams, and following a factorial design <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels (low, medium or high) and either {{presence or absence of}} a mixture of emerging contaminants (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diclofenac, methylparaben, and sulfamethoxazole). We measured biofilm biomass, basal fluorescence, gross primary production and community respiration. Our initial hypotheses were that biofilm biomass and activity would: increase with medium nutrient concentrations (subsidy effect), but decrease with high nutrient concentrations (stress effect) (i); decrease with emerging contaminants, with the minimum decrease at medium nutrient concentrations (antagonistic interaction between nutrients subsidy and stress by emerging contaminants) and the maximum decrease at high nutrient concentrations (synergistic interaction between nutrients and emerging contaminants stress) (ii). All the measured variables responded linearly to the available nutrients, with no toxic effect at high nutrient concentrations. Emerging contaminants only caused weak toxic effects in some of the measured variables, and only after 3 - 4 weeks of exposure. Therefore, only antagonistic interactions were observed between nutrients and emerging contaminants, as medium and high nutrient concentrations partly compensated the harmful effects of emerging contaminants during the first weeks of the experiment. Our results show that contaminants with a subsidy effect can alleviate the effects of toxic contaminants, and that long-term experiments are required to detect stress effects of emerging contaminants at environmentally relevant concentrationsThis research was supported by the European Community's 7 th Framework Programme (GLOBAQUA; 603629 -ENV- 2013 - 6. 2. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work was to {{determine}} whether grafting could improve salinity tolerance of cucumber using two different salt stressors such as NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 with equimolar concentrations, and to study the changes induced by the rootstock in the shoot growth at agronomical and physiological levels. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to determine yield, growth, fruit quality, leaf gas exchange, electrolyte leakage, SPAD, and mineral composition and assimilate partitioning of cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L. cv. ???Akito???), either ungrafted or grafted onto the commercial rootstock ???PS 1313 ??? (Cucurbita maxima Duch. × Cucurbita moschata Duch.) and cultured in quartziferous sand. Plants were supplied <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>nutrient</b> solutions: non-salt control, 27 mM Na 2 SO 4, or 40 mM NaCl. Significant depression of yield, shoot and root biomass production in response to an increase of salinity concentration in the nutrient solution was observed with more detrimental effects with NaCl treatment. The two salt treatments, especially NaCl, inhibited photosynthesis, pigment synthesis, and membrane integrity. Salinity with NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 improved fruit quality in both grafting combinations by increasing fruit dry matter and total soluble solids content. Moreover, at the two salt treatments the percentage of yield and biomass reduction in comparison to control was significantly lower in the plants grafted onto ???PS 1313 ??? than ungrafted plants, with the highest yield, shoot and root reduction recorded with NaCl in comparison to those recorded with Na 2 SO 4 treatment. Grafted cucumber plants exposed to Na 2 SO 4 were capable of maintaining higher net assimilation rates, higher chlorophyll content (SPAD index), a better nutritional status (higher K, Ca and Mg and lower Na) in the shoot tissues and higher membrane selectivity in comparison with ungrafted ones. The higher crop performance of grafted cucumber recorded with Na 2 SO 4 than with NaCl, was attributed to the inability of the rootstock to restrict Cl??? shoot uptake, thus Cl???, which continues passing to the leaves, becomes the more significant toxic component of the saline solution...|$|R

40|$|In {{the coming}} years, farmers {{will have to}} deal with growing crops under {{suboptimal}} conditions dictated by global climate changes. The application of plant biostimulants such as beneficial microorganisms and plant-derived protein hydrolysates (PHs) may represent an interesting approach for increasing crop tolerance to alkalinity and salinity. The current research aimed at elucidating the agronomical, physiological, and biochemical effects as well as the changes in mineral composition of greenhouse lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) either untreated or treated with a microbial-based biostimulant (Tablet) containing Rhizophagus intraradices and Trichoderma atroviride alone or in combination with a PH. Plants were sprayed with PH at weekly intervals with a solution containing 2. 5 ml L(- 1) of PH. Lettuce plants were grown in sand culture and supplied <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>nutrient</b> solutions: standard, saline (25 mM NaCl) or alkaline (10 mM NaHCO 3 + 0. 5 g l(- 1) CaCO 3; pH 8. 1). Salt stress triggered a decrease in fresh yield, biomass production, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition and increased leaf proline concentration, without altering antioxidant enzyme activities. The decrease in marketable yield and biomass production under alkali stress was not significant. Irrespective of nutrient solution, the application of Tablet and especially Tablet + PH increased fresh marketable yield, shoot and root dry weight. This was associated with an improvement in SPAD index, Fv/Fm ratio, CAT and GPX activities and a better nutritional status (higher P, K, and Fe and lower Na with NaCl and higher P and Fe with NaHCO 3) via an increase of total root length and surface. The combination of microbial biostimulant with foliar application of PH synergistically increased the marketable fresh yield by 15. 5 and 46. 7 % compared to the Tablet-treated and untreated plants, respectively. The improved crop performance of Tablet + PH application was attributed to a better root system architecture (higher total root length and surface), an improved chlorophyll synthesis and an increase in proline accumulation. Combined application of Tablet and PH could represent an effective strategy to minimize alkalinity and salinity stress in a sustainable way...|$|R

It is the second {{in a series of}} methodological studies designed to predict production surfaces, isoquants, isoclines, marginal products and marginal replacement rates between nutrients when two or more nutrients are used in promoting increased crop yields. These quantities, which are fundamental in obtaining a basic science knowledge of fertilizer-crop relationships, are then used to predict optimum levels of fertilization and optimum ratios of nutrients with profit maximization as the criterion of selection. While the major objectives of the study are of a methodological nature, illustrations are included to show how the basic relationships and principles can be adapted to simple forms for farmer and educational uses.

40|$|In 1970, five low-productive {{treeless}} peatlands in Sweden, {{ranging from}} latitudes 56 °N to 67 °N, were drained and fertilized for afforestation. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine the effect of four ditch spacings, varying from 7. 5 to 60 m, and five NPK-fertilizer combinations, on the survival and growth of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and silver birch (Betula pendula) seedlings. The assessments were carried out 18 – 22 years after planting. Neither silver birch, nor Norway spruce was regarded suitable for the site type. The mortality of silver birch was almost complete, and Norway spruce did not grow well in any of the study areas, however, better than Scots pine in the north. Lodgepole pine had better height and diameter growth but also higher mortality rates than Scots pine. In the two northernmost experimental areas no response to fertilization was found. In the other three areas, the response to fertilization did not differ between species. Phosphorus was the most effective of the added fertilizer elements, whereas nitrogen showed no positive effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the general patterns of response by tree species common to Everglades Tree Islands (TI) when conditions limiting optimal growth are improved by fertilization on LILA tree islands. Experiments were conducted on constructed TI in the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA). Thirty-six trees of two species, Annona glabra and Chrysobalanus icaco, were randomly selected on each of four tree islands. Two tree islands have peat overlying limestone cores and two are composed solely of peat. Each tree was treated <b>with</b> one of <b>three</b> <b>nutrient</b> regimes: +N, +P, or Control (no addition of nutrients). A highly significant P-treatment effect on growth rate, leaf TP and leaf N:P ratio were observed in both species in comparison to Control trees. In contrast, neither of the species responded to N-fertilization. The mass N:P ratios and δ 13 C in P-treated trees exhibited a positive correlation with Relative Elevation (RE) for both species. These findings suggested that the tree growth at LILA tree islands was P-limited on both substrates (limestone and peat) ...|$|R

Separate experiments were conducted <b>with</b> the <b>three</b> <b>nutrients,</b> applying each at five different doses {{and the other}} two at the recommended doses. An equal amount of irrigation by wastewater was provided to each experiment. The spike length, spikelets per spike, grain yield and harvest index of wheat increased with the increase in N dose up to 100 kg ha− 1, but decreased with further doses. Most of the growth and yield attributes improved significantly (p = 0. 05) with the increase in P dose up to 20 kg ha− 1, beyond which the P exerted negative, but insignificant, effect on the crop attributes. The omission of N or P significantly reduced the yield attributes and yield of wheat, with the dominant effect of N. Either the omission or the higher than the recommended dose of K had no significant suppressing effect on the grain yield of wheat. The crop most effectively utilized the nutrients when supplied at the lower doses. The omission of N or P or K minimally reduced the 1000 -grain weight. The negative effects of the excess nutrient doses were the greatest for N and least for K, implying that N was the most limiting and K was the least limiting factors for wheat production. status: publishe...|$|R
