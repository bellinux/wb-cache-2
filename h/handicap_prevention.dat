40|$|Invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) infection, {{predominantly}} manifested as {{acute meningitis}} and epiglottitis, {{is a serious}} disease with associated mortality and residual <b>handicap.</b> <b>Prevention</b> of the disease is possible by vaccination against Hi serotype b (Hib). In a prospective study in a Swedish population before large scale Hib vaccination of infants was introduced, the incidence of invasive Hi infection, in children 0 - 4 years of age, was 55 / 100. 000 /year. Hib caused 98 % of the cases. In a study on laboratory reports, the incidence in Sweden was reduced by 90 % {{two years after the}} initiation of the vaccination programme. The pre vaccination incidence in adults was high; 2. 8 / 100. 000 /year and 51 % of the cases were caused by Hib. No significant impact on the incidence in children older than 4 years and adults was found by the vaccination programme during the first two years. Acute epiglottitis during the pre vaccination era was studied retrospectively, and the incidence was higher than previously reported. Blood cultures confirmed Hi as the most prevalent etiologic pathogen in children, but in adult epiglottitis, the aetiology was often unknown. Cultures from nasopharynx had a low diagnostic value. The case fatality rate of invasive Hi infection was 2. 9 % and residual sequelae were diagnosed in 5. 8 %. These cases were all caused by Hib. The most prevalent sequelae was sensorineural hearing loss after meningitis. Adults who had recovered from Hi meningitis in childhood were investigated and the prevalence of a late progression of pure tone audiometric abnormality was documented. In these cases, hearing loss was peripheral, with cochlea as the suspected site of the lesion, and subclinical vestibular pathology was over-represented. However, brain dysfunction and central auditory disturbance, unpredictable by conventional audiometry was also found. The functional capacity of Hib vaccination induced antibodies was studied with three assays. The induced serum bactericidal and opsonophagocytic activity usually correlated to the serum concentration of antibodies against the Hib capsular polysaccharide (PRP). However, the prevalence of non-functional antibodies indicates that a functional evaluation is desirable in addition to serum concentrations of antibodies in bacterial vaccine trials. A chemiluminescence (CL) -index assay proved more useful than phagocytic killing in measuring serum opsonic action, and the ELISA and CL-index showed that PRP conjugated to diphtheria toxoid was more immunogenic than PRP conjugated to outer membrane protein complex of meningococcus serogroup B. In an overlay assay of radiolabeled bacteria by thin-layer chromatography, Hi recognised three glycosphingolipid (GSL) specificities; lactosylceramide, gangliotri-/gangliotetraosylceramide and neolactotetraosylceramide. Target tissues for Hi were investigated for relevant GSLs and Hi bound to neolactotetraosylceramide of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and oropharyngeal epithelium. The epithelial expression of neolactotetraosylceramide, although as a minor compound, serve as a relevant carbohydrate receptor for Hi in the upper respiratory tract...|$|E

Since man {{normally}} {{does not}} live in an aquatic environment,he is potentially at risk each time he consumes or has bodily contact with water. Diseases such as typhoid and paratyphoid fever, amoebic dysentery, leptospirosis, and bacillary dysentery, sometimes associated with contaminated drinking water, can also be spread through contact with the contaminated water of swimming pools. In addition, the swimming pool and surrounding areas are often the source of injuries and frequently {{play a role in}} the transmission of infections of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, and in the spread of athlete's foot, impetigo, and other dermatoses. In light of these considerations, the proper construction and maintenance of public swimming pools is a public health problem of great importance. The first edition of this training manual was published in 1959. It was prepared for use by health jurisdictions in training programs designed specifically for public health workers and swimming pool c 1 perators. The intervening years have brought many changes in the concepts of swimming pool chemistry and disinfection, testing, and operation. Professor David G. Thomas of the State University of New York has assisted in updating this manual. This edition represents the latest information on design, construction, operation, maintenance, and the effect of each on disease control practices and safety procedures. It is organized specifically to serve as a training and reference guide for State and local personnel, and especially for further use in the conduct of their own in-service training programs. In addition, it is hoped that this volume will be useful in the development of training programs which will benefit operators and owners of swimming pools. Foreword [...] 1.

40|$|The Nordic welfare {{states are}} facing {{significant}} demographic challenges {{now and in}} the future. At the same time life expectancy of the citizens is increasing. Thus more senior citizens need to be cared for by still fewer young people of taxable age. This development undermines the financial sustainability of the Nordic welfare state and presents a major medium to long-term challenge for the Nordic countries, if the high welfare service levels are to be sustained in the decades to come. One of the solutions to this challenge could be the implementation of new welfare technologies and innovative solutions which can increase efficiency of service providers and deliver more value for money. The aim of the project is to increase knowledge about public-private partnerships in the five Nordic countries, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland, with a focus on the welfare sectors in these countries. Focus is on the following sectors: children and youth, elderly and <b>handicapped,</b> disease <b>prevention,</b> education, treatment and rehabilitation. The overall objective is to increase understanding of approaches, effects and perspectives in the use of public-private partnerships, in particular public-private innovation partnerships. This includes the use of public-private partnerships as a strategic tool for new business development for welfare solutions in the Nordic region...|$|R
