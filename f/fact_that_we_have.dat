25|$|It {{has been}} argued by some physicists, e.g., M. J. Duff, that {{the laws of physics}} are {{inherently}} dimensionless. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, {{there was no way to}} relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: c, ħ, and G, in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{it is not}} the {{wrecking}} of {{the ship}} that is important, but the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the Hunley, which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (Hunley also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels {{and was one of the}} few historic warships ever raised intact); the Resurgam II, the first powered submarine; and Holland 5, which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.|$|E
500|$|Scott also {{advocated}} ending kynect, but Comer advocated {{maintaining and}} reforming it and Heiner said he opposed the Affordable Care Act, but remained non-committal on {{his plans for}} kynect. Bevin {{was the first of}} the four to advocate reversing the Medicaid expansion, telling reporters [...] "No question about it. I would reverse that immediately. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> one out of four people in this state on Medicaid is unsustainable, it's unaffordable and we need to create jobs in this state, not more government programs to cover people." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{were selling}} {{ourselves}} on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the technical or organisational group {{that could do}} something, {{and we were just}} waiting for someone with enough money to do it" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{can tell}} me about the great fight. We heard of it, at Dongola, but beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> thrashed the Khalifa, and taken Omdurman, we {{received}} no particulars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our tickets fixed up {{will go to}} show what our {{intentions}} were, Si. However, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> put our feet into it, and must take what comes." ...|$|R
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E
500|$|Max Mosley, the {{president}} of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher's comments saying that his comments [...] "reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude". Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E
2500|$|... "after some {{hundreds}} of years of experience {{we think that we}} have learned here in Oxford how to teach what is known. But now with the undeniable upsurge of scientific research, we cannot continue to rely on the mere <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned how to teach what is known. We must learn to teach the best attitude to what is not yet known. This also may take centuries to acquire but we cannot escape this new challenge, nor do we want to." ...|$|E
60|$|I answered, {{giving him}} our names, and {{mentioning}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been {{the guest of}} Bulstrode, and how much we were disappointed in having missed not only our friend, but his corps.|$|R
50|$|Dallaire noted, The border was a sieve, {{riddled with}} little {{mountain}} trails {{that had been}} there for millennia. Given my tiny force of eighty-one observers and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no helicopters with night-vision capability, the task of keeping the border under surveillance was at best symbolic.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} you perfectly, sir, {{and it was}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> already met in what one might almost term a social way that emboldened me to come 'ere today and offer you my services as a hintermediary, should you feel disposed to avail yourself of them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Activists say the {{movement}} is non-violent. According to the ALF's code, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action, including acts of vandalism causing economic damage to their victims. American activist Rod Coronado said in 2006: [...] "One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being—that is, terrorists, violent criminals—is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> harmed no one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, {{the state}} celebrated its centennial of {{statehood}} (albeit one year late) {{with a great}} exposition in Nashville. The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was the ultimate expression of the Gilded Age in the Upper South—a showcase of industrial technology and exotic papier-mâché versions of the world's wonders. The Nashville Parthenon, a full-scale replica of Athens' Parthenon, was built in plaster, wood and brick. Rebuilt of concrete in the 1920s, it {{remains one of the}} city's attractions. During its six-month run at Centennial Park, the Exposition drew nearly two million visitors to see its dazzling monuments to the South's recovery. Governor Robert Taylor observed, [...] "Some of them who saw our ruined country thirty years ago will certainly appreciate the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> wrought miracles." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the world}} record attempt, Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S, said “When we {{introduced}} the Vitesse, we established the top speed for open-top driving to be 375 km/h. Still, we could not {{let go of the}} idea of reaching the 400 km/h mark with this car as well. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> succeeded in reaching 408.84 km/h is a thrill for me, and it reaffirms once again that Bugatti is the leader when it comes to technology in the international automotive industry." [...] The driver, Anthony Liu, claimed [...] "Even at such high speeds it remained incredibly comfortable and stable. With an open top, you can really experience the sound of the engine and yet even at higher speeds I did not get compromised by the wind at all.” ...|$|E
60|$|This {{last man}} had as large a store of fresh {{provisions}} {{as could be}} hauled by one mule, and within five minutes after coming up with him we were getting supper, giving no heed to anything save the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> food in plenty {{for at least one}} meal.|$|R
6000|$|Last spring I met General Miles again, and {{he commented}} on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> known each other thirty years. He said it was strange <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not met years before, when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> both been in Washington. At that point I changed the subject, and I changed it with art. But the facts are these: ...|$|R
5000|$|Gregory Bernard {{said of the}} film: [...] "We’re really {{blessed to}} have so much {{attention}} on such a small film.

2500|$|In an April 2008 article, online {{publication}} Electronic Intifada {{revealed the}} existence of a Google group set up by CAMERA. The stated purpose of the group was [...] "help us keep Israel-related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors". In follow-up e-mails to his recruits, Ini emphasized the secrecy of the campaign: [...] "There is no need to advertise the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> these group discussions," [...] he wrote. [...] "Anti-Israel editors will seize on anything to try to discredit people who attempt to challenge their problematic assertions, and will be all too happy to pretend, and announce, that a 'Zionist' cabal ... is trying to hijack Wikipedia." [...] Someone leaked four weeks' worth of communications from within Ini's organization, and the quotes weren't pretty. Describing the Wiki-campaign, a member of Ini's corps writes: [...] "We will go to war after we have built an army, [...] it, trained." [...] There is also some back-and-forth about the need to become Wikipedia administrators, to better influence the encyclopedia's articles. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5eI81uvfP?url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2008/05/03/war_of_the_virtual_wiki_worlds/ |archivedate=2009-02-02 |deadurl=no |df= }} Electronic Intifada accused CAMERA of [...] "orchestrating a secret, long-term campaign to infiltrate the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history, pass off crude propaganda as fact, and take over Wikipedia administrative structures to ensure these changes go either undetected or unchallenged". Andre Oboler, a Legacy Heritage Fellow at the Israeli non-governmental organization NGO Monitor, responded that [...] "Electronic Intifada is manufacturing a story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “There is {{an opinion}} that the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not adhered to the {{declaration}} of Paris does not exempt us from the duty of respecting the principles therein enunciated. The principle Spain unquestionably refused to admit then was the abolition of privateering.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course, the old man's opinion settled the question, and we hauled around for a run down the bay, double reefing the {{mainsail}} and jib, as was proper when you {{take into consideration the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the same as no cargo aboard to give the pungy stiffness.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} quite sure {{that they would not}} venture beyond the room in which I had {{discovered}} them, though I had not guessed at what deterred them.

5000|$|On May 5, 2017 Judge James Sarsfield {{dropped the}} rape and assault charges. Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy said [...] "Due {{to the lack of}} {{corroboration}} and substantial inconsistencies from the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> obtained from multiple sources since the filing of the original charging document, the original charges cannot be sustained and prosecution is untenable on those charges." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can," [...] I assured her. [...] "And {{there is no}} need at all for you to think about earning money yet. It is not that which {{troubles}} us at all.

6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} me," [...] said the Duchess, [...] "I don't think I could see him. Of course, Augustus, I don't wish to say {{anything}} hard of Arabella.

6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] said I. [...] "We are {{far away}} from the gorilla land now, I know; for, in {{addition}} to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen no traces of gorillas for a long time, we have, within the last few days, seen several lions, which, you are well aware, do not exist in the gorilla country." ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, if {{he should}} tell no more than he already knew, without {{attempting}} {{to add to the}} story in any way, that officer who listened to him could, and with good reason, have set it down as a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> remained in the village to act the part of spies, after which straightway every building in the village would be searched.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{tell me how}} {{it happens}} that {{you are on the}} Patuxent river taking prisoners here and there without due warrant from the {{government}} at Washington," [...] the commodore said with a smile, and I began by explaining why we started in search of the fleet, not forgetting to make mention of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> hoped to find a sale for fish or oysters.|$|R
60|$|The {{trial was}} {{conducted}} in private by the Keeper of the Seals--a lean, wizened individual, with an air as musty and dry {{as that of the}} parchments among which he had spent his days. He was supported by six judges, and on his right sat the King's Commissioner, Monsieur de Chatellerault--the bruised condition of whose countenance still advertised the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> met but yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} Matthew very well; {{he was so}} shy we boys couldn't get acquainted with him--but I quite {{agree with you that}} Captain Jim is one of the rarest and finest souls God ever clothed in clay. He is so delighted over the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> given his name to our small lad. It seems he has no other namesake." ...|$|E
6000|$|The count looked inquiringly at Frank, who {{translated}} what Julian had said.

6000|$|... "Oh, sir," [...] replied Mowbray, {{in a tone}} betwixt scorn and civility, [...] "you cannot {{suppose the}} present company is alluded to; I only presumed to mention as a <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been annoyed with {{unqualified}} people shooting on our grounds, without either liberty or license.

60|$|Then he went out, {{my father}} leaning {{heavily on his}} arm, and Jerry and I faced {{each other in the}} gloom, heeding not the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had nothing to eat during nearly eight and forty hours, save the chips of ham and the unsavory mess {{prepared}} by Jim; thinking only of what we were to do, and the many chances against success.|$|R
60|$|I {{have often}} {{wondered}} since, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had at our hand as many stones as {{could have been}} used, {{what would have been}} the result?

5000|$|When in Brazil, Sagat {{told his}} desire {{to be in a}} serious relationship.
