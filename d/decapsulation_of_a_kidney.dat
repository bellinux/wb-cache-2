40|$|Splenic cysts {{are rare}} {{entities}} and {{are classified as}} true cysts or pseudocysts based on the presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> epithelial lining. Congenital nonparasitic true cysts can be epidermoid, dermoid, or endodermoid, present at a young age, and are commonly located in the upper pole of the spleen. Surgical treatment is recommended for symptomatic, large (more than 5 [*]cm), or complicated cysts. Depending on cyst number, location, relation to hilus, and the major splenic vessels, the surgical options include aspiration, marsupialization, cystectomy, partial cystectomy (decapsulation), and partial or complete splenectomy. Laparoscopic techniques have now become the standard approach for many conditions, including the splenic cysts, with emphasis on the spleen-preserving minimally invasive operations. We present the successful extended partial laparoscopic <b>decapsulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant epidermoid splenic cyst in a young female patient that, although asymptomatic, was unfortunately followed by complete splenectomy five days later due to a misinterpreted abdominal CT suggesting splenic postoperative ischemia...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The optimal {{treatment}} {{for patients with}} nonparasitic splenic cysts is controversial. This study aimed to evalulate the clinical outcome of patients treated for a symptomatic splenic cyst, and to define a surgical strategy. METHODS: Spleen-preserving surgery (9 laparotomies and 6 laparoscopies) was performed for a primary cyst in six patients and a secondary cyst in nine patients. The median follow-up time was 37. 5 months. Partial splenic resection was performed for eight patients and cyst decapsulation for seven patients. RESULTS: Cyst recurrence was observed in four patients after <b>decapsulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primary splenic cyst, as compared with none after resection. Postoperative complications were encountered only after laparotomy (5 / 9). The median hospital stay was 3. 5 days (range, 2 - 5 days) after laparoscopy, as compared with 9 days (range, 5 - 14 days) after laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic splenic cysts should be treated laparoscopically. For patients with recurrent or suspected primary splenic cysts, laparoscopic partial splenectomy is preferable. For other cases, a laparoscopic decapsulation is advocated. status: publishe...|$|R
