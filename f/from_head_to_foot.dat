Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance {{took the form of}} flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E

25|$|In Indian religion, late Vedic rituals {{developed}} {{involving the}} anointing of government officials, worshippers, and idols. These are {{now known as}} abhisheka. The practice spread to Indian Buddhists. In modern Hinduism and Jainism, anointment is common, although the practice typically employs water or yoghurt, milk, or (particularly) butter from the holy cow, rather than oil. Many devotees are anointed {{as an act of}} consecration or blessing at every stage of life, with rituals accompanying birthing, educational enrollments, religious initiations, and death. New buildings, houses, and ritual instruments are anointed, and some idols are anointed daily. Particular care is taken in such rituals to the direction of the smearing. People are anointed <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot,</b> downwards. The water may derive from one of the holy rivers or be scented with saffron, turmeric, or flower infusions; the waste water produced when cleaning certain idols or when writing certain verses of scripture may also be used. Ointments may include ashes, clay, powdered sandalwood, or herbal pastes.|$|E

500|$|The {{appearance}} of Molyneux's globes {{had a significant}} influence on the culture of his time. In Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the protagonists, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: [...] "No longer <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her."

The fair-skinned figures, two males and one female, are covered <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> in light-brown body hair. Scholars generally agree that these hirsute figures represent wild or primeval humanity but disagree on the symbolism of their inclusion. Art historian Patrik Reuterswärd, for example, posits that they may be seen as [...] "the noble savage" [...] who represents [...] "an imagined alternative to our civilized life", imbuing the panel with [...] "a more clear-cut primitivistic note". Writer Peter Glum, in contrast, sees the figures as intrinsically connected with whoredom and lust.|$|E

Victoria wrote, [...] "the two Indian ladies... who are, I believe, the first Mohammedan purdah ladies who ever came over... keep their custom of complete seclusion and of being entirely covered when they go out, except for the holes for their eyes." [...] As a woman, Victoria saw them without veils. The Munshi {{and his family were}} housed in cottages at Windsor, Balmoral and Osborne, the Queen's retreat on the Isle of Wight. Victoria visited regularly, usually bringing her female guests, including the Empress of Russia and the Princess of Wales, to meet the Munshi's female relatives.

500|$|The Beatles {{played at}} the opening of the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959, which was in the cellar of Mona Best's house. Aspinall later rented a room in the house and became very good friends with then-Beatle Pete Best. The Beatles had {{previously}} used public transport to get to local gigs, but by February 1961, they were playing two or three concerts per night at different locations and needed someone to drive them. Best asked Aspinall to be a part-time road manager for the band, so Aspinall bought an [...] "old, grey and maroon Commer van" [...] for £80, and charged each of the group five shillings (25p) per concert. Harrison later said: [...] "Our early van became the centre of attention every time it pulled up. It was brush-painted red and grey and <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> was covered in graffiti – girls' names, and things like 'I love you, John'. It looked interesting, but the moment anybody saw it they would feel free to write all over it.” The Beatles returned from their second trip to Hamburg in July 1961, and Aspinall left his job to become their permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant.|$|E
500|$|Elliott was {{admitted}} to the 1st Australian General Hospital in Heliopolis on 7 May 1915, was discharged on 26 May, and rejoined the 7th Battalion at Anzac on 5 June. On 8 July he was in his headquarters behind Steele's Post when he received word that the Turks were in an Australian tunnel near the German Officers' Trench. Characteristically, he went forward in person to ascertain the situation, entering the tunnel with two men. Some [...] from the end there was a flash in his face, and the man behind him was shot. Elliott drew his pistol and barricaded the tunnel with sand bags, refusing help for fear that anyone else coming forward might also be hit. The tunnel was blocked off, and sealed with an explosion. On 8 August 1915, the 7th Battalion moved into positions captured the previous day in the Battle of Lone Pine, and he took over responsibility for the defence of the entire position. He led his men from the front trenches, steadying them in an uncertain situation. They fought off a series of Turkish counterattacks, winning four Victoria Crosses in the process. In the fighting, a man next to him was shot dead, splashing him <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> with blood and brains, but he was not decorated for the battle despite inspirational leadership. Apparently his name, originally {{at the top of the}} recommendations for decorations, had been struck off the list. On 28 August, Elliott was evacuated to England towards the end of August with pleurisy, and [...] did not rejoin the 7th Battalion until 7 November. On 18 December, one day before the evacuation of Anzac, he sprained his ankle and was evacuated ahead of his troops. He was mentioned in despatches on 28 January 1916.|$|E

2500|$|She {{is known}} for the Wandesford House, a charity. Wandesford had never married, and in her will dated November 4, 1725, left funds for the {{creation}} of a [...] "religious house of Protestant retirement" [...] in York for ten poor unmarried woman, thereby creating a religious community for single women. It was the norm during the time, though not a law, that siblings inherited. However, as a single woman, Wandesford exercised her freedom in her will. It was also notable because of the lack of religious vocationals available, especially for Anglican women, a circumstance she tried to change by her own means through her will. She bequeathed sizeable properties in Brompton on Swale, with a mortgage worth up to £1,200 and an additional £1,200 in South Sea Company Stocks and annuities, profits of which were not only used for the endowment of the institution, but also to pay for a schoolmaster to teach poor children at Kirklington. It was also her wish that at her funeral, [...] "six of the poorest unmarried women in Kirklington may have white vales <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> prepared for them and white gloves, and carry [...] corps into the church...Let the white vales be such cloth as will do them service hereafter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coal mining {{quickly became}} the most {{important}} industry in the Cumberland area. Some of the richest beds of soft, bituminous coal in the country lay within the hills and mountains of this region. After the Civil War, coal became one of Maryland's chief products and exports. Coal from the Cumberland area fueled the state's mills and plants, steamships in Baltimore's harbor {{as well as the}} US Navy fleet, and was traded to buyers from London, Brazil, Egypt, and beyond. Primarily Scotch and Welsh immigrants provided the labor force for these mines, immigrating with their families for the opportunities America offered. In the Cumberland region, miners escaped the indebtedness to the mining company that plagued miners in surrounding states. The company store system, in which miners were forced to purchase all their supplies and household needs from the mining company, was outlawed in Maryland in 1868. A comparatively high proportion of miners were also homeowners, as local mining firms found it more profitable to sell houses to their miners, than establish [...] "company" [...] housing. Cumberland's coal mines were constructed with horizontal shafts, far less dangerous that the vertical mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Still, Cumberland's miners blackened <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> when they emerged from a mine {{at the end of a}} day knew that the carbon-filled air, which corroded the lungs overtime, would lead to an early death.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reasons for}} {{starting}} the Split S manoeuvre from the inverted position include {{the fact that}} people tolerate acceleration ("g-force") applied <b>from</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>feet</b> several times better than the reverse direction, as much as 9g versus 3g.
