We combined the rhinomanometry measurements of 11 patients and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in 3 nasal airway models to dissect the complex mechanisms that determine nasal flow obstruction: spatial complexity and pressure-dependent deformability of nasal airways.

A laboratory setup with a cyclic flow of water was used. The flow cross section was divided into ten equal sections with nine verticals in between. Pitot static tube was used to measure static and stagnation pressure heads at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 point on the verticals. These measurements were conducted at a depth corresponding to 0. 1 h, 0. 2 h, 0. 4 h, 0. 6 h 0. 8 h and 0. 9 h from the free surface of the water in the canal. The different between stagnation head and static head was used to compute the local instantaneous velocity at each measured point. Three different discharges ware used 3. 5, 9. 5, and 11. 4 l/s. The results of the study reaffirms the non equal to unity of energy and momentum correction factors and that for regular canal the value of α range from 1. 10 to 1. 20 and β from 1. 03 to 1. 07.

The work adopts an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach which ensures that individual particle behaviour is accounted for by solving the particle equation of motion for each individual particle in a four-way coupled system. The hard-sphere collision model is used to detect particle-particle interactions and, on detection of a collision, particle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy,</b> restitution <b>coefficient</b> and the van der Waals interactions. Particle collision and agglomeration are considered in a shear Reynolds number 300 flow of water containing spherical particles of 75 and 250 μm diameter at a volume fraction of O(10 - 3). For the particle sizes considered, {{the overall number of}} collisions and agglomerations increases with time, although not all collisions result in agglomeration. The rate of collision and agglomeration is considerably higher for the lower particle size, leading to the formation of much larger agglomerates. Particle deposition due to gravitational effects leads to a distribution of collisions and agglomerates over the channel height, with larger values towards the lower regions of the flow. This is more pronounced for the larger particles, with their increased migration into regions near the lower wall with high levels of turbulence leading to collision and agglomeration numbers comparable for the two particle sizes...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent flows, {{noted for}} their chaotic dynamic and {{multiscale}} nature, are notoriously difficult and expensive to simulate accurately for problems of engineering interest. Adaptive wavelet-based methods have shown promise {{to this end}} with their ability to efficiently resolve local, coherent structures with a priori accuracy control. Here the methods are extended to the compressible regime, where thermodynamic and variable density effects interact with the turbulent flow. The adaptive wavelet collocation method (AWCM) exploits spatio-temporal intermittency in turbulent flows through multiresolution analysis. The highest fidelity approaches, wavelet-based direct numeric simulation and coherent vortex simulation, capture all scales of the energy cascade. The so called stochastic-coherent adaptive large eddy simulation (SCALES) method, however, requires {{the implementation of a}} subgrid-scale (SGS) model. A compressible <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> equation-based approach and a minimum dissipation model are adapted to the SCALES framework.

The vibronic band structure of the singlet-triplet n -* n* transition were attributed to the strong coupling of the methyl torsion and aldehydic hydrogen wagging modes. The vibronic peaks have been assigned in terms of two upper electronic state (T^) vibrations; the methyl torsion mode v^g, and the aldehydic hydrogen wagging mode v^^. The electronic origin O^a^ is unequivocally assigned as follows: CH 3 CHS (16294. 9 cm""), CH 3 CDS (16360. 9 cm""), CD 3 CHS (16299. 7 cm"^), and CD 3 CDS (16367. 2 cm""). To obtain structural and dynamical information about the two electronic states, potential surfaces V(e,a) for the 6 (methyl torsion) and a (hydrogen wagging) motions were generated by ab initio quantum mechanical calculations with a 6 - 3 IG* basis in which the structural parameters were fully relaxed. The <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>coefficients</b> BQ(a,e), B^(a,G), and the cross coupling term B^(a,e), were accurately represented as functions of the two active coordinates, a and 9.

The conformation of the upper T^ electronic state was found to be staggered (a= 24. 68 °,e=- 45. 66 °). The saddle point in the path traced out by the aldehyde wagging motion was calculated to be 175 cm"^ above the equilibrium configuration. The corresponding maxima in the path taken by methyl torsion was found to be 322 cm' The small amplitude normal vibrational modes were also calculated to aid in the assignment of the spectra. Torsional-wagging energy manifolds for the two states were derived from the Hamiltonian H(a,e) which was solved variationally using an extended two dimensional Fourier expansion as a basis set. A torsionalinversion band spectrum was derived from the calculated energy levels and Franck-Condon factors, and was compared with the experimental supersonic-jet spectra. Most of the anomalies which were associated with the interpretation of the observed spectrum could be accounted for by the band profiles derived from ab initio SCF calculations. A model describing the jet spectra was derived by scaling the ab initio potential functions.

The algorithm to detect inter-particle collisions {{is such that}} the computational costs scale linearly {{with the number of}} particles present in the computational domain. On detection of a collision, particle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy,</b> restitution <b>coefficient</b> and the van der Waals' interactions. The performance of the technique developed is tested by performing parametric studies of the influence the restitution coefficient (e_n = 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8), particle size (d_p = 60, 120, 200 and 316 μm), fluid inertia (Re_τ = 150, 300 and 590) and particle concentration (α_p = 5. 0 × 10 ^- 4, 1. 0 × 10 ^- 3 and 5. 0 × 10 ^- 3) have on particle-particle interaction events (collision and agglomeration). The results demonstrate that the collision frequency shows a linear dependency on the restitution coefficient, while the agglomeration rate shows an inverse dependence. Collisions among smaller particles are more frequent and efficient in forming agglomerates than those of coarser particles. The particle-particle interaction events show a strong dependency on the shear Reynolds number Re_τ, while increasing the particle concentration effectively enhances particle collision and agglomeration. Overall, the sensitivity of the particle-particle interaction events to the selected simulation parameters is found to influence the population and distribution of the primary particles and agglomerates formed.

Baroclinicity is incorporated into the equations of motion by specifying horizontal gradients of air temperature in the atmosphere and seawater density in the ocean. Experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} different magnitudes and directions of baroclinicity and of atmospheric stratification on the dynamical and turbulent structure of the interacting boundary layers. The results of the simulations demonstrate that certain levels of baroclinicity produce double maxima in the K profiles in the atmosphere and ocean. Baroclinic effects change the dominant components of the turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> in both air and sea boundary layers from shear production and dissipation for dimensionless heights and depths of less than 0. 1 (about 20 % of the height or depth of the boundary layer at zero surface heat flux) to shear production and buoyant destruction for dimensionless heights and depths greater than 0. 1.

40|$|We {{construct}} and study several semilocal density functional approximations for the positive Kohn-Sham <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> density. These functionals fit the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> {{density of the}} Airy gas {{and they can be}} accurate for integrated <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of atoms, molecules, jellium clusters and jellium surfaces. We find that these functionals are the most accurate ones for atomization <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of molecules and for fragmentation of jellium clusters. We also report that local and semilocal <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> functionals can show "binding" when the density of a spin unrestricted Kohn-Sham calculation is used.
