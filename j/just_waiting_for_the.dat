Or even the next 'Just Dance' to really make us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression."

50|$|The {{most common}} {{practice}} of siege warfare was to lay siege and <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> surrender of the enemies inside or, quite commonly, to coerce someone inside to betray the fortification. During the medieval period, negotiations would frequently take {{place during the}} early part of the siege. An attacker - aware of a prolonged siege's great cost in time, money, and lives - might offer generous terms to a defender who surrendered quickly. The defending troops would be allowed to march away unharmed, often retaining their weapons. However, a garrison commander who was thought to have surrendered too quickly might face execution by his own side for treason.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme to deterministically {{generate}} Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of N≥ 3 atoms trapped in spatially separated cavities connected by optical fibers.

The parametrized shapes of the Rabi frequencies of the classical fields that drive the two end atoms are chosen appropriately to realize the scheme. We also show numerically that the proposed scheme is insensitive to the fluctuations of the pulses' parameters and, at the same time, robust against decoherence caused by the dissipation due to fiber decay. Moreover, a relatively high fidelity can be obtained even in the presence of cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission. Comment: Accepted by JOSA...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} children’s conceptual understanding and ballgame experience when judging whether a football player is in an offside position, or not. In the offside position, a player takes advantage of being behind the defence line of the opposing team and <b>just</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ball to arrive in order to score a goal. We explained the offside rule to 7 - and 9 -year-old children with a Subbuteo setup. They produced drawings of an offside position until it was correct (drawing to criterion). Thereafter, children judged whether a designated player was in an offside position in a computerized task. Like adults, also children {{found it easier to}} judge when a player was in a wrong rather than a right place. Only when including frequency of ballgame practice in the analysis it was revealed that boys were better independently of age as they judged the offside position more systematically...|$|R
