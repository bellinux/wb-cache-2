25|$|Paracetamol or {{acetaminophen}} (trade name Panadol and Tylenol) {{is extremely}} toxic to cats, {{and should not}} be given to them under any circumstances. Cats lack the necessary glucuronyl transferase enzymes to safely break paracetamol down and minute portions of a normal tablet for humans may prove fatal. Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation and discolouration of the tongue and gums. After around two days, liver damage is evident, typically giving rise to jaundice. Unlike an overdose in humans, it is rarely liver damage that is the cause of death, instead methaemoglobin formation and the production of <b>Heinz</b> <b>bodies</b> in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing asphyxiation. Effective treatment is occasionally possible for small doses, but must be extremely rapid.|$|E

Increased <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Bodies</b> {{were observed in}} the cases of severe acute hepatitis, subacute yellow liver atrophy and of severe acute nephritis.

In the supravital staining the <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Bodies</b> with twenty -one basic dyestuffs, not only the basic dyes reported by Friedstein and Webster but marked stainings with crystal violette, victorian blue and methyl green were observed. 2. Observing conditions of these <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Bodies,</b> after the fixations with such as methanol, formalin-gas, action, Carony's solution or flames, Triamino Compounds in Triarylmethan, dyes were relatively well stained, the stainings in general were not so good. However, the staining with acid dyestuffs were ex-cellent especially after the fixation with aceton and Carony's solution. 3. On adding the saline solutions containing sodium salicylate, sodium stearate or urea to the rabbit erythrocytes suspension, fein speckled granules smaller than those with phenylhydrazin, well stained by methyl violett, were observed in the peripheral areas of the erythrocytes, in proportion to the Mol concentration of these chemicals. The staininga of <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Body</b> and so were the stainings after the fixations, The granules grew up slowly until maximum size, when no more growth was observed. The optimum concentrations for the growth of the grnules were go to 100 mol urea, 1 mol of Sodium stearate or 1 mol of sodium salicylate. 4. In producing <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Bodies</b> no significant difference was noted between the two methods, adding urea after phenyihydrazin to rabbit erythrocyte and the sole administration of phenylhydrazin. 5. The granules, were produced by adding urea to stroma an well as phesylhydrazin, and exhibited aproximate the same staining with <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Body</b> although they were not essentially the same. 6. The granules, corresponding with <b>Heinz's</b> <b>Body,</b> were noted after adding phenylhydrazin to hemoglobin.

40|$|By {{determining}} {{at first}} the appearance of <b>Heinz's</b> <b>body</b> in man and male domestic rabbits, both normal, with the Yoshida-Kawamura method, and next by investigating {{the rate of the}} appearance of <b>Heinz's</b> <b>body</b> in Bikini hydrogen-bomb patients and in the domestic rabbits injected with radio-isotope P(32) {{as well as in the}} rabbits exposed to X-ray, the author obtained the following results: 1. Two separate groups of male and female, each consisting of 25 persons, were selected and the rate of the Heinz-body appearance was determined; and as the result, the average rates of the appearance of each were found to be 63. 88 â€° (male) and 66. 52 â€° (female) respectively; thus the average value of females was slightly higher. On the other hand, in the 62 normal male rabbits similarly measured, the average value of the appearance of <b>Heinz's</b> <b>body</b> was found to be 22. 19 â€°. 2. In the case of the 7 fishermen passing through the Bikini area and having shown no apparent clinical disorders, the rate of Heinz-body appearance was found to be still high, yet within 3 to 4 weeks after the examination, it returned to normal, paralleling more or less with the change of blood-iron contents, Sideroblastogram, and the results of Bone marrow tissue culture. In view of this, in establishing a criterion of the recovery of these hydrogenbomb cases, it seems that scrupulous daily examinations such as mentioned previously are of urgent necessity. 3. In the domestic rabbits receiving the injection of 100 Î¼c. P(32) /kg, <b>Heinz's</b> <b>body</b> increased 6 hours after the injection but it returned to normal after 20 to 42 days; even then they maintained a high value of blood-iron contents and showed an unmistakable evidence of radio-active substance in the bone as well.
