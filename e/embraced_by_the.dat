Brown has suggested that Dot has universal appeal because everybody knows a person like Dot. In 2009, a poll by magazine Inside Soap named Dot as the UK's 'greatest gossip' in a soap opera.|$|E
5|$|During the Ming dynasty, the Neo-Confucian {{doctrines of}} the Song scholar Zhu Xi were <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{court and the}} Chinese literati at large, {{although}} the direct line of his school was destroyed by the Yongle Emperor's extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of Fang Xiaoru in 1402.|$|E

5000|$|The {{philosopher and}} {{historian}} Robert Pasnau makes a similar, but more extreme claim that [...] "modernity {{came in the}} late twelfth century, with Averroes' magisterial revival of Aristotle and its almost immediate <b>embrace</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Latin West." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{movement}} to legalize birth control {{came to a}} gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on the books) were rarely enforced.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the WHA's Calgary Cowboys, who folded {{three years}} earlier, the Flames were {{immediately}} <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> city of Calgary. While the Cowboys could manage to sell only 2,000 season tickets {{in their final}} campaign of 1976–77, the Flames sold 10,000 full- and half-season ticket packages in the 7,000 seat Stampede Corral.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E
50|$|Thello Entertainment {{invited him}} to join them on a yearlong Japanese tour {{alongside}} other reggae stars including Wayne Wonder and Ky-Mani Marley (son of Bob Marley). It was during his time in Japan that his welcome <b>embrace</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese spawned a style they deemed ‘Mutant Chant’ for his evolving sound. His Japanese fans created his name Jah Bami.|$|R

25|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, the Order was in decline. However, its {{fortunes}} were revived in the 1880s {{after its}} <b>embrace</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> landlords {{in opposition to}} both the Irish Land League and later Home Rule. The Order was heavily involved in opposition to Gladstone's first Irish Home Rule Bill 1886, and {{was instrumental in the}} formation of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). Protestant opposition to Irish self-government under Roman Catholic influence was intense, especially in the Protestant-dominated province of Ulster.|$|R
5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{there was}} a renewal of football at Maryland. Fullback Grenville Lewis was elected as team captain and head coach. He instituted a strict physical training regimen involving calisthenics and long-distance running, and banned smoking, drinking, and eating pie during the football season. This was unpopular with the team, but Lewis was <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> students and faculty. In the game to decide the state championship, Maryland Agricultural faced Maryland-Baltimore. Late in the scoreless game, the Aggies pushed to their opponents' two-yard line. With darkness approaching and Maryland Agricultural having difficulty scoring, the referee called the game. It became clear that Maryland-Baltimore had sneaked three extra players onto the field, but the referee refused to award the Aggies the win. Two days later, the Maryland–Baltimore players voted to forfeit the game, {{and with it the}} championship, to Maryland Agricultural.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{marriage}} to Claude Duchess of Brittany, Francis I of France secured the Union of Brittany and France. On 13 August 1532, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the arrangement by signing the Edict of Union. Upon the death of Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1536, the Duchy of Brittany passed to Henry II of France. Henry's status as king of France meant that the duchy became merely a French province. Institutions such as the Breton Estates and Parlement of Brittany continued to resist Paris in matters of taxation until their dissolution {{at the end of}} the 18th century. Breton nationalism saw a revival following the 1839 publication of Barzaz Breiz, a collection of traditional Breton folktales, songs and music. Pitre-Chevalier's 1844 Histoire de la Bretagne, followed in the same footsteps by highlighting a number of historical events as manifestations of Breton nationalism and aspirations of independence. Chevalier did not hesitate to distort the causes of revolts such as the Revolt of the papier timbré, in order to promote his agenda. The end of the 19th century was marked by the disintegration of archaic Breton social and economic structures with a parallel drive for compulsory primary education. During the course of the latter, primary teachers were specifically instructed with phasing out minority languages. Early Breton nationalist organizations such as Association Brettone (founded in 1829) focused on issues such as the preservation of the Breton language and administrative autonomy. By 1914, the Breton language had <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> region's intellectuals through a literary revival failing however to reach the masses.|$|E

50|$|Together with Cărtărescu {{and other}} {{figures in the}} Postmodernist group, Nedelciu was a target for criticism, both {{individual}} and collective. A synthesis of these objections was provided by literary historian Eugen Negrici. In Negrici's view, the self-referential and ironic works produced by such writers hindered the development of local literature on a more solid basis, and their <b>embrace</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> established critics diverted attention from older, classically Modernist authors. He also argued that the group's identification with Postmodernist theses prevented others from doing the same, and that <b>the</b> approximation implied <b>by</b> this process rendered the Postmodern label meaningless.|$|R

25|$|After the {{independence}} of Indonesia in 1945, Confucianism in Indonesia was affected by several political conflicts. In 1965, Sukarno issued Presidential Decree No. 1/Pn.Ps/1965, recognising that six religions are <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian people, including Confucianism. In 1961, the Association of Khung Chiao Hui Indonesia (PKCHI), a Confucianist organisation, had declared that Confucianism is a religion and Confucius is their prophet.|$|E
5000|$|Sirach is {{not part}} of the Jewish canon, once thought to have been {{established}} at the hypothetical Council of Jamnia, perhaps due to its late authorship, although it is not clear that the canon was completely [...] "closed" [...] at the time of Ben Sira. [...] Others have suggested that Ben Sira's self-identification as the author precluded it from attaining canonical status, which was reserved for works that were attributed (or could be attributed) to the prophets, or that it was denied entry to the canon as a rabbinical counter-reaction to its <b>embrace</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nascent Christian community.|$|R

25|$|After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi {{and even}} {{mausoleum}} of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos. One {{of the most}} dangerous threats to the structure was that it would be equated with the late Pahlavi dynasty by the new regime and destroyed. It however was not and was instead <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new local government since Ferdowsi was a devout Muslim.|$|E
25|$|Artists {{particularly}} <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{gay community}} during the 1980s included Patti Labelle, Alaska, Charo, Dolly Parton, Elaine Paige, Amanda Lear, Prince and Mylène Farmer. Several Britons {{were seen as}} gay icons, including singers Boy George, George Michael, Morrissey, Pet Shop Boys, Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, and writer Quentin Crisp. Elton John also became a gay icon during this decade, a status strengthened throughout the years.|$|E

25|$|A {{speaker of}} Glaswegian might refer to those {{originating}} from the Scottish Highlands and the Western Isles as teuchters, while they would reciprocate {{by referring to}} Glaswegians as keelies. Those from the East of Scotland refer to Glaswegians as Weegies (or Weedgies), a term which is increasingly being <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> locals as a term of self-reference, whereas in the past it was normally used in a pejorative sense by outsiders.|$|E
25|$|Against a {{background}} of poorly maintained church buildings; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities, the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated {{a return to a}} more medieval attitude to churchgoing. The change was <b>embraced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance.|$|E
25|$|The Victory Tests were {{a series}} of cricket matches played in England from 19 May to 22 August 1945, between a {{combined}} Australian Services XI and an English national side.

40|$|The {{marketing}} and distribution of pre-recorded music for sale and public consumption is a cultural development as profound as any in the twentieth-century musical world. It is especially relevant to late- 1950 s American rock and roll, {{in terms of the}} music's capture in the rapidly-evolving environment of the recording studio, its release into the marketplace via independent record labels, and its enthusiastic <b>embrace</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> burgeoning youth culture of the era. Within this multi-dimensional context, Zoom Records, a tiny, independent record label, was born in Tucson, Arizona. A unique convergence of technological, artistic, and commercial developments and historical events gives special import to the Zoom Records story, as a lesson in entrepreneurship, artistic expression and personal transformation...|$|R
60|$|Carriages {{were rolling}} about, and gay groups on piazzas, lawns, and window-seats idly speculated {{as to who}} the {{distinguished}} guests might be. The appearance of a very dusty vehicle loaded with trunks at Mr Bhaer's hospitably open door caused much curious comment among the loungers, especially as two rather foreign-looking gentlemen sprang out, followed by two young ladies, all four being greeted with cries of joy and much <b>embracing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bhaers. Then they all disappeared into the house, the luggage followed, and the watchers were left to wonder who the mysterious strangers were, till a fair collegian declared {{that they must be}} the Professor's nephews, one of whom was expected on his wedding journey.|$|R
