500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Matt Rush, who had {{attended}} the concert in July, {{noted that the}} original concert was much longer than the broadcast, due to the time taken by Gaga for changing her costumes. Rush complimented Bennett's performance saying [...] "At 88, the remarkable Tony Bennett ... can still deliver the goods, and his solo rendition of 'How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> the Music Playing?' is the soaring highlight of [...] Bennett's rapport with Gaga seems genuine, {{and they have a}} sweet, unforced musical chemistry in these selections from their current album of standards." [...] Brad Oswald from the Winnipeg Free Press was impressed by the duos vocal delivery, saying that [...] "the 88-year-old crooner and the 28-year-old pop diva meld voices seamlessly as they serve up swinging duet versions of such standards". New York Daily News TV Critic David Hinckley, who awarded the concert with four out of five stars, was surprised by Lady Gaga being a [...] "multifaceted singer, not just a dance diva" [...] and stated that Gaga handled the fashion side of the event. He finished the review [...] declaring [...] "The singing in general is solid. Bennett can still hit some remarkable notes, and more important, he understands the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Bennett and Gaga {{performed}} thirteen songs. The concert {{started with}} Bennett and Gaga appearing before {{the crowd and}} singing [...] "Anything Goes", then {{moving on to the}} title track, [...] "Cheek to Cheek". A costume change ensues, and Gaga and Bennett appear on stage to sing [...] "Nature Boy". Bennett continues with [...] "How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> the Music Playing?" [...] following which Gaga appears on stage in Menkes' red jumpsuit and a big wig to sing her solo rendition of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". Following a standing ovation, the duo come together to perform the Billy Strayhorn penned [...] "Firefly" [...] and Gaga disappears for a third costume change. She appears in Vogels' crown hat and a Valentino gown and together they sing [...] "I Won't Dance" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love", wearing Cavalli. Gaga stays on stage for solo rendition of [...] "Lush Life", followed by Bennett with his solo performance of [...] "Sophisticated Lady". After another costume change, the duo sing [...] "Let's Face the Music and Dance" [...] and [...] "But Beautiful". The final performance is aided by the full band and dancers, as they sing [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". After taking a bow, Bennett and Gaga disappear behind the curtains.|$|E

500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E

2500|$|Clough's time at Forest {{saw him at}} {{odds with}} Justin Fashanu, whose goals and then {{confidence}} dried up as he failed {{to fit in with}} Clough's playing and lifestyle demands after signing for them in 1981. When Clough learned of Fashanu's homosexuality (which was not made public until 1990), he barred Fashanu from training with the side. In his autobiography, Clough recounted a dressing down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going to}} gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> going to that bloody poofs' club?'" [...] It was also in this book that he admitted his one regret was leaving Derby County.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1944, {{some of the}} arrested {{perpetrators}} of the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler were taken before Freisler for punishment. [...] The proceedings were filmed {{to be seen by}} the German public in cinema newsreels, portraying how Freisler ran his court, showing him alternating between cerebral questioning of the defendants, with clinical interrogations to prove their guilt of the charges, and verbally and psychologically toying with them to the point of enraged hysterical screaming of personal abuse at them from the bench. At one point he yelled at Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, who was trying to hold his trousers up after being given old oversized and beltless clothing, [...] "You dirty old man, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> fiddling with your trousers?" [...] Nearly all were sentenced to death by hanging, the sentences being carried out within 2 hours of the verdicts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not warn me of this?" [...] he demanded. [...] "And why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> such a {{precious}} power {{in an old}} shoe? And why didn't you put the shoe under a pillow? You were very wrong, my lad, in not confiding to me, your faithful friend, the secret, for in that case the shoe would not now be lost." ...|$|R

2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
2500|$|Justin Fashanu, {{the first}} black £1 million footballer, was the first footballer to be openly gay. In his autobiography, Brian Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going}} to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> going to that bloody poofs' club?"' Fashanu committed suicide in 1998 after he was questioned by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault, and it has been suggested that the tragedy and hostility that struck his life after publicly coming out persuaded other gay footballers that coming out would not be a good idea. The coroner said the prejudices he experienced, plus the sexual assault charge he was facing at the time of his death, probably overwhelmed him.|$|E
