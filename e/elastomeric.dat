25|$|This polymer is {{primarily}} {{used to make}} <b>elastomeric</b> polyurethane fibers like Spandex.|$|E
25|$|Microcellular foams {{are tough}} <b>elastomeric</b> {{materials}} used in coverings of car steering wheels or shoe soles.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} molding {{materials}} are glass-filled nylon 6 and nylon 66. Other materials include unfilled nylons, polyphenylene sulfide, glass-filled polyaryletherketone (PAEK), glass-filled polypropylene (PP), rigid thermoplastic urethane, and <b>elastomeric</b> thermoplastic polyurethane.|$|E
25|$|Micro-contact {{printing}} or {{soft lithography}} {{is analogous to}} printing ink with a rubber stamp. The SAM molecules are inked onto a pre-shaped <b>elastomeric</b> stamp with a solvent and transferred to the substrate surface by stamping. The SAM solution {{is applied to the}} entire stamp but only areas that make contact with the surface allow transfer of the SAMs. The transfer of the SAMs is a complex diffusion process that depends on the type of molecule, concentration, duration of contact, and pressure applied. Typical stamps use PDMS because its <b>elastomeric</b> properties, E = 1.8 MPa, allow it to fit the countour of micro surfaces and its low surface energy, γ = 21.6 dyn/cm². This is a parallel process and can thus place nanoscale objects over a large area in a short time.|$|E
25|$|In all cases, if {{employer}} select respirator with tight-fitting facepiece (full face mask, <b>elastomeric</b> half-mask or quarter-mask, or {{filtering facepiece}} respirator), all employee must be fit tested (to prevent leakage unfiltered polluted air through gaps between {{their faces and}} the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces). Appendix A provides {{a detailed description of}} this testing.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{equipment}} manufacturers (FIE) have raised several concerns regarding FAME fuels, identifying FAME {{as being the}} cause of the following problems: corrosion of fuel injection components, low-pressure fuel system blockage, increased dilution and polymerization of engine sump oil, pump seizures due to high fuel viscosity at low temperature, increased injection pressure, <b>elastomeric</b> seal failures and fuel injector spray blockage. Pure biodiesel has an energy content about 5–10% lower than petroleum diesel. The loss in power when using pure biodiesel is 5–7%.|$|E
25|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that uses a wedge to seal off a wellhead. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an <b>elastomeric</b> packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. The annular {{blowout preventer}} was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors. Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and <b>elastomeric</b> bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|E
25|$|Current robotic and {{prosthetic}} hands receive {{far less}} tactile information than the human hand. Recent research {{has developed a}} tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips. The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an <b>elastomeric</b> skin. Electrodes are mounted {{on the surface of}} the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects.|$|E
25|$|The AW119 {{employs a}} {{four-bladed}} fully articulated main rotor; the composite rotor blades {{are designed to}} produce maximum lift with minimum noise, and feature tip caps to reduce noise and <b>elastomeric</b> bearings with no lubrication requirements. Aluminium honeycomb structural panels are used throughout the airframe, which absorb both noise and vibration, thus requiring no additional vibration absorption systems to be employed. The PT6B-37A powerplant of the AW119, located {{in the same area}} as the AW109 is capable of providing high power margins along with generous speeds and endurance. According to AgustaWestland, the AW119 retains the system redundancy of dual engine helicopters, such as the hydraulics and the dual independent stability augmentation systems; the gearbox has a 30-minute dry run capability.|$|E
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with <b>elastomeric</b> 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, <b>elastomeric</b> rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an <b>elastomeric</b> connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E
2500|$|... (1993-1994) Experts {{have studied}} the {{protective}} properties of the different <b>elastomeric</b> respirators and filtering facepieces. The workers used these respirators in several companies producing paint, flame retardants and batteries.|$|E
2500|$|Polyurethanes {{are used}} in the {{manufacture}} of high-resilience foam seating, rigid foam insulation panels, microcellular foam seals and gaskets, durable <b>elastomeric</b> wheels and tires (such as roller coaster, escalator, shopping cart, elevator, and skateboard wheels), automotive suspension bushings, electrical potting compounds, high performance adhesives, surface coatings and surface sealants, [...] synthetic fibers (e.g., Spandex), carpet underlay, hard-plastic parts (e.g., for electronic instruments), condoms, and hoses.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{facepiece}} of the respirator is tight-fitting one (<b>elastomeric</b> quarter or half masks, filtering facepieces, or full-face masks), efficiency decreases due to leakage of unfiltered {{air through}} {{the gaps between}} the mask and face.

2500|$|... (1976) The {{concentrations}} {{of sulfur dioxide}} were measured under the negative pressure filtering respirator with <b>elastomeric</b> half mask, and in the breathing zone (simultaneously); {{and the results were}} used to calculate the respirator protection factors PF (such as the concentration ratio, ambient to in-facepiece). Experts analyzed the results of only those measurements, during which the masks were not removed. They found a positive relationship between a comfortableness of respirators, and their effectiveness, as the workers tightened the straps of harness at the convenient masks much stronger.|$|E
2500|$|The UH-60 {{features}} four-blade {{main and}} tail rotors, and {{is powered by}} two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines. The main rotor is fully articulated and has <b>elastomeric</b> bearings in the rotor head. The tail rotor is canted and features a rigid crossbeam. The helicopter has a long, low profile shape to meet the Army's requirement for transporting aboard a C-130 Hercules, with some disassembly. [...] It can carry 11 troops with equipment, lift [...] of cargo internally or [...] of cargo (for UH-60L/M) externally by sling.|$|E
2500|$|Chain extenders (f=2) {{and cross}} linkers (f≥3) are low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that {{play an important role}} in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, [...] elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The <b>elastomeric</b> properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating <b>elastomeric</b> resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.|$|E

The spacecraft's on-orbit mass including fuel is over [...] on the Jupiter flyby trajectory, but would have been only [...] for the backup direct flight option to Pluto. Significantly, had the backup option been taken, this would have meant less fuel for later Kuiper belt operations.|$|E

[...] The Bell 214ST has a larger, stretched fuselage with seating for 16-18 passengers, and two [...] GE CT7-2A engines. [...] The helicopter introduced some ground-breaking innovations for Bell, including a one-hour run-dry transmission, fiberglass rotor blades, <b>elastomeric</b> rotorhead bearings, and {{the option of}} either skid or wheeled landing gear. [...] The helicopter has a cockpit door and a large cabin door on each side. [...] The 214ST has a fuel capacity of 435 US gallons (1,650 L). [...] An auxiliary fuel system could be added.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main rotor}} hub has a single piece {{aluminum}} hub with <b>elastomeric</b> bearings designed not to require lubrication or {{any other kind of}} maintenance throughout its design life. The main rotor blades have titanium spars and incorporate a ten degree twist to give an even loading when hovering, while they use a non-symmetrical airfoil section with a drooped leading edge. The rotor tips are tapered and swept back. Flight controls are servo-assisted, with a Stability Augmentation System fitted. A retractable nosewheel undercarriage is fitted, which gives the S-76A a [...] increase in cruising speed; emergency flotation gear can be fitted using helium-filled bags to increase buoyancy {{in the event of a}} forced landing on water.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{was among}} the first to {{recognize}} the potential of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening in the discovery of olefin polymerization catalysts. [...] Stevens’ work here led to an amazing hafnium-based catalyst family (few experts would have believed a hafnium complex would have the needed activity) that enables the polymerization of propylene to isotactic polymers and copolymers in a high temperature solution process. [...] In a series of papers and patents starting in 2002, Stevens, along with colleagues and collaborators, disclosed new catalysts which are non-conventional, counter-intuitive, subtle, and have an unprecedented stereoselectivity along with remarkable high temperature performance. [...] This discovery has led to another family of new propene-based polyolefins and a process for the large-scale production of new thermoplastic and <b>elastomeric</b> materials. The resulting polymers have been commercialized under the VERSIFY tradename.|$|E
