5|$|Ten years later, J. D. Redding and {{his teenage}} {{daughter}} Tory rent the O'Grady farmhouse for the summer. Contract workers Nathan Murphy, his 12-year-old brother Alex, and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re-paint the farmhouse. While {{looking around the}} basement, Ozzie hears the leprechaun's cry for help and mistakes him for a little child. He brushes the old four-leaf clover off the crate, freeing the leprechaun. After failing to convince the others that he met a leprechaun, Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it, believing he will find a pot of gold at the end. Alex accompanies him for fear Ozzie might <b>hurt</b> <b>himself.</b> A bag of one hundred gold pieces magically appears before Ozzie. After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a piece, they stash it in an old well and plot to keep it for themselves, hoping to fix Ozzie's brain.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{had also}} <b>hurt</b> <b>himself.</b> He had fired {{many of his}} {{supporters}} {{and most of the}} research department staff. Miller relied instead on a law firm for bargaining advice, which caused confusion among UMWA negotiators and sent mixed signals to the employers.|$|E
25|$|The shot of Petersen {{running along}} the top of the {{dividers}} between the terminal's moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he <b>hurt</b> <b>himself.</b> The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.|$|E
25|$|Respecting one's {{health and}} {{physical}} well-being {{was one of the}} foundations of the group. If any member <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{had also}} <b>hurt</b> <b>himself.</b> He had fired {{most of his}} {{supporters}} in the intervening three years, including press officer Bernard Aronson, research director Thomas Bethell {{and most of the}} research department staff, leaving UMWA organizationally unable to handle the needs of the negotiations and strike. Miller turned to the Stanley H. Ruttenberg Company for negotiating advice and assistance at the bargaining table. This caused confusion among UMWA negotiators as to strategy, tactics and the content of proposals, and caused mixed signals to be sent by the bargaining committee, Miller and other UMWA officers. The lack of organizational competence and flow of mixed messages helped prolong the labor dispute.|$|E
500|$|The second {{incident}} was {{a dispute with}} his naval counterpart on the Chesapeake, Captain Thomas Symonds, over the distribution of prizes captured during the various expeditions. [...] Symonds was so incensed by Arnold's attitude that he refused to leave port to respond to reports of transports carrying Lafayette's troops on the bay. [...] The incident became widely known when Arnold got back to New York, prompting one officer to write, [...] " [...] has <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> by discovering too much fondness for cash ... if he {{is attached to the}} latter ... he is no acquisition for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E

500|$|Wilson began 2006 {{with the}} Grizzlies before getting {{called up to}} the majors on April 23 to replace Tyler Walker, who was {{designated}} for assignment after struggling to begin the season. He made his major league debut that day in relief, pitching two innings, surrendering two hits and no runs while striking out three [...] He later revealed that he <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> during his first inning but continued pitching through the second without informing anyone of his injury. Afterward he {{was placed on the}} disabled list for a month. On May 23, he returned from the DL. He was optioned to Fresno on June 7 when Tim Worrell was activated from the DL; Giants' manager Felipe Alou said Wilson was not getting enough playing time. Wilson would go on to have three more stints with the Giants in 2006. On July 2, he got his first career save, stranding three inherited runners in the eighth inning and throwing [...] scoreless innings in a 6–2 victory over the San Diego Padres. In 31 games, he had a 2–3 record, a 5.40 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 21 walks in 30 innings pitched. In 24 games with Fresno, he had a 1–3 record, a 2.89 ERA, 30 strikeouts, and 14 walks in 28 innings pitched.|$|E
2500|$|Despite initial {{misgivings about}} Carisa's design with a desk {{built into the}} foot of the bed (one judge remarked that an active boy could easily <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> on the rough edges), her design was named one of the best that night. Goil's design, with a bed {{equipped}} to roll away inside the wall when not in use, and a crawl space for the child to hide if he so chose, was also liked by the judges. Erik's design, revolved around a wooden [...] "pirate ship" [...] (the client he had expressed an interest in pirates), won top prize.|$|E

Laiho {{felt that he}} had <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "more than ever" [...] {{over the course of a}} two-year period (between 2005–2007), and arrived at the conclusion that he was addicted to hurting himself [...] "so bad". [...] When discussing the track in interviews, Laiho has made reference to the fact that he self-harmed in the past. However, Laiho has noted that the song isn't [...] "necessarily just about cutting yourself but about other things you do to yourself and you don't know why".|$|E
60|$|And on {{went the}} giant, behind before, like a bull in a china-shop, till {{he ran into}} the steeple of the great idol temple (for they are all idolaters in those parts, of course, else they would never be afraid of giants), and knocked the upper half clean off, <b>hurting</b> <b>himself</b> horribly about the small of the back.|$|R

50|$|The beloved person, whom {{otherwise}} has {{not lost}} his self-criticism, can be conquered {{by his own}} pride.

2500|$|... "Alexei was {{the center}} of this united family, the focus of all its hopes and affections," [...] wrote Gilliard. [...] "His sisters worshipped him. He was his parents' pride and joy. When he was well, the palace was transformed. Everyone and {{everything}} in it seemed bathed in sunshine." [...] He bore a striking resemblance to his mother, and was tall for his age, with [...] "a long, finely chiseled face, delicate features, auburn hair with a coppery glint, and large grey-blue eyes like his mother," [...] Though intelligent and affectionate, his education was frequently interrupted by bouts of haemophilia and he was spoiled because his parents couldn't bear to discipline him. His parents appointed two sailors from the Imperial Navy: Petty Officer Andrei Derevenko and his assistant Seaman Klementy Nagorny, to serve as nannies and to follow him about so he would not <b>hurt</b> <b>himself.</b> He was prohibited from riding a bicycle or playing too roughly, but was naturally active.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they wait}} for the fly {{to land on the}} flypaper, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after Holly was born, before his surgery and before Skyler knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night Jane died. Walt then tells Jesse of his bar {{conversation}} with Donald Margolis, Jane's father, on the day that she died. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse, who is unaware of Walt's direct involvement in Jane's death, is surprised to hear this, but before he can ask more, he sees the fly up near the ceiling. He constructs a make-shift support for a step-ladder, asking Walt to hold it steady while he reaches for it. Walt, nearly asleep, begs Jesse to not <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> getting the fly. For a moment, it appears that Walt in his sleepy state is about to confess to Jesse how he stood by while Jane choked to death, but he stops at apologizing for Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. As Jesse begins wildly swatting at the fly, a sobbing Walt falls asleep. Jesse fails to get the fly and with Walt asleep, starts to climbs back down, but sees the fly land on the ladder. He swats and kills it.|$|E
2500|$|The 2003 {{event was}} {{disrupted}} by a defrocked priest, Cornelius Horan, who ran onto the Hangar Straight {{during the race}} while cars were coming at him at 160+ mph. Marshals {{were able to get}} him off the track before he <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> or anyone else and he was later arrested; Brazilian Rubens Barrichello won the race for Ferrari. A dispute between Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), and the Formula One authorities in 2003 over the funding of necessary improvements to the track's facilities led to doubts over the future of the race. In October 2004 the British Grand Prix was left off the preliminary race schedule for 2005 because the BRDC refused to pay the race fee demanded by Bernie Ecclestone. However, after months of negotiation between the BRDC, Ecclestone and the Formula One constructors, a deal was made for the Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone until 2009. 2008 saw Briton Lewis Hamilton win for McLaren; and on 4 July, it was announced that Donington Park had been awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix for 10 years from 2010. However, Donington failed to secure the necessary funding to host the race, and its contract was terminated in November 2009. On 7 December 2009, Silverstone signed a 17-year contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010 onwards. The 2010 race saw a new circuit configuration being used, using the brand new [...] "Arena" [...] layout. For 2011 a new pit complex was built between Club and Abbey Corners, to where the start/finish line was moved. Silverstone is still a very fast circuit- with average speeds up in the 145mph range for Formula 1 cars; one of the highest average speeds on the F1 calendar.|$|E

60|$|A good {{tradesman}} has a {{great deal}} of trouble with a bad servant, but must take heed that he is not wounded by a good one--the extravagant idle vagrant servant <b>hurts</b> <b>himself,</b> but the diligent servant endangers his master.

5000|$|Abenezer {{was born}} and raised in the 08 Sar Bet {{district}} of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he spent most of his childhood. In his early age, his friends and mother would describe him as being [...] "hyperactive", even in his sleep he would roll back and forth so violently that he would often end up on the floor, so his mother had to put him in a basket to keep him from <b>hurting</b> <b>himself</b> unknowingly.|$|R
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he <b>hurt</b> <b>himself</b> by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E

Because she liked him, she begged her brother to allow Big Ding to work in his company. Still enraged over recent events, he feels working at Wang-Chim's company {{would give him a}} chance to get some revenge.|$|R
50|$|If a {{roundhouse}} kick is attempted by the opponent, the Thai boxer will normally {{check the}} kick, that is he will block the kick {{with the outside}} of his lower leg. Thai boxers are trained to always connect with the shin. The foot contains many fine bones and is much weaker. A fighter may end up <b>hurting</b> <b>himself</b> if he tries to strike with his foot or instep. Shins are trained by repeatedly striking firm objects, such as pads or heavy bags.|$|R
