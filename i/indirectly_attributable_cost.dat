40|$|BACKGROUND: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of death from cancer among women in Germany. Despite its {{clinical}} and economic relevance, no <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> for breast cancer have been reported for Germany so far. The objective of this study is to estimate age-specific breast cancer attributable health expenditures for Germany. METHODS: Sickness fund data from 1999 representing about 26 million insured (i. e. 32 % of the total German population) have been analysed using generalized additive models and the error propagation law. Costs have been inflated to 2010. RESULTS: Breast cancer <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> decreased with age. Among breast cancer patients aged 30 - 45 years, about 90 % of all health expenditures were due to breast cancer, whereas in breast cancer patients aged 80 - 90 years, about 50 % were due to breast cancer. Breast cancer <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> amounted to about € 9, 000 annually for patients below 55 years of age and declined to about € 3, 000 in 90 -year-old breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides estimates of <b>attributable</b> breast cancer <b>costs</b> in Germany.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} firstly to estimate the healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>attributable</b> to heart disease in Denmark using recently available data for 2002 – 05. Secondly, to estimate the <b>attributable</b> healthcare <b>costs</b> of lifestyle risk factors among heart patients, in order to inform decision making about prevention programmes specifically targeting patients with heart disease. Methods: For a cohort consisting of participants in a national representative health interview survey, register-based information about hospital diagnosis was used to identify patients with heart disease. Healthcare consumption during 2002 – 05 among individuals developing heart disease during 2002 – 05 was compared with individuals free of heart disease. Healthcare <b>costs</b> <b>attributable</b> to heart disease were estimated by linear regression with adjustment for confounding factors. The <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> of excess drinking, physical inactivity and smoking among future heart patients were estimated with the same method. Results: Individuals with heart disease cost the healthcare system on average J 3195 (pv 0. 0001) per person-year more than individuals without heart disease. The <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> of unhealthy lifestyle factors among individuals at risk of heart disease was about 11 %– 16 % of the <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> of heart disease. Conclusions: Heart disease incurs significant additional costs to the healthcare sector, and more so if heart patients have a history of leading an unhealthy life. Consequently, strategies to prevent or cease unhealthy lifestyle may not only result in cost savings due to avoided heart disease. Additional cost savings may be obtained because heart patient...|$|R

Methods The study was an incidence-based cost-of-illness study based on national registries covering {{the entire population of}} Denmark. We identified all patients with a first-time hospital diagnosis of atrial fibrillation between 2001 and 2012. For every atrial fibrillation patient, we identified three age- and sex-matched controls from the general population. Both the total and the <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> of atrial fibrillation were estimated based on individual level information on hospital care (in- and out-patient contacts), primary sector care, use of prescription drugs and productivity loss. Results Average 3 -year societal <b>costs</b> per patient <b>attributable</b> to atrial fibrillation were estimated to be € 20, 403 – 26, 544 during the study period. The costs were highest during the first year after diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Admission costs constituted the largest cost component, whereas primary sector costs and medicine costs only constituted minor components. The <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> were more than two-fold higher among patients experiencing a stroke. The total 3 -year <b>cost</b> <b>attributable</b> to atrial fibrillation in Denmark was estimated to be € 219 – 295 million.

The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> due to pneumonia among patients hospitalized with pneumonia compared to a matched general population control group without pneumonia hospitalization. Methods: This study includes citizens older than 18 years from three municipalities (n= 142, 344). Based on national registers and municipal data, the health and social care costs of pneumonia in the second half of 2013 are estimated and compared with propensity score-matched population controls. Results: The average health care costs of 383 patients hospitalized with pneumonia in the second half of 2013 were US$ 34, 561 per patient. Among pneumonia patients with COPD, the costs were US$ 35, 022. The <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> of patients with pneumonia compared to the population control group for the 6 -month period were US$ 24, 155 per case. Overall, the <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> for the 383 pneumonia cases amounted to US$ 9. 25 million. Subgroup analyses showed that costs increased with age. The <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> due to pneumonia were highest among the 18 – 59 -year-old and the 70 – 79 -year-old patients. This difference is likely to reflect an increased risk of mortality among the pneumonia patients. Men have higher costs than women in the pneumonia group. Conclusion: The costs of pneumonia are considerable. In three Danish municipalities, the <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> due to pneumonia were US$ 24, 155 per case or US$ 64, 992 per 1, 000 inhabitants in the second half of 2013. Similar high health care and social care costs were found for pneumonia patients with COPD – the largest group having pneumonia episodes. The municipalities are responsible for 49 % of the costs, while a closer focus on the prevention of pneumonia may be advisable, eg, starting with citizens having COPD.

40|$|Introduction: Our {{objective}} was to estimate the future direct health care costs due to diabetes for a 10 -year period in Canada using national survey data, a validated diabetes risk prediction tool and individual-level <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> estimates. Methods: We used the Diabetes Population Risk Tool to predict {{the number of new}} diabetes cases in those aged 20 years and above over a 10 -year period (to 2022), using 2011 and 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey data. We derived <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> due to diabetes from a propensity-matched case control study using the Ontario Diabetes Database and other administrative data. We calculated total costs by applying the respective <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> to the incident cases, accounting for sex, year of diagnosis and annual disease-specific mortality rates. Results: The predicted 10 -year risk of developing diabetes for the Canadian population in 2011 / 12 was 9. 98 %, corresponding to 2. 16 million new cases. Total health care <b>costs</b> <b>attributable</b> to diabetes during this period were $ 7. 55 billion for females and $ 7. 81 billion for males ($ 15. 36 billion total). Acute hospitalizations accounted for the greatest proportion of costs (43. 2 %). A population intervention resulting in 5 % body weight loss would save $ 2. 03 billion in health care costs. A 30 % risk-reduction intervention aimed at individuals with the highest diabetes risk (i. e. the top 10 % of the highest-risk group) would save $ 1. 48 billion. Conclusion: Diabetes represents a heavy health care cost burden in Canada through to the year 2022.

However, the economic effects of such infections remain unclear particularly in developing countries. MethodsPatients who were mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h in the ICU were studied for the occurrence of VAP. Total drug costs and hospital costs were noted, and <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> were calculated after adjusting for potential confounders. ResultsNinety-five (38 %) patients who were ventilated for more than 48 h developed VAP, which resulted in an incidence of 40. 1 VAP infections/ 1000 mechanical ventilation days. The patients with VAP experienced significantly longer hospital stay [21 (IQ= 14 – 33) days versus 11 (IQ= 6 – 18) days, P< 0. 0001) ] and incurred greater hospital costs [USD $ 6250. 92 (IQ= 3525. 39 – 9667. 57) versus $ 2598. 84 (IQ= 1644. 33 – 4477. 65), P< 0. 0001].

40|$|Background: In this study, we {{developed}} cost prediction equations that facilitate {{estimation of the}} costs of various cardiovascular events for patients of specific demographic and clinical characteristics over varying time horizons. Methods: We used administrative claims data and generalized linear models to develop cost prediction equations for selected cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), angina, strokes and revascularization procedures. Separate equations were estimated for patients with events and for their propensity score-matched controls. <b>Attributable</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated on a monthly basis for the first 36 months after each event and annually thereafter, with differences in survival between cases and controls factored into the longitudinal cost calculations. The regression models were used to estimate event costs ($US, year 2007 values) for the average patient in each event group, over various time periods ranging from 1 month to lifetime. Results: When the equations are run for the average patient in each event group, <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> of each event in the acute phase (i. e. first 3 years) are substantial (e. g. MI $US 73 300; hospitalization for angina $US 36 000; nonfatal haemorrhagic stroke $US 71 600). Furthermore, for most events, cumulative costs remain substantially higher among cases than among controls over the remaining lifetime of the patients. Conclusions: This study provides updated estimates of medical care costs of cardiovascular events among a managed care population over various time horizons.

However, {{estimates of the}} annual cost of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) from the Medicaid perspective are lacking. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Medicaid administrative claims data from California and Florida to estimate COPD expenditures using two alternative methods: (1) excess costs (comparing a COPD cohort to a matched comparison cohort); and (2) <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> (COPD-related expenditures within a COPD cohort, inclusive of respiratory medications). The COPD cohort in each state included Medicaid recipients not dually eligible for Medicare who were 40 + years of age with at least one medical claim for COPD during 2001. The comparison cohort consisted of patients with medical claims during 2001 for conditions other than chronic respiratory disease, matched by age, sex, and race to the COPD cohort. Results: A total of 6738 Medicaid recipients in California and 18, 017 in Florida were included in the COPD cohort, with mean ages of 56 and 60 years, respectively. Comorbidities, especially congestive heart failure and vascular disease, were more common in the COPD cohort than among matched controls. The mean excess cost of COPD per-patient was estimated to be approximately $ 6500 in California Medicaid and $ 5200 in Florida Medicaid.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo present new {{estimates}} of the average lifetime costs per child maltreatment victim and aggregate lifetime costs for all new child maltreatment cases incurred in 2008 using an incidence-based approach. MethodsThis study used the best available secondary data to develop cost per case estimates. For each cost category, the paper used <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> whenever possible. For those categories that <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> data were not available, costs were estimated {{as the product of}} incremental effect of child maltreatment on a specific outcome multiplied by the estimated cost associated with that outcome. The estimate of the aggregate lifetime cost of child maltreatment in 2008 was obtained by multiplying per-victim lifetime cost estimates by the estimated cases of new child maltreatment in 2008. ResultsThe estimated average lifetime cost per victim of nonfatal child maltreatment is $ 210, 012 in 2010 dollars, including $ 32, 648 in childhood health care costs; $ 10, 530 in adult medical costs; $ 144, 360 in productivity losses; $ 7, 728 in child welfare costs; $ 6, 747 in criminal justice costs; and $ 7, 999 in special education costs. The estimated average lifetime cost per death is $ 1, 272, 900, including $ 14, 100 in medical costs and $ 1, 258, 800 in productivity losses. The total lifetime economic burden resulting from new cases of fatal and nonfatal child maltreatment in the United States in 2008 is approximately $ 124 billion. In sensitivity analysis, the total burden is estimated to be as large as $ 585 billion. ConclusionsCompared with other health problems, the burden of child maltreatment is substantial, indicating the importance of prevention efforts to address the high prevalence of child maltreatment...|$|R
40|$|Bottle-feeding {{has been}} {{associated}} with excess childhood disease. The costs of managing this burden have not yet been quantified in Canada. This thesis estimated the direct costs of three childhood diseases (diarrhea, otitis media and lower respiratory infection) attributable to bottle-feeding among Ontario infants under the age of one year in 1994. A systematic review identified relative risks among bottle-fed children. The prevalence of bottle-feeding was determined from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, 1994 / 1995. Impact fractions were calculated {{for each of the three}} diseases and applied to the costs of physician visits and hospitalizations which were provided by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The net direct costs of bottle-feeding were estimated as the sum of <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> minus cost savings. The cost of health care attributable to bottle-feeding was estimated to be $ 2. 2 million. A sensitivity analysis revealed that bottle-feeding could have yielded cost savings of $ 88, 900 or cost just under $ 4. 0 million. This estimate was conservative as the costs of drugs were not included...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{surgery is}} {{performed}} {{on more than}} 600, 000 patients in the United States yearly (American Heart Association, 2001; McConkey et al., 1999). Postoperative mediastinitis {{is one of the}} devastating complications of this procedure. The reported incidence ranges from a fraction of a percentage to more than 2 % for all cardiac surgery operations in the United States (Bitkover & Gardlund, 1998; Borger et al., 1998). Mediastinitis develops {{as a result of a}} complex interaction of patient, surgical, and virulent microbial risk factors. Major consequences include at least two additional operations; increased morbidity and mortality, with extended hospitalization of an average 30 days; and significant economic loss, ranging from $ 20, 000 to $ 60, 000 as direct <b>attributable</b> <b>costs</b> per infected patient (Gaynes et al., 1991...|$|R
40|$|Although Uganda is well {{endowed with}} {{adequate}} food supplies, {{more than one}} third of the {{children under the age of}} five are malnourished and 60 % of all deaths of children under five years of age are directly or <b>indirectly</b> <b>attributable</b> to malnutrition. The causes of this public health problem in Uganda are complex and multidisciplinary, but poor quality and quantity of foods given to children play a major role. In this study, we conducted a rat feeding trial experiment in order to explore the potential of a banana-soy based diet optimally incorporated with sesame as a complementary diet to support growth of children. The study applied sensory evaluation and rat feeding trial experiments to investigate the optimum level of sesame incorporation in an earlier formulated banana-soy diet and as well explore the nutritional value of the final diet. Crude protein, ash and energy contents of the formulations were determined using AOAC methods. Data were analyzed using GenStat 5 Release 3. 2. Nutrient and energy composition was compared using ANOVA and PER was compared using t-test. Results showed that a mixture of 67 % banana, 16. 5 % soybean and 16. 5 % sesame flours produced a blend whos...|$|R
40|$|As {{trends in}} {{population}} growth, resource scarcity, {{and global warming}} converge, global food security is becoming a pressing issue. To address this challenge, agricultural systems will have to transition towards more efficient and sustainable production regimes through the generation and diffusion of new technologies. The role of governance in catalyzing this change {{has long been a}} topic of research and debate. In this thesis, the author borrows from the concepts of “niches” and functional analysis to evaluate the role of governance and other factors in pioneering “Dynamic Formulation” technology for salmon within the Norwegian aquaculture sector. This technology was used to substitute expensive fishmeal, extracted from declining stocks of wild fish, with more economic and sustainable feed ingredients. It was found that the “niche” conditions, which facilitated this technological emergence, were only <b>indirectly</b> <b>attributable</b> to government policy. Instead, long-term price incentives, industry dynamics, and attributes of the technology itself were major drivers behind this innovation. This thesis contributes to multi-level and innovation system literature with a hybrid framework applied to a previously unstudied case and encourages discussion about the role of governance in optimizing an already functional “niche”.

40|$|SummaryRationaleAlthough the {{economic}} burden of COPD has gained attention in recent years, {{data on the}} costs of COPD among U. S. Medicare beneficiaries are lacking. MethodsThis study used administrative claims and eligibility records from a large U. S. multi-state Medicare managed care database. Study patients were 65 + years of age with paid claims during 2004. The COPD cohort comprised patients with 1 + inpatient/ER claims or 2 + outpatient claims (> 30 days apart) for COPD (ICD- 9 -CM codes 491. xx, 492. x, 496). The comparison cohort included patients without COPD matched 3 : 1 to the COPD cohort on age, sex, enrollment months, and Medicare plan. Excess costs of COPD were estimated as the difference in overall health plan payments between the two cohorts during 2004. <b>Attributable</b> <b>costs</b> were calculated using medical claims with listed diagnoses of COPD or other respiratory-related conditions and pharmacy claims for respiratory medications. ResultsA total of 8370 patients {{were included in the}} COPD cohort and were matched to 25, 110 comparison cohort patients. For both groups, mean (SD) age was 78 (8) years, 54 % were female, and duration of eligibility was 11 (2) months. COPD patients were more likely to utilize healthcare services and had excess total healthcare costs about $ 20, 500 higher (P< 0. 0001) than the comparison cohort. Comorbidities were high in the COPD cohort, accounting for 46 % of the observed excess <b>cost.</b> The <b>attributable</b> <b>cost</b> of COPD averaged about $ 6, 300; other respiratory-related costs averaged about $ 4, 400. ConclusionIn this U. S. Medicare managed care population, COPD posed a substantial burden in terms of both respiratory-related and total healthcare costs. A comparison of these cost-of-illness estimates to those for elderly COPD patients in other countries would be of great interest, given the increasing age of populations in most Western countries...|$|R
