40|$|Blood-brain barrier (BBB) {{disruption}} is {{the hallmark}} {{feature of the}} secondary injuries that occur following traumatic and ischemic brain injuries. Microvascular <b>hyperpermeability</b> that occurs consequently leads to vasogenic edema and elevated intracranial pressure. Structurally, the BBB is comprised of the brain endothelial cells and the tight junction between them formed by the tight junction proteins (TJPs). Zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) is an important membrane-bound scaffolding TJP that links transmembrane TJPs to intracellular actin cytoskeletal assembly. Studies indicate that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is released into the extracellular space following trauma binds to and activates the purinergic receptor (P 2 X 7 R), leading {{to the production of}} interleukin- 1 ? (IL- 1 ?); which in turn is shown to activate various downstream proteases. Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) and calpains are proteases known to induce BBB breakdown. However, the mechanisms by which ATP and IL- 1 ? induce BBB dysfunction and <b>hyperpermeability</b> and the involvement of proteases in this process are vastly unknown. We hypothesize that ATP and IL- 1 ?-induced BBB dysfunction and <b>hyperpermeability</b> occurs via P 2 X 7 R and /MMP- 9 /calpain-mediated pathways, respectively. And thus, P 2 X 7 R/MMP- 9 /calpain inhibitions {{play an important role in}} mediating BBB dysfunction and <b>hyperpermeability</b> following traumatic injuries in brain. The results from these studies demonstrate that MMP- 9 /calpain inhibition attenuated IL- 1 ?-induced monolayer <b>hyperpermeability,</b> f-actin stress fiber formation, and loss of ZO- 1 /TJ integrity and enhanced MMP- 9 /calpain activity in RBMECs. However, IL- 1 ? treatment did not alter intracellular calcium levels, total number of viable cells, total ZO- 1 protein, and mRNA expression. Purinergic receptor (P 2 X 7 R) inhibition attenuated Bz-ATP (potent agonist of P 2 X 7 R) -induced endothelial cell <b>hyperpermeability,</b> loss of ZO- 1 /TJ integrity and f-actin stress fiber formation. Although Bz-ATP treatment reduced ZO- 1 protein expression, it did not alter total number of viable cells or ZO- 1 mRNA expression in vitro. Melatonin (a pineal hormone with MMP- 9 inhibitory properties), calpain inhibitor III (calpain inhibitor), and KN- 62 (PX 7 R inhibitor) pretreatment attenuated TBI-induced BBB <b>hyperpermeability</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. P 2 X 7 R knockout mice demonstrated reduced TBI-induced BBB <b>hyperpermeability</b> compared to the wild-type animals. In conclusion, ATP-sensitive P 2 X 7 R are involved in promoting BBB dysfunction and <b>hyperpermeability</b> via IL- 1 ?-mediated activation of MMP- 9 /calpain pathways and subsequent disorganization of the TJs.

In pathological conditions, endothelial <b>hyperpermeability</b> can be induced by vasoactive agents, which induce tiny leakage sites between the cells, and by cytokines, in particular vascular endothelial growth factor, which increase {{the exchange of}} plasma proteins by vesicles and intracellular pores. It is generally believed that the interaction of actin and non-muscle myosin in {{the periphery of the}} endothelial cell, and the destabilization of endothelial junctions, are required for endothelial <b>hyperpermeability</b> induced by vasoactive agents. Transient short-term <b>hyperpermeability</b> induced by histamine involves Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent activation of the myosin light chain (MLC) kinase. Prolonged elevated permeability induced by thrombin in addition involves activation of the small GTPase RhoA and Rho kinase, which inhibits dephosphorylation of MLC. It also involves the action of other protein kinases. Several mechanisms can increase endothelial barrier function, depending on the tissue affected and the cause of <b>hyperpermeability.</b> They include blockage of specific receptors, and elevation of cyclic AMP by agents such as β 2 -adrenergic agents.

40|$|Microvascular barrier {{dysfunction}} is {{a serious}} problem that occurs in many inflammatory conditions, including sepsis, trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Barrier dysfunction permits extravasation of serum components into the surrounding tissue, leading to edema formation and organ failure. The basis for microvascular barrier dysfunction is <b>hyperpermeability</b> at endothelial cell-cell junctions. Endothelial <b>hyperpermeability</b> is increased by actomyosin contractile activity in response to phosphorylation of myosin light chain by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK-dependent endothelial <b>hyperpermeability</b> occurs in response to inflammatory mediators (e. g., activated neutrophils, thrombin, histamine, tumor necrosis factor alpha, etc.), through multiple cell signaling pathways and signaling molecules (e. g., Ca(++), protein kinase C, Src kinase, nitric oxide synthase, etc.). Other signaling molecules protect against MLCK-dependent <b>hyperpermeability</b> (e. g., sphingosine- 1 -phosphate or cAMP). In addition, individual MLCK isoforms play specific roles in endothelial barrier dysfunction, suggesting that isoform-specific inhibitors could be useful for treating inflammatory disorders and preventing multiple organ failure.

An inhibitor of glutamate transport (L-trans-pyrrolidine- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid: trans-PDC) and an irreversible blocker (acivicin) of the extracellular glutamine to glutamate converting enzyme, γ-glutamyltransferase, were used. RESULTS: Apical to basolateral HRP flux increased significantly compared to controls not exposed to PDB (n = 30, P < 0. 001). Glutamine application reduced <b>hyperpermeability</b> by 19 % and 39 % in the respective cell lines. Glutamate application reduced <b>hyperpermeability</b> by 30 % and 20 %, respectively.

Irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGEs), resulting from nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins or lipids, are found in plasma, vessel wall, and tissues and {{have been linked to}} the development of diabetic complications. The principal means through which AGEs exert their cellular effects is via specific cellular receptors, one of which, receptor for AGE (RAGE), is expressed by endothelium.

40|$|Caveolin- 1, the {{signature}} protein of endothelial cell caveolae, has many important functions in vascular cells. Caveolae {{are thought to}} be the transcellular pathway by which plasma proteins cross normal capillary endothelium, but, unexpectedly, cav- 1 −/− mice, which lack caveolae, have increased permeability to plasma albumin. The acute increase in vascular permeability induced by agents such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A occurs through venules, not capillaries, and particularly through the vesiculo-vacuolar organelle (VVO), a unique structure composed of numerous interconnecting vesicles and vacuoles that together span the venular endothelium from lumen to ablumen. Furthermore, the hyperpermeable blood vessels found in pathological angiogenesis, mother vessels, are derived from venules. The present experiments made use of cav- 1 −/− mice to investigate the relationship between caveolae and VVOs and the roles of caveolin- 1 in VVO structure in the acute vascular <b>hyperpermeability</b> induced by VEGF-A and in pathological angiogenesis and associated chronic vascular <b>hyperpermeability.</b> We found that VVOs expressed caveolin- 1 variably but, in contrast to caveolae, were present in normal numbers and with apparently unaltered structure in cav- 1 −/− mice. Nonetheless, VEGF-A-induced <b>hyperpermeability</b> was strikingly reduced in cav- 1 −/− mice, as was pathological angiogenesis and associated chronic vascular <b>hyperpermeability,</b> whether induced by VEGF-A 164 or by a tumor.

Here we show that altering endothelial cell heparan sulfate biosynthesis in vivo decreases <b>hyperpermeability</b> induced by both VEGF 165 and VEGF 121. Because VEGF 121 does not bind heparan sulfate, the requirement for heparan sulfate suggested that it interacted with VEGF receptors rather than the ligand.

Furthermore, the number of heparan sulfate-VEGFR 2 complexes increased in response to both VEGF 165 and VEGF 121. Genetic or heparin lyase-mediated alteration of endothelial heparan sulfate attenuated phosphorylation of VEGFR 2 in response to VEGF 165 and VEGF 121, suggesting that the functional VEGF receptor complex contains heparan sulfate.

We tested the hypotheses that the expression of eNOS and eNOS endocytosis by caveolae are fundamental for appropriate signaling mechanisms in inflammatory endothelial permeability to macromolecules. We used bovine coronary postcapillary venular endothelial cells (CVECs) because these cells are derived from the microvascular segment responsible for the transport of macromolecules in inflammation. We stimulated CVECs with platelet-activating factor (PAF) at 100 nM and measured eNOS phosphorylation, NO production, and CVEC monolayer permeability to FITC-dextran 70 KDa (Dx- 70). PAF translocated eNOS from plasma membrane to cytosol, induced changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme, and increased NO production from 4. 3 ± 3. 8 to 467 ± 22. 6 nM. PAF elevated CVEC monolayer permeability to FITC-Dx- 70 from 3. 4 ± 0. 3 × 10 − 6 to 8. 5 ± 0. 4 × 10 − 6 cm/s. The depletion of endogenous eNOS with small interfering RNA abolished PAF-induced <b>hyperpermeability,</b> demonstrating that the expression of eNOS is required for inflammatory <b>hyperpermeability</b> responses.

Exposure of bEnd. 3 monolayers to 1 hour OGD+ 23 hours RO exacerbated <b>hyperpermeability</b> relative to 1 hour OGD, which was associated with decreased expression levels of occludin and ZO- 1, but no change in cell viability or caspase- 3. 4 hours OGD + 23 hours RO exacerbated <b>hyperpermeability,</b> decreased expression levels of tight junction proteins, decreased cell viability, and increased caspase- 3 expression. Thus, bEnd. 3 cells exhibit <b>hyperpermeability,</b> a loss of tight junction proteins, and undergo cell death, after exposure to prolonged periods of OGD. Moreover, they exhibit exacerbated <b>hyperpermeability,</b> a loss of tight junction proteins, and increased expression of caspase- 3 after OGD + RO. These findings will facilitate the use of this cell line in studies of BBB disruption and for the testing of therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Microvascular <b>hyperpermeability</b> {{that occurs}} {{at the level of}} the blood-brain barrier (BBB) often leads to vasogenic brain edema and {{elevated}} intracranial pressure following traumatic brain injury (TBI). At a cellular level, tight junction proteins (TJPs) between neighboring endothelial cells maintain the integrity of the BBB via TJ associated proteins particularly, zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) that binds to the transmembrane TJPs and actin cytoskeleton intracellularly. The pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) as well as the proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) are key mediators of trauma-associated brain edema. Recent studies indicate that melatonin a pineal hormone directly binds to MMP- 9 and also might act as its endogenous inhibitor. We hypothesized that melatonin treatment will provide protection against TBI-induced BBB <b>hyperpermeability</b> via MMP- 9 inhibition. Rat brain microvascular endothelial cells grown as monolayers were used as an in vitro model of the BBB and a mouse model of TBI using a controlled cortical impactor was used for all in vivo studies. IL- 1 β (10 ng/mL; 2 hours) -induced endothelial monolayer <b>hyperpermeability</b> was significantly attenuated by melatonin (10 μg/mL; 1 hour), GM 6001 (broad spectrum MMP inhibitor; 10 μM; 1 hour), MMP- 9 inhibitor- 1 (MMP- 9 specific inhibitor; 5 nM; 1 hour) or MMP- 9 siRNA transfection (48 hours) in vitro. Melatonin and MMP- 9 inhibitor- 1 pretreatment attenuated IL- 1 β-induced MMP- 9 activity, loss of ZO- 1 junctional integrity and f-actin stress fiber formation. IL- 1 β treatment neither affected ZO- 1 protein or mRNA expression or cell viability. Acute melatonin treatment attenuated BBB <b>hyperpermeability</b> in a mouse controlled cortical impact model of TBI in vivo. In conclusion, one of the protective effects of melatonin against BBB <b>hyperpermeability</b> occurs due to enhanced BBB integrity via MMP- 9 inhibition. In addition, acute melatonin treatment provides protection against BBB <b>hyperpermeability</b> in a mouse model of TBI indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for brain edema when established in humans...|$|E
40|$|Histamine is a {{mediator}} of allergic inflammation released mainly from mast cells. Although histamine strongly increases vascular permeability, its precise mechanism under in vivo situation remains unknown. We here attempted to reveal how histamine induces vascular <b>hyperpermeability</b> {{focusing on the}} key regulators of vascular permeability, blood flow and endothelial barrier. Degranulation of mast cells by antigen-stimulation or histamine treatment induced vascular <b>hyperpermeability</b> and tissue swelling in mouse ears. These were abolished by histamine H 1 receptor antagonism. Intravital imaging showed that histamine dilated vasculature, increased blood flow, while it induced <b>hyperpermeability</b> in venula. Whole-mount staining showed that histamine disrupted endothelial barrier formation of venula indicated by changes in vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) localization at endothelial cell junction. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) by L-NAME or vasoconstriction by phenylephrine strongly inhibited the histamine-induced blood flow increase and <b>hyperpermeability</b> without changing the VE-cadherin localization. In vitro, measurements of trans-endothelial electrical resistance of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) showed that histamine disrupted endothelial barrier. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), NOS attenuated the histamine-induced barrier disruption. These observations suggested that histamine increases vascular permeability mainly by nitric oxide (NO) -dependent vascular dilation and subsequent blood flow increase and maybe partially by PKC/ROCK/NO-dependent endothelial barrier disruption...|$|E
40|$|Focal {{adhesion}} kinase (FAK) {{is known}} to mediate endothelial cell adhesion and migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The {{aim of this study}} was to explore a potential role for FAK in VEGF regulation of microvascular endothelial barrier function. The apparent permeability coefficient of albumin (Pa) was measured in intact isolated porcine coronary venules. Treating the vessels with VEGF induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in Pa. Inhibition of FAK through direct delivery of FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) into venular endothelium did not alter basal barrier function but significantly attenuated VEGF-elicited <b>hyperpermeability.</b> Furthermore, cultured human umbilical vein endothelial monolayers displayed a similar <b>hyperpermeability</b> response to VEGF which was greatly attenuated by FRNK. Western blot analysis showed that VEGF promoted FAK phosphorylation in a time course correlating with that of venular <b>hyperpermeability.</b> The phosphorylation response was blocked by FRNK treatment. In addition, VEGF stimulation caused a significant morphological change of FAK from a punctate pattern to an elongated, dash-like staining that aligned with the longitudinal axis of the cells. Taken together, the results suggest that FAK contributes to VEGF-elicited vascular <b>hyperpermeability.</b> Phosphorylation of FAK may play an important role in the signal transduction of vascular barrier response to VEGF...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{important}} regulator of blood flow, but its role in permeability is still challenged. We tested in vivo the hypotheses that: (a) endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is not essential for regulation of baseline permeability; (b) eNOS is essential for <b>hyperpermeability</b> responses in inflammation; and (c) molecular inhibition of eNOS with caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain (AP-Cav) reduces eNOS-regulated <b>hyperpermeability.</b> We used eNOS-deficient (eNOS−/−) mice and their wild-type control as experimental animals, platelet-activating factor (PAF) at 10 − 7 m as the test pro-inflammatory agent, and integrated optical intensity (IOI) as an index of microvascular permeability. PAF increased permeability in wild-type cremaster muscle from a baseline of 2. 4 ± 2. 2 to a peak net value of 84. 4 ± 2. 7 units, while the corresponding values in cremaster muscle of eNOS−/− mice were 1. 0 ± 0. 3 and 15. 6 ± 7. 7 units (P < 0. 05). Similarly, PAF increased IOI in the mesentery of wild-type mice but much less in the mesentery of eNOS−/− mice. PAF increased IOI to comparable values in the mesenteries of wild-type mice and those lacking the gene for inducible NOS (iNOS). Administration of AP-Cav blocked the microvascular <b>hyperpermeability</b> responses to 10 − 7 m PAF. We conclude that: (1) baseline permeability {{does not depend on}} eNOS; (2) eNOS and NO are integral elements of the signalling pathway for the <b>hyperpermeability</b> response to PAF; (3) iNOS does not affect either baseline permeability or <b>hyperpermeability</b> responses to PAF; and (4) caveolin- 1 inhibits eNOS regulation of microvascular permeability in vivo. Our results establish eNOS as {{an important}} regulator of microvascular permeability in inflammation...|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{oxidative}} stress, decreased antioxidant capacity, {{and enhanced}} cellular calcium levels are initial factors that cause endothelial cell (EC) <b>hyperpermeability,</b> which represents a crucial {{event in the}} pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4) strongly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced <b>hyperpermeability</b> through maintaining the normal expression of VE-cadherin and β-catenin. This effect was mainly mediated by a specific LXA 4 receptor. LXA 4 could also obviously inhibit LPS-induced elevation of the cellular calcium level and up-regulation of the transient receptor potential protein family C 1, an important calcium channel in ECs. At the same time, LXA 4 strongly blocked LPS-triggered reactive oxidative species production, while it promoted {{the expression of the}} NF-E 2 related factor 2 (Nrf 2) protein. Our findings demonstrate that LXA 4 could prevent the EC <b>hyperpermeability</b> induced by LPS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), under which the possible mechanism is through Nrf 2 as well as Ca 2 +-sensitive pathways...|$|E
