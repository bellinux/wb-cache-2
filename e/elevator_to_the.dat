5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train {{on the top of the}} tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
5|$|The <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{commuter}} rail platform was also temporarily {{out of service}} for maintenance during the same period; a shuttle bus ran between Harvard, Porter and Waltham. The Red Line elevator was returned to service on June 22, 2012, and the {{commuter rail}} elevator returned to service on July 30, 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. The <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 the United States {{government}} {{forced the}} railroad {{to move out}} of its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Although Harrison threatened to take the company headquarters to Atlanta, in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square. Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building in the middle of 1929.|$|E
5|$|The Rockaway-bound {{platform}} has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and one exit-only turnstile {{leading to}} a short staircase that goes down to the intersection of 159th Road and 103rd Street. The Brooklyn-bound platform has a set of emergency doors leading {{to the parking lot}} just north of the AirTrain JFK station; they are normally locked, but were in use from December 2012 to May 2013 as a connection to a temporary shuttle bus service instituted after Hurricane Sandy. Both platforms have stairs, escalators, and an <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> headhouse above the platforms.|$|E
5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he scanned the area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top floor.|$|E

25|$|From the assembler, the {{assembled}} line moves via the first <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> justification vise. The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which {{are set to}} the desired line width. The spacebands are now expanded to justify the line. When the line is justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal which will prevent the molten type metal from escaping when the line is cast.|$|E
50|$|Once mixed, {{the coal}} would {{continue}} up on another system of bucket <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coal distribution conveyor belt that {{ran along the}} top of the boiler building. From this conveyor, the coal would fall into the loaders and from there was directed through downspouts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rotating grate conveyor inside the boiler, where it burned slowly, producing a temperature inside the boiler of approximately 1200°C.|$|R
5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. One tree was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of <b>the</b> {{building}} <b>to</b> reinforce <b>the</b> symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open stairwells.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the wing}} {{trailing}} edge {{and the end}} of the lower girder the rear fuselage was a tapering, vertically orientated, two bay Warren truss, ending at a vertical cross member which supported the rudder. The triangular tailplane and fin were mounted on the horizontal upper fuselage beam and the straight edged rudder extended down through a cut-out between <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower beam.|$|R
25|$|Underneath the Waldorf-Astoria (and {{connected}} to Grand Central via the tracks) {{is a private}} platform, Track 61, which was built mainly for former United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He would travel into the city using his personal train into Track 61, then take a specially designed <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface. It has been used occasionally since Roosevelt's death. This platform {{was part of the}} original design of the Waldorf Astoria. It was mentioned in The New York Times in 1929 and first used by General Pershing in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Each Nike battery {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} areas; IFC, LA and general. The LA consisted to a maximum of four launching sections, each section {{consisted of}} an underground storage area, an elevator to move missiles to and from the surface launchers, and four aboveground firing locations. One of these locations was directly above the elevator, the others were reached by manually pushing the missiles off the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> launcher along rails. The LA also had a control van to control and monitor the LA activities and maintenance facilities.|$|E
25|$|He {{took the}} <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{executive}} reception {{area on the}} third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed {{down the stairs to the}} pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} behaves as {{in direct}} mode: the autotrim feature {{is turned off}} {{and there is a}} direct response of <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sidestick inputs. The horizontal stabilizer is set to 4° up but manual settings (e.g. for center of gravity) override this setting. After the wheels leave the ground, a 5-second transition occurs where normal law - flight mode takes over from ground mode.|$|R

25|$|Kileak: The DNA Imperative is a first-person shooter, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} an International Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) polar operative Matt Coda in an armored SJ 107 assault suit. The player can advance and retreat, move {{from side to side}} and rotate the camera in any direction. The game is set in a South Pole observation base, which is composed of floors connected by elevators. On each floor, the player must find an elevator in order to proceed to the level below. The requirements are varied between floors, with many levels requiring the use of key cards to open locked doors, while some doors are opened by puzzle solving. On reaching the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next floor, the player can save their progress to a memory card that fits into the accompanying PlayStation.|$|E
25|$|Wright turned 80 {{shortly after}} World War II ended, yet {{remained}} busy. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City occupied Wright for 16years (1943–1959) and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on Fifth Avenue; its interior {{is similar to}} the inside of a seashell. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.|$|E
25|$|Back at the garden, Lucy is {{planting}} seeds {{around the}} well, when Jacinda arrives {{to take her}} to Bainbridge Island across the lake, so they can be together and escape from Victoria. When they arrive at the town line, Jacinda's car breaks down and the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> docks has been closed, which Lucy believes means they're trapped in Hyperion Heights, much like the residents of Storybrooke were. At the police station, Victoria interrupts Henry and Rogers to ask the officer to help find Lucy and Jacinda, believing that Henry knows something. Victoria's daughter Ivy and Officer Rogers find the pair, who have decided to stay and fight Victoria's claim. As Ivy gives Rogers Lucy's Once Upon a Time book, and insists that it be thrown away, Rogers catches sight of a specific page featuring a picture of Emma Swan.|$|E

25|$|It is {{uncertain}} which Allied unit {{was first to}} reach the Kehlsteinhaus; several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th {{went as far as}} the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kehlsteinhaus, with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Also, elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.|$|E
25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking. The driveway {{in front of this}} entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof. But he touched a power line as he climbed off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E
500|$|The first missile was radar-controlled and {{proximity}} fuzed, and detonated [...] {{behind the}} aircraft. Sending fragments forward, it either severed or unraveled the crossover cable {{from the left}} inboard <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right elevator. This, with damage {{to one of the}} four hydraulic systems, caused KAL007 to ascend from , at which point the autopilot was disengaged.|$|E
50|$|Like earlier Wibault designs, the Wib 210 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with {{a largely}} Duralumin structure and clad with narrow aluminium strips applied longitudinally. Its wings, mounted with mild dihedral, were straight edged and tapered with blunt wing tips. Full span ailerons were fitted. The triangular tailplane carried split elevators and the fin was angular, with a swept leading edge and square tip, bearing a rudder which extended down between <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> keel.|$|R

50|$|After {{political}} {{requests and}} lobbying {{efforts by the}} local community, the station underwent extensive renovation from 1990 to 1993 with a new bus shed and underground connections, including a crossover mezzanine between the Red Line platforms. Work began in September 1990; the station was closed nights and some weekends until March 1991 during the heaviest work. Construction on the busway finished in January 1994. The rebuilt station incorporates <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platforms <b>to</b> provide full handicapped accessibility.|$|R
