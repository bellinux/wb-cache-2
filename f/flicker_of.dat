25|$|A rapid start ballast applies voltage and heats the cathodes simultaneously. It {{provides}} superior lamp {{life and}} more cycle life, but uses slightly more energy as the electrodes in {{each end of}} the lamp continue to consume heating power as the lamp operates. Again, although popular in 100-120volt countries for lamps of 40W and above, rapid start is sometimes used in other countries particularly where the <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> switch start systems is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E

5000|$|... 4th {{generation}} of Retro-Fit LED tubes The 4th {{generation of}} LED tubes focuses on solving well-being related issues of general lighting. Recently, several studies aimed at <b>flickering</b> <b>of</b> electric lights have been conducted. According to these studies, the <b>flickering</b> <b>of</b> traditional fluorescent lamps can cause brain stress and anxiety. The 4th generation of LED tubes offers {{a solution to}} the flickering problem. The flickering is measured using so-called flicker index or flicker percentage value. Elimination <b>of</b> <b>flickering</b> allows high-quality video recording and slow motion capture, as well as certain machine vision applications in premises equipped with flicker-free lights.|$|R
25|$|An instant start ballast {{does not}} preheat the electrodes, instead using a {{relatively}} high voltage (~600V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted {{from the surface of}} the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.|$|E

500|$|The Bunnygraphs, as a genre, were {{representative}} of the cinema of the period, and were very successful, making Bunny the first American comic film star and Finch the first female star comedian. A Cure for Pokeritis, released February 23, 1912, was individually well-received, including in showings outside the United States. The Thames Star, a New Zealand newspaper, described the film as [...] "screamingly funny". After John Bunny's death, interest in his films led Vitagraph in 1917 to announce the re-release of this film (retitled A Sure Cure for Pokeritis), along with many of his other works, as [...] "Favorite Film Features". However, the comedy style of A Cure for Pokeritis has not aged well, especially in contrast to Mack Sennett's slapstick films and the works of later comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. According to film scholars Donald McCaffrey and Christopher Jacobs, modern viewers [...] "will hardly get a <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> a smile" [...] from the film, despite the skill of its actors.|$|E

[...] Michael Farr commented on the [...] "distinct quality and special popularity" [...] of The Black Island. He thought that the inclusion of many airplanes and a television in the first version was symptomatic of Hergé's interest in innovation and modernism. Commenting on the differences between the third version of the comic and the earlier two, he thought that the latter was [...] "strongly representative" [...] of the artistic talents of Studios Hergé in the 1960s, but that it was nevertheless inferior, because it had replaced the [...] "spontaneity and poetry" [...] of the original with [...] "over-detailed and fussily accurate" [...] illustrations.|$|E

The tale starts by detailing how a man named Eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death {{at the side of}} Loch nan Dobhran, on the west coast of Argyll. Some months later, Phemie, Eachann's girlfriend, is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch, which make her think of Murdoch, her former paramour. While she sat dreaming of Eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near the loch, she sensed the <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> a shadow behind her, except this time it was Murdoch. He promptly overpowered her by enveloping her in a blanket and tying her hands. At that point, a water bull came to Phemie's rescue by knocking Murdoch to the ground. The bull then knelt down allowing Phemie to get on its back, before transporting her {{at the speed of light}} back to the home of her mother. The bull disappeared never to be seen again but a [...] "voice was heard in the air calling out loudly". The verse heard was in Gaelic, and translates as: ...|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{had four}} film {{releases}} in 2006. She {{first appeared in}} All the King's Men, a political thriller set in 1940s Louisiana, featuring Sean Penn and Jude Law. She played the supporting part of the love interest to Law's character. The film received negative reviews for lacking political insight and narrative cohesiveness, and failed to recoup its US$55 million investment. Her next release, the drama Little Children, was far better received. Based on the novel of the same name, the film {{tells the story of}} Sarah Pierce, an unhappy housewife who has a torrid affair with a married neighbour (played by Patrick Wilson). Winslet was challenged by the role of an uncaring mother, as she did not understand or respect her character's actions. Scenes requiring her to be hostile towards the child actress playing her daughter proved upsetting for her to film. Having given birth to two children, Winslet was made anxious by the sex scenes in which she had to be nude; she took on the challenge to present a positive image for women who did not have [...] "perfect" [...] bodies. A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that Winslet successfully [...] "registers every <b>flicker</b> <b>of</b> Sarah’s pride, self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and concern". With another Academy Award for Best Actress nomination, Winslet, at age 31, became the youngest actress to accrue five Oscar nominations.|$|E
