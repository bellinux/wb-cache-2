To this aim, the process of <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cell</b> formation is studied under a systems biology point of view. By relying on statistical physics techniques, we translate the essential ingredients and mechanisms of the genetic circuit into a set of differential equations that describes the continuous time evolution of combined nitrogen, PatS, HetR and NtcA concentrations. The detailed analysis of these equations gives insight into the single cell dynamics. On the other hand, the inclusion of diffusion and noisy conditions allows simulating the formation of heterocysts patterns in cyanobacteria strains. The time evolution of relevant component concentrations are calculated allowing for a comparison with experiments. Finally, we discuss the validity and the possible improvements of the model.

However, the significance of N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria in past nitrogen cycling is difficult to establish as their preservation potential is relatively poor and specific biological markers are presently lacking. Heterocystous N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria synthesize unique long-chain glycolipids in the cell envelope covering the <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cell</b> to protect the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase enzyme. We found that these heterocyst glycolipids are remarkably well preserved in (ancient) lacustrine and marine sediments, unambiguously indicating the (past) presence of N 2 -fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria. Analysis of Pleistocene sediments of the eastern Mediterranean Sea showed that heterocystous cyanobacteria, likely as epiphytes in symbiosis with planktonic diatoms, were particularly abundant during deposition of sapropels. Eocene Arctic Ocean sediments deposited at a time of large Azolla blooms contained glycolipids typical for heterocystous cyanobacteria presently living in symbiosis with the freshwater fern Azolla, indicating that this symbiosis already existed in that time.

Azolla is known as a small water fern which can fix nitrogen through the symbiotic association with the blue green algae Anabaena. Experimental studies were carried out in the glass house, investigating the growth of Azolla using different levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the media. The experiment used 12 treatments with 3 levels of nitrogen (0, 5, and 10 mg atom/L) and 4 levels of phosphorus (0, 10, 20, and 30 mg atom/l) in a factorial design with 3 replicates.

The alga had not been previously adapted under hydrogen gas and hence the hydrogen evolution occurred entirely within the nitrogen-fixing heterocyst cells; organisms grown in a fixed nitrogen source, and which were therefore devoid of heterocysts, did not produce hydrogen under these conditions. Use of the inhibitor dichlorophenyl-dimethyl urea showed that hydrogen formation was directly dependent on photosystem I and only indirectly dependent on photosystem II, consistent with heterocysts being the site of hydrogen formation. The uncouplers carbonyl cyanide chlorophenyl hydrazone and dinitrophenol almost completely inhibited hydrogen formation, indicating that the process occurs almost entirely via the adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate-dependent nitrogenase. Salicylaldoxime also inhibited hydrogen formation, again illustrating the necessity of photophosphorylation. Whereas hydrogen formation could usually only be observed in anaerobic, dinitrogen-free environments, incubation {{in the presence of the}} dinitrogen-fixing inhibitor carbon monoxide plus the hydrogenase inhibitor acetylene resulted in significant formation of hydrogen even in air. Hydrogen formation was studied in batch cultures as a function of age of the cultures and also as a function of culture concentration, in both cases the cultures being harvested in logarithmic growth. Hydrogen evolution (and acetylene-reducing activity) exhibited a distinct maximum with respect to the age of the cultures. Finally, the levels of the protective enzyme, superoxide dismutase, were measured in <b>heterocyst</b> and vegetative <b>cell</b> fractions of the organism; the level was twice as high in <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cells</b> (2. 3 units/mg of protein) as in vegetative cells (1. 1 units/mg of protein).

40|$|Approximately 50 % of {{the global}} natural {{fixation}} of nitrogen occurs in the oceans supporting a considerable {{part of the new}} primary production. Virtually all nitrogen fixation in the ocean occurs in the tropics and subtropics where the surface water temperature is 25 °C or higher. It is attributed almost exclusively to cyanobacteria. This is remarkable firstly because diazotrophic cyanobacteria are found in other environments irrespective of temperature and secondly because primary production in temperate and cold oceans is generally limited by nitrogen. Cyanobacteria are oxygenic phototrophic organisms that evolved a variety of strategies protecting nitrogenase from oxygen inactivation. Free-living diazotrophic cyanobacteria in the ocean are of the non-heterocystous type, namely the filamentous Trichodesmium and the unicellular groups A–C. I will argue that warm water is a prerequisite for these diazotrophic organisms because of the low-oxygen solubility and high rates of respiration allowing the organism to maintain anoxic conditions in the nitrogen-fixing cell. Heterocystous cyanobacteria are abundant in freshwater and brackish environments in all climatic zones. The <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cell</b> envelope is a tuneable gas diffusion barrier that optimizes the influx of both oxygen and nitrogen, while maintaining anoxic conditions inside the cell.

The transition from vegetative cells to heterocysts requires marked metabolic and morphological changes. We show that a trimeric pore-forming outer membrane �-barrel protein belonging to the TolC family, Alr 2887, is up-regulated in developing heterocysts and is essential for diazotrophic growth. Mutants defective in Alr 2887 did not form the specific glycolipid layer of the <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cell</b> wall, which is necessary to protect nitrogenase from external oxygen. Comparison of the glycolipid contents of wild-type and mutant cells indicated that the protein {{is not involved in}} the synthesis of glycolipids but might instead serve as an exporter for the glycolipid moieties or enzymes involved in glycolipid attachment. We propose that Alr 2887, together with an ABC transporter like DevBCA, is part of a protein export system essential for assembly of the heterocyst glycolipid layer. We designate the alr 2887 gene hgdD (heterocyst glycolipid deposition protein).

In the marine cyanobacteria Nostoc muscorum and Calothrix sp., we detected the same glycolipids as found in freshwater representatives of these genera.

The different glycolipid composition of the marine endosymbotic heterocystous cyanobacteria compared to their free-living counterparts may be an adaptation to the high intracellular O- 2 concentrations within their host.

Both strains contained an overall similar composition of heterocyst glycolipids, with 1 -(O-hexose) - 3, 25 -hexacosanediols (HG 26 diols) and 1 -(O-hexose) - 3 -keto- 25 -hexacosanols (HG 26 keto-ols) dominating minor quantities of 1 -(O-hexose) - 3, 27 -octacosanediols (HG 28 diols) and 1 -(O-hexose) - 3 -keto- 27 -octacosanols (HG 28 keto-ols). The relative proportion of HG diols vs. HG keto-ols increased with increasing growth temperature, which was quantitatively expressed as HGI 26 (heterocyst glycolipid index of 26 carbons). Values of the index decreased from 0. 30 to 0. 12 in Nostoc CCY 9926 and from 0. 18 to 0. 10 in Anabaena CCY 9613 over the temperature interval investigated.

Species {{of the families}} Nostocaceae and Rivulariaceae, capable of biosynthesising heterocysts, contained a suite of glycolipids consisting of sugar moieties glycosidically bound to long-chain diols, triols, keto-ols and keto-diols. The aglycone moiety consisted of C 26 or C 28 carbon-chains with hydroxyl groups at the C- 3, ω- 1 or ω- 3 positions. Keto-ols and keto-diols contained their carbonyl functionalities likely at the C- 3 position. These compounds were absent in all analysed unicellular and filamentous non-heterocystous cyanobacteria and in the heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena CCY 9922 grown {{in the presence of}} combined nitrogen, supporting the idea that the long-chain glycolipids are an important and unique structural component of the <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cell</b> envelope. The glycolipids 1 -(O-hexose) - 3, 25 -hexacosanediol and 1 -(O-hexose) - 3 -keto- 25 -hexacosanol were ubiquitously distributed in species of the family Nostocaceae. 1 -(O-hexose) - 3, 25, 27 -octacosanetriol and 1 -(O-hexose) - 3 -keto- 25, 27 -octacosanediol were dominant in members of the Calothrix genus, while traces of those compounds were detected only in one species of the Nostocaceae family. Their distribution in heterocystous cyanobacteria suggests a chemotaxonomic relevance that might allow distinguishing between species of different genera. Culture experiments indicate that the amount of keto-ols and keto-diols decreases relatively to their corresponding diols and triols counterparts with increasing temperature.

40|$|Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is a filamentous, {{multicellular}} cyanobacterium {{that allows}} {{for the study of}} developmental factors that lead to the patterned differentiation of cell types. When given a source of fixed nitrogen, Anabaena grows in long strands of identical vegetative cells, all of which carry out photosynthesis to capture energy and fix carbon for the organism. However, under nitrogen-deplete conditions, approximately every tenth vegetative cell of a strand will terminally differentiate into a heterocyst, a non-dividing cell type with the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. This cell-type specific cessation of division indicates that there is a regulatory link between binary fission and heterocyst differentiation. In Anabaena, the location of the division plane for binary fission is determined by the interaction of MinC, MinD, MinE, and FtsZ. It is unknown how cell division is inhibited in heterocysts, but {{it has been shown that}} heterocysts lack polymerized FtsZ rings (Z-rings) normally responsible for for cytokinesis. To begin to understand FtsZ loss in heterocysts, mutant strains of Anabaena that displayed abnormal heterocyst morphology were screened for the presence of Z-rings. In mutant strains of interest, a copy of ftsZ, translationally fused with a yellow fluorescent protein (yfp), was introduced into the genome, and the cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The results suggest that hetP may be responsible for inhibiting Z-ring formation in heterocysts, thus preventing division. Through a bacterial two-hybrid system and β-galactosidase assay, the interactions of HetP, Min proteins, and FtsZ have been qualitatively and quantitatively assessed.

Relative to the wild type, in a hetC mutant differentiation resulted in a reduced number of heterocysts that were incapable of nitrogen fixation, but deletion of patS or hetN restored heterocyst number and function in a hetC background. These epistasis results suggest that HetC is necessary for conferring self-immunity to the inhibitors on differentiating cells. Nine hours after induction of differentiation, HetC was required for neither induction of transcription of patS nor intercellular transfer of the patS-encoded signal to neighboring cells. Conversely, in strains lacking HetC, the patS- and hetN-encoded signals were not transferred from <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cells</b> to adjacent vegetative cells.

In response to nitrogen deprivation, Anabaena differentiates nitrogen-fixing heterocyst cells in a periodic pattern. Anabaena research has practical applications in human health, sustainable agriculture, and biofuel production. This study aimed to characterize novel interactions to refine the current understanding of Anabaena development. Investigations were performed to elucidate the hetF-dependent activation of differentiation. A novel genetic regulatory network involving hetF, a CHF class protease, and the negative regulator patU 3 and other developmental genes was identified. A component of the hetZ-patU 5 -patU 3 gene cluster, PatU 3 was shown to directly interact with HetZ, another activator of differentiation. Genetic epistasis analysis determined that PatU 3 suppressed positive regulation by HetZ and HetR. These negative feedback loops explain the elevated HetR-GFP concentrations in hetF-dependent strains despite the paradoxical absence of heterocysts. The HetF-dependent pathway may act as a control point prior to commitment to the <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cell</b> fate. Lateral inhibition by PatS and HetN, which both contain the same RGSGR pentapeptide sequence, involves regulation by HetR. The unique domains present in the structure of HetR may relate to its activity as a transcriptional activator. In this study, genetic and cytological approaches were used to identify residues in HetR necessary for interaction with PatS, HetN and RGSGR. A related investigation demonstrated that the RGSGR-pentapeptide derived from HetN directs pattern formation by direct cytoplasmic exchange.

Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is a filamentous cyanobacterium capable of differentiating morphologically distinct nitrogen-fixing <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cells</b> in a periodic pattern. While heterocyst development has been shown to require proper peptidoglycan remodeling, the role of peptidoglycan synthesis has remained unclear. Here we report the identification of two peptidoglycan synthesis genes, murC (alr 5065) and murB (alr 5066), as required for heterocyst development. The murC and murB genes are predicted to encode a UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase and a UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase, respectively, and we confirm enzymatic function through complementation of Escherichia coli strains deficient for these enzymes. Cells depleted of either murC or murB expression failed to differentiate heterocysts under normally inducing conditions and displayed decreased filament integrity. To identify the stage(s) of development affected by murC or murB depletion, the spatial distribution of expression of the patterning marker gene, patS, was examined. Whereas murB depletion did not affect the pattern of patS expression, murC depletion led to aberrant expression of patS in all cells of the filament. Finally, expression of gfp controlled by the region of DNA immediately upstream of murC was enriched in differentiating cells and was repressed by the transcription factor NtcA. Collectively, the data in this work provide evidence for a direct link between peptidoglycan synthesis and the maintenance of a biological pattern in a multicellular organism.

N. punctiforme also forms nitrogen-fixing symbiotic associations; its plant partners influence the differentiation and behavior of hormogonia and heterocysts. N. punctiforme is genetically tractable and its genome sequence is nearly complete. Thus, the regulatory circuits of three cellular differentiation events and symbiotic interactions of N. punctiforme can be experimentally analyzed by functional genomics...|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{input of}} available nitrogen (N) in boreal forest ecosystems originates from moss-associated cyanobacteria, which fix unavailable atmospheric N 2, {{contribute to the}} soil N pool, and thereby support forest productivity. Alongside climate warming, increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are expected in Canada’s boreal region over the next century, yet {{little is known about}} the combined effects of these factors on N fixation by forest floor cyanobacteria. Here we assess changes in N fixation in a common forest floor, moss-associated cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme Hariot, under elevated CO 2 conditions over 30 days and warming combined with elevated CO 2 over 90 days. We measured rates of growth and changes in the number of specialized N 2 fixing <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cells,</b> as well as the overall N fixing activity of the cultures. Elevated CO 2 stimulated growth and N fixation overall, but this result was influenced by the growth stage of the cyanobacteria, which in turn was influenced by our temperature treatments. Taken together, climate change factors of warming and elevated CO 2 are expected to stimulate N 2 fixation by moss-associated cyanobacteria in boreal forest systems...|$|R
40|$|Under {{conditions}} of limited fixed-nitrogen, some filamentous cyanobacteria develop a regular pattern of <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cells</b> that fix nitrogen {{for the remaining}} vegetative cells. We examine three different heterocyst placement strategies by quantitatively modelling filament growth while varying both external fixed-nitrogen and leakage from the filament. We find {{that there is an}} optimum heterocyst frequency which maximizes the growth rate of the filament; the optimum frequency decreases as the external fixed-nitrogen concentration increases but increases as the leakage increases. In the presence of leakage, filaments implementing a local heterocyst placement strategy grow significantly faster than filaments implementing random heterocyst placement strategies. With no extracellular fixed-nitrogen, consistent with recent experimental studies of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the modelled heterocyst spacing distribution using our local heterocyst placement strategy is qualitatively similar to experimentally observed patterns. As external fixed-nitrogen is increased, the spacing distribution for our local placement strategy retains the same shape while the average spacing between heterocysts continuously increases.

40|$|Many {{filamentous}} cyanobacteria {{respond to}} the external cue of nitrogen scarcity by the differentiation of <b>heterocysts,</b> <b>cells</b> specialized in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in oxic environments. Heterocysts follow a spatial pattern along the filament of two heterocysts separated by ca. 10 – 15 vegetative cells performing oxygenic photosynthesis. HetR is a transcriptional regulator that directs heterocyst differentiation. In the model strain Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the HetR protein was observed in various oligomeric forms in vivo, including a tetramer that peaked with maximal hetR expression during differentiation. Tetramers were not detected in a hetR point mutant incapable of differentiation, but were conspicuous in an over-differentiating strain lacking the PatS inhibitor. In differentiated filaments the HetR tetramer was restricted to heterocysts, being undetectable in vegetative cells. HetR co-purified with RNA polymerase from Anabaena mainly as a tetramer. In vitro, purified recombinant HetR was distributed between monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers, and it was phosphorylated when incubated with (γ- 32 P) ATP. Phosphorylation and PatS hampered the accumulation of HetR tetramers and impaired HetR binding to DNA. In summary, tetrameric HetR appears to represent a functionally relevant form of HetR, whose abundance in the Anabaena filament could be negatively regulated by phosphorylation and by PatS.

40|$|AbstractUpon {{nitrogen}} step-down, some filamentous cyanobacteria differentiate <b>heterocysts,</b> <b>cells</b> specialized for dinitrogen fixation, {{a highly}} oxygen sensitive process. Aerobic respiration {{is one of}} the mechanisms responsible for a microaerobic environment in heterocysts and respiratory terminal oxidases are the key enzymes of the respiratory chains. We used Anabaena variabilis strain ATCC 29413, because it {{is one of the}} few heterocyst-forming facultatively chemoheterotrophic cyanobacteria amenable to genetic manipulation. Using PCR with degenerate primers, we found four gene loci for respiratory terminal oxidases, three of which code for putative cytochrome c oxidases and one whose genes are homologous to cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidases. One cytochrome c oxidase, Cox 2, was the only enzyme whose expression, tested by RT-PCR, was evidently up-regulated in diazotrophy, and therefore cloned, sequenced, and characterized. Up-regulation of Cox 2 was corroborated by Northern and primer extension analyses. Strains were constructed lacking Cox 1 (a previously characterized cytochrome c oxidase), Cox 2, or both, which all grew diazotrophically. In vitro cytochrome c oxidase and respiratory activities were determined in all strains, allowing for the first time to estimate the relative contributions to total respiration of the different respiratory electron transport branches under different external conditions. Especially adding fructose to the growth medium led to a dramatic enhancement of in vitro cytochrome c oxidation and in vivo respiratory activity without significantly influencing gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen-deprived {{filaments}} of wild-type or hetC Anabaena sp. produce respectively, at semiregular intervals, heterocysts and weakly fluorescent <b>cells.</b> Unlike <b>heterocysts,</b> {{the latter}} <b>cells</b> can divide and elongate, producing {{a pattern of}} spaced series of small cells. Because a hetR::gfp fusion is expressed most strongly in the small cells, we propose that these small cells represent a very early stage of heterocyst differentiation. hetC::gfp is expressed most strongly in proheterocysts and heterocysts.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} One {{of the most}} often distance metastasis site of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) is brain and the standard treatment of brain metastasis was radiotheraphy including whole brain irradiation (WBI) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). It has been reported that epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) had the active response in brain metastasis of lung cancer. In the present study, we reported one case of EGFR 19 el in cerebrospinal fluid tested by ARMS got partial response given erlotinib. Methods Cerebrospinal fluid was collected through lumbar puncture, then cast-off cells and EGFR mutation was analysed. Erlotinib was given with dose of 150 mg, qd. Objective response was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteriation in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v 1. 1 and adeverse events were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4. 0 (CTC AE v 4. 0). Results <b>Heterocyst</b> <b>cells</b> were found in cerebrospinal fluid and EGFR mutation was tested as 19 del. The patient achieved partial response (PR) of brain metastasis and the effective response in lung was stable disease (SD) after 4 weeks of erlotinib. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of brain metastasis was 10. 5 months and 11 months respectively. The main adverse event was rash (Grade I). Conclusion It was feasible to test EGFR mutation in cerebrospinal fluid and the combination of erlotinib with chemotheraphy would be an appropriate choice to those lung cancer patients who had brain metastasis harboring EGFR sensitive mutation...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} {{to a lack of}} environmental combined nitrogen, the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 differentiates nitrogen-fixing <b>heterocyst</b> <b>cells</b> in a periodic pattern. HetR is a transcription factor that coordinates the regulation of this developmental program. An inverted repeat-containing sequence in the hepA promoter required for proheterocyst-specific transcription was identified based on sequence similarity to a previously characterized binding site for HetR in the promoter of hetP. The binding affinity of HetR for the hepA site is roughly an order of magnitude lower than that for the hetP binding site. A BLAST search of the Anabaena genome identified 166 hepA-like sites that occur as single or tandem sites (two binding sites separated by 13 bp). The vast majority of these sites are present in predicted intergenic regions. HetR bound five representative single binding sites in vitro, and binding was abrogated by transversions in the binding sites that conserved the inverted repeat nature of the sites. Binding to four representative tandem sites was not observed. Transcriptional fusions of the green fluorescent protein gene gfp with putative promoter regions associated with the representative binding sites indicated that HetR could function as either an activator or repressor and that activation was cell-type specific. Taken together, we have expanded the direct HetR regulon and propose a model in which three categories of HetR binding sites, based on binding affinity and nucleotide sequence, contribute to three of the four phases of differentiation...|$|R
