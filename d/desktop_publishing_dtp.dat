40|$|This {{research}} project {{was directed to}} characterize the variables that govern {{the black and white}} reproduction process in a <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> enviroment (<b>DTP),</b> which in this case is formed by: a Macintosh II computer, a Mycrotek 300 A scanner as the inputing device and a LaserWriter as the outputting device. The specific goal of this research was to find the ideal settings of cell size and resolution for each type of black and white photographic image that would produce the best reproduction possible from the system. Two different experiments were performed, the first one using a gray scale and a resolution target as originals, showed the influence of the variables over the tone reproduction curve and the resolution of the system. The second test used three different images as originals, and their corresponding reproductions were rated by a selected group of judges, using the pair comparison technology for the evaluation. In addition to obtaining the best settings for each image, an analysis of the application of information theory to image evaluation was performed. The results found that the actual mathematical model needs to incorporate other factors such as the visual response of a human observer, to be considered as a valuable tool for quality assesment of a reproduction system...|$|R

40|$|This initial, {{descriptive}} study addressed the primary research question "What is {{a profile of}} <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> use in Indiana Corporations with 250 or more employees?" The problem {{that led to the}} study was the lack of information on the topic, and as an aid to business people in evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing.</b> The information compiled from the random telephone survey was intended to help put into perspective what systems and software were appropriate for certain public relations projects. A random telephone survey of 240 Indiana corporations was conducted in March 1988. The data gathered showed that only 31 of the 240 corporations contacted (13 percent) were using <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing.</b> Several conclusions could be drawn. There was a lack of understanding of the capabilities of <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> among many of those contacted as well as a lack of money to purchase a system and time to train a user. The quality of output capability in <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> at the time of the study was lower than most respondents wanted. A profile of the 31 corporations (13 percent) using <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> would typify them as manufacturing companies who have used <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> one year or less and have an average publications budget of $ 120, 949. They are using <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> to produce newsletters primarily. They did not have a knowledge of <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> before purchasing the system, but would recommend its use to others. They cite increased control and time savings as the biggest benefits of owning and using <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing,</b> with an average time savings of 30 %. They typically use the Macintosh computer with Pagemaker and Microsoft Word software. The manager using the system has been in his position five years or less (83. 9 %) and has an average age of 34. The maximum age among these managers was 47 years old. A profile of the non-users would read as follows: Of the 240 Indiana corporations with 250 or more employees surveyed, 152 (63. 3 percent) did not use <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing.</b> The average publications budget at these companies was $ 103, 058. Most of the non-users were manufacturing corporations. Their managers in charge of publications had been in their position five years or less (66. 4 %). The average age for those managers was 40, with the maximum being 64 years old. While the publication they produced most was the newsletter, they cited the following reasons for not using desktop publishing: saw no cost benefits for their publications and did not think the output quality was high enough.

50|$|The {{front-end}} of the web-to-print {{process is}} similar to <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> (<b>DTP)</b> in that individuals or graphic designers use desktop publishing software to create pre-defined templates. These templates are then posted online for later customization by end-users and automated production by a print house or commercial printer. Unlike DTP, web-to-print can bypass the use of traditional design tools by the end-user as the templates utilized in this process are based upon a WYSIWYG (often browser-based) interface that can be edited and approved by a client and by the print house without a graphic designer’s assistance.|$|E

50|$|Together, the {{hardware}} and software provided a low-cost video editing suite for a few thousand U.S. dollars that rivaled the output of professional systems costing ten times as much at the time.

The Video Toaster won the Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in 1993.
