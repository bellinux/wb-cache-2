25|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors are}} higher than on normal buses so that passengers can only board from designated shelters. The doors employ automated swing and slide mechanisms which is manually controlled by the driver. Currently, the slide mechanism is being phased out, with all new buses being equipped with swing doors. Protective full-height acrylic glass barriers are installed behind passenger seats close to the sliding door mechanism. Although, feeder routes uses low street-level doors. This is achieved with the driver's door {{at the front of}} the bus on big buses and a pair of designated hydaulic <b>folding</b> <b>door</b> on medium buses.|$|E
25|$|This {{area was}} a sacred burial {{site for the}} aliʻi (ruling class). Kekāuluohi and Kanaʻina's {{original}} home {{was similar to that}} of the other estates in the neighborhood consisting of small buildings used for different purposes. The sitting and sleeping area had a <b>folding</b> <b>door</b> entrance of green painted wood under glass upper panels. The house had two rooms separated by a festooned tent door of chintz fabric and was carpeted with hand crafted makaloa mats. In the front was a lounge area opposite a sideboard and mirror. In the middle they placed a semi circle of armchairs with a center table where the couple would write. Four matching cabinet-bookshelves with glass doors were set in each corner of the room with silk scarves hanging from each. In his book, A visit to the South Seas, in the U.S. Ship Vincennes: during the years 1829 and 1830, Charles Samuel Stewart describes the area and homes in detail.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the walls}} are single skinned. The {{south-west}} end of the building contains the office and the former goods room, with a small walled cubicle at the south-west (goods room) end. The partition wall between the office and the goods room has been removed. There are two windows (one casement and one with timber louvres) at the south-west end of the space, along with a door to the platform and a casement window to the south-east (Kamerunga Road) elevation. The office space, which retains some timber counters, has a casement window and a modern sliding window on the south-east side, two sash windows on the north-west elevation, and a stable door and ticket window on the north-east side, through to the waiting shed. The waiting shed retains its bench seating, and has a glass-louvre window to the south-east elevation and a timber double <b>folding</b> <b>door</b> to the platform. North-east of the waiting shed is the ladies toilet, with a doorway to the platform and a small glass louvre window to the south-east. The remains of gardens, with concrete retaining walls to Kamerunga Road, are located south- west of the station building.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the upper}} {{fenestration}} of both garages was similar, the street entrances were not. The Knickerbocker's {{was a single}} wide pointed arch stretching across all three bays, with separate entrances. Its window spandrels had decorative touches meant to mimic Gothic tracery. On the Arnink, every bay had a separate garage, the western one slightly larger each in a pointed-arch entrance with original <b>folding</b> <b>door</b> and metal lantern-style light above. Above it a frieze bore the inscription [...] "Arnink Garage 1915" [...] carved into the cast stone.|$|E

30|$|The building, {{designed}} by the Danish modernist architects Gehrdt Hinrich Bornebusch, Max Brüel and Jørgen Selchau, has achieved international awareness {{not only as a}} piece of architecture presenting a vision of integration of colour, form and function but also as an artwork being the largest artistic decoration of public space in Denmark [1]. Besides the colour scheme for decoration of the walls and interior {{designed by}} Gernes, the hospital foyer includes 65 individual paintings and two painted <b>folding</b> <b>doors</b> executed by Poul Gernes [1]. (Originally, there were four <b>folding</b> <b>doors</b> but the two doors at the balcony covering a bank and a hairdressing salon were removed around 2003 and replaced by glass walls, when the shops were closed down). The two remaining <b>folding</b> <b>doors</b> are the original doors from 1976 and have never been restored.|$|R
60|$|The man obeyed these {{directions}} {{as if he}} quite comprehended {{the motive}} {{with which they were}} dictated, and left the room.

60|$|He {{had caught}} sight {{through the long}} glass <b>folding</b> <b>door</b> of the gleam of a white blouse and a straw hat in the tennis ground.

6000|$|The time came, the {{carriage}} was sent punctually, and {{in due time}} Marian was being marshalled up the broad staircase by the tall servants, in all the trepidation of making her first visit in state on her own account, and feeling at every step {{as if she was}} getting further into the Wreath of Beauty.

60|$|Here the chamberlain, {{throwing}} open a <b>folding</b> <b>door,</b> ushered us at once into {{a spacious}} and lofty saloon, which offered a brilliant {{contrast to the}} quaint and sombre apartments we had traversed. It was elegantly furnished, and the walls hung with paintings, yet something of its original architecture had been preserved and blended with modern embellishments. There were the stone-shafted casements and the deep bow-window of former times. The carved and panelled wood-work of the lofty ceiling had likewise been carefully restored, and its Gothic and grotesque devices painted and gilded in their ancient style.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} <b>folding</b> <b>door</b> was opened {{no more than}} was {{necessary}} for {{the passage of a}} human body; and there entered at the same moment a louder buzz of talk, and the redoubtable President of the Suicide Club. The President was a man of fifty or upwards; large and rambling in his gait, with shaggy side whiskers, a bald top to his head, and a veiled grey eye, which now and then emitted a twinkle. His mouth, which embraced a large cigar, he kept continually screwing round and round and from side to side, as he looked sagaciously and coldly at the strangers. He was dressed in light tweeds, with his neck very open in a striped shirt collar; and carried a minute book under one arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is my main gallery," [...] said Lord Badgery, {{throwing}} {{open one}} leaf {{of a tall}} <b>folding</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "I must apologise for it.

[...] He fumbled with the electric switches and there was suddenly light--light that revealed an enormous gallery, duly receding into distance according to all the laws of perspective. [...] "I dare say you've heard of my poor father," [...] Lord Badgery continued. [...] "A little insane, you know; sort of mechanical genius with a screw loose. He {{used to have a}} toy railway in this room. No end of fun he had, crawling about the floor after his trains. And all the pictures were stacked in the cellars. I can't tell you what they were like when I found them: mushrooms growing out of the Botticellis. Now I'm rather proud of this Poussin; he painted it for Scarron." ...|$|E
60|$|In sudden alarm {{the four}} boys {{turned back toward}} the <b>folding</b> <b>doors</b> through which they had entered the dining-room. To their consternation, the doors were tightly shut.|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{rose and}} crept very slowly, and with {{infinite}} precautions against noise, towards the <b>folding</b> <b>doors.</b> He stood listening with his ear near the yellow chink.|$|R
60|$|Up {{the grand}} {{staircase}} I rushed, burst open {{the pair of}} huge <b>folding</b> <b>doors</b> which faced me, and learned at last that my efforts were in vain.|$|R
60|$|He had {{finished}} his professional commentary by flinging open a <b>folding</b> <b>door,</b> and ushering the party into a broad hall, which {{was filled with}} a great number of people who were waiting, like themselves, for an audience. The room was very spacious, lighted on one side by three arched and mullioned windows, while opposite was a huge fireplace in which a pile of faggots was blazing merrily. Many of the company had crowded round the flames, for the weather was bitterly cold; but the two knights seated themselves upon a bancal, with their squires standing behind them. Looking down the room, Alleyne marked that both floor and ceiling were of the richest oak, the latter spanned by twelve arching beams, which were adorned at either end by the lilies and the lions of the royal arms. On the further side was a small door, on each side of which stood men-at-arms. From time to time an elderly man in black with rounded shoulders and a long white wand in his hand came softly forth from this inner room, and beckoned to one or other of the company, who doffed cap and followed him.|$|E
60|$|A brief precis of 'cases' {{may show}} how these {{elements}} of noise, on one side, and apparitions, on the other, are commonly blended. In a detached villa, just outside 'the town of C.,' Mrs. W. remarks {{a figure of}} a tall dark-haired man peeping round {{the corner of a}} <b>folding</b> <b>door.</b> She does not mention the circumstance. Two months later she sees the same sorrowful face in the drawing-room. This time she tells her husband. Later in the same month, when playing cricket with her children, she sees the face 'peeping round from the kitchen door'. Rather later she heard a deep voice say in a sorrowful tone, 'I can't find it'; something slaps her on the back. Her step-daughter who had not heard of the phantasm, sees the same pale dark-moustached face, 'peeping round the folding doors'. She is then told Mrs W.'s story. Her little brother, later, sees the figure simultaneously with herself. She also hears the voice say, 'I can't find it,' at the same moment as Mrs. W. hears it. A year later, she sees the figure at the porch, in a tall hat! Neither lady had enjoyed any other hallucination. Nothing is known of the melancholy spectre, probably the ghost of a literary person, searching, always searching, for a manuscript poem by some total stranger who had worried him into his grave, and not left him at peace even there. This is a very solemn and touching story, and appeals tenderly and sadly to all persons of letters who suffer from the unasked for manuscripts of the general public.|$|E
6000|$|... "The next {{question}} {{is that of the}} mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades--a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are {{in the form of an}} ordinary door, (a single, not a <b>folding</b> <b>door)</b> except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis--thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open--that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.--By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.|$|E
