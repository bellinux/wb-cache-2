I got the nickname the first day I walked in the gym. I was 10 years old and put a pair of gloves on and started walloping the bag, and my amateur coach said, [...] "Look at him, look how evil he is.

2500|$|Meier {{explained}} {{the story behind}} [...] "Domingo", saying, [...] "Domingo is a false preacher who, with a few sentences, is trying to impress the people there, and then the choir chants 'Domingo, you showed us just nothing like no one before', it means 'you didn't show us anything either, it's all nonsense what you said, but somehow you did it right'. Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't know where <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>from,</b> but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases me as well, I called him Domingo." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E

That morning Mr. Indian broke through the ice and wet himself to the waist. Of course he began to freeze right away. The proper thing was to build a fire. But Dave Walsh was a bull. It was only half a mile to camp, where a fire was already burning. What was the good of building another? He threw Mr. Indian over his shoulder—and ran with him—half a mile—with the thermometer at seventy-five below. You know what that means. Suicide. There’s no other name for it. Why, that buck Indian weighed over two hundred himself, and Dave ran half a mile with him. Of course he froze his lungs. Must have frozen them near solid. It was a tomfool trick for any man to do. And anyway, after lingering horribly for several weeks, Dave Walsh died.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1936 the Swedish {{composer}} Gösta Nystroem, that was curator at Göteborgs Konsthall 1934-36, organizes a scholarship to Billman. Billman was {{given the opportunity to}} study art in March and April in Antwerp. The journey gave inspiration for new motifs. But above all had the harbour environments strongly reminded him of his years as a sailor. Within a year after the trip he made some of his classic black and white woodcuts with sailor motifs such as: Through the Red Sea - Changing of the guard in the stokehole (1936) and The newly signed on sailors (1936), which is one of Billman's best-known woodcuts. About the woodcut [...] Stoker watch goes over deck in the storm (1936/37) the artist said: [...] "I remember the first scene <b>I</b> <b>got</b> inspiration <b>from.</b> <b>It</b> was when the watch came up and the boat was filled with water and there they stood up to their necks in water, so to speak. That I thought, I would try to portray. But it took many years. I had stored such motifs." [...] "I've experienced all my images myself", Torsten Billman often underlined.|$|R
