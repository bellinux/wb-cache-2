25|$|Most drivers {{reported}} initial {{difficulties in}} mastering the MINI E aggressive regenerative braking system which is {{integrated into the}} accelerator pedal. However, all drivers said that once they learned to like the system, they discovered that they could travel more smoothly, and learned to control almost all acceleration and braking events with one pedal. They also discovered, thanks to the <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> information, that they recovered energy proportional to their expertise with the single pedal.|$|E
25|$|A plasma <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> is a {{flat panel}} display common to large TV displays. Many tiny cells between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases. The gas in the cells is {{electrically}} turned into a plasma which then excites phosphors to emit light. The monochrome plasma video display was co-invented in July 1964 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by Donald Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and graduate student Robert Willson for the PLATO Computer System.|$|E

25|$|This approach, {{which is}} not {{compatible}} with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism. Microsoft significantly improved this in Windows Vista by redesigning the power management system to allow basic configuration by Group Policy. The support offered {{is limited to a}} single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for timer coalescing, processor power management, and <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.|$|E
25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{lamented the}} loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its {{brightness}} was turned all the way up. CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: [...] "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions." [...] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15" [...] and 17" [...] models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized. The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.|$|E

5000|$|The {{primary reason}} for this move was {{considered}} to be production efficiency - since <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> for TVs use the 16:9 aspect ratio, it became more efficient for display manufacturers to produce computer <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> in the same aspect ratio as well. A 2008 report by DisplaySearch also cited a number of other reasons, including the ability for PC and monitor manufacturers to expand their product ranges by offering products with wider screens and higher resolutions, helping consumers to adopt such products more easily and [...] "stimulating the growth of the notebook PC and LCD monitor market".|$|R
2500|$|Reception to the iPhone 7 was mixed. Gordon Kelly of Forbes {{noted that}} rival smartphones, {{such as the}} Samsung Galaxy S7, had {{increased}} battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD <b>display</b> <b>panel,</b> while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially {{the size of the}} device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that [...] "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".|$|E
2500|$|On December 4, 1970, {{the twisted}} nematic field effect in liquid {{crystals}} was filed for patent by Hoffmann-LaRoche in Switzerland, (...) with Wolfgang Helfrich and Martin Schadt (then {{working for the}} Central Research Laboratories) listed as inventors. Hoffmann-La Roche then licensed the invention to the Swiss manufacturer Brown, Boveri & Cie who produced displays for wristwatches during the 1970s and also to Japanese electronics industry, which soon produced the first digital quartz wrist watches with TN-LCDs and numerous other products. James Fergason, while working with Sardari Arora and Alfred Saupe at Kent State University Liquid Crystal Institute, filed an identical patent in the United States on April 22, 1971. In 1971 the company of Fergason ILIXCO (now LXD Incorporated) produced the first LCDs based on the TN-effect, which soon superseded the poor-quality DSM types due to improvements of lower operating voltages and lower power consumption. In 1972, the first active-matrix liquid-crystal <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> was produced in the United States by T. Peter Brody's team at Westinghouse, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1983, researchers at Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC), Switzerland, invented the super-twisted nematic (STN) structure for passive matrix addressed LCDs. H. Amstutz et al. were listed as inventors in the corresponding patent applications filed in Switzerland on July 7, 1983, and October 28, 1983. Patents were granted in Switzerland CH 665491, Europe EP 0131216, [...] and many more countries. In 1980 Brown Boveri started a 50/50 joint venture, Videlec AG, with the Dutch Philips company. Philips had all the required know how to design and build chips for the control of large LCD elements. In addition. Philips had better access to markets for electronic components and intended to use LCDs in new product generations of hi-fi, video equipment and telephones. In 1984 Philips researchers Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan invented video speed [...] drive schemes that solved the slow response time of STN-LCDs, enabling high resolution, high quality, and smooth moving video images on STN-LCDs. In 1985 Philips inventors Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan solved the problem to drive high-resolution STN-LCDs using low-voltage (CMOS-based) drive electronics; opening the application of high-quality (high resolution and video speed) LCD panels {{to be used in}} battery operated portable products like notebook computers and mobile phones. In 1985 Philips acquired 100% of the in Switzerland located Videlec AG company, after Philips moved the Videlec production lines to the Netherlands. The years after, Philips successfully produced and marketed complete modules (consisting of the LCD screen, microphone, speakers etc.) in high-volume production for the booming mobile phone industry.|$|E
