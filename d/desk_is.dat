5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E

The borough is the police headquarters for the North Downs division, and is itself divided into three areas for the purposes of neighbourhood policing: Crawley East, Crawley West, and Crawley Town Centre. A separate division covers Gatwick Airport. There is a police station in the town centre; it is open 24 hours a day, and the front <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> staffed for 16 hours each day except Christmas Day. Statutory emergency fire and rescue services are provided by the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service which operates a fire station in the town centre. The South East Coast Ambulance Service is responsible for ambulance and paramedic services.|$|E
25|$|In B. subtilis, this pathway is {{regulated}} by a two-component system: DesK and DesR. <b>DesK</b> <b>is</b> a membrane-associated kinase and DesR is a transcriptional regulator of the des gene. The regulation responds to temperature; {{when there is}} a drop in temperature, this gene is upregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids increase the fluidity of the membrane and stabilize it under lower temperatures. <b>DesK</b> <b>is</b> the sensor protein that, {{when there is a}} decrease in temperature, will autophosphorylate. DesK-P will transfer its phosphoryl group to DesR. Two DesR-P proteins will dimerize and bind to the DNA promoters of the des gene and recruit RNA polymerase to begin transcription.|$|E

25|$|On the right, or south, is the pulpit, reader’s desk, and clerk’s desk, the reader’s desk {{supposedly}} {{made from}} {{portions of the}} original pulpit. The reader’s desk stands {{just in front of}} (north) of the main pulpit. All of this stands to {{the west side of the}} south window on a raised platform but, unlike the chancel, has no separating rail. Between the chancel and the raised area for the pulpit is a small organ enclosed by vertical panels. Behind the organ are two choir pews facing north. (This is a crowded church with very narrow aisles.) In front of the clerk’s <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> the baptismal font. To the west of the raised pulpit are two rows of three slip pews with a central aisle. The rest of the ground level of the church is taken up by rows of slip pews facing south in what is essentially a nave area.|$|E

500|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officer's <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> the [...] {{ceremonial}} mace. Melbourne goldsmith Fortunato Rocca was commissioned by the Parliament of New South Wales in 2002 to design it. The mace took 300 hours to craft and is made from gold, silver and brass.

500|$|Inside, {{the library}} {{is divided into two}} main spaces: alcoves and larger reading areas. The building's main <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> located in the center-front of the floor plan, while its stacks are located in the back, on the first and second floors. On the upper level, the {{original}} metal guardrail continues to protect patrons, and the bookcases and wood paneling that was present when Macon opened is also still used. The library's small alcoves contain wooden benches and fireplaces present when the library opened. A series of frescoes and panels with phrases such as [...] and [...] were inlaid on the mantelpieces above the fireplaces, but the panels with their verbiages are no longer present.|$|E

500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. Jane Horrocks, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Tony Way feature respectively as Liz, Joanne and Michael, other volunteers at the call centre. The characters of Liz and Joanne have strongly differing approaches to their roles as volunteers, with Joanne focussing on detachment and Liz on involvement. Both approaches, for Pemberton, have advantages and disadvantages. Jane's <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> adorned with various trinkets, including ornaments and pictures. These were Horrocks's idea, and, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, served to make viewers suspicious of her from the start. Horrocks was chosen because {{she would be able to}} add humour while still keeping to the tight timings necessary for the episode; many of her lines were improvised. The character of Michael begins to work at the centre during the episode. Pemberton and Shearsmith considered having it mentioned that he had been sent by [...] "Pauline from Wood Green", a reference to the stage version of The League of Gentlemen Pauline, who had been based at Wood Green. However, this was not included in the final episode.|$|E
500|$|Suspects and {{witnesses}} {{in a case}} can be interrogated for information, when the interviewee responds, players are given the option to either believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying. (These options, originally presented as [...] "Truth", [...] "Doubt", or [...] "Lie", were changed to [...] "Good Cop", [...] "Bad Cop", and [...] "Accuse" [...] in the 2017 remaster, which were selected by Rockstar to [...] "more accurately reflect Phelps’ behavior when a player selects each choice".) If players accuse them of lying, they must submit evidence to prove it. When interrogating two suspects at the police station, players may decide who to charge with the crime; charging the wrong suspect affects players' end rating. Players {{have the option to}} skip past an action sequence and continue through the narrative if they fail it three times. There is also a free roam mode called [...] "The Streets of L.A.", which is unlocked after each crime <b>desk</b> <b>is</b> completed, except for the Patrol desk. In this mode, the player and his partner are allowed to free roam the city of Los Angeles. The player can replay Street Crimes, find Golden Film Reels, discover Landmarks, collect Hidden Vehicles, find Badges or just cruise around and listen to the radio.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} 1947 Los Angeles, and {{the open}} world was {{modelled}} accordingly. To model the city, the developers used aerial photographs taken by photographer Robert Spence. The team also used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as the}} location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919. In addition to recreating the city as it was in 1947, all of the in-game cases that the developers worked upon were each inspired in some part by the actual real-life crimes that the city's media reported on during that year. Each of the game's cases features at least a few of the real-life elements that were reported in newspaper articles of that time, with one example of a case that developers found inspiration for being the [...] "Red Lipstick Murder". The case, part of the game's Homicide <b>Desk,</b> <b>is</b> based upon the facts and elements that were mentioned in articles about the real-life, unsolved murder of Jeanne French, a woman who was found dead in exactly the same conditions as the victim of the in-game case is found in, including the M.O. used on the victim, the state the body was left in, the lipstick message found on the body, and the initial suspect being the victim's husband, yet the in-game case differs from this in that it is closed by the main protagonist and not becoming a cold case towards the end of its investigation.|$|E

50|$|Standing <b>desks</b> have <b>been</b> made in many {{styles and}} variations. Standing <b>desks</b> may <b>be</b> {{specialized}} to suit particular tasks, such as certain {{variations of the}} telephone desk and desks for architectural drafting. Some standing <b>desks</b> may only <b>be</b> used while standing while others allow users to sit or stand by adjusting the desk height with an electric motor, hand crank, or counterbalance system. Some <b>desks</b> <b>are</b> also constructed like teacher's lecterns, allowing them to be set {{on top of an}} existing desk for standing, or removed for sitting. While height of most seated <b>desks</b> <b>is</b> standardized, standing <b>desks</b> <b>are</b> made in many different heights ranging from 70 to 128 cm. Ideally the height of a standing desk fits the height of its individual user. With seated desks, adjusting the height relative to the user can be accomplished by adjusting the height of the user's chair. However, because users of a standing desk move around more than when seated, using a pedestal to adjust the user's height is not practical.|$|R
