40|$|International audienceThe {{degradation}} of the marine environment is a subject {{of concern for the}} European authorities primarily because of its contamination by hydrocarbons. The traditional methods (ISO 11348 standard) of general toxicity assessment are unsuitable in a context of in situ monitoring, such as seaports or bathing zones. Consequently, to address this issue, bacterial biosensors appear to be pertinent tools. This article presents the design of an innovative bioluminescent biosensor dedicated to in situ toxicity monitoring. This biosensor is based on the entrapment of the wild marine bioluminescent bacterial strain Aliivibrio fischeri ATCC® 49387 ™ in an agarose matrix within a <b>disposable</b> <b>card.</b> A pre-study was needed to select the most biological parameters. In particular, the regenerating medium’s composition and the hydrogel concentration needed for the bacterial entrapment (mechanical resistance) were optimized. Based on these data, the ability of the bacterial reporter to assess the sample toxicity was demonstrated using naphthalene as a chemical model. The biosensor’s results show a lower sensitivity to naphthalene (EC 50 [*]=[*] 95 mg/L) compared with the results obtained using the reference method (EC 50 [*]=[*] 43 mg/L). With this architecture, the biosensor is an interesting compromise among low maintenance, ease of use, appropriate sensitivity, relatively low cost and the ability to control online toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Food ScienceDaniel Y. C. FungIn {{the food}} industry, {{coliform}} testing is traditionally {{done by the}} time consuming and labor intensive plate count method or tube enumeration methods. The TEMPO® system (bioMérieux, Inc.) was developed to improve laboratory efficiency and to replace traditional methods. It uses a miniaturization of the Most Probable Number (MPN) method with 16 tubes with 3 dilutions in one single <b>disposable</b> <b>card.</b> It utilizes two stations: the TEMPO® Preparation station and the TEMPO® Reading station. In this study, the Oxyase® (Oxyase®, Inc.) enzyme was added to TEMPO® CC (Coliforms Count), TEMPO® AC (aerobic colony count) and TEMPO® EC (E. coli Count) methods. Water samples of 1 ml with 0. 1 ml of Oxyase® enzyme were compared to samples without the Oxyase® enzyme using the TEMPO® system. Samples were spiked with different levels of coliforms (10, 102, 103 and 104 CFU/ml), stomached (20 sec), and pipetted into the three different TEMPO® media reagents (4 ml) in duplicate and then automatically transferred into the corresponding TEMPO® cards by the TEMPO® preparation station. Counts were obtained using the TEMPO® reading station after 8, 12, 16, 22 and 24 hours at an incubation temperature of 35 °C. Results from 20 replicates were compared statistically. Using TEMPO® tests, high counts in food samples (> 6 log 10 CFU/ml) can be read in 6 ± 2 hours of incubation using the time-to-detection calibration curve. The TEMPO® system reduces reading time (reading protocol should be changed). There {{is no need to}} wait for 22 hours of incubation only 12 hours is required. Oxyrase® enzyme is not needed for the TEMPO® system...|$|E

40|$|New Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) {{approaches for}} the quantitative determination of peroxide value (PV) and isolated trans analyses were investigated and developed. The FTIR-PV methods investigated were {{all based on}} the stoichiometric reaction of hydroperoxides and triphenylphosphine (TPP) which converts TPP to triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO). A reference transmission cell (100 mum) method was developed based {{on the use of}} a unique TPPO absorption at 542 cm- 1. This method covered PV values from 0 [...] 15 PV and was shown to be superior in accuracy and reproducibility to the standard American Oil Chemists Society (AOCS) iodometric method. Subsequently, the utility of <b>disposable</b> polyethylene <b>cards,</b> normally used only for qualitative analyses, was investigated for quantitative PV determination. A quantitative IR card method was successfully developed and shown to serve as a very simple, rapid and alternative means of carrying out PV analyses. TPP-impregnated cards were able to reproduce the transmission cell PV results to +/- 1. 12 PV, while the unimpregnated card was slightly more accurate (+/- 0. 92 PV). A third FTIR-PV method was developed specifically for the at-line monitoring of high PV fatliquors and employed a germanium attenuated total reflectance sample handling accessory. This method hinged on the use of a TPPO absorption band at 1118 cm- 1, normally off scale when pathlengths of > 3 mum are used, but is suited to the analysis of oils having very high PVs (> 250). The successful quantitative use of the <b>disposable</b> polyethylene IR <b>card</b> to PV led to its study for the quantitative FTIR determination of the isolated trans content of fats and oils and margarines. The polyethylene card was shown to unique and useful properties, tending to inhibit fat crystallization and its inability to retain moisture. These two properties allowed trans determination to be carried out on melted, high trans fats, without heating the polyethylene substrate and also to analyze margarine...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{magnetic}} cards adopt plain text to store confidential information, thus being vulnerable to an untrusted {{credit card reader}} or a skimming device. To tackle the problem, researchers have proposed several new techniques such as integrated circuit card (IC card) and mobile wallet applications; however, none of them can support existing magnetic card readers thereby facing backwards compatibility issue. In this paper, to combat such credit card information leakages and remain backwards compatible, we propose SafePay, a system that transforms <b>disposable</b> credit <b>card</b> information to electrical current and drives a magnetic card chip to simulate {{the behavior of a}} physical magnetic card. We have implemented a prototype system of SafePay by a mobile phone and a prototype magnetic card chip. In the evaluation, we show that the current cost is about 0. 5 excluding the phone, and the cost can be even lowered if manufactured in large scale.

The results show that the physical signal in oscilloscope {{is the same as the}} theoretical value, and meanwhile, we can successfully buy products in all the tested real-world scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Current newborn {{screening}} programs for phenylketonuria (PKU) do not reach many individuals, worldwide, who {{would benefit from}} testing. Existing PKU tests require a high-resource laboratory, {{as well as a}} base level of local infrastructure, which prohibits their use in low-resource settings. In this report, we demonstrate a paper-based PKU test, based on a well-known enzyme colorimetric assay (ECA), which is applicable to low-resource settings. Phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PheDH) catalyzes the reaction between phenylalane (Phe) and NAD+ to produce phenylpyruvate, NH 4, and NADH. Subsequently, NADH reacts with nitroblue tetrazolium salt (NBT) and phenazine methosulfate (PMS), an intermediate electron carrier, to produce NAD+ and a purple formazan dye. We characterized the enzymatic and colorimetric reactions in solution before characterizing their performance in porous substrates. The enzymatic reaction was translated into a glass fiber substrate and the colorimetric reaction into a cellulose substrate. Short-term dry storage of reagents within the porous media was examined. Finally, we demonstrated an easy-to-use, fully <b>disposable</b> test <b>card</b> with a limit of detection near 1 mg/dL phenylalanine with a time to result of 10 minutes. A test like this has potential for the application of newborn PKU screening in areas of the world that are not currently reached by existing screening programs...|$|R
