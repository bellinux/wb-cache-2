This overuse of pods could also result in the patient having to spend more money on the Omnipod System, since the pods are disposable.|$|E

40|$|A lifelong-implanted and {{completely}} automated artificial or bioartificial pancreas (BAP) is {{the holy grail}} for type 1 diabetes treatment, and could be a definitive solution even for other severe pathologies, such as pancreatitis and pancreas cancer. Technology has made several important steps forward in the last years, providing new hope for the realization of such devices, whose feasibility is strictly connected to advances in glucose sensor technology, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal insulin pump development, the design of closed-loop control algorithms for mechatronic pancreases, as well as cell and tissue engineering and cell encapsulation for biohybrid pancreases. Furthermore, smart integration of the mentioned components and biocompatibility issues must be addressed, bearing in mind that, for mechatronic pancreases, it is most important to consider how to recharge implanted batteries and refill implanted <b>insulin</b> <b>reservoirs</b> without requiring periodic surgical interventions. This review describes recent advancements in technologies and concepts related to artificial and bioartificial pancreases, and assesses how far we are from a lifelong-implanted and self-working pancreas substitute that can fully restore {{the quality of life}} of a diabetic (or other type of) patient...|$|R

50|$|According to the manufacturers, The {{first step}} to setting up the Omnipod System is to {{sanitize}} the insertion site. This is most commonly done by using rubbing alcohol. Once the site is ready, the pod must be filled with insulin. Every pod set comes with a syringe to fill the empty pod with insulin. After the syringe {{is filled with the}} desired amount, the insulin can then be injected through the fill port {{on the bottom of the}} pod. The fill port has a one use only self-sealing septum. This ensures that insulin won’t escape through this port when it is being worn.

At first glance, type 2 diabetes patients represent a large percentage of the total diabetes patient population; however, adoption of traditional IIP products and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy has remained limited amongst this patient segment. With an <b>insulin</b> <b>reservoir,</b> delivery system, and cannula integrated into a small, wearable, disposable or semidisposable device, patch pumps simplify traditional IIP therapy, while potentially offering therapeutic benefits over traditional MDI therapy.

For this reason, insulin pens, like other injection devices, must never be used by more than one person. Reports of insulin pen sharing have come from a variety of U. S. health care settings. Since 2011, there have been at least six separate incidents in which patients were contacted and given advice to test for bloodborne patho-gens because individual insulin pen devices were reused for multiple patients (Table 1). In all of these events, reuse of pens may have occurred {{over a period of years}} before it was identified and corrected. Because these unsafe practices had gone unnoticed for so long, thousands of patients were placed at risk for infection.

40|$|Technology has {{recently}} changed {{type 1 diabetes}} treatment by introducing several advancements able to improve patients' quality of life. However, despite of several decades of research efforts, {{the dream of a}} fully-automated implanted artificial pancreas is quite far from its realization. The need for periodically restoring the implanted battery charge and refilling the implanted <b>insulin</b> <b>reservoir</b> are the main issues, for which invasive surgery, transcutaneous catheters or external portable devices are presently the only solutions. In this paper we propose a novel approach to these issues, describing a totally implanted closed-loop artificial pancreas with a wireless battery charger and a non-invasive strategy for insulin refilling, based on sensorized swallowable "insulin carrier" capsules. Such system has the potential to represent a final solution for diabetes treatment, by fully restoring patients' quality of life...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an embedded control system for insulin pump. The insulin pump is an integrated component in any closed loop insulin delivery system for type 1 diabetes. The pump consists of three main components: micro-needles, <b>insulin</b> <b>reservoir</b> (syringe), and piezoelectric (PZT) linear servo motor. The actuated syringe has an injection back pressure that resists the linear motion of the driving PZT motor. This back pressure acts as a disturbance and leads to inaccurate position and consequently an imprecise insulin dosage. Therefore, a highly precise positioning control on the pump is required to control the insulin dosage and to maintain the blood glucose level in its safe range. The proposed controller is designed using fuzzy logic as a nonlinear controller to compensate any non-modeled nonlinearities in the system. The embedded controller for the PZT motor can be implemented using FPGA or microcontroller chip. This controller acts as a slave and responds to its master controller which controls the complete closed loop insulin delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{subcutaneous}} insulin infusion (CSII), {{more commonly}} known asinsulin pump therapy, delivers rapid acting insulin subcutaneously, in a flexi-ble and precisely controlled manner via a programmable pager sized device with an <b>insulin</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Basal insulin delivery rates can be varied {{according to the}} time of day, and during periods of exercise. A patient (or parent) -initiated bolus of insulin can be delivered in a variety of profiles aimed to match the nature of the ingest-ed meal. Relative to the more widely used modality for delivering insulin, multiple daily injection (MDI), CSII allows for more accurate delivery, reduced variability in insulin absorption, and greater flexibility with both basal and bolus insulin delivery. While CSII offers a larger number of options with regard to insulin dosing, the quali-ty of any decisions made with regard to adjustments in patient management will be in part dependent upon the quality and completeness of the information upon which these decisions are based. Glucometer readings obtained from finger prick testing for intermittent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is at present the most widely used method employed by patients for monitoring their glucose levels at home.

The device consists of a smart glucose-sensitive gel that forms a gateway to an <b>insulin</b> <b>reservoir</b> and is designed to both sense glucose and deliver insulin in the peritoneal cavity. It can be refilled with insulin via subcutaneous ports and surgery was developed to insert the AP. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ), the device filled with insulin (Humulin 1 R U- 500) in situ and the animal observed for several weeks, during which time there was normal access to food and water and several oral glucose challenges. Blood glucose (BG) levels were brought down from > 30 mmol/L (540 mg/dL) to non-fasted values between 7 and 13 mmol/L (126 – 234 mg/dL) about five days after filling the device. Glucose challenge responses improved ultimately so that, starting at 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), the BG peak was 18 mmol/L (324 mg/dL) and fell to 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) after 30 min, contrasting with intravenous attempts. The reservoir solution was removed after 8 days of blood glucose levels during {{which they had been}} increasingly better controlled. A rapid return to diabetic BG levels (30 mmol/L) occurred only after a further 24 days implying some insulin had remained in the device after removal of the reservoir solution. Thus, the closed loop system appeared to have particular influence on the basal and bolus needs for the 8 days in which the reservoir solution was in place and substantial impact for a further 3 weeks. No additional insulin manual adjustment was given during this period...|$|E
