5|$|At party {{meetings}} in late 1919 and early 1920, hecklers and protesters tried to <b>disrupt</b> Adolf Hitler's speeches, and fought with party members. It {{was decided that}} a permanent group of party members would serve to protect Nazi officials at rallies and <b>disrupt</b> the meetings of opposing parties. The basis for the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) had been formed. Heiden became an early member of the Nazi Party and the SA. In 1923, Heiden joined a small personal bodyguard unit for Adolf Hitler named Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler").|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas focused on three objectives: to <b>disrupt</b> the newly created French bureaucracy, to <b>disrupt</b> their {{military}} outposts and to <b>disrupt</b> the transport of rice to Cholon, the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam. The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861. At 05:00, 600 rebels {{under the command of}} Do Dinh Thoai stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded. By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from Mỹ Tho, Định's men had fled. Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{extremely}} high blood thrombogenicity {{has been reported}} in patients with acute myocardial infarction, it has not been clarified if the increased blood thrombogenicity is a cause of acute myocardial infarction or a mere result induced by thrombus formation at the <b>disrupted</b> plaque. Therefore, we examined if blood thrombogenicity is extremely increased as in acute myocardial infarction patients when <b>disrupted</b> plaque is present in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Methods and resultsConsecutive patients (n= 38) with stable coronary artery disease who received angioscopic examination were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to presence or absence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque that accompanied thrombus. Blood thrombogenicity was evaluated by blood vulnerability index and compared between the patients with and without <b>disrupted</b> plaque. Among 38 study patients, 16 had <b>disrupted</b> plaque and 22 did not. Blood vulnerability index was not different between the patients with and without <b>disrupted</b> plaque (2395 ± 612 vs. 3013 ± 1476, p= 0. 12). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant association between blood vulnerability index and the presence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque. ConclusionThe presence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque, in comparison with its absence, was not associated with higher blood thrombogenicity evaluated by blood vulnerability index...|$|R
40|$|The {{links between}} {{unresolved}} maternal attachment status, <b>disrupted</b> maternal interaction in play situa-tions, and disorganized attachment relationships {{were examined in}} a study of 82 adolescent mother– infant dyads.

Additional rating scales were developed to correspond to the 5 dimensions of <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior outlined by E. Bronfman, E. Parsons, and K. Lyons-Ruth (1999). A robust association was observed between <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior and disorganized attachment. Ratings of <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior revealed that disorganized attachment relationships were strongly related to ratings of fearful/disoriented behavior. Moreover, mothers who were unresolved were more likely than not-unresolved mothers to show <b>disrupted</b> patterns of interaction with their infants. Regression analyses suggested that <b>disrupted</b> behavior statistically mediated the association between unresolved status and disorganized attachment relationships...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, {{we argue that}} the neighborhood-level of <b>disrupted</b> family {{processes}} (weak social ties to parents and coercive family interaction) should have a contextual effect on adolescent substance use (cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and lifetime cannabis use), because adolescents living in neighborhoods in which <b>disrupted</b> family processes are prevalent should {{be more likely to}} associate with deviant (substance using) peers. We use nested data on 5491 Icelandic adolescents aged 15 and 16 years in 83 neighborhoods to examine the neighborhood-contextual effects of <b>disrupted</b> family processes on adolescent substance use (cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and lifetime cannabis use), that is, whether neighborhoods in which <b>disrupted</b> family processes are common have more adolescent substance use, even after partialling out the individual-level effects of <b>disrupted</b> family processes on substance use. As predicted, we find that the neighborhood-levels of <b>disrupted</b> family processes have significant, contextual effects on all the indicators of substance use, and that association with substance using peers mediates a part of these contextual effects. The findings illustrate the limitation of an individual-level approach to adolescent substance use.

40|$|ABSTRACT: â-Amyloid (Aâ), {{the primary}} protein {{component}} of Alzheimer’s plaques, is neurotoxic when aggregated into fibrils. We have devised a modular strategy for generating compounds that inhibit Aâ toxicity. These compounds contain a recognition element, designed to bind to Aâ, {{linked to a}} <b>disrupting</b> element, designed to interfere with Aâ aggregation. On {{the basis of this}} strategy, a hybrid peptide was synthesized with the sequence KLVFF (residues 16 - 20 of Aâ) as the recognition element and a lysine hexamer as the <b>disrupting</b> element; this compound protects cells in vitro from Aâ toxicity [Pallitto, M. M., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 3570]. To determine if the length of the <b>disrupting</b> element could be reduced, peptides were synthesized that contained the KLVFF recognition element and a sequence of one to six lysines as <b>disrupting</b> elements. All compounds enhanced the rate of aggregation of Aâ, with the magnitude of the effect increasing as the number of lysines in the <b>disrupting</b> element increased. The greatest level of protection against Aâ toxicity was achieved with compounds containing <b>disrupting</b> elements of three or more lysines in sequence. A peptide with an anionic <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFEEEE, had activity similar to that of KLVFFKKKK, in both cellular toxicity and biophysical assays, whereas a peptide with a neutral polar <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFSSSS, was ineffective. Protective compounds retained activity even at an inhibitor:Aâ molar ratio of 1 : 100, making these some of the most effective inhibitor...|$|R
