5|$|Despite his {{improved}} {{performance in the}} 1973 season, Richard was sent <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on his pitching mechanics and ball control in Class-AA baseball with the Columbus Astros of the Southern League. He started 13games with Columbus before being moved back up to Class-AAA with the Denver Bears. In four starts with the Bears, Richard threw three shutouts and pitched 33 scoreless innings with a 4–0 record and 26strikeouts. He was called back into the majors on July 13 and stayed with the Astros {{for the remainder of}} the season. He first pitched 14innings of baseball in six relief appearances before being placed on the starting rotation. He then started in all nine of the games he pitched during the remainder of the season. Richard finished with a 4.18ERA in just over 64innings of work during the 15pitching appearances he made during the season.|$|E
5|$|By June 1848 {{many of the}} {{specimens}} {{from the}} Wilkes Expedition had been damaged or lost. Many were still not classified or published, as the mismanagement and bungling that had plagued the expedition before it ever departed continued. While {{on a trip to}} Washington, D.C., that month with his new bride, Gray was hired to study the botanical specimens for five years. This included a year in Europe, with his wife, using the facilities at the herbariums in Europe. Mr.and Mrs.Gray departed for England on June11, 1850. They spent the summer traveling to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Gray then set <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the expedition's plant sheets at the estate of botanist George Bentham, whom he had met eleven years earlier, and then with William Henry Harvey in Ireland. Gray returned to England and settled into a routine at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The couple was back in America on September4, 1851. In the meantime, a dispute had arisen between Wilkes and the team of Torrey and Gray about the format of the books resulting from the expedition. Gray almost hired his father-in-law to break the contract. This dispute largely centered on the use of Latin and English. Wilkes wanted a literal Latin to English translation while Torrey and Gray wanted a looser one because they felt that technical English terms were equally incomprehensible to the public. Much of the work was stymied or burned in fires.|$|E
25|$|Across the Sky {{was formed}} when solo artists, Ben Kolarcik and Justin Unger, who were under {{consideration}} by Word Records, met and began collaborations in Nashville. Both artists {{had a history}} of performance and music ministry in their hometowns and in regional tours. After deciding on becoming a duo act, the pair sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on music together. After composing 50 or so titles, they settled on 12 for their first album. The pair was assisted along the way by such notable Contemporary Christian musicians and writers as Cindy Morgan, Scott Krippayne, Matthew Gerrard, Jeff Borders, Kyle Matthews and Tony Wood.|$|E

25|$|Crosby's musical endeavors {{began at}} the age of 13, where he was noted in Guitar Player Magazine as a {{promising}} guitarist of the future. He often recorded home demos with nothing more than a guitar] and a drum machine, sometimes a bass player with him as well. He nearly signed onto a guitar-based label Shrapnel, but turned it <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on his budding songwriting skills. Crosby eventually left Rancho Cotate High School in Rohnert Park, California, to do home study and begin his own band, which he dubbed VAST. Much like fellow alternative rock/industrial band Nine Inch Nails, Crosby was the only member but found a touring band who knew the songs well enough to play with him live.|$|E
25|$|While the paroled prisoners, {{primarily}} from the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, were brought from the parole camp to Sultana, a mechanic was brought <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the leaky boiler. Although the mechanic wanted to cut out and replace a ruptured seam, Mason knew that such a job would take {{a few days and}} cost him his precious load of prisoners. By the time the repairs would be completed, the prisoners would have been sent home on other boats. Instead, Mason and his chief engineer, Nathan Wintringer, convinced the mechanic to make temporary repairs, hammering back the bulged boiler plate and riveting a patch of lesser thickness over the seam. Instead of taking two or three days, the temporary repair took only one. During her time in port, and while the repair was being made, Sultana took on the paroled prisoners.|$|E

The ship is commanded by the cat-like Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined first mate, Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook John Silver, whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the galley, where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship. Flashbacks are shown in Jim's youth when his father abandoned him.|$|E

500|$|At school (not {{identified}} {{but generally}} recognised as Eton), Widmerpool is undistinguished academically and athletically, a [...] "gauche striver" [...] {{in the words}} of one literary commentator. He is the object of some ridicule, chiefly remembered for wearing the [...] "wrong kind of overcoat" [...] on his arrival at the school. Driven by ambition, instead of going on to university ("much better get <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> right away") he is articled to a firm of solicitors, declaring this to be a springboard to wider horizons in business and politics. When Jenkins encounters him a few years after school, Widmerpool has achieved some social success and is a regular invitee at dinner-dances. He has also acquired a commission as a lieutenant in the Territorial Army.|$|E
500|$|The 1987–88 Devils {{garnered}} the franchise's first winning record. On {{the final}} day of the regular season, they were tied with their rivals, the Rangers, for the final playoff spot in the Patrick Division. After New York defeated the Quebec Nordiques 3–0, the Devils needed to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks for a post-season berth. The Devils were trailing 3–2 midway through the third period when John MacLean tied the game, and with 2:39 left in overtime, he added the winning goal. Although the Rangers and Devils both finished with 82 points, the Devils had two more wins, sending them to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history as the New Jersey Devils. The team made it all the way to the Wales Conference Finals in the 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs, but lost to the Boston Bruins in seven games. In that series, head coach Jim Schoenfeld verbally abused referee Don Koharski after the third game, screaming at him. During the exchange, Koharski fell and Schoenfeld said to him [...] "Good, 'cause you fell, you fat pig! Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!" [...] Schoenfeld was given a suspension by the NHL, but due to a favorable court order, he was able to coach in the fourth game of the series. In protest, referee Dave Newell and linesmen Gord Broseker and Ray Scapinello refused to work the game. Three off-ice officials – Paul McInnis, Jim Sullivan and Vin Godleski – were tracked <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the game. After the injunction was lifted, Schoenfeld's suspension was imposed in the following game.|$|E
500|$|Elgar {{was devastated}} {{by the loss of}} his wife. With no public demand for new works, and {{deprived}} of Alice's constant support and inspiration, he allowed himself to be deflected from composition. His daughter later wrote that Elgar inherited from his father a reluctance to [...] "settle <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on hand but could cheerfully spend hours over some perfectly unnecessary and entirely unremunerative undertaking", a trait that became stronger after Alice's death. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, Elgar indulged himself in his several hobbies. Throughout his life he was a keen amateur chemist, sometimes using a laboratory in his back garden. He even patented the [...] "Elgar Sulphuretted Hydrogen Apparatus" [...] in 1908. He enjoyed football, supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., for whom he composed an anthem, [...] "He Banged the Leather for Goal", and in his later years he frequently attended horseraces. His protégés, the conductor Malcolm Sargent and violinist Yehudi Menuhin, both recalled rehearsals with Elgar at which he swiftly satisfied himself that all was well and then went off to the races. In his younger days, Elgar had been an enthusiastic cyclist, buying Royal Sunbeam bicycles for himself and his wife in 1903 (he named his [...] "Mr. Phoebus"). As an elderly widower, he enjoyed being driven about the countryside by his chauffeur. In November and December 1923, he took a voyage to Brazil, journeying up the Amazon to Manaus, where he was impressed by its opera house, the Teatro Amazonas. Almost nothing is recorded about Elgar's activities or the events that he encountered during the trip, which gave the novelist James Hamilton-Paterson considerable latitude when writing Gerontius, a fictional account of the journey.|$|E

[...] It is his longest opera {{as well as the}} one on which he spent the most time.|$|E
2500|$|Back in the United States, Oppenheimer {{was invited}} to do the initial {{planning}} for a new branch of the Smithsonian, but he turned it <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on what he called his [...] "San Francisco project". In 1967, the Oppenheimers came to San Francisco with a view towards opening an independent museum of their own. Oppenheimer sought funding {{and support for the}} endeavor using a grassroots approach, bringing a written proposal and some handmade exhibits with him as he visited scientists, businesses, city and school officials, relatives, and friends. Many prominent scientists and cultural figures endorsed the project, and the offers of support in conjunction with a $50,000 grant from the San Francisco Foundation made the museum realizable.|$|E
2500|$|Haas's rival Leopold Nowak was {{appointed}} to produce a whole new critical edition of Bruckner's works. He and others such as Benjamin Korstvedt and conductor Leon Botstein argued that Haas's explanation is at best idle speculation, at worst a shady justification of Haas's own editorial decisions. Also, it has been pointed out that Bruckner often started work on a symphony just days after finishing the one before. As Cooke writes, [...] "In spite of continued opposition and criticism, and many well-meaning exhortations to caution from his friends, he looked neither to right nor left, but simply got <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the next symphony." [...] The matter of Bruckner's authentic texts {{and the reasons for}} his changes to them remains politicised and uncomfortable.|$|E

2500|$|Another tape reached The Island Def Jam Music Group {{executive}} Lewis Largent, {{who liked}} the demos enough to accept Sweeney's offer to watch an Andrew W.K. gig at the Mercury Lounge, where Largent {{was impressed by}} how W.K. [...] "won over every last person in the audience." [...] Wilkes-Krier reacted with surprise to Island's interest in him, and [...] "despite his manager's advice that you classically don't go with the first offer, [...] 'wanted to get <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{as quickly as possible}} and not fuck around," [...] as Sweeney recalls. Girls Own Juice was followed by another Bulb Records EP entitled Party Til You Puke in October 2000. Following the release of Party Til You Puke, Andrew W.K. left Bulb Records amicably to sign with Island Records.|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Bellini {{arrived in}} Parma on 17 March giving him 56 {{days before the}} opening, but he then learned {{that some of the}} singers would only arrive 14 days before the date of the premiere, a date that was—in theory— unchangeable. In fact, it had to be changed due to the {{inability}} of Lalande to arrive in time for sufficient rehearsal. Both composer and librettist were somewhat dilatory, delaying work as much and as long as possible. Count Sanvitale's request on 17 April, asking [...] "to let me know the reasons why our copyists are kept idle", did not receive much of response to satisfy the theatre's management. [...] Eventually, both men got <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and finished on time, although the premiere was delayed by four days.|$|E
2500|$|Chase's early film roles {{included}} Tunnel Vision, the {{box office}} hit Foul Play, and Oh! Heavenly Dog. The role of Eric 'Otter' Stratton in National Lampoon's Animal House was originally written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on Foul Play. The role went to Tim Matheson instead. Chase {{said in an interview}} that he chose to do Foul Play so he could do [...] "real acting" [...] for the first time in his career instead of just doing [...] "schtick". Chase followed Foul Play with the successful Harold Ramis comedy Caddyshack, in 1980. That same year, he also reunited with Foul Play co-star Goldie Hawn for Neil Simon's Seems Like Old Times and released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by Randy Newman, Barry White, Bob Marley, the Beatles, Donna Summer, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Troggs, and The Sugarhill Gang.|$|E

2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon {{settling}} <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door and peered in. Catherine was sprawled on the floor. Her face appeared purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{noticed that}} the new album sounds {{different}} from Zola Jesus' earlier works. [...] "I just wanted to try out new ways to produce and different ways to write. And with this new record it's a lot more stripped down and there are way more acoustic elements as opposed to no acoustic elements. [...] I just wanted more breathing room, so people could insert their own experiences into the song, their own feelings into the song, as opposed to me forcing it on them with the densest sound possible", Danilova explained. Speaking to Prefix Magazine after her performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, {{she said she wanted}} the album to be a step forward. [...] "n doing that, there was so, so much trial and error and so much quitting music {{at the end of the}} day", she admitted. Danilova said that the title of the album (meaning [...] "moving forward" [...] in Latin) appeared before the work on it began. [...] "I had it in mind beforehand because I knew that's what I was going through even before I sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the record, I was already going through that emotional process of trying to push myself", she said.|$|E
