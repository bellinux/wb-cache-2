40|$|Summary: The {{effects of}} {{repetitive}} mild heat shock (30 rain, 41 ~ C) on growth and various cellular and biochemical characteristics of human skin fibroblasts undergoing ageing in vitro were analysed. Human skin cells not only tolerated more than 30 repeated heat shocks throughout heir replicative lifespan, but also maintained several characteristics of young cells {{until late in}} life. Whereas the growth rates, population doubling rates, and cumulative population doubling levels achieved in vitro remained unaffected, age-related changes in cellular morphology, cell size, cytoskeletal organisation, autofluorescence and neutral ~-galactosidase activity were significantly slowed down by repeated mild heat shock. These hormesis-like ffects of stress-induced defence processes can be useful to elucidate the role of maintenance and repair mechanisms in ageing.

40|$|AbstractThe {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{is widely}} used to study aging, development, behavior and other basic metazoan processes [1 – 3]. The only mutants directly identified {{on the basis of}} their extended longevity in any metazoan have been isolated in C. elegans[4, 5]. All life-extension mutants (Age mutants) previously identified in C. elegans result from hypo-morphic or nullo-morphic mutations. We have identified a new class of <b>gerontogene</b> (a gene whose alteration causes life extension) that increases life span when overexpressed. The first gene in this class has been designated tyrosine kinase receptor- 1 (tkr- 1); it encodes a putative receptor tyrosine kinase. Overexpression of tkr- 1 in transgenics increases longevity 40 – 100 % (average 65 %), confers increased resistance to heat and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in transgenic nematodes, and does not alter development or fertility. Unlike previously identified gerontogenes, tkr- 1 positively modulates stress resistance and longevity. These results further support the positive relationship between increased stress resistance and increased longevity seen in all previously studied longevity mutants. This transgenic system is an effective means for identifying overexpression gerontogenes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Our {{survival}} {{and the physical}} quality of life depends upon an efficient functioning of various maintenance and repair processes. This complex network of the so-called longevity assurance processes is composed of several genes, termed vitagenes. The homeodynamic property of living systems {{is a function of}} such a vitagene network. Because aging is characterized by the failure of homeodynamics, a decreased efficiency and accuracy of the vitagene network can transmutate it into a <b>gerontogene</b> network. It is not clear how various components of the vitagene network operate and influence each other in a concordant or a discordant manner. Experi-mental strategies through which this transmutation of vitagenes into virtual geronto-genes may be elucidated include induction of molecular damage, antisense intervention, and genetic screening for varied efficiencies {{of the members of the}} vitagene family. A reversal of this approach by maintaining or recovering the activity of vitagenes will lead to a delay of aging, a decreased occurrence of age-related dis-eases, and a prolongation of a healthy life span.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{view that}} {{the life span of}} an {{organism}} is intrinsically limited and is largely species-specific necessarily involves certain notions of genetic elements of regulation. The term <b>gerontogenes</b> refers to any such genetic elements that are involved in the regulation of ag-ing and life span. The existence of genes for programmed aging is generally discounted on the basis of evolutionary arguments against the notion of the adaptive nature of ag-ing. It is suggested here that the concept of <b>gerontogenes</b> be linked with the idea of genes involved in homeostasis and longevity assurance, which is not contradictory to the nonadaptive nature of aging. Because these genes were not originally selected as real genes for aging, their in-volvement in aging is an emergent property making them virtual <b>gerontogenes.</b> Some experimental evidence is available that suggests that sets of genes involved in the maintenance and repair of various cellular functions are the primary candidates qualifying as virtual geron-togenes. - Rattan, S.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous <b>gerontogene</b> mutants {{leading to}} {{dramatic}} life extensions {{have been identified}} in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans over the last 20 years. Analysis of these mutants has provided a basis for understanding the mechanisms driving the aging process(es). Several distinct mechanisms including an altered rate of aging, increased resistance to stress, decreased metabolic rate, or alterations in a program causing organismic aging and death have been proposed to underlie these mutants. RESULTS: Whole-genome analysis of gene expression during chronological aging of the worm provides a rich database of age-specific changes in gene expression and represents one way to distinguish among these models. Using a rigorous statistical model with multiple replicates, we find that {{a relatively small number of}} genes (only 164) show statistically significant changes in transcript levels as aging occurs (&lt; 1 % of the genome). Expression of heat shock proteins decreases, while expression of certain transposases increases in older worms, and these findings are consistent with a higher mortality risk due to a failure in homeostenosis and destabilization of the genome in older animals. Finally, a specific subset of genes is coordinately altered both during chronological aging and in the transition from the reproductive form to the dauer, demonstrating a mechanistic overlap in aging between these two processes. CONCLUSIONS: We have performed a whole-genome analysis of changes in gene expression during aging in C. elegans that provides a molecular description of C. elegans senescence...|$|E
40|$|Aging is {{accompanied}} by poor learning and memory abilities and by decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, {{a process that is}} also modulated by oxidative stress (OS). P 66 (Shc) has recently emerged as a novel mammalian <b>gerontogene</b> able to affect healthspan during aging. Deletion of this gene in mice leads to reduced OS accompanied by decreased incidence of age-related pathologies and reduced signs of behavioral aging. We hypothesized that p 66 (Shc-/-) mutants might show increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory processes. To this aim, granule cell number, proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and cell death were assessed in the hippocampus in senescent p 66 (Shc-/-) [knock out (KO) ] and p 66 (Shc+/+) [wild type (WT) ] male and female mice. Spatial learning abilities and spontaneous activity were also investigated in a multifunctional behavioral system-IntelliCages. The behavioral analysis revealed that females in general perform better in spatial learning tasks, with genotype effects being apparent in the activity pattern only. Likewise, all females showed increased neuronal differentiation, whereas increased proliferation was found only in those belonging to the p 66 (Shc-/-) genotype, indicating that they might be protected from precursor cell loss. The number of dying cells was not affected by genotype or sex; however, all KO mice showed less granule cells than WT. Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal function is protected in the female gender at older age, an effect amplified by reduced OS in the p 66 (Shc-/-) mutant...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} and assess a laboratory module that we introduced into an intermediate-level undergraduate course in Neuroscience and Behavior (NEUR 201) {{in order to}} expose students to the new and rapidly developing neurogenomic and bioinformatics approaches to neuroscience research. The laboratory accompanies a topics-based, highly process-oriented course that explores research methodologies and integrative approaches to particular topics in the field. The laboratory comprises multi-week modules that expand upon the topics being covered in class. In the class for which this module was developed, a key topic under discussion is {{the role played by}} the nervous system in aging and/or lifespan. This laboratory module focuses on the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), which has been studied extensively. There is a large and ongoing literature elucidating a number of genes involved in determining or modulating lifespan in C. elegans. Students choose a candidate <b>gerontogene</b> expressed in neurons in C. elegans from a provided list for which we have mutant strains. Students use available databases to become experts on their candidate gene and design, carry out and analyze a behavioral experiment. In addition, students use available bioinformatics and genomic tools to conduct a protein sequence phylogenetic analysis of their candidate protein across at least 10 different taxa of animals. The laboratory module thus focuses on the integration of behavioral, genetic and bioinformatics approaches, {{as well as on the}} evolutionary considerations of the role played by gerontogenes in different organisms...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aging of {{biological}} systems occurs {{in spite of}} numerous complex pathways of maintenance, repair and defense. There are no <b>gerontogenes</b> which have the specific evolutionary function to cause aging. Although aging is the common cause of all age-related diseases, aging in itself cannot be considered a disease. This understanding of aging as a process should transform our approach towards interventions from developing illusory anti-aging treatments to developing realistic and practical methods for maintaining health throughout the lifespan. The concept of homeodynamic space can be a useful one {{in order to identify}} a set of measurable, evidence-based and demonstratable parameters of health, robustness and resilience. Age-induced health problems, for which there are no other clear-cut causative agents, may be better tackled by focusing on health mechanisms and their maintenance, rather than only disease management and treatment. Continuing the disease-oriented research and treatment approaches, as opposed to health-oriented and preventive strategies, are economically, socially and psychologically unsustainable...|$|R

40|$|When {{prosecutors}} {{are trying to}} reveal an underground conspiracy, they usually start with the inferior perpetrators and gradually lead to the bosses. However, researchers probing how a biochemical pathway controls worm aging are following the opposite course. They know that the protein DAF- 16 extends survival, {{but they are still}} investigating the genes that undergo its bidding. A new study has revealed more than 100 genes receiving orders from DAF- 16 (). "Gerontogenes" (genes that affect the rate of aging) are theoretically categorized as genes that can be altered such that a longer than normal maximum lifespan is the result. In order to define a gene as a “gerontogene”, one is experimentally to show that full or partial ablation, or overexpression of the gene will affect life expectancy. During the last two decades, researchers have overwhelmingly demonstrated that gerontogenes exist and modulate the rate of aging () ]. The first direct demonstration that genes {{play a role in the}} aging process was carried out in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These results lead to the important fact that the process of aging, just as other biological processes, is actually specified by the gene () ]. These evolutionary studies on C. elegans have shown that an insulinlike signaling pathway helps control the nematode's lifespan. A study led by Fred Ausubel, HMS professor of genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital, now suggests that a hardier immune system may account for part of the pathway's effect on longevity. Worms with mutations in the pathway are resistant to pathogenic bacteria and live much longer when fed a diet of these bad bugs than do wild type strains () ]. The <b>gerontogene</b> mutants in C. elegans have increased the level of interest in the topic, but the definite answer to the question whether similar genes exist in mammals remains unresolved. Although it is believed that the contribution of genetic component in human longevity is small, there is reason to be optimistic that major gerontogenes exist in humans. At this step research done on rodents, especially on mice, is significant as mice they provide a useful model system that has the value of a bridge between invertebrate and human. Hopefully, at least four distinct genes have been determined in which loss-of function mutations lead to drawfism and increasead mean and maximum longevity. The second significant act on human longevity gene research is to sort known genes into theoretical categories for a better understanding of their roles on human aging. Generally they are studied in three groups. Most gerontologists believe that there must not be a group as “genes that cause aging”, since such a gene promoting aging would be likely to decrease reproductive fitness and thus would be subject to negative selection. On the other hand, there are statements by notable developmental biologists who say that aging must be programmed to avoid the competition with offsprings. Perhaps, the group “genes that affect what kind of an individual you are” is more concrete. Not surprisingly, thousands of these genes (that fit to this definition) are found in mice and human. This group includes polymorphic differences that help to determine which and how soon the individuals will become bald or gray or even will develop certain pathologies such as osteoporosis, macular degenerationor cognitive impairment. However, this is not the same as to say that these genes have a direct control on the rate of aging. The last group includes the “genes that extend life expectancy or maximum lifespan”. These genes are important in response mechanisms such as response to growth hormone, insulin-like signaling and response to stress. It is not hard to see that in doing so they affect life expectancy. First, they were found in model systems such as nematodes and fruit flies, but examples in mice are also identified. Alleles of this type predictably exist in humans; however, it is harder to demonstrate in such a long-lived species than in short lived ones. The symptoms of many inherited human neurodegenerative diseases begin late in life. This observation suggests that, in these disorders, aged neurons are more susceptible to degeneration. At least eight hereditary neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease, are caused by a disease locus that encodes a protein containing an expanded glutamine tract. The mechanism by which these polyglutamine repeats cause late onset neurodegeneration and cell death is unknown (). Perhaps, these accelerated studies on longevity research lead us to a crucial reconsideration of the path of developing research. At the moment, it is observed that the research mainly concentrates on increasing the lifespan of humankind. However, this theoretical approach in fact will predictably be challenged by a realistic fact; neurodegeneration. Without sustaining the level of consciousness the study of longevity will lead nowhere. The ultimate challenge is to increase lifespan with the timespan of human specific abilities such as intellectual and cognitive functions. Thus, it can be predicted that after defining fundalmentals of longevity the concentration will shift to neurosystem...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the extension of adult life span (Age) seen in several mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans (age- 1 : an altered aging rate; daf- 2 and daf- 23 : activation of a dauer-specific longevity program; spe- 26 : reduced fertility; clk- 1 : an altered biological clock). Using an assay for ultraviolet (UV) resistance in young adult hermaphrodites (survival after UV irradiation), we observed that all these Age mutants show increased resistance to UV. Moreover, mutations in daf- 16 suppressed the UV resistance {{as well as the}} increased longevity of all the Age mutants. In contrast to the multiple mechanisms initially proposed, these results suggest that a single, daf- 16 -dependent pathway, specifies both extended life span and increased UV resistance. The mutations in daf- 16 did not alter the reduced fertility of spe- 26 and interestingly a daf- 16 mutant is more fertile than wild type. We propose that life span and some aspects of stress resistance are jointly negatively regulated by a set of <b>gerontogenes</b> (genes whose alteration causes life extension) in C. elegans...|$|R

40|$|The planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) pathway {{is highly}} conserved from Drosophila to humans and a PCP-like pathway {{has recently been}} described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The developmental function of this pathway is to coordinate the orientation of cells or structures within the plane of an epithelium or to organize cell-cell intercalation required for correct morphogenesis. Here, we describe a novel role of VANG- 1, the only C. elegans ortholog of the conserved PCP component Strabismus/Van Gogh. We show that two alleles of vang- 1 and depletion of the protein by RNAi cause an increase of mean life span up to 40 %. Consistent with the longevity phenotype vang- 1 animals also show enhanced resistance to thermal- and oxidative stress and decreased lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, vang- 1 mutants show defects like reduced brood size, decreased ovulation rate and prolonged reproductive span, which are also related to <b>gerontogenes.</b> The germline, but not the intestine or neurons, {{seems to be the}} primary site of vang- 1 function.
