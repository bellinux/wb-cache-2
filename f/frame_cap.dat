50|$|While the Hawaiians did {{not wear}} hats, {{during times of}} combat the Ali'i chiefs would wear {{specially}} created wicker helmets that have been likened to the classic Greek helmets, and also co-incidentally bear a resemblance to the headdress worn by Ladakh Buddhist religious musicians. While the question has been posed if the influence is from the Spanish, the tradition comes from the northern coast of New Ireland.The design for mahiole is a basketry <b>frame</b> <b>cap</b> with a central crest running {{from the center of}} the forehead to the nape of the neck. However the variation in the design is considerable with the colour and arrangement of the feather patterns differing and the crest varying in height and thickness. A number of museums have numerous examples in different designs and stages of preservation. A related Hawaiian term Oki Mahiole means a haircut where a strip of hair is left on the head. The image of the Hawaiian god Kū-ka-ili-moku is sometimes presented with a similar shaped head.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{insertion}} of amino acid sequences into the adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) capsid open reading <b>frame</b> (<b>cap</b> ORF) is one strategy currently being developed for retargeting this prototypical gene therapy vector. While {{this approach has}} successfully resulted {{in the formation of}} AAV particles that have expanded or retargeted viral tropism, the inserted sequences have been relatively short, linear receptor binding ligands. Since many receptor-ligand interactions involve nonlinear, conformation-dependent binding domains, we investigated the {{insertion of}} full-length peptides into the AAV cap ORF. To minimize disruption of critical VP 3 structural domains, we confined the insertions to residue 138 within the VP 1 -VP 2 overlap, which {{has been shown to be}} on the surface of the particle following insertion of smaller epitopes. The insertion of coding sequences for the 8 -kDa chemokine binding domain of rat fractalkine (CX 3 CL 1), the 18 -kDa human hormone leptin, and the 30 -kDa green fluorescent protein (GFP) after residue 138 failed to lead to formation of particles due to the loss of VP 3 expression. To test the ability to complement these insertions with the missing capsid proteins in trans, we designed a system for producing AAV vectors in which expression of one capsid protein is isolated and combined with the remaining two capsid proteins expressed separately. Such an approach allows for genetic modification of a specific capsid protein across its entire coding sequence leaving the remaining capsid proteins unaffected. An examination of particle formation from the individual components of the system revealed that genome-containing particles formed as long as the VP 3 capsid protein was present and demonstrated that the VP 2 capsid protein is nonessential for viral infectivity. Viable particles composed of all three capsid proteins were obtained from the capsid complementation groups regardless of which capsid proteins were supplied separately in trans. Significant overexpression of VP 2 resulted in the formation of particles with altered capsid protein stoichiometry. The key finding was that by using this system we successfully obtained nearly wild-type levels of recombinant AAV-like particles with large ligands inserted after residue 138 in VP 1 and VP 2 or in VP 2 exclusively. While insertions at residue 138 in VP 1 significantly decreased infectivity, insertions at residue 138 that were exclusively in VP 2 had a minimal effect on viral assembly or infectivity. Finally, insertion of GFP into VP 1 and VP 2 resulted in a particle whose trafficking could be temporally monitored by using confocal microscopy. Thus, we have demonstrated a method that can be used to insert large (up to 30 -kDa) peptide ligands into the AAV particle. This system allows greater flexibility than current approaches in genetically manipulating the composition of the AAV particle and, in particular, may allow vector retargeting to alternative receptors requiring interaction with full-length conformation-dependent peptide ligands...|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>cap</b> <b>frame</b> ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the <b>cap</b> <b>frame</b> the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|R

The most considerable support in Lower Silesian voivodeship was obtained by subregion of intensive agriculture, especially the inhabitants of rural areas of Wrocław district. Absorption of support means connected with particular sectors of the EU programs consolidates the leading functions of each subregion of Lower Silesia region, which result from environmental, economic and location conditions.
