5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
25|$|Noble {{likes to}} have {{spontaneous}} material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages heckling and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the Edinburgh Playhouse during Noble's 2005 Randomist tour, {{a member of the}} audience put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage, and later removed his shoes {{and put them on the}} stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.|$|E
500|$|... "The Box" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Salon.com {{gave the}} episode an A-, explaining [...] "this week's episode was {{chock full of}} good stuff. We get some more fun nuggets about how Earth 2 differs from Earth 1... Your Bose headphones cannot protect you from the awesome sonic power of [...] "The Box". UGO Networks' Alex Zalben wrote [...] "Two weeks in, Fringe {{is still the best}} damn show currently on TV". Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it was a terrific episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was {{a good example of how}} far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology. Now, Fringe is a seamless whole".|$|E
6000|$|This {{morning he}} {{was in front of}} his house, {{inspecting}} the grass parking between the curb and the broad cement sidewalk. Babbitt stopped his car and leaned out to shout [...] "Mornin'!" [...] Littlefield lumbered over and stood with one <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> running-board.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stiles looked shocked, and, time pressing, Mr. Burton, {{breathing}} so {{hard that}} it impeded his utterance, purchased a first-class ticket and conducted him to the carriage. Mr. Stiles took a seat by the window and lolling back put his <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cushions opposite. A large bell rang and the carriage-doors were slammed.|$|R

2500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of5, and {{commented that}} the [...] "irreverently funny" [...] film had [...] "a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat next to you," [...] and praising {{director}} Gondry's [...] "sense of humor and acute visual skill" [...] even while calling the movie [...] "cheerfully unfocused". Rogen proclaimed the film was a [...] "nightmare", chalking it up to studio executives paying {{little attention to the}} most expensive portions of the film and its inflated budget.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1/17/1897 – W./D. (Webb to Dall) [...] "yesterday I {{took four}} horses, six men, three belts, tackle, {{a lot of}} heavy {{planking}} and a rigger to superintend the work and succeeded in rolling the invertebrate out of the pit and placing in about 40 <b>feet</b> higher <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach where it now rests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flooring of heavy plank.".|$|R

50|$|Shortly after noon, Shano's {{sister and}} nephew came to visit. When the nephew knocked insistently, Sawyer gave Shano {{the key to}} open the door and she ran {{screaming}} to the safety of her relatives. Her excited ravings were incomprehensible to her nephew and sister until they looked inside and saw the gruesome scene and Arwood's beaten and blistered body. They also saw Sawyer sitting with his <b>feet</b> propped <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the couch.|$|R
60|$|With that he {{heaved a}} great sigh, and then, {{as if he}} had {{discharged}} his duty to the past, put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter luxuriously.|$|E
60|$|A tumble-down archway, leaning to {{one side}} like a lame hen, gave access to a dark passage, dank with moisture, whereon {{the door of the}} house gave some {{eighteen}} <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left.|$|E

5000|$|On 7 August 2006, Hüseyin Başbilen, a 31-year-old {{mechanical}} engineer working {{for ten years}} at Aselsan as a production engineer, {{was found dead in}} his car at Pursaklar, Ankara. His left wrist and throat were cut, his head was under <b>the</b> glove compartment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> passenger's side and his <b>feet</b> were <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's seat. In 2009, a court ruled that it was suicide. In 2011, the case was reopened as part of the [...] "Ergenekon" [...] investigation.|$|R
6000|$|He came strolling {{around the}} vicarage {{into the garden}} one morning about eleven, though she had not {{expected}} him until lunch-time; and she was sitting with her <b>feet</b> tucked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aged but still practicable garden-seat reading Shaw's [...] "Common Sense of Municipal Trading." [...] He came and leant {{over the back of}} the seat, and she looked up, said [...] "Good morning. Isn't it perfectly lovely?" [...] and indicated by a book still open that her interest in it remained alive.|$|R
60|$|Creeping stealthily to {{the porch}} she peered in at the window. Eddie was {{stretched}} out in cramped though seeming luxury in an office chair. His <b>feet</b> were cocked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desk before him. In his lap lay his six-shooter ready for any emergency. Another reposed in its holster at his belt.|$|R
6000|$|Bjornstam did not {{fuss over}} her. He suggested, [...] "Might throw open your coat {{and put your}} <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> box {{in front of the}} stove." [...] He tossed his dogskin coat into the bunk, lowered himself into the barrel chair, and droned on: ...|$|E
60|$|Anderson {{leaped to}} get {{one hand on the}} car door, the other on Nash. He almost pulled the driver out of his seat. But Nash held on desperately, and the car, gaining momentum, dragged Anderson. He could not get his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> running-board, and {{suddenly}} he fell.|$|E
60|$|The man sat huddled {{up in his}} chair, {{with his}} head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back {{with his hands in}} his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.|$|E
60|$|The more I worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case, the clearer {{it became}} {{to me that}} Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke's great-uncle had been either a consummate scoundrel or a lunatic, and that our only hope of winning {{must be based on}} proving him one or the other; it did not matter much which, for my {{expectations}} at best were small. When I had at length settled to this conclusion I confided it as delicately as possible to my client, who was sitting at the time with his <b>feet</b> cocked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> office table, reading a pink newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} Presidential anecdotes by Paul F.

500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, <b>on</b> a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered across the stage and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one <b>foot</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> keyboard. Once again, she staggered across the stage, with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance was for her fans: [...] "I wanted to say something honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off <b>on</b> stage <b>the</b> whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would be at home cheering and swooning." [...] In a poll conducted by Billboard, the performance was ranked as the fourth best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, miss; {{not that}} one," [...] said Rufus. [...] "You see, I'm {{long in the}} legs, and if I once got down as low as that, I reckon I should have to restore the balance by putting my <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grate; and that's not manners in Great Britain--and quite right too." ...|$|E
6000|$|His gloves {{were the}} saddest ruin, {{but he told}} me where I could get some like them. His shoes would hardly hold walnuts without leaking, but he liked to put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece and {{contemplate}} them. He wore a dim glass breastpin, which he called a [...] "morphylitic diamond"--whatever that may mean--and said only {{two of them had}} ever been found--the Emperor of China had the other one.|$|E
60|$|Hank was not {{the sort}} of man who makes {{universal}} appeal. Also, he was no ladies' man. He was long and lean and hard-bitten, and his supply of conventional small talk was practically non-existent. To get the best out of Hank, as has been said, you had to let him take his coat off and put his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of a second chair and reconcile yourself to the pestiferous brand of tobacco which he affected.|$|E

The man can be seen {{standing}} {{to the left of}} center with his left <b>foot</b> propped <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fountain as he plays his guitar. He wears a poncho and a bandana, and is looking at the woman seated cross-legged to the right of him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fountain. She is looking at him and wears a dress with a long shawl. A few other people {{can be seen in the}} background in front of a hacienda-style building. Plants cover the columns holding up the covered patio, while a bush can be seen in the extreme right foreground...|$|R
5000|$|I did {{not want}} to do an [...] "authorized biography" [...] on either Microsoft or Apple, so we made the {{decision}} going in that we would not talk or meet with them. With a team of Harvard researchers, I embarked on a seven-month research project that encompassed virtually everything we could find <b>on</b> <b>the</b> history of both companies, including old technical magazines from the '70s. I intended every scene to be based on actual events, including such seemingly fantastic moments as Bill Gates' bulldozer races {{in the middle of the}} night and Steve Jobs' bare <b>feet</b> going <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board room table during an applicant's job interview. I have two or more sources that verify each scene.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Schwirtz {{said that}} he was [...] "expecting {{something}} to turn up--nothin' he could do but wait for some telephone calls." [...] He sat about with his stockinged <b>feet</b> cocked <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, reading detective stories till he fell asleep in his chair. He drank from unlabeled pint flasks of whisky all day. Once, when she opened a bureau drawer of his by mistake, she saw half a dozen whisky-flasks mixed with grimy collars, and the sour smell nauseated her. But on food--they had to economize on that! He took her to a restaurant of fifteen-cent breakfasts and twenty-five-cent dinners. It was the [...] "parlor floor" [...] of an old brownstone house--two rooms, with eggy table-cloths, and moldings of dusty stucco.|$|R
60|$|His {{friends were}} men's men; {{he could not}} see them fitting into a scheme of life that {{involved}} the perpetual presence of a hostess. Hank Jardine, for instance. To Kirk, the great point about Hank was that he had been everywhere, seen everything, and was, when properly stimulated with tobacco and drink, a fountain of reminiscence. But he could not talk unless he had his coat off and his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of a chair. No hostess could be expected to relish that.|$|E
60|$|Flamboyantly smoking cigars {{they sat}} in a box at the burlesque show, their <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed, worried, and inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more {{elementary}} chorus-evolutions, and a Jewish comedian made vicious fun of Jews. In the entr'actes they met other lone delegates. A dozen of them went in taxicabs out to Bright Blossom Inn, where the blossoms were made of dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a cow-stable no longer wisely used.|$|E
60|$|Verona and Kenneth Escott were {{eventually}} and hesitatingly married. For the wedding Babbitt was dressed {{as carefully as}} was Verona; he was crammed into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a certain relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine, {{he returned to the}} house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have the living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and Kenneth worrying, in a cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages and the Drama League.|$|E
60|$|Around one {{isolated}} potato-barrel stood {{four young}} gentlemen, two black, two white, becomingly dressed, each {{with the head}} of a slender cane pressed against his teeth, and each with a <b>foot</b> propped <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barrel. Another young gentleman came up, looked longingly at the barrel, but saw no rest for his foot there, and turned pensively away to seek another barrel. He wandered here and there, but without result. Nobody sat upon a barrel, as is the custom of the idle in other lands, yet all the isolated barrels were humanly occupied. Whosoever had a foot to spare put it on a barrel, if all <b>the</b> places <b>on</b> it were not already taken. The habits of all peoples are determined by their circumstances. The Bermudians lean upon barrels because of the scarcity of lamp-posts.|$|R
60|$|It may {{be easily}} judged that this {{put them into}} great consternation, and they might well {{conclude}} {{that they should be}} all drowned and lost; for they were now, as it were, {{in the middle of the}} sea upon two open floats or rafts, fenced nowhere from the least surge or swell of the water, except by a kind of waste board, about two <b>feet</b> high, built <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides, without any calking or pitching, or anything to keep out the water.|$|R
50|$|On Wednesday 6 December Colonel Thomas Pride’s Regiment of <b>Foot</b> took <b>up</b> {{position}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs {{leading to}} the House. Pride stood {{at the top of}} the stairs. As MPs arrived, he checked them against the list provided to him; Lord Grey of Groby helped to identify those to be arrested and those to be prevented from entering. Prides Purge excluded all but about 200 members of the about the 500 member who had been entitled to sit before the purge.|$|R
