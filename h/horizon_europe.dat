Following exploratory semi‐structured interviews with town centre‐based shopping centre managers, the main {{stage of the}} research comprised a postal questionnaire. This investigated two main areas: {{the nature of the}} process by which marketing/promotional activities were planned; and the actual “marketing” activities used by respondents (and their perceived importance), with particular reference to marketing communications activities. The questionnaire was administered to shopping centre managers in urban shopping destinations classified as major city, major regional, regional and sub‐regional in the Management <b>Horizons</b> <b>Europe</b> UK Shopping Index – 173 destinations in total across the whole of the UK. The results are structured using Shimp's categories of general choices, specific choices and programme evaluation. Regarding general choices (i. e. targeting, objectives budgeting), centre positioning was regarded as very important and key target audiences were general public and media at the local/regional level. Objectives focused on raising centre profile and improving footfall. Centres spent an average of 13. 6 per cent of operating budget on promotional activities. With regard to specific choices (i. e. mixing communication elements, creating messages), the most widely used promotional elements were found to be press and radio advertising, events and festivals, leaflets and other promotional literature and also public relations. Evidence of integration between communications elements existed although there is potential for greater synergy...|$|R

40|$|High {{variability}} {{characterizes the}} winter climate of central Europe: interannual {{fluctuations in the}} surface-air temperature as large as 18 C over large areas are fairly common. The extraordinary early-winter 2000 in Europe {{appears to be a}} departure to an unprecedented extreme of the existing climate patterns. Such anomalous events affect agriculture, forestry, fuel consumption, etc., and thus deserve in-depth analysis. Our analysis indicates that the high anomalies of the surface-air temperature are predominantly due to the southwesterly flow from the eastern North Atlantic, with a weak contribution by southerly flow from the western Mediterranean. Backward trajectories based on the SSM/I and NCEP Reanalysis datasets traced from west-central Europe indicate that the warm air masses flowing into Europe originate in the southern North Atlantic, where the surface-air temperatures exceed by 15 c or more the climatic norms in Europe for late-November or early-December. Because such large ocean-to-continent temperature differences characterize the winter conditions, we refer to this episode which started in late November as occurring in the early winter. In this season, with the sun low over the <b>horizon</b> in <b>Europe,</b> absorption of insolation by the surface has little significance. The effect of cloudiness, a corollary to the low-level maritime-air advection, is a warming by a reduction of heat loss (greenhouse effect).

Independent chronological information suggests that the tephra is c. 42 000 - 45 000 years old, and geochemical analysis indicates that it is of basanitic composition. The latter suggests a possible origin in the Eifel; however, as yet, no other volcanic events or deposits can be correlated to the Les Echets tephra.

40|$|The Frasnian-Famennian (Late Devonian) mass {{extinction}} {{has often been}} related {{to the development of}} the Kellwasser anoxic events in Europe and North Africa but the synchronous development of the anoxia has not been reported from the Great Basin of the western United States. An integrated sedimentological, palaeoecological, and pyrite petrographic study has been undertaken on a range of F-F boundary sections from Nevada and Utah spanning a spectrum of carbonate and clastic depositional environments from distal basin, base-of-slope, mid-slope, and intrashelf basin settings. These reveal a range of facies from oxic strata, fully bioturbated and lacking any pyrite, to euxinic strata characterised by fine lamination and pyrite framboid populations of small size and narrow size range. Oxygen-restricted deposition is seen in all sections at various times, but the only interval characterised by basin-wide euxinicity occurs at the end of the Frasnian Stage late in the linguiformis Zone. This is the peak of the F-F {{mass extinction}} and it is also contemporaneous with the Upper Kellwasser <b>Horizon</b> of <b>Europe.</b> The study therefore reinforces the claim that the mass extinction coincides with the global development of marine anoxia. Shallow-water sections were not studied but slope and base-of-slope sections record many sediment-gravity flows that transported an allochthonous fauna into deeper water settings. This shallow-water fauna temporarily disappears late in the linguiformis Zone perhaps indicating the development of oxygen-restriction in shallow-water settings. Intriguingly the condensed, deepest water sections from the Woodruff basin record somewhat higher oxygenation levels than the contemporaneous slope sections. The most oxygen-restricted conditions may therefore have occurred in a mid-water oxygen-minimum zone that expanded its vertical range both upwards and downwards and became sulfidic late in the linguiformis Zone...|$|R

In most Western Interior Basin sites, in Colombia, and in Western Europe, two closely spaced elemental abundance peaks occur in the upper Cenomanian (about 92 m. y.), spanning the ammonite zones of Sciponoceras gracile through Neocardioceras juddii. Elements with anomalously high concentrations include Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Ir, Pt, and Au. The lower peak coincides with the disappearance (extinction) of the foraminifer Rotalipora cushmani. In North American sections R. greenhornensis also disappears at or just below this <b>horizon,</b> but in <b>Europe</b> it disappears considerably earlier than R. cushmani.

40|$|Recently, Husserl’s {{phenomenology}} of the “life-world” {{has been}} given special emphasis in those areas {{of the social sciences}} that are concerned with the crisis of values and meaning in our contemporary world. Husserl conceived the concept of “life-world” as a final introduction to his system of transcendental phenomenology, the project of a lifetime. As Husserl puts it in The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (7), phenomenology is not only the act of “senseinvestigation” (Besinnung), but also the universal “coming to self-awareness” (Selbstbesinnung) of humanity in a reflective manner, and herein precisely lies humanity’s responsibility towards itself. Husserl expected phenomenology to be the ultimate universal science, destined to ground all human achievements in the soil of the “life-world” (33 - 34). But can Husserl’s phenomenology accomplish this task effectively outside the <b>horizon</b> of <b>Europe,</b> and outside the context of a critique of modern science and technology? So as to try to answer this question, our aim will be to introduce some key concepts and notions that characterize Husserl’s phenomenology of the “life-world” or philosophy of genesis in the context of Aboriginal identity in Australia. For this purpose, we will offer a reading of Sally Morgan’s My Place, an autobiographical novel which narrates the personal quest of a woman of Aboriginal descend to find her roots and identity in a Westernized world. In the course of our analysis, we will describe in what ways some of Husserl’s notions related to the life-world are hindered in postcolonial contexts, and whether a phenomenological analysis can provide a means of reconcilement. Finally, we will also ask ourselves {{about the possibility of a}} phenomenological idea of history that respects the idiosyncracies of historicity...|$|R

A laboratory dose recovery test {{indicates that the}} single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) procedure is suitable for our samples (measured to a given dose ratio 0. 980 +/- 0. 005; n= 139). Completeness of resetting of the wedge infill of two samples was confirmed by single-grain analyses. The suite of optical ages indicates that repeated thermal contraction cracking, degradation and infilling with wind-blown sediment {{appear to have been}} commonplace in Flanders during the Late Pleniglacial (Oxygen Isotope Stage 2; OIS 2); more specifically, around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 21 kyr ago) and the transition period between the LGM and the start of the Lateglacial (similar to 15 kyr ago). Optical dating at one site has revealed two significantly older wedge levels, the younger inset into the older; the younger wedge has an age of 36 +/- 4 kyr (Middle Pleniglacial; OIS 3), the older wedge 129 +/- 11 kyr, which points to formation during the Late Saalian (OIS 6). Our OSL ages of the wedges and host sediments bracket formation of the BGB (Beuningen Gravel Bed: a widespread deflation <b>horizon</b> in northwestern <b>Europe)</b> at between similar to 15 and 18 kyr; this is in good agreement with previous OSL dating studies.

This paper considers the position of seven countries in South Asia: Afghanistan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Maldives; Nepal; Pakistan; and, Sri Lanka 1. It also identifies national and regional priorities for the seven themes under consideration. This paper is an output of the CASCADE project (Collaborative Action towards Societal Challenges through Awareness, Development, and Education) that aims to provide the foundation for a future International Cooperation Network programme targeting South Asian Countries, which will promote bi-regional coordination of Science & Technology cooperation. The EU recognise a need to strengthen internationalisation through strategic policy action. The need for linkages with Asian countries has been highlighted given the region’s rapidly growing research and innovation capacities and the urgency to address global challenges. The project coincides with the launch of <b>Horizon</b> 2020, a <b>Europe</b> 2020 flagship initiative aimed at securing Europe’s global competitiveness. Running from 2014 to 2020 with a budget of just over € 80 billion, the EU’s new programme for research and innovation is part of the drive to tackle global societal challenges, and create new growth and jobs. International cooperation in research and innovation is an essential element for meeting the objectives of Europe 2020.

40|$|AbstractFirst class {{transport}} {{is fundamental}} {{for a healthy}} society and a thriving economy. By providing {{a high degree of}} mobility for ideas, people and goods, it enables innovation to flourish, businesses to serve wide markets and citizens to travel easily for work and for pleasure. This leads to job creation; regional, national and EU economic development; better social cohesion and a better quality of life. This is why transport is one of the seven ‘Societal Challenges’ on which <b>Europe's</b> <b>Horizon</b> 2020 research programme is focusing in 2014 – 2020. Much is being done to improve transport in Europe in specific topics, including in technology, in networks and in financing. Yet Europe is failing to capture the full benefits of these investments. As the European Commission's 2011 Transport White Paper recognises, today's European transport system remains fragmented, inefficient and inadequate. Analysis of the root causes of this poor performance shows that, while technology barriers are significant, policy issues dominate. We examine the arguments for a more connected approach and report on progress towards achieving such an approach. This sees European transport as one system and optimises it as such. This contrasts with the present situation of many fragments, individually good but poorly related. This connected approach will lead to better overall transport provision and better results for the resources invested. However, transport involves many stakeholders, who tend to focus on their own specific modes and issues. Truly effective transport will only develop if all stakeholders work together. We consider new initiatives to bring together all relevant actors at EU, national and regional levels to tackle the problems described above. These would, for example: (i) bring a stronger systems-level perspective to research and development efforts; (ii) coordinate investments in demonstrators and pilots; (iii) identify and fast-track changes necessary in regulations and standards; and (iv) mobilise demand, in particular through better coordinated public procurement. Such an approach will build on existing initiatives, at modal, sectoral and administrative levels, and unlock the full value creation potential of existing investment programmes...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the three}} classic writers {{were still at}} their height, the first true {{movement}} in modern Yiddish literature sprang up in New York. The “Sweatshop Poets,” as this school {{has come to be}} called, were all immigrant workers who experienced [...] the inhumane working conditions in the factories of their day. The leading members of this group were Morris Rosenfeld, Morris Winchevsky, David Edelstadt and Joseph Bovshover. Their work centers on the subject of proletarian oppression and struggle, and uses the styles of Victorian verse, producing a rhetoric that is highly stylized. As a result it is little read or understood today. Simultaneously in Warsaw a group of writers centered around I. L. Peretz took Yiddish to another level of modern experimentation; they included David Pinski, S. Ansky, Sholem Asch and I.M. Weissenberg. A later Warsaw group, “Di Khalyastre” (“The Gang”) included notables such as Israel Joshua Singer, Peretz Hirshbein, Melech Ravitch and Uri Zvi Grinberg (who went on to write most of his work in Hebrew). Like their New York counterpart, Di Yunge (“The Young Ones”), they broke with earlier Yiddish writers and attempted to free Yiddish writing, particularly verse, from its preoccupation with politics and the fate of the Jews. Prominent members of Di Yunge included Mani Leib, Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, H. Leivick, Zishe Landau and the prose writers David Ignatoff, Lamed Shapiro and Isaac Raboy. Just a few years after Di Yunge came into prominence, a group called “In Zikh” (“Introspection”) declared itself the true avant garde, rejecting metered verse and declaring that non-Jewish themes were a valid topic for Yiddish poetry. The most important member of this group was Yankev Glatshteyn. Glatshteyn was interested in exotic themes, in poems that emphasized the sound of words, and later, as the Holocaust loomed and then took place, in reappropriations of Jewish tradition. His poem “A gute nakht, velt” (“Good Night, World,” 1938) seems to foresee the tragedy on the <b>horizon</b> in Eastern <b>Europe.</b> In Vilnius, Lithuania (called Vilna or Vilne by its Jewish inhabitants, {{and one of the most}} historically significant centers of Yiddish cultural activity), the group “Yung Vilne” (“Young Vilna”) included Chaim Grade, Abraham Sutzkever and Szmerke Kaczerginski. Grade’s short story “Mayn krig mit Hersh Raseyner” (“My Quarrel With Hershl Rasseyner”) is one of the classic post-Holocaust Yiddish stories, encapsulating the philosophical dilemma faced by many survivors. Sutzkever went on to be one of major poets of the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} achievements in modern society is the increase in life expectancy. This increment {{is so great that}} children born after 2011 have a one in three chance of reaching their 100 th birthday, and specifically in Europe, a quarter of the population will be over 60 years of age by 2020 (European Commission, 2014). This is an important change in society that is occurring {{for the first time in}} human history and producing new challenges that need to be addressed, especially those concerning age-related health problems. In this regard, one of the main aims of new research programs, such as <b>Horizon</b> 2020 in <b>Europe,</b> is to increase the possibilities of keeping older people healthy and independent as long as possible. To do so, it is critical to understand what processes can provoke, or at least contribute to, an increase in the vulnerability of older people because this will help to develop new strategies of prevention and intervention. Conserving good cognitive functioning is especially important for the maintenance of independent life. Therefore, it is essential to identify those mechanisms that can affect cognitive performance in older people and their adaptation to the environment. Along these lines, changes in the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) have been related to changes in the cognitive performance of both young and older people, and it has become a research target that can shed light on the changes that can be observed in aging. This dissertation presents the results of a research study focused on investigating the relationship between cognitive performance and the activity of the HPA-axis in older people. The first chapter of this dissertation provides a description of the HPA-axis, its main functions and the biological samples commonly used in research to measure the hormone cortisol, the end product of this neuroendocrine axis. Additionally, this chapter explains the age-related changes that can be observed in the circadian activity of the HPA-axis and in the stress-induced cortisol response. The last part of this chapter presents a short overview of the studies that have investigated the effects of acute stress and cortisol on memory performance in young and older people, and the relationship between the basal activity of the HPA-axis and cognitive performance in older people. The second and third chapters present two studies designed to investigate the effect of acute stress on memory in older men and women. The first empirical study of this dissertation investigated the effects of the cortisol response to stress on long-term memory retrieval. In the second study, two experiments were performed to investigate the effects of acute stress on the memory span and the executive component of the working memory. The fourth chapter describes the third study, designed to investigate whether differences in the long-term endogenous cortisol exposure and in the diurnal regulation of the HPA-axis are related to inter-individual differences in the cognitive performance of older people. In this study, a new technique was used to assess cortisol levels in hair samples, making it possible to measure cortisol exposure during the three months prior to the cognitive performance assessment. The fifth chapter includes a study designed to investigate whether the cortisol awakening response, a discrete component of the diurnal HPA-axis, was related to walking speed, a commonly used measure of physical activity that has been closely related to cognitive performance in older people. Also focused on the CAR, the sixth chapter describes the fifth study. It investigated whether the CAR is different in normotensive and hypertensive older people. Additionally, the relationship between the cortisol awakening response and cognitive performance was studied in these two groups. The seventh chapter contains a general discussion, the clinical implications of the findings, study limitations, and future considerations drawn from the results of the previous empirical studies. Finally, the eighth chapter includes a summary of the main conclusions of this doctoral dissertation...|$|R

A European humus group {{exists and}} has done some steps into a common {{classification}} of the humus forms; 2. The principles of the classification; 3. The future <b>horizons.</b> 1. In <b>Europe</b> {{as well as in}} North America a multitude of humus taxonomies exists starting with early approaches in the late 19 th century. Due to the variety of sites throughout Europe, different methodological approaches were used, thus resulting in different classification systems. The Canadian (Green et al. 1993) and French (Brêthes et al. 1998) classification systems are frequently used in an international context, but don’t cover all site conditions of European forest ecosystems. Basic concepts of most national European classification systems are similar along general lines. Nevertheless there are differences in parameters used for description and classification of humus forms as well as in scaling these parameters. This results in incompatibility of classifications on the lower levels of the systems. So, i. e. regional humus forms cannot be described and compared as similar designations of humus forms often having differing contents, and similar contents having differing names. In 2003, during a meeting in Trento (Italy), 26 European specialists in humus forms met in Trento (Italy) and of humus forms decided to create set up a “European humus research group” in order to study the process of transformation of the top soil and to find some rules of classification based on a morpho-genetic description and diagnostic horizons, adapted to European ecological conditions. The young born group managed established three commissions named “Vocabulary”, “Classification” and “Diffusion”. These organs of actiongroups produced some common references. and Tthise goal of the presention paper is to illustrates the most important steps in on this way. In July 2004, the commission Classification met in Vienna (Austria) and drew drafted a first schemakey in which to the main terrestrial humus forms have been placed on a plane in based on response to some environmental conditions and specific biological activities. The This draft has beenwas presented in Freiburg (Germany) at the EUROSOIL Congress 2004 (Jabiol et al. 2004) and renewed was worked out furtherly in San Vito (Italy) in 2005 in a well developed taxonomic draft. Protocols for assessment and sampling of ecto- and endorganic layers were set up as well as definitions of specific horizons and the their designation. 2. Taking into account the Canadian (Green et al., 1993) and the French points of view (Brêthes and al. 1998) as well as new national classification systems form Austria, the Netherlands and Germany, it has been possible to individuate four main humus forms (Mull, Moder, Mor and Amphihumus) are classed and each further dividing into many subcategories. Assigning a strong discriminating power to the actions of the pedofauna, which above all modifies the OH and A horizons characters and determines the evolution of the top soil in a given ecosystem, one canit is possible to class both humus form and ecosystem functioning. Mull humus forms are developed due to the mixing activity mainly of anecic and endogeic earthworms, mainly. In unfavourable ecological conditions for earthworms, Moder humus forms are developed by the litter comminuting activity of microarthropods and enchytraeids. Amphihumus corresponds to the activity of both animal groups in different vertical niches strata and, finally, Mor humus forms are found in ecosystems in which soil animal abundance is very low. Some properties are considered as taxonomic differentiae for humus forms: the presence/absence and thickness of diagnostic horizon, type and size of horizons’ structure, presence/quantity of roots, woody debris and rock. Thanks to a Dutch input, the last version of the classification takes into account also the semi-terrestrial ecosystems. Conceived as a dichotomised tree, the first bifurcation of the key divides peat from terrestrial forms. The descriptors for the diagnostic horizons have been conceived in harmony with the FAOWRB-draft (1998) and will be presented in Philadelphia by Broll G. et al. under the title "Topsoil characterization and classifications. New developments and chances for links to WRB. 3. From 2004, a web site is active in Grenoble (France) : [URL] The 40 members of the group are from 10 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Rumania, Sweden, Switzerland). The running projects concern nowdeal with better definitions of the Amphi- and Litho- humus forms and all the transitional cases, particularly between Amphihumus - Moder and Moder - Mor. Three meetings are planned in order to look all together at peat (Netherlands, Alterra, 2006), high mountain (France, Grenoble, 2007) and Mediterranean (Italy, Cagliari, 2007) ecosystems. It currently is considered to use the present classification within the BioSoil project of the European Community (repetition of transnational soil condition monitoring) ...|$|R
