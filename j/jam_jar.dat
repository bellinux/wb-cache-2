25|$|The band {{have cited}} bands such as Fugazi, Polvo and Archers of Loaf as {{influences}} for the albums sessions, while Brian Lane proclaimed {{that the main}} influence for their progression towards the more aggressive and raw sound was coming off of tour and being bored of the songs {{that they had been}} playing. Accardi had been listening to albums such as Ten by Pearl <b>Jam,</b> <b>Jar</b> of Flies by Alice in Chains, and Purple and Core by Stone Temple Pilots. Garrett Tierney looked to emulate some of the bass guitar sounds found on the records of The Jesus Lizard and Hüsker Dü.|$|E

5000|$|An AA {{statement}} said: [...] "A lady about 75 {{was seen}} filling up 20 empty one-gallon paint tins with plastic lids {{and also a}} tray of <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> in her boot with petrol.” The incident was in Macclesfield, Cheshire.|$|R
5000|$|By 1947 their top-selling {{range of}} jams, jellies and [...] "Olde English Marmalade" [...] was {{produced}} alongside baking powder, ground coffee, vegetables, apple juice, mincemeat, honey, jelly crystals, and curt. They held the patent for the replaceable metal lid to their glass <b>jam</b> <b>jars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Cauty {{works with}} the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop, London which he {{explains}} [...] "is not a gallery, it’s a support system, spiritual home and technical epicentre for {{a small group of}} artists" [...] which includes Billy Childish, Jamie Reid and Harry Adams. Cauty first worked in conjunction with L-13 on the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice. Subsequent collaborations included the Riot In A <b>Jam</b> <b>Jar</b> exhibitions and the ADP Riot Tour - is a vast 1:87 scale model in a 40 foot shipping container which tours historic riot sites around the world. L-13 continue to collaborate with Cauty and Drummond, running [...] "dead perch merch", official merchandise operatives to The JAMs.|$|E
2500|$|They {{filled a}} <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> with {{gasoline}} {{and placed it}} in the back seat with the intention of setting the car and weapons on fire to destroy evidence after the robbery. Phillips wore roughly [...] of equipment, including a Type IIIA bulletproof vest and groin guard; a load bearing vest and multiple military canteen pouches for ammunition storage; and several pieces of homemade body armor created from spare vests, covering his shins, thighs, and forearms. Mătăsăreanu wore only a Type IIIA bulletproof vest, but included a metal trauma plate to protect vital organs. Additionally, both robbers had sewn watch faces onto the back of their gloves to check their timing inside the bank. Before entering, they took the barbiturate phenobarbital, prescribed to Mătăsăreanu as a sedative, to calm their nerves.|$|E
2500|$|Hairy Jam – <b>Jam</b> <b>jar</b> mechanic, {{also called}} [...] "Damaged Jam" [...] in the Goovies. However, {{he is not}} good at his job, as his lack of {{mechanical}} skills and carelessness with tools always seem to get his customers killed/seriously injured. Does not seem to take interest in the other jams' rebellion against the government, but has an obsession with baked beans, which, he claims, [...] "everyone loves." [...] Like Hairy Lee, he is hairy all over. First appeared in [...] "Band", where he killed off three Jams, stating that he is high. Believes that hitting a car repeatedly with a hammer and filling it with beans gives the best cleaning results. Last seen as an employee at Pissy Werld (wearing a Tesco Value label), along with Shopkeep, The Mysterious Chicken and The Captain of the Farm.|$|E
5000|$|The International Playboys were {{a fusion}} of classic rock 'n roll, 80s acid <b>jams,</b> <b>jarring</b> vocals, and stage showmanship. The band was well known for their wild presence, sweaty dimestore suits, and the wild unkempt hair of lead vocalist Monty Carlo, who was {{referred}} to by critics as [...] "Joe Cocker, punk rocker".|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Jams</b> – <b>Jam</b> <b>jars</b> {{who try to}} {{overthrow}} the government and fight for freedom, though not very successfully. First appeared in [...] "Wrong", in which they distracted Weebl in order for Chris the Ninja Pirate to steal Donkey. Probably based on the popular band 'The Jam', as they share the name and are a tad revolutionary, spreading political messages through music.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} {{national}} scheme, a salvage officer was appointed, and a derelict building at the bottom of Grove Lane was used to store paper, bottles, <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> and metal; collections were made by the WVS aided by schoolchildren. In addition to finding material for the war effort, the salvage fund raised money for local charities and especially for the village hall building fund.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ideas of}} A Riot in a <b>Jam</b> <b>Jar</b> {{evolved into the}} Aftermath Dislocation Principle, shown at the Hoxton Arches in October 2013. The 448 square foot {{installation}} at 1:87 scale (representing approximately one square mile) details the desolate and charred aftermath of what {{appears to have been}} a devastating riot. The sculpture, constructed by modifying components of traditional model railway kits, took approximately 8 months to complete includes nearly 3,000 police figures and a soundtrack pitched to match the 1:87 scale. The piece [...] "makes a political statement about societal freedom and state control". The Aftermath Dislocation principle then toured the Netherlands, being shown at Piet Hein Eek Gallery, Eindhoven (November 2013), Cultuurwerf, Vlissingen (April 2014), and Mediamatic, Amsterdam (July–August 2014). In 2015 the work was exhibited at Dismaland and then London. Following this it was re-engineered to fit inside a 40-foot shipping container and now tours historic riot sites around the world.|$|E
2500|$|The rabbi's wife tries {{in vain to}} {{stop her}} children, aged four and eight, {{fighting}} in her bunk. Her neighbours, kept awake by the din, swear at them. A woman screams because a mouse has run over her face. Bedbugs drop from the higher bunks onto the lower. Another woman screams because the little boy in the bunk above her has spilled the <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> he uses as a chamber pot all over her. Somebody has whooping cough. Another little boy begs his mother not to beat him because in his sleep he wet the bunk he shares with her. She does and he squeals. A former night-club dancer tells dirty stories about her ex-colleagues to the refined Orthodox language teacher, who does not know whether to block her ears or to laugh. A spoilt rich wife has hung her clothes on all available nails, leaving no room for anybody else. The passage ends with: [...] "In 24 out of 24 hours there is never a minute's silence ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams was {{the subject}} of several TV documentaries. [...] "My Experience with Autism, Emotion and Behavior" [...] (1993), an episode, on Eye to Eye with Connie Chung was {{broadcast}} in the United States. Beth Fouse and Maria Wheeler describe Williams' interview and her mode of communication in their book, A Treasure Chest of Behavioral Strategies for Individuals with Autism (1997). Williams had [...] "difficulties in processing incoming information. She needed to listen or look. She could not use auditory and visual channels at the same time". On <b>Jam</b> <b>Jar</b> (1995), by Fresh Film in association with BBC Four, which aired in the UK, Williams provided her audience with a greater depth of understanding of autism. The documentary provided Joe Geraci with Williams' [...] "provocative argument about academics coming to some kind of understanding of autism" [...] where she described the 'inside-out' world, [...] " [...] has his own system, and it's not an infantile version of [...] system; they haven't learned his system". It was nominated for the Mental Health Media Award. Yokosho Watashi No Sekai E [...] "Jiheisho" [...] Donna Williams (1995), was broadcast by NHK TV in Japan. Krankheit als Schicksal (English: Illness as fate), was filmed in 1995, by Hamburg's Spiegel TV, and was aired on 25 January 1997 in Germany. It is titled Dann Verstehe Ich Auch Nur Bla, Bla, Bla (English: Then I Only Understood Too Much Bla, Bla, Bla).|$|E
40|$|Series of {{drawings}} and digital videos articulating movement within empty spaces. The drawings are of time-lapse videos of cloud movement {{on a number}} of different days, but rather than depicting visible forms, instead depict movement vectors as made visible by cloud movement. Video works are analogous to the drawings but the articulation of shapes within given voids are made visible through (a) recordings of starling mass movement and (b) moths captured in <b>jam</b> <b>jars...</b>|$|R

50|$|At {{about the}} same time that the wave of German potters arrived, so did a new type of pot. It was {{designed}} for a very specific purpose: to contain a newly fashionable beverage. Coffee had been introduced as the drink of choice among the European elite. Since the Bunzlauer clays tolerated rapid changes in temperature they were well-suited in the making of coffee pots. These coffee pots were often accompanied sugar bowls, <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> and milk pitchers to complete the coffee service, all covered in a coffee-colored slip.|$|R
50|$|Successful {{versions}} of the <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> jet have been run in a plastic bottle. The bottle is far less efficient than the <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> versions and is unable to sustain a decent jet {{for more than a}} few seconds. It is theorized that the alcohol that was used to operate the simple jet was acting as a barrier to stop the heat getting all the way through to the plastic. For the <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> jet design to work the propellant must be vaporised to ignite which is most often done by a shaking of the jet which causes the propellant to coat the container, therefore giving the theory some validity.|$|E

50|$|Although Cragg Vale {{is a small}} linear village, it has two pubs The Robin Hood Inn and the Hinchliffe Arms, as well as Cragg Vale J and I {{school and}} a Caravan park. In {{the last few years}} the village has {{expanded}} with a children's nursery called The Ark, a recording studio Aspire Technology and an online fancy dress retailer Atlantis Fancy Dress being added to the village. One of the businesses to launch most recently is Preserve Shop, a retailer of <b>jam</b> <b>jars,</b> <b>jam</b> making equipment and kitchenware for home preserving. The main business area in Cragg Vale is Top Land Country Business Park. Another enterprise is The Little Valley Brewery which produces such locally named brews as Cragg Vale Bitter, Stoodley Stout, Hebdens Wheat & Tod's Blonde among others.|$|R
50|$|Mesoleptus hibernica is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} wasp that was discovered by Dr. Chris Williams, in County Mayo, when {{he was waiting for}} marsh flies to hatch in <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> on his desk. Instead of flies, two wasp species emerged. Scientists from Italy, Finland and the United Kingdom identified the species. Mesoleptus hibernica females lay their eggs in fly larvae and when the eggs hatch, the wasps eat the larvae. It was the first parasitic wasp species that was discovered in Ireland that was new to science. It was named after the ancient Latin name of the country, Hibernia.|$|R
60|$|We chattered; we laughed; we sniggled {{together}} like schoolgirls in amusement at the passers-by, in the strange, busy High Street. I devoured the entrancing wares {{in the shop}} windows--milliner, hairdresser and perfumer, confectioner; even the pyramids of <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> and sugar-cones in the grocer's, and the soaps, syrups, and sponges of Mr Simpkins--Beechwood's pharmaceutical chemist. Out of the sovereign which I had brought with me from my treasure-chest Pollie made purchases on my behalf. For Mrs Bowater, a muslin tie for the neck; for herself--after heated controversy--a pair of kid gloves {{and a bottle of}} frangipani; and for me a novel.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, when Johnson thick-edged a {{ball for}} four, Hutton had had enough. He stood arms akimbo and told Johnson, [...] "Why don't you (expletive) off {{back onto the}} Robertson's <b>jam</b> <b>jar,</b> you Golliwog." [...] Everybody, {{including}} Johnson, fell about laughing. Hutton meant that Johnson's high afro hair-style, resembled the Golliwog trademark on the Robertson's <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> labels. As D'Oliveira's nickname was Dolly, the Worcestershire players jokingly dubbed this incident [...] "The Dolly and Golly Show".|$|E
50|$|The {{item was}} invented by Samuel Sorensen Adams of the S.S. Adams Co. circa 1915. Adams' wife Emily had been {{complaining}} about the <b>jam</b> <b>jar,</b> saying that it wasn't properly closed or that it was sticky. Adams, inspired by her nagging, then invented a spring snake - a coil of wire wrapped in a cloth skin, and compressed the two-foot snake into a little <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> {{so that it would}} jump out when the lid was removed.|$|E
50|$|The United Arab Emirates premiere {{took place}} in Dubai in April 2013 with Director Nina Hein, at the <b>Jam</b> <b>Jar.</b> Actors were Russell Bell (Michael), Brook Butterworth (Annette), Mike Green (Alan) and Sophie Paris (Veronica).|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, Beek {{started to}} draw the comic strip [...] for the jam factory [...] "". It was a metre long and was {{displayed}} on shelves {{in front of the}} <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> in stores. Beek's wife, Freddie Langeler (1899-1948), herself an artist, wrote the rhyming text for the strip and coloured in the drawings. In 1936, a printer named De IJssel produced a cardboard theatre which could be used to display the comic strip as a slide show. It was illuminated from behind with a flashlight. It was dubbed the [...] "Flipposcoop" [...] (Flipposcope) and Flipje appeared in a special strip with instructions on how to assemble and load the theatre.|$|R
50|$|Julie is {{concerned}} about M.J. taking advantage of Susan when he begins {{to do whatever he}} wants by eating ice cream for breakfast and playing video games {{during the middle of the}} night. Julie tries to tell Susan that he can't keep acting up, but Susan is reluctant to discipline him because of what he must be going through now that Mike's dead. When M.J. assaults his teacher Susan realizes that she must show M.J. different ways to deal with his pain. The two of them decide to smash <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> against the wall as a way to get their anger out. After smashing a few jars, M.J. and Susan both begin to cry and comfort one another.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} of these was [...] "The Female Christ" [...] (1969) when his wife Lene Adler Petersen walked naked with a cross through the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in order to remind society of Christ's visit to the temple. Trading was suspended {{for the rest of the}} day. Another was his [...] "Horse Sacrifice" [...] (1970) where he slaughtered a horse on a field in the north of Sealand and carved it up into small pieces which he put into hundreds of <b>jam</b> <b>jars.</b> Here he was successful in encouraging the press to focus on the Vietnam War and hunger in Biafra. The happening caused quite a commotion and debate.|$|R
50|$|The snake <b>jam</b> <b>jar</b> then {{evolved into}} a whole array of products, {{including}} the snake peanut brittle can, the snake mint can, and the best-selling snake nut can. In the 1990s Adams' grandson produced snake potato chips.|$|E

50|$|The variant {{was based}} on a prop owned by screenwriter Terry Nation which had been used in the second Doctor Who film. The neck bin mesh, struts and neck rings were removed, the latter items being {{replaced}} by new rings having a flat, recessed edge detailed with small rivets rather than the usual bevel. Lilac dome lights shaped like upturned <b>jam</b> <b>jars</b> were fitted, together with an eyeball resembling a flashlight which lit up when it spoke. It was painted in gloss black with yellow-gold hemispheres, slats, neck rings and dome. It is uncertain who carried out the conversion work, although the painting of the prop was undertaken by the BBC Visual Effects Department under the direction of Clifford Culley.|$|R
60|$|The {{tone was}} one of pathetic entreaty. I turned the handle and entered. It was a small room, dimly lighted by a dirty window, {{the bottom half of}} which was {{rendered}} opaque by tissue paper pasted to its panes. The place suggested a village shop rather than an office. Pots of <b>jam,</b> <b>jars</b> of pickles, bottles of wine, biscuit tins, parcels of drapery, boxes of candles, bars of soap, boots, packets of stationery, boxes of cigars, tinned provisions, guns, cartridges--things sufficient to furnish a desert island littered every available corner. At a small desk under the window sat a youth with a remarkably small body and a remarkably large head; so disproportionate were the two I should hardly have been surprised had he put up his hands and taken it off. Half in the room and half out, I paused.|$|R
