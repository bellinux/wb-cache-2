30|$|For {{the crisis}} {{management}} example, we performed 10 series of 1000 experiments. These experiments had two objectives: the first <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the proposed MILP approach {{has a real}} qualitative advantage over local optimization.

25|$|One common way {{of proving}} that a {{polyhedron}} is integral <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{it is totally}} unimodular. There are other general methods including the integer decomposition property and total dual integrality. Other specific well-known integral LPs include the matching polytope, lattice polyhedra, submodular flow polyhedra, and the intersection of 2 generalized polymatroids/g-polymatroids --- e.g. see Schrijver 2003.|$|E
25|$|Badiou makes {{repeated}} use {{of several}} concepts throughout his philosophy. One of {{the aims of}} his thought <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique. Therefore, he uses them to interrogate art and history as well as ontology and scientific discovery. Johannes Thumfart argues that Badiou's philosophy {{can be regarded as}} a contemporary reinterpretation of Platonism.|$|E

25|$|The {{easiest way}} to see this is {{isomorphic}} to βN <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> it satisfies the universal property. For f: N → K with K compact Hausdorff and F an ultrafilter on N we have an ultrafilter f(F) on K, the pushforward of F. This has a unique limit, say x, because K is compact Hausdorff, and we define βf(F) = x. This may readily be verified to be a continuous extension.|$|E
25|$|For {{refutation}} tableaux, {{the objective}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the negation of a formula cannot be satisfied. There are rules for handling {{each of the}} usual connectives, starting with the main connective. In many cases, applying these rules causes the subtableau to divide into two. Quantifiers are instantiated. If any branch of a tableau leads to an evident contradiction, the branch closes. If all branches close, the proof is complete and the original formula is a logical truth.|$|E
25|$|The {{decorative}} schemes {{in churches}} have often reflected the Church's role. One point of emphasis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the Church {{was founded by}} the apostles and its history goes back to that time without a break. One way a church might reflect this {{was to have the}} relics of an apostle or an early martyr. There was a great trade in body parts of different religious notables. At least three churches claim to have the body of Mary Magdalene.|$|E

25|$|In general, some subsets {{of a set}} in L {{will not}} be in L. So the whole power set of a set in L will usually not be in L. What we need here <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the {{intersection}} of the power set with L is in L. Use replacement in V to show that there is an α such that the intersection is a subset of Lα. Then the intersection is {z | z∈Lα and z is a subset of x} ∈ Lα+1. Thus the required set is in L.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a proof is formalized {{in the field of}} {{mathematical}} logic. A formal proof is written in a formal language instead of a natural language. A formal proof is defined as sequence of formulas in a formal language, in which each formula is a logical consequence of preceding formulas. Having a definition of formal proof makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of proof theory studies formal proofs and their properties, for example, the property that a statement has a formal proof. An application of proof theory <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> certain undecidable statements are not provable.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mishnah Hillel went to Jerusalem {{with the}} {{intention}} of studying biblical exposition and tradition at the age of 40 in 70 BCE. The difficulties Hillel had to overcome to gain admittance to the school of Sh'maya and Abtalion, and the hardships he suffered while pursuing his aim, are told in a touching passage (Talmud, tractate Yoma 35b), the ultimate purpose of which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> poverty cannot be considered an obstacle to the study of Torah. Some time later, Hillel succeeded in settling a question concerning the sacrificial ritual in a manner that showed his superiority over the Benei Betheira (literally, sons of Betheira), who were at that time the heads of the Sanhedrin. On that occasion, it is narrated, they voluntarily resigned their position as Nasi (President) in favor of Hillel. After the resignation of the Benei Betheira, Hillel was recognized as the highest authority among the Pharisees (predecessors to Rabbinic Judaism). Hillel {{was the head of the}} great school, at first associated with Menahem the Essene, who might be the same Menahem the Essene as the one mentioned by Flavius Josephus in relation to King Herod, afterward with Shammai, Hillel's peer in the teaching of Jewish Law.|$|E

500|$|Clifton and Ebert, too, {{focussed}} on Cochrane's {{attempt to}} find and conceptualise a middle ground between the work of Regan (who advocates animal rights) and Singer (who advocates animal welfare from a utilitarian perspective), and Meijer praised it for identifying a conceptual space between animal rights and animal liberation. Clifton suggested that Cochrane's thought is actually closer to Regan's. Boisseau, though, suggested that, given that Cochrane allows some use of animals in entertainment and genetic engineering, the arguments of Animal Rights Without Liberation may come across as [...] "radically permissive" [...] when {{compared with those of}} other animal rights positions. The permissibility of some forms of animal experimentation under Cochrane's account [...] "may shock" [...] supporters of approaches based upon Regan's philosophy. Ebert concluded that [...] "the great accomplishment of Cochrane's book <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> there is a coherent, intuitively plausible, and useful notion of animal rights that is firmly rooted in the tangible and avoids the unattractive absolutism of Regan-style rights views". Meijer felt that the book is strong on the application of Cochrane's account, but she expressed concern about Cochrane's rejection of liberty rights for animals, which, she noted, most approaches to animal rights allow. Cochrane's deploys, she noted, a narrow account of animal agency; [...] "it is", she argued, [...] "problematic to view humans as autonomous agents and other animals as nonautonomous others". Cochrane's view of animals as non-autonomous, she argued, is emphasised by the absence of an account of relationships and communication between humans and animals.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
