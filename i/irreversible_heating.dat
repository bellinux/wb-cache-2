The significant temperature increase from 13 to 37 K, amounting to 700 J/mol, is observed due to the <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> at the first order phase transition. We argue that the hysteresis loss of the magnetization curve and the dissipative structural transformation account for the <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating.</b> The measurement of the <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> can be utilized for detecting the first-order phase transition in good combination with the ultrahigh magnetic fields generated in microseconds.

40|$|Recent X-ray {{observations}} of merger shocks in galaxy clusters {{have shown that}} the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons hotter than the electrons. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study the physics of electron <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> in perpendicular low Mach number shocks, for a representative case with sonic Mach number of 3 and plasma beta of 16. We find that two basic ingredients are needed for electron entropy production: (i) an electron temperature anisotropy, induced by field amplification coupled to adiabatic invariance; and (ii) a mechanism to break the electron adiabatic invariance itself. In shocks, field amplification occurs at two major sites: at the shock ramp, where density compression leads to an increase of the frozen-in field; and farther downstream, where the shock-driven proton temperature anisotropy generates strong proton cyclotron and mirror modes. The electron temperature anisotropy induced by field amplification exceeds the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of whistler waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for efficient entropy production. We find that the electron heating efficiency displays only a weak dependence on mass ratio (less than 30 percent drop, as we increase the mass ratio from 49 up to 1600). We develop an analytical model of electron <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> and show that it is in excellent agreement with our simulation results.

This effect of increased dawn-dusk mobility is particularly dramatic when electrons are introduced in the calculation, and is in agreement with the results of kinetic particle simulations.

We examine such impact behavior of Cu nanoparticles with molecular dynamics simulations, for different particle sizes (1 – 15 nm in radius) and impact velocities (25 – 200 m s^(− 1)). The impact can be ultra-elastic (R > 1) or inelastic (R < 1). Ultra-elastic or inelastic impact may occur for the smallest nanoparticles soly due to fluctuations, and the impact is inelastic but can be highly elastic (R 0. 9 – 1) for larger sizes. R decreases with increasing size and impact velocity in general.

We find that our condition resembles with the generalized condition to achieve an optimized work output for generalized <b>irreversible</b> <b>heat</b> engines in the nonlinear regime [Y. Wang, Phys.

We also find that the optimized efficiency obtained by this minimally nonlinear <b>irreversible</b> <b>heat</b> engine can reach the reversible efficiency under the tight coupling condition {{in which there is no}} heat leakage between the system and the reservoirs.

40|$|Abstract: The {{instability}} of a modulated ultrarelativistic electron beam in a dense plasma is investigated under conditions when the phase oscillations in the beam are suppressed by the relativistic {{increase of the}} electron mass, and the nonlinear mechanism of saturation of the oscillation amplitude can be described by the dependence of the plasma permittivity on the field amplitude.

40|$|A {{causal link}} between major impact events and global {{processes}} would probably require {{a significant change}} in the thermal state of the Earth's interior, presumably brought about by coupling of impact energy. One possible mechanism for such energy coupling from the surface to the deep interior would be through focusing due to axial symmetry. Antipodal focusing of surface and body waves from earthquakes is a well-known phenomenon which has previously been exploited by seismologists in studies of the Earth's deep interior. Antipodal focusing from impacts on the Moon, Mercury, and icy satellites has also been invoked by planetary scientists to explain unusual surface features opposite some of the large impact structures on these bodies. For example, 'disrupted' terrains have been observed antipodal to the Caloris impact basis on Mercury and Imbrium Basin on the Moon. Very recently there have been speculations that antipodal focusing of impact energy within the mantle may lead to flood basalt and hotspot activity, but there has not yet been an attempt at a rigorous model. A new hypothesis was proposed and preliminary proof-of-principle tests for the coupling of energy from major impacts to the mantle by axial focusing of seismic waves was performed. Because of the axial symmetry of the explosive source, the phases and amplitudes are dependent only on ray parameter (or takeoff angle) and are independent of azimuthal angle. For a symmetric and homogeneous Earth, all the seismic energy radiated by the impact at a given takeoff angle will be refocused (minus attenuation) on the axis of symmetry, regardless of the number of reflections and refractions it has experienced. Mantle material near the axis of symmetry will experience more strain cycles with much greater amplitude than elsewhere and will therefore experience more <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating.</b> The situation is very different than for a giant earthquake, which in addition to having less energy, has an asymmetric focal mechanism and a larger area. Two independent proof-of-principle approaches were used. The first makes use of seismic simulations, which are being performed with a realistic Earth model to determine the degree of focusing along the axis and to estimate the volume of material, if any, that experiences significant <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating.</b> The second involves two-dimensional hydrodynamic code simulations to determine the stress history, internal energy, and temperature rise as a function of radius along the axis...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} dissipative anomalies in {{a turbulent}} fluid {{governed by the}} compressible Navier-Stokes equation. We follow an exact approach pioneered by Onsager, which we explain as a non-perturbative application {{of the principle of}} renormalization-group invariance. In the limit of high Reynolds and Péclet numbers, the flow realizations are found to be described as distributional or "coarse-grained" solutions of the compressible Euler equations, with standard conservation laws broken by turbulent anomalies. The anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy is shown to be due not only to local cascade, but also to a distinct mechanism called pressure-work defect. <b>Irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> in stationary, planar shocks with an ideal-gas equation of state exemplifies the second mechanism. Entropy conservation anomalies are also found to occur by two mechanisms: an anomalous input of negative entropy (negentropy) by pressure-work and a cascade of negentropy to small scales.

40|$|Hot collisionless {{accretion}} flows, {{such as the}} one in Sgr A^* at our Galactic center, {{provide a}} unique setting for the investigation of magnetic reconnection. Here, protons are non-relativistic while electrons can be ultra-relativistic. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate electron and proton heating in the outflows of trans-relativistic reconnection (i. e., σ_w∼ 0. 1 - 1, where the magnetization σ_w is the ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy density). For both electrons and protons, we find that heating at high β_ i (here, β_ i is the ratio of proton thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) is dominated by adiabatic compression ('adiabatic heating'), while at low β_ i it is accompanied by a genuine increase in entropy ('irreversible heating'). For our fiducial σ_w= 0. 1, the <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> efficiency at β_ i≲ 1 is nearly independent of the electron-to-proton temperature ratio T_ e/T_ i (which we vary from 0. 1 up to 1), and it asymptotes to ∼ 2 % of the inflowing magnetic energy in the low-β_ i limit. Protons are heated more efficiently than electrons at low and moderate β_ i (by a factor of ∼ 7), whereas the electron and proton heating efficiencies become comparable at β_ i∼ 2 if T_ e/T_ i= 1, when both species start already relativistically hot. We find comparable heating efficiencies between the two species also in the limit of relativistic reconnection (σ_w≳ 1). Our results have important implications for the two-temperature nature of collisionless accretion flows, and may provide the sub-grid physics needed in general relativistic MHD simulations.

40|$|High-resolution imaging of some protoplanetary disks in {{scattered}} light reveals {{presence of the}} global spiral arms of significant amplitude, likely excited by massive planets or stellar companions. Assuming that these arms are density waves, evolving into spiral shocks, we assess their effect on the thermodynamics, accretion, and global evolution of the disk. We derive analytical expressions for the direct (<b>irreversible)</b> <b>heating,</b> angular momentum transport, and mass accretion rate induced by the disk shocks of arbitrary strength. We find these processes to be very sensitive to the shock amplitude. Focusing on the waves of moderate strength (density jump at the shock ΔΣ/Σ∼ 1) we show the associated disk heating to be negligible (contributing at ∼ 1 % level to the energy budget) in passive, irradiated protoplanetary disks on ∼ 100 AU scales, but becoming important within several AU from the star. At the same time, shock heating can be a significant (or even dominant) energy source in disks of cataclysmic variables, stellar X-ray binaries, and supermassive black hole binaries, heated mainly by viscous dissipation. Mass accretion induced by the global spiral shocks is comparable to (or exceeds) the mass inflow due to viscous stresses. Protoplanetary disks featuring prominent global spirals must be evolving rapidly, in ≲ 0. 5 Myr at ∼ 100 AU. A direct upper limit on the disk evolution timescale can be established via the measurement of the gravitational torque due to the spiral arms from the imaging data. Our findings suggest that, regardless of their origin, global spiral waves must be important agents of the protoplanetary disk evolution. They may serve as an effective mechanism of disk dispersal and {{could be related to}} the transitional disk phenomenon. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|E
40|$|Recent X-ray {{observations}} of merger shocks in galaxy clusters {{have shown that}} the post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons being hotter than the electrons. In this work, the second of a series, we investigate by means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations the efficiency of electron <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> in perpendicular low Mach number shocks. We consider values of plasma beta (ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures) in the range 4 ≲β_p 0 ≲ 32 and sonic Mach number (ratio of shock speed to pre-shock sound speed) in the range 2 ≲ M_s≲ 5, as appropriate for galaxy cluster shocks. As shown in Paper I, magnetic field amplification - induced by shock compression of the pre-shock field, or by strong proton cyclotron and mirror modes accompanying the relaxation of proton temperature anisotropy - can drive the electron temperature anisotropy beyond the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of whistler waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for efficient entropy production. We find that the post-shock electron temperature T_e 2 exceeds the adiabatic expectation T_e 2, ad by an amount (T_e 2 -T_e 2, ad) /T_e 0 ≃ 0. 044 M_s (M_s- 1) (here, T_e 0 is the pre-shock temperature), which depends only weakly on the plasma beta, over the range 4 ≲β_p 0 ≲ 32 which we have explored, and on the proton-to-electron mass ratio (the coefficient of ≃ 0. 044 is measured for our fiducial m_i/m_e= 49, and we estimate that it will decrease to ≃ 0. 03 for the realistic mass ratio).

40|$|When {{interpreting}} thermomagnetic {{curves of}} non-saturated magnetic minerals, <b>irreversible</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling curves need not necessarily imply chemical or structural changes. Increased aligning of magnetic moments on heating in an {{applied magnetic field}} can also induce an irreversible cooling curve. The two processes can be distinguished by stirring the sample between subsequent thermomagnetic runs. Sample redispersion considerably enhances the interpretative value of thermomagnetic analysis and is therefore strongly recommended, in particular when analysing non-saturated magnetic minerals. Stirring between subsequent runs was extensively used {{in the analysis of}} the thermomagnetic behaviour of haematite and goethite as a function of grain size (i. e. coercivity) in various non-saturating magnetic fields (10 - 350 mT). The shape of the thermomagnetic heating curves of haematite is shown to be dependent on the competitive interplay between the temperature dependence of the exchange energy and that of the coercive force with respect to the applied field. On heating, pure defectpoor haematite, which is magnetically dominated by the canted moment, has an initially increasing thermomagnetic heating curve. Further heating causes the magnetization to increase smoothly up to a certain temperature which depends critically on the applied field and the coercivity of the sample. The irreversible block-shaped thermomagnetic cooling curve lies above the heating curve, and shows hardly any dependence on applied field and grain size. In contrast to the heating curve, the shape of the cooling curve depends only on the temperature variation of the exchange energy. Our data seem to indicate that for defect-poor haematites the domain configuration acquired at the maximum heating temperature is retained on cooling to room temperature. More defect-rich haematite has a gently decreasing thermomagnetic heating curve. On heating to increasingly elevated temperatures (800 °C) the defects are annealed out off the lattice, because the thermomagnetic curves approach those of defect-poor haematite. The defect moment due to lattice defects seems to be additive to, but softer than, the canted moment. The canted and defect moment appear to have the same Neel (or Curie) temperature (= 680 °C), because no change in temperature was observed, whilst the relative contributions did change.
