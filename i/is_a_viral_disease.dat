5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on {{the left or right}} of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of}} the body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E

Although PDD was long suspected to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> based on epidemiologic observations and the typical lesions, it was not until 2008 that was first identified the presence of a novel Borna virus ininfected birds,which was named Avian Bornavirus(ABV).

50|$|HLB was {{originally}} thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease,</b> but <b>was</b> later discovered {{to be caused}} by bacteria, carried by insect vectors. HLB infection can arise in various climates and is often associated with different species of psyllid insects. For example, citrus crops in Africa become infected under cool conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the African citrus psyllid Trioza ertreae, an invasive insect that favors cool and moist conditions for optimal growth. Citrus crops in Asia, however, are often infected under warm conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri.|$|R
25|$|Yellow fever <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> of {{typically}} short duration. In most cases, {{symptoms include}} fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains {{particularly in the}} back, and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within five days. In about 15% of people within a day of improving, the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is also increased.|$|E
25|$|Mumps <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the mumps virus. Initial signs and {{symptoms}} often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling {{but this does not}} increase the risk of infertility.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{distemper}} (sometimes termed hardpad disease) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{that affects}} {{a wide variety}} of animal families, including domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and large cats, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, {{and a variety of other}} species. It was long believed that animals in the family Felidae, including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were resistant to canine distemper, until some researchers reported the prevalence of CDV infection in large felids. It is now known that both large Felidae and domestic cats can be infected, usually through close housing with dogs or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats, but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Rugose wood disease {{complex is}} one of the most {{important}} graft-transmissible grapevine diseases and it is considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease.</b> With the aim to obtain more information about appearance of rugose wood disease observed on cultivar ‘Refošk’, ‘Refošk’ vines from collection vineyard in Komen were used for green grafting on SO 4 rootstock and autografts for control were made as well. Rugose wood symptoms were observed on grafts of two ‘Refošk’ biotypes, which confirmed graft transmissibility. Appearance of rugose wood symptoms on autografts excluded the impact of incompatibility in rugose wood disease, but at the same time it could be proposed that stress caused by grafting has an important role...|$|R

25|$|Rabies <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>viral</b> <b>disease</b> {{that causes}} {{inflammation}} of the brain in humans and other mammals. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling {{at the site of}} exposure. These symptoms are followed by {{one or more of the}} following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year. The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system.|$|E
