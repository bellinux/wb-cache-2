40|$|Background Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, AN 69 ®) {{dialysis}} membranes {{have been}} shown to improve the outcome of critically ill patients. Factor D is an essential enzyme of the alternative pathway of complement and is increased during renal failure. On the other hand the contact of blood with biomaterials activates the complement cascade through the alternative pathway. <b>PAN</b> <b>filters</b> adsorb factor D which looses its enzymatic activity whilst bound to the membrane [1] the complement alternative pathway function of serum exposed to <b>PAN</b> <b>filters</b> is greatly diminished and restored after addition of purified factor D [1]. The aim of our study was to measure the time course of factor D adsorption and its blood concentration during CVVH in critically ill patients with acute renal failure. Methods We studied seven critically ill patients with ARF before, during and after continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) with AN 69. Results There was a rapid decrease of factor D levels to 62 (± 6 %) of the pre-CVVH value during the first 2 h, which continued to 51 (± 7. 3 %) after 12 h; at 24 h there was a slight rise to 62 ± 12 %. Sequential use of Polyacrylonitrile (AN 69 ®) filters lowered factor D levels below the normal plasma concentration in three patients, thus producing a state of factor D depletion. Conclusions The significant reduction of factor D levels during CVVH with <b>PAN</b> <b>filters</b> suggests that frequent changes of <b>PAN</b> <b>filters</b> may reduce alternative pathway function by lowering factor D levels.

Metalcraft has specialized in improving the reliability of existing tilting <b>pan</b> <b>filters</b> by providing filter components that increase filtration area, improve flow characteristics, increase structural integrity, and reduce maintenance cost. The optimization process involves diligent onsite technological study, mapping and modeling of an existing filter. Benchmarks are established as to the operational and maintenance condition of the filter, and mechanical deficiencies can be addressed. Filter measurements and data are integrated into the modeling software to revel accurate real time conditions, which then can be compared with corrected or improved modeling of all filter components. The extent of improvements and optimization are discussed with the client and further steps are planned {{in harmony with the}} customer's goals. Continuation of the optimization process allows for implementing improved cloth spray header system matched with a turnover track that is properly timed in relationship to the sprays and dumping cycle. Applying these technologies will result in improved losses, better cloth cleaning efficiencies, extended run time between cloth changes, and lower maintenance cost.

In addition, the transient response can be purposefully improved by imposing constraints on the time-domain filter coefficients...|$|R

30|$|The Quality with No Reference (QNR) index [118] {{comprises}} two indices, one {{pertaining to}} spectral distortion {{and the other}} to spatial distortion. As proposed in [118] and [119], the two distortions may be combined to yield a unique global quality measure. While the QNR measure proposed in [118] is based on the UIQI index, the one proposed in [119] is based on the measure of the mutual information (MI) between the different images. The spectral distortion index defined in [118] can be derived from the difference of inter-band UIQI values calculated among all the fused MS bands and the resampled LR MS bands. The spatial distortion index defined in [118] is based on differences between the UIQI of each band of the fused image and the PAN image and the UIQI of each band of the LR MS image with a low-resolution version of the PAN image. This LR image is obtained by <b>filtering</b> the <b>PAN</b> image with a low-pass filter with normalized frequency cutoff at the resolution ratio between MS and PAN images, followed by decimation. The QNR index is obtained by the combination of the spectral and spatial distortion indices into one single measure varying from zero to one. The maximum value is only obtained when there is no spectral and spatial distortion between the images. The main advantage of the proposed index is that, in spite of lack of a reference data set, the global quality of a fused image can be assessed at the full scale of the PAN image.|$|R

All ultrafiltrate was also returned to the reservoir. The level of adsorption was calculated from the fall in the amikacin concentration. The dose and the initial concentration of amikacin were varied, as were the pH, the type of hemofilter, and the hemofilter surface area. The reversibility of adsorption and the effect of repeated dosing were also studied. The level of adsorption by 0. 6 -m 2 <b>PAN</b> <b>filters</b> was significantly greater than that by 0. 6 -m 2 polyamide filters. Adsorption was increased by increasing the dose of amikacin even when the initial concentration was unchanged. It was unaffected by the pH (pH 6. 8 or 7. 4) or the hemofilter surface area (0. 6 m 2 or 0. 9 m 2). Repeated doses of amikacin resulted in further adsorption. In a saturation experiment, the maximum adsorptive capacity of 0. 6 -m 2 PAN hemofilters was at least 546. 9 mg (range, 427. 6 to 577. 5 mg).

40|$|Adsorption of {{complement}} factor D by polyacrylonitrile dialysis membranes. Factor D, an essential enzyme {{of the alternative}} pathway (AP) of complement, accumulates in end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane activates complement poorly and {{has been shown to}} adsorb C 3 a, the main anaphylatoxin released during complement activation. In the present work we investigated whether factor D might be adsorbed on PAN. In vitro there was a loss of hemolytic factor D when normal human serum (NHS) was incubated with PAN dialysis fibers, whereas no loss was observed with cuprophan (Cu) fibers. There was a dose and time dependent binding of purified radiolabeled factor D to PAN but not to Cu. The hemolytic function of factor D released from PAN by 2 M NaCl was normal. By contrast, factor D was inactive while adsorbed to PAN fibers. When 50 ml of NHS or 100 ml of whole blood were passed through a new hollow fiber PAN dialyzer 95 % of factor D was adsorbed. The eluate from a <b>PAN</b> <b>filter</b> which had been used for dialysis in a patient with ESRF contained 38. 4 mg of hemolytic factor D, representing 34 % of the proteins eluted. By immunoblotting, antigenic factor D from the PAN eluate was identical to purified human factor D. In six patients there was a 81. 4 % decrease in hemolytic factor D in blood after dialysis with PAN, contrasting with a 9. 6 % decrease in those dialyzed with cellulose acetate. No factor D was found in the dialysis fluid of PAN dialyzers, indicating that PAN removed factor D mainly by adsorption. In conclusion, PAN has a significant capacity to adsorb factor D, a reaction that might contribute to the diminished capacity of PAN membrane to activate the AP of complement. Whether the efficient removal of large amounts of factor D might be beneficial in uremic patients remains to be defined...|$|R
40|$|Context: Video {{stabilization}} {{techniques have}} gained popularity for their permit to obtain {{high quality video}} footage even in non-optimal conditions. There have been significant works done on video stabilization by developing different algorithms. Most of the stabilization software displays the missing image areas in stabilized video. In {{the last few years}} hand-held video cameras have continued to grow in popularity, allowing everyone to easily produce personal video footage. Furthermore, with online video sharing resources being used by a rapidly increasing number of users, a large proportion of such video footage is shared with wide audiences. Sadly such videos often suffer from poor quality as frame vibration in video makes human perception not comfortable. In this research an attempt has been made to propose a robust video stabilization algorithm that stabilizes the videos effectively. Objectives: The main objective of our thesis work is to perform effective motion estimation using SIFT features to calculate the inter frame motion, allowing to find Global Motion Vectors and optimal motion compensation is to be achieved using adaptive fuzzy filter by removing the unwanted shakiness and preserve the panning leading to stabilized video. Methods: In this study three types of research questions are used- Experimentation and Literature review. To accomplish the goal of this thesis, experimentation is carried out for performing video stabilization. Motion estimation is done using feature based motion estimation using SIFT and GMVs are calculated. The intentional motion is filtered using Adaptive fuzzy <b>filter</b> to preserve <b>panning</b> and Motion compensation is performed to wrap the video to its stabilized position. MOS implies the mean scores of the subjective tests performed according to the recommendations of ITU-R BT. 500 - 13 and ITU-T P. 910 to analyze the results of our stabilized videos. Results: As a part of results from our work, we have successfully stabilized the videos of different resolutions from experimentation. Performance of our algorithm is found better using MOS.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} was developed to assay levofloxacin and vancomycin. Fluorescence polarization immunoassay was to assay amikacin. The oseltamivir carboxylate and telavancin concentrations were assayed by {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. An in vitro model was utilized to examine adsorption of antibiotics onto haemofilters. In order to test antibiotics {{from a range of}} classes, levofloxacin, amikacin, vancomycin, telavancin, and oseltamivir carboxylate were studied. In summary, the antibiotic adsorption by haemofilters is a complex process. Both characteristics of antibiotics and haemofilters may determine adsorption. Among the studied antibiotics, in vitro adsorption of amikacin by <b>PAN</b> <b>filters</b> may have clinical significance, thus the routine monitoring of amikacin peak concentration in vivo during CRRT is recommended. In the in vitro model, blood was pumped from an agitated, glass mixing chamber (heated using an automatic water bath), around a circuit and returned to the mixing chamber using a haemofiltration machine. Ultrafiltrate was also returned to the mixing chamber to constitute a closed circuit. As a result any decrease in drug concentration could only be due to adsorption to the filter and extracorporeal circuit, spontaneous degradation or metabolism by red cells. The main findings were: (1) low adsorption of levofloxacin and vancomycin by haemofilters at clinically relevant concentrations; (2) significant absolute adsorption of amikacin by polyacrylonitrile haemofilters; (3) the adsorption of antibiotics was membrane-material dependent with greater adsorption by polyacrylonitrile filters; (4) lack of relationship between membrane surface area and amikacin adsorption; (5) the adsorption of levofloxacin is reversible, contrary to irreversibility of vancomycin and amikacin; (6) sieving coefficient of oseltamivir is very near to 1. 0. This thesis investigated: (1) the extent of antibiotic adsorption (levofloxacin, vancomycin, amikacin, telavancin and oseltamivir carboxylate) by haemofilters; (2) the time course of antibiotic adsorption by haemofilters; (3) the effects of plasma albumin concentration, initial dosage, pH, filter membrane material, filter membrane surface area and repeated dosing on adsorption; (4) the reversibility or irreversibility of adsorption; (5) clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate and telavancin by ultrafiltration. Up to 25 % of critically ill patients develop acute renal failure with sepsis being the most common cause. Outside of North and South America, these patients usually receive continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) which utilizes high flux haemofilter membranes. Thus it is common for these patients to be concurrently receiving antibiotics and CRRT. However, information about the adsorptive capacity of various haemofilters for most drugs is lacking.
