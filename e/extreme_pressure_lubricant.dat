Our study extensively investigated {{the effects of the}} types of grinding wheels, grinding fluids, and their different combinations on grinding ratio (G-ratio), specific energy (U), grinding efficiency (E), and surface roughness (Ra) of 52100 steel ground parts {{for a wide range of}} specific material removal rates. As a result of this study the following findings were made: The specific material removal rate (Q’) can be increased by more than 100 percent by using sol-gel wheels with metalworking fluids containing a high concentration of <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> (EP) <b>lubricants,</b> instead of conventional aluminum oxide wheels with non-EP-containing fluids. The sol-gel grinding wheel generates an eight to ten times higher G-ratio than a traditional aluminum oxide wheel. Metalworking fluids with two levels of EP lubricants were compared with a fluid that did not contain EP lubricants. The fluid with the highest EP level gives six to nine times higher G-ratios than the non-EP containing fluid. The combination of the sol-gel wheel with the highest-EP-level fluid results in a 56 -fold increase in G-ratio over that of the conventional aluminum oxid...|$|R
30|$|Short-chain {{chlorinated}} paraffins (SCCPs) are complex technical mixtures of halogenated contaminants with linear carbon chain lengths from 10 to 13. The chlorine content ranges from 30 to 70 % (calculated by weight). Technical mixtures {{are used as}} <b>extreme</b> <b>pressure</b> additives in <b>lubricants,</b> flame retardants in plastics and paints, plasticizers in coatings, sealants and adhesives, and in leather fat liquors. They have replaced the PCBs uses in industrial mixtures (De Boer et al. 2010). SCCPs are of great interest due to their persistence, toxicological properties, and high octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) that make them tend to bioaccumulate in lipid tissues of marine organisms and can be transferred and magnified along the food chain (Feo et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 2012). Besides, SCCPs {{have been found in}} remote areas. In consequence, it is possible to think about their long-range atmospheric transport (Tomy et al. 2000). Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) have similar properties to other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and already subject to assessment by Stockholm Convention (UNEP/POPS/POPRC. 11 / 4 2015). The western countries have begun to restrict the usage and production of CPs (van Mourik et al. 2016).|$|R
