5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and <b>geophysical</b> surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American <b>Geophysical</b> Union's <b>Geophysical</b> Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

5|$|This {{relationship}} {{became known}} as Birch's law. Birch {{was elected to the}} National Academy of Sciences in 1950, and served {{as the president of the}} Geological Society of America in 1963 and 1964. He received numerous honors in his career, including the Geological Society of America's Arthur L. Day Medal on 1950 and Penrose Medal in 1969, the American <b>Geophysical</b> Union's William Bowie Medal in 1960, the National Medal of Science from President Lyndon Johnson in 1967, the Vetlesen Prize (shared with Sir Edward Bullard) in 1968, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1973, and the International Association for the Advancement of High Pressure Research's Bridgman Medal in 1983. Since 1992, the American <b>Geophysical</b> Union's Tectonophysics section has sponsored a Francis Birch Lecture, given at its annual meeting by a noted researcher in this field.|$|E
5|$|Another global field model, called World Magnetic Model, is {{produced}} {{jointly by the}} United States National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National <b>Geophysical</b> Data Center) and the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Office {{as well as in}} many civilian navigation systems.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} unfavorable vertical {{wind shear}} impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft {{during the afternoon}} hours of August5 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). A few computer models, namely the <b>Geophysical</b> Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, a NASA {{press release}} {{said that the}} {{consensus}} was that Voyager 1 was then in the heliosheath. In a scientific session at the American <b>Geophysical</b> Union meeting in New Orleans {{on the morning of}} May 25, 2005, Dr. Ed Stone presented evidence that the craft crossed the termination shock in late 2004. This event is estimated to have occurred on December 15, 2004 at a distance of 94 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In {{what would}} later become the second of two {{tropical}} cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988, an area of disturbed weather was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November1. Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, <b>Geophysical</b> and Astronomical Services Administration also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Welpring.|$|E
5|$|It was {{scheduled}} as an ancient monument in 1882. Since 1884 the Stoney Littleton Long Barrow {{has been in}} state care, and is now managed by English Heritage who have provided an information board at the site. Further conservation work and a <b>geophysical</b> survey were carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the Cotswold Archaeological Trust.|$|E
5|$|On <b>geophysical</b> evidence, {{most of the}} nickel on Earth is {{believed}} to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Pemex {{disallowed}} {{release of}} specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention. Coincidentally, many experts in impact craters and the K–Pg boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield {{had plenty of}} <b>geophysical</b> data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.|$|E
5|$|Professor Lubowich helped arrange {{an event}} on the National Mall on June 19, 2015. Astronomy Magazine came and staff passed out hand-outs, and groups in {{attendance}} {{to support the}} event included: the American <b>Geophysical</b> Union, the International Dark-Sky Association, the Carnegie Institution, and Georgetown University. It featured a portable blow-up dome with a lit planetarium for viewing. Instructors dressed as historical figures from astronomy including: Caroline Herschel, Tycho Brahe, and Johannes Kepler to educate children about the field.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a <b>geophysical</b> model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
5|$|S. L. de Silva and P. Francis {{suggested}} in their 1991 book Volcanoes of the Central Andes that the Central Volcanic Zone should be subdivided into two systems of volcanoes, one in Peru {{and another in}} Chile, {{on the basis of}} the orientation (northwestsoutheast versus northsouth). C.A. Wood, G. McLaughlin and P. Francis in a 1987 paper at the American <b>Geophysical</b> Union {{suggested in}}stead a subdivision into nine different groups.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only <b>geophysical</b> attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and <b>Geophysical</b> Bureau both hoisted {{strong wind}} signal 1 on August1 {{as the system}} was located within 800km (497mi) of their {{respective}} cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised to strong wind signal 3 as strong winds were expected to strike the area. In Macau in particular this was further increased to strong wind signal 8 SE on August3, as gale-force winds were expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next afternoon as Prapiroon moved inland.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949–52 was {{the first}} {{international}} scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71°S, 11°W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land. During the International <b>Geophysical</b> Year (1957–1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the Soviet Union, Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started <b>geophysical</b> and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following {{the withdrawal of the}} Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the SANAE station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, has maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station. Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957, except for a hiatus of a few years. Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964–66. The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The RSMCs and TCWCs are not {{the only}} {{organizations}} that provide information about tropical cyclones to the public. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues advisories in all basins except the Northern Atlantic {{for the purposes of the}} United States Government. The Philippine Atmospheric, <b>Geophysical</b> and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issues advisories and names for tropical cyclones that approach the Philippines in the Northwestern Pacific to protect the life and property of its citizens. The Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issues advisories on hurricanes and their remnants for Canadian citizens when they affect Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Tromsø as a {{location}} for a telemetry stations {{was in part}} tied to the Tromsø <b>Geophysical</b> Observatory—which had been located in Tromsø since 1928—and the planned University of Tromsø. The Canadian Space Agency was at the time working on the Alouette 2 program and were seen by NDRE as a natural cooperation partner. The NASA's International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies was also being designed and NASA therefore decided to supply equipment for a telemetry station in Tromsø to be operational by August 1966.|$|E
5|$|The north-west corner {{tower is}} 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an {{entrance}} {{door on the}} east side, and originally had a loft floor. It remains uncertain {{if there was a}} second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a <b>geophysical</b> survey in 1998 proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The stone circles {{have been}} studied since John Aubrey's visit in 1664 with some {{excavations}} of the site in the 18th century. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries <b>geophysical</b> surveys have confirmed {{the size of the}} stone circles and identified additional pits and postholes. The Cove {{has been shown to be}} around one thousand years older than the stone circles, so dating from 4000-3000 BCE. A variety of myths and legends about the stone circles have been recorded, including one about dancers at a celebration who have been turned to stone.|$|E
