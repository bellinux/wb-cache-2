Theoretical, or `static testing' also a requirement. Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a tool used for static testing. FMEA is a bottom-up technique that aims to assess the effects of all component failure modes in a system. Its use is traditionally limited to hardware systems. With the growing complexity of modern electronics traditional FMEA is suffering from state explosion and re-use of analysis problems. Also with the now ubiquitous use of microcontrollers in smart instruments and control systems, software is increasingly being seen as a `missing factor' for FMEA...|$|E

Therefore, in the prerequisite of vibration and <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (EMC) being satisfied, how to make effective thermal design is what the research staff are generally concerned about. Firstly, a comprehensive description of the overall structure for a sealed enclosure is provided. Then the cooling plate is designed by using the method of theoretical calculation. At the same time, {{the temperature of the}} enclosure is analyzed by using Flow Simulation; the distribution of temperature field for the enclosure is obtained. Both classical heat transfer theory and a computational approach are used to verify the enclosure cooling performance. It turns out that applying the method of combining the theoretical calculation and simulation analysis cannot only improve the reliability of thermal analysis, but can also provide some valuable references to the research staff...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWithin the ICT OMEGA project, a {{thorough}} {{study of the}} <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (EMC) issues linked to Power Line Communications (PLC) has been conducted. In this paper, we present our investigations {{carried out in the}} context of a frequency bandwidth extension of PLC systems up to 100 MHz. The current status of EMC regulations for PLC is first recalled. An experimental study is then presented for the assessment of the effect of electromagnetic field radiation from an electrical network, in the 30 ­ 100 MHz band. Recommendations are given for the injected PSD levels to be used for future studies within the OMEGA project. From these results, the capacity of the PLC channel is evaluated in terms of outage probability. This analysis shows that an extended bandwidth up to 100 MHz provides capacities in excess of 1 Gbps, while satisfying the current emission limits. Finally, the possible countermeasures for the mitigation of EMC issues are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Among these applications, the {{adaptation}} of VLC for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is of high interest to various VLC research groups [5 – 12]. In order to obtain intelligence in transportation, ITSs have utilized {{the advantages of the}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), providing several different technological systems that help users. Among the possible ICTs, ITSs are now considering the use of VLC, focusing on two aspects. First of all, it is possible to repurpose the transportation lighting infrastructure for communication. Recently, the transportation lighting infrastructure such as street lamps, traffic lights, automotive lamps, etc., is changing to LEDs. Therefore, {{in the case of an}} ITS based on VLC, it will be possible to make use of the conventional automotive and traffic LEDs. Consequently, the cost incurred in constructing the ITS infrastructure will be reduced. Second, the <b>electro</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> problem, which is a very serious problem in ITSs based on RF signals, will be minimized since visible light and the conventional RF signals occupy different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{regulations}} have demanded that electronics manufacturing companies control emissions from their products and the susceptibility {{of their products}} for Emissions from other products. In addition, unexpected product failure and the ever-present demands of technology are also forcing the electronics industry to face {{the need to maintain}} Electrical Integrity. The investigations into high-speed design techniques have shown three major causes of failure: emissions from interconnecting conductors; poor PCB layout and lack of technical knowledge in <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> (EMC). Catching these kinds of electrical integrity problems early in the design phase allows designers to take timely action without jeopardising project time scales. The work reported here presents design for manufacturing guidelines and rules to maintain electrical integrity in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). Currently, a common method for handling EMC is through compliance testing of the final product. Similarly, noise budget is measured on finishing prototypes. Since product life cycles are reduced, dealing with EMC late in the design cycle is undesirable. The cost of fixing may also be higher at a final stage because only a few options are available to correct the problem. A 'find and fix' approach is no longer acceptable. More and more companies are facing or will soon be facing EMC and electrical integrity issues. The majority of analysis tools available today are targeted towards simulation engineers. Such tools are not easy to use and are dependent on the availability and accuracy of complex simulation models. Moreover, they also tend to be ineffective on how to correct potential EMC problems...|$|E

40|$|Variable speed motors {{are used}} in HVAC systems (furnaces, heat pumps and air {{condition}}ers) to condition the air in a residential/commercial space. The speed of the motor is adjusted to provide an efficient system operation in an air conditioned space. The motor speed is adjusted by controlling the power applied by means of precise electronic control. ^ The power electronics components and the switched voltage and currents produce Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) in the system. To mitigate EMI, filters are integrated at {{the front end of}} the electronic controller in order to achieve compliance with FCC and CISPR 22 class B standard [6]. However, the increased switching frequency, together with the increased current and voltage slew rates, di/dt and dv/dt, have detrimental effects on the <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> (EMC) performance of the system. At the same time, EMI filters typically have a degraded attenuation due to parasitic elements at high frequencies, and will be less effective in filtering out the high frequency EMI noises generated from the power circuits. ^ This thesis describes a modeling approach of an electric drive system with device level components, with emphasis on the study of EMI performance. The multi-domain system software Ansoft Simplorer is used to characterize and model the passive and semiconductor components in the control board. The passive components are characterized by using the measured results obtained from an impedance analyzer where the models are presented as equivalent circuits, which is sufficient in the frequency range of conducted emission (0. 15 - 30 MHz). To characterize and validate the semiconductor components, several models are imported from Pspice and predefined libraries of Ansoft Simplorer. ^ The EMI levels of the electronic drive are measured by using a Line impedance stabilization network (LISN) device connected between the power supply and the control board (electronic drive) where the drive operates a motor which is modeled as an RL load. The measured EMI results are compared to the simulated EMI results. The impact of the parasitics on the EMI and also the improvements in the EMI filter to reduce the EMI has been simulated and analyzed. ...|$|E
