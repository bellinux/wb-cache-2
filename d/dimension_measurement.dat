In 31 patients with advanced atherosclerotic carotid artery disease, two high resolution (0. 25 × 0. 25 mm(2); HR) and two routinely used low resolution (0. 50 × 0. 50 mm(2); LR) carotid 3 T MRI scans were performed within 1 month. After manual delineation of carotid wall contours in a dedicated image analyses program in eight slices covering the atherosclerotic plaque, image reproducibility, {{as well as the}} within-reader and between-reader variability were determined. We found significantly higher intraclass correlation coefficients for total wall volume, mean wall area and mean wall thickness for the HR measurements (all p < 0. 05). We found a significant lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio for the HR compared to the LR measurements. The carotid arterial wall <b>dimension</b> <b>measurements</b> of all parameters were significantly lower for the HR compared to the LR measurements. No significant differences were observed between the within-reader and between-reader reproducibility for HR versus LR measurements.

[Methods]An airway phantom, which was constructed using various types of material and with various tube sizes, was scanned using four CT scanner types under different conditions to calculate airway dimensions, luminal area (Ai), and the wall area percentage (WA%). To investigate the limitations of accurate airway <b>dimension</b> <b>measurement,</b> we then developed a second airway phantom with a thinner tube wall, and compared the clinical CT images of healthy subjects with the phantom images scanned using the same CT scanner.

Single point of light passes through lens {{converted}} to parallel light which will illuminate to the CCD through the moving object to be tested. CCD pixels which are blocked by the object while light is on are low, and the remaining pixels are high conversely. The distance of the tested objects while light is on can be ignored since the light pulse width is {{much smaller than the}} integration time of CCD (generally). The size of the tested object can be achieved by the number of dark pixels of CCD while light is on.
