5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures.

5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high atomic number, it is highly unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{points out}} that the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> violates their individual conscience.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, so there was little incentive for currency war <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been possible.|$|E
5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E

The {{inscriptions}} found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> did not lie on the trade route.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance.

5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
