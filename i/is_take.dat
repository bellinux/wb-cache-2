[...] "What they've allowed us to do <b>is</b> <b>take</b> a licensed property and treat it like a brand new IP" [...] stated Tieger. The vehicle modes for car-based characters initially consisted of wheels, however the developers found that it crippled gameplay by removing the player's ability to strafe while in vehicle mode. [...] Taking the dilemma to Hasbro, the two companies agreed that characters would turn their wheels down and hover while in vehicle mode, allowing for more movement. [...] The vehicles would then revert to the traditional wheeled mode while using a character's boost, maintaining what the Transformers license had established with previous canon.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews also praised it, writing [...] "Waters' debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters", comparing the depiction of Nancy's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield, and adding that it [...] "pulsat with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat". John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it [...] "has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author's craftsmanship, idiosyncrasy and sheer effort."

500|$|The plot of [...] "Day of the Jackanapes" [...] {{is based}} on the 1959 {{political}} thriller novel The Manchurian Candidate.

After Krusty has announced the cancellation of his show, a group of crying children are seen at the Krustylu Studios, where the show is filmed. The name of the studio {{is based on}} Desilu Studios, a television company based in Los Angeles. In an interview with Kent Brockman, Krusty says that he taped over all episodes of his show that Sideshow Bob was in with episodes of the reality court show Judge Judy. This is a reference to how NBC reused tapes of early episodes of The Tonight Show to film new programs.

500|$|Speaking in a 2003 {{television}} documentary about Nigel Kneale's career, {{the writer and}} critic Kim Newman praised the underlying themes of Quatermass II, and their particular relevance to the British way of life. [...] "Quatermass II is the British Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing... What Quatermass II does <b>is</b> <b>take</b> that metaphor {{and apply it to}} the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the Cold War paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by the council, or in this case big business." [...] The British Film Institute's [...] "Screenonline" [...] website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial."With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale's story tapped into contemporary fears about the 'red' (i.e. communist) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including Invasion of the Body Snatchers. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age — the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British nuclear weapons tests). In short, Quatermass II was the perfect cold-war drama." ...|$|E
500|$|Accelerated Evolution {{was well}} {{received}} by critics.

[...] William Hughes of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "amazing", saying the album [...] "has elements that will appeal to fans of all different genres, from progressive to metal." [...] Alex Henderson of Allmusic called the album [...] "excellent", and praised Townsend's ability to blend genres and influences: [...] "The Canadian rocker provides enough downtuned guitars to put this CD in the alt rock category. And yet Accelerated Evolution has a big sound that suggests the pop-metal, arena rock and hard rock of the '70s and '80s – big melodies, big harmonies, big guitars, big vocals, big production." [...] Chris Hawkins of KNAC.com said, [...] "Like always, what Devin manages to do <b>is</b> <b>take</b> the most infectious rhythm, place his stamp upon it, and thus create something completely original." [...] Xander Hoose of Chronicles of Chaos compared the album favorably to SYL, noting that [...] "there is more variation, and the songs are more memorable and layered than their one-dimensional SYL counterparts." [...] Hoose added, [...] "For those who thought Terria was going {{too much in the}} wrong direction, Accelerated Evolution will probably come as a relief." ...|$|E

However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the [...] "Shawarma scene" [...] in The Avengers, explaining, [...] "It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel <b>is</b> <b>take</b> the best moments and do something else. Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else.
