500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews, both {{in general}} and for the musical performances in particular. While reviewers were not impressed with the judging scene and {{highly critical of the}} inclusion of Emma and Will's having sex {{for the first time as}} part of the post-victory sequence, the overall quality was lauded by many. The musical numbers were widely praised, and although some critics felt that Vocal Adrenaline gave better performances than New Directions, the three main competition soloists—Rachel (Lea Michele), Finn (Cory Monteith) and Unique (Alex Newell)—were especially singled out for encomiums.

Benigno felt that while the song was [...] "really quite good", the [...] "stupidity of the scene" [...] it was in detracted from it, resulting in a grade of [...] "B+", while Gonzalez, when she gave it an [...] "A−", said she hadn't been a [...] "huge fan of the cover" [...] when she heard it before the show aired, but it grew on her in context. Futterman wrote, [...] "The New Directions break into a restrained, tender take on [...] "Pure Imagination" [...] with lush harmonies on the chorus that's exactly right for the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Benigno and Futterman {{compared}} [...] "Singin' in the Rain / Umbrella" [...] {{favorably to}} mash-ups {{performed in the}} preceding episode.

Futterman {{described it as a}} [...] "buoyant and catchy homage to {{the old and the new}} [...] perfectly captures Glee musical spirit". In contrast, Vick felt the song could not compare to the previous episode's mash-ups. She deemed the staging implausible, questioning how a glee club in financial difficulty could afford elaborate water features for a rehearsal number. Stack was willing to overlook such improbability; he wrote that he loved the mash-up and graded it an [...] "A−". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times appreciated the choreography and the manner in which [...] "Paltrow's sassiness undercuts [...] overripe sweetness", and named it potentially her favorite <b>group</b> <b>number</b> of the season.|$|E

Anthony Benigno, an editor for the Daily News, and Time James Poniewozik criticized the show for sanitizing the song, but while the latter found it inferior to the original version, the former preferred Paltrow's deeper voice and awarded it an [...] "A". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman felt the censorship of the song did not adversely affect its success, and deemed the performance [...] "charming and sassy". Megan Vick of Billboard favored it as [...] "the most exciting number" [...] of the episode, and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack went further in his praise: he bestowed a grade of [...] "A+" [...] and lauded it as [...] "one {{of the most memorable}} and energetic Glee performances ever, thanks in no small part to Paltrow". Green expressed approval of the rendition. Benigno gave her short performance of [...] "Conjunction Junction" [...] an [...] "A", and described it as [...] "a glorious ten seconds", and granted the installment's mash-up of [...] "Singin' In The Rain / Umbrella" [...] a [...] "B".

Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times appreciated the mash-up's choreography {{and the manner in which}} [...] "Paltrow's sassiness undercuts [...] overripe sweetness", and named it potentially her favorite <b>group</b> <b>number</b> of the second season.

40|$|We {{examine the}} "Group" sunspot numbers {{constructed}} by Hoyt and Schatten {{to determine their}} utility in characterizing the solar activity cycle. We compare smoothed monthly <b>Group</b> Sunspot <b>Numbers</b> to Zurich (International) Sunspot Numbers, 10. 7 -cm radio flux, and total sunspot area. We find that the Zurich numbers follow the 10. 7 -cm radio flux and total sunspot area measurements slightly better than the <b>Group</b> <b>numbers.</b> We examine several significant characteristics of the sunspot cycle using both <b>Group</b> <b>numbers</b> and Zurich numbers. We find that the "Waldmeier Effect" - the anti-correlation between cycle amplitude and the elapsed time between minimum and maximum of a cycle - is much more apparent in the Zurich numbers. The "Amplitude-Period Effect" the anti-correlation between cycle amplitude {{and the length of}} the previous cycle from minimum to minimum - is also much more apparent in the Zurich numbers. The "Amplitude-Minimum Effect" - the correlation between cycle amplitude and the activity level at the previous (onset) minimum is equally apparent in both the Zurich <b>numbers</b> and the <b>Group</b> <b>numbers.</b> The "Even-Odd Effect" - in which odd-numbered cycles are larger than their even-numbered precursors - is somewhat stronger in the <b>Group</b> <b>numbers</b> but with a tighter relationship in the Zurich numbers. The "Secular Trend" - the increase in cycle amplitudes since the Maunder Minimum - is much stronger in <b>Group</b> <b>numbers.</b> After removing this trend we find little evidence for multi-cycle periodicities like the 80 year Gleissberg cycle or the two- and three-cycle periodicities. We also find little evidence for a correlation between the amplitude of a cycle and its period or for a bimodal distribution of cycle periods. We conclude that the <b>Group</b> <b>numbers</b> are most useful for extending the sunspot cycle data further back in time and thereby adding more cycles and improving the statistics. However, the Zurich numbers are more useful for characterizing the on-going levels of solar activity...|$|R
