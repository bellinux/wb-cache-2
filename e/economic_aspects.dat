40|$|This study's {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the strength of contextual aspects' influences on environmentally ethical behaviour (EEB). A survey method with a selfadministered questionnaire was used and a cross-section of the Muslim male population of New Zealand was taken. The qualitative interviews and email questionnaires were also utilised to further explain the survey results. The linear regression analyses show correlations between contextual aspects (i. e., social, religious, economic, political, and demographic) and EEB (pre-cycling, re-use and recycling). Results indicate that the contextual aspects are influential on EEB in many ways and degrees. A model describing the relationship was developed. The <b>economic</b> <b>aspect</b> statistically significantly related to EEB the strongest. The qualitative interview and email questionnaire data support the findings of the survey. The relationship was positive, meaning that the more the consumers were influenced by the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect</b> to behave in an environmentally ethical way, the more they were likely to perform EEB. Compared to the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect,</b> white collar workers, number of household occupant, work involvement with the environment, type of house, and age had a weaker statistically significant relationship with EEB. The relationships were positive, meaning that the better the consumers' occupation (i. e., white collar workers), the more household member they had (i. e., 4 and above), the higher their level of work involvement with the environment, and the better their dwelling (i. e., bungalow or semi-detached houses), the more they were likely to perform EEB. However, the relationship between age and EEB was negative, meaning that the younger the consumers the more they were likely to perform EEB. However, the results of this study, from both the survey and the interview methods, indicate that demographic characteristics were not as important as the contextual <b>aspects,</b> particularly the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect,</b> in understanding consumers' EEB. This study shows that the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect</b> was very important in understanding consumers' EEB compared to the other contextual aspects even the political aspect was statistically significantly related to EEB via the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect.</b> Thus, the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect</b> should be used optimally by public and private sector managers to promote EEB...|$|R

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of glucosamine is controversial. Reviews {{have found it}} to be equal to or slightly better than placebo. A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not. The evidence for glucosamine sulfate having an effect on osteoarthritis progression is somewhat unclear and if present likely modest. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence no longer recommends its use. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a viable treatment option. The European Society for Clinical and <b>Economic</b> <b>Aspects</b> of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) recommends glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for knee osteoarthritis.

40|$|It {{has been}} quite some time that Puerto Ricans have been debating the status issue. Put simply, it {{is the issue of}} {{appropriate}} political arrangement between the island and the mainland USA. There are basically three status options to consider, namely (a) statehood, (b) commonwealth, and (c) independence. The question of right political status is indeed a difficult and complicated question.

Among different dimensions of the status question, the one that is of foremost importance is economic. It is also possible to be more objective with regard to the <b>economic</b> <b>aspect</b> than with regard to other aspects.

25|$|The {{development}} of the new multipurpose vessel began on 25 May 2003 when the Ministry of Transport and Communications appointed a work group to investigate the technical requirements and <b>economic</b> <b>aspects</b> of building a new multipurpose icebreaker capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the Gulf of Finland had increased from a mere 15 million tons {{per year in the}} early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with oil recovery equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and emergency towing of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist oil tankers to the Kilpilahti oil refinery in Porvoo during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the work group noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker would have {{to spend the rest of}} the year in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.|$|E
