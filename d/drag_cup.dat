40|$|The {{improvements}} {{obtained on}} the torque with low currents using rotor with spiral sheets are analyzed in this paper. To {{have a complete}} study, several rotors and stators have been built to verify the electromagnetic variations on the three-phase asynchronous motors where they combine different constructive and mechanical characteristics of the related elements: changing inertias, constructive materials, and the geometrical shapes and disposition of the sheets. These different types of motors have been first tested in the laboratory, then, are simulated using computer aided tools (Matlab–Simulink). In particular four stators (1000, 1500, 1500 -type A, and 3000 rpm) having the same constructive parameters, have been tested with the following rotors: solid rotor, solid rotor with diamagnetic rings, <b>drag</b> <b>cup,</b> and simple and double squirrel cage rotor. All these results have been compared to those obtained with the seven variants of spiral sheet rotor, presented in this paper. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A {{collector}} {{handed over}} to the Hungarian National Museum 15 items of samian ware which he had discovered on the outskirts of Papkeszi. All of the vessels were plain ware: <b>Drag.</b> 33 <b>cups</b> or <b>Drag.</b> 18 / 31 platters. 12 pieces bear stamps, with exception one they were all made by the workshops of Lezoux in the Antonine period. Their accordance as a set is evidenced by the graffiti naming Verus on 8 pieces. The cache of Papkeszi and its closest paralell in space and time the one of Gorsium indicate that they were both purposely hidden deposits. Cache from the same era are also known from Noricum and Pannonia. Deposits from Gorsium and Aquincum can be related to the Marcomannic–Sarmatian attacks of AD 178 – 179 which among others resulted in the destruction of the earth-timber fort of Celamantia. Based on samian and brooches the Roman settlement of Papkeszi was inhabited from the Flavian Age. Although its inhabitants might have hidden a cache of terra sigillata as a significant treasure, the Marcomannic–Sarmatian wars (AD 166 – 180) did not cause any considerable interruption in the occupation of the settlement...|$|R
