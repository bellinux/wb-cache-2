Work by the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Porto and University of Minho have concentrated on a few mammals (Pyrenean <b>desman,</b> European otter, roe deer, and wild boar), reptiles and fish. These studies looked into the numbers of species and factors influencing their habitats.|$|E
2500|$|Hedgehogs often {{comprise}} a fairly {{significant portion of}} the prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls, both in numbers and biomass. At least eight species of hedgehog have been predated. The European hedgehog is often {{one of the most prominent}} prey species in eagle-owl diet studies from Europe, and was recorded as the most numerous prey species per researchers in parts of Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and south Germany. With an average weight of , the European hedgehog can {{comprise a}} very large portion of the biomass. A study of the Bavarian region of Germany, the European hedgehog (the main prey species) made up 41.7% of the prey by number and 52.1% of the biomass, the maximum representation of hedgehogs known in Europe. Other members of the Erinaceus genus are also locally regularly taken, as is the [...] Daurian hedgehog (Mesechinus dauuricus) in Mongolia. Studies from Greece and the Czech Republic found that the northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus) was the leading prey species. Unidentified Erinaceus hedgehogs almost totally dominated the diet of eagle-owls in Stavropol, Russia, making up 70.9% of the food, only the European rabbit has been found as more significant at the genera level by number in a given dietary study. Studies from both Syria and Kazakhstan showed that the [...] long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) was the most significant prey, making up 25.3% and 33.6% of the prey remains, respectively. After killing hedgehogs, the Eurasian eagle-owls peel the prickly skin off their backs before consumption, frequently resulting in up to dozens of hedgehog backs being found around nests. Moles and shrews are readily hunted but are usually only a secondary portion of the diet. Eurasian eagle-owls have been recorded hunting the smallest mammal on earth (by weight) the [...] Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), as well as the largest mole on earth, the [...] Russian <b>desman</b> (Desmana moschata). From the smallest shrew to the heaviest hedgehog, the Eurasian eagle-owl has been verified to hunt the full size range of insectivores. They’ve also attacked bats of every size available, from the smallest European bat, the [...] common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), to the largest species there, the [...] greater noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus). In the Sikhote-Alin range of the Russian Far East, bats were found to comprise 5.9% of the remains and, of five local owl species, the Eurasian eagle-owl was the most regular predator of bats in the area.|$|E

50|$|The family Talpidae {{includes}} the moles, shrew moles, and <b>desmans.</b> Most {{members of this}} family have Eimer's organs, touch-sensitive structures on the snout. The <b>desmans</b> are semi-aquatic and have small sensory hairs that have been compared to the neuromasts of the lateral line. These hairs are termed “microvibrissae” due to their small size, ranging from 100 to 200 micrometers. They are located with the Eimer's organs on the snout and might sense water movements.|$|R
50|$|The family Talpidae {{includes}} the moles, shrew moles, <b>desmans,</b> and other intermediate forms of small insectivorous mammals {{of the order}} Soricomorpha. Talpids are all digging animals to various degrees: moles are completely subterranean animals; shrew moles and shrew-like moles somewhat less so; and <b>desmans,</b> while basically aquatic, excavate dry sleeping chambers; whilst the quite unique star-nosed mole is equally adept {{in the water and}} underground. Talpids are found across the Northern Hemisphere and southern Asia, Europe, and North America, although none are found in Ireland nor in the Americas south of northern Mexico.|$|R

50|$|<b>Desmans</b> and shrew moles are {{primarily}} nocturnal, but moles are active day and night, usually travelling above ground only {{under cover of}} darkness. Most moles dig permanent burrows, and subsist largely on prey that falls into them. The shrew moles dig burrows to access deep sleeping chambers, but forage for food {{on the forest floor}} by night. <b>Desmans</b> dig burrows in riverbanks for shelter and forage in the water of rivers and lakes. The star-nosed mole is able to make a living much as other moles do, but are also very capable aquatic creatures, where they are able to smell underwater by using their unique proboscis to hold out a bubble of air into the water.|$|R
50|$|Haldanodon was {{probably}} an aquatic insectivore {{akin to the}} modern platypus and <b>desmans.</b> This is indicated by numerous skeletal features, such as the strong forelimbs and specialized ends, the skull and the cephalic shield with eyes small and tight, all adaptations for digging and swimming. It occurred in a wetland environment, so aquatic foraging was very likely.|$|R

50|$|Pyrenean <b>desmans</b> are {{proficient}} swimmers, {{suited to}} their aquatic habitat, although their claws also {{allow them to}} be good at climbing. They live in pairs, with the male having a slightly larger territory than the female. Both members of the pair scent mark. They have the reputation of being aggressive to other adult members of the species.|$|R
50|$|Thus, Eulipotyphla {{comprises}} the hedgehogs and gymnures (family Erinaceidae, formerly also the order Erinaceomorpha), solenodons (family Solenodontidae), the <b>desmans,</b> moles, and shrew-like moles (family Talpidae) and true shrews (family Soricidae). True shrews, talpids and solenodons were formerly grouped in the clade Soricomorpha; however, Soricomorpha {{has been found}} to be paraphyletic, since erinaceids are the sister group of shrews.|$|R

50|$|All {{species have}} small eyes and poor eyesight, {{but only a}} few are truly blind. The {{external}} ears are very small or absent. Talpids rely primarily on their sense of touch, having sensory vibrissae on their faces, legs, and tails.

Unusually, the penis of talpids points backwards, and they have no scrotum.|$|R
5000|$|The family Talpidae {{contains}} all the true moles {{and some of}} their close relatives. <b>Desmans,</b> which are Talpidae but are not normally called [...] "moles", are not shown below, but belong to the subfamily Talpinae (note the slightly different name).

50|$|In the {{northern}} {{slope of the}} Cantabrian mountains, beech and oak groves of the Saja-Besaya Natural Park spread out; an important nature reserve abundant with deers, roe deers and golden eagles. The presence of Iberian wolves is not very rare, and brown bears have been sighted, thus considering this zone as an important nexus of communication between isolated populations of this plantigrade. There are also important colonies of griffon vultures. Other interesting species of animals that populate the area are: eagle owls, martens, badgers, stoats and <b>desmans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Generally, all aquatic <b>desmans,</b> shrews, and voles make quick dives {{and catch}} small fish and invertebrates. The giant otter shrew, for example, makes quick dives that last for seconds and grabs small crabs (usually {{no bigger than}} 7 cm across). The Lutrine opossum is the most {{carnivorous}} opossum, usually consuming small birds, rodents, and invertebrates. Water voles mainly eat grass and plants near the water and at times, they will also consume fruits, bulbs, twigs, buds, and roots. However, a population of water voles living in Wiltshire and Lincolnshire, England have started eating frogs' legs and discarding the bodies.|$|R
