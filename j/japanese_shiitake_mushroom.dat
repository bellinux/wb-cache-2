5000|$|<b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{dermatitis}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Flagellate mushroom dermatitis," [...] "Mushroom worker's disease," [...] and [...] "Shiitake-induced toxicoderma") is an intensely pruritic dermatitis characterized by disseminated 1mm erythematous micropapules {{seen in a}} linear grouped arrangement secondary to Koebnerization due to patient scratching. It {{is caused by the}} ingestion of <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> and was first described in 1977 by Nakamura. Although it is rarely seen outside of China and Japan due to a lower incidence of shiitake consumption outside these regions, there is a well-established association between flagellate dermatitis and <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Lentinula edodes) ingestion. Bleomycin ingestion may also cause similar findings. On physical exam, one key difference between the two is that post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation changes are usually seen with bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis and are not typically present with <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> induced flagellate dermatitis. The median time of onset from ingestion of <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> is typically 24 hours, ranging from 12 hours to 5 days. Most patients completely recover by 3 weeks, with or without treatment. Although the pathogenesis of shiitake induced flagellate dermatitis is not clear, the theory most argued for is a toxic reaction to lentinan, a polysaccharide isolated from <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> However, Type I and Type IV allergic hypersensitivities have also been supported by the 24-hour median time of onset, clearance in 3-21 days, severe pruritus, benefit of steroids and antihistamines, and lack of grouped outbreaks in people exposed to shared meals containing <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms.,</b> Most cases reported shortly after its discovery were due to consumption of raw <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> but several cases have since been reported after consumption of fully cooked mushrooms.|$|R

40|$|Functional foods {{may have}} a role to play in either {{preventing}} or treating obesity. Both preventive and treatment studies were carried out in this project. The preventive study was carried out in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) adding low dose (LD), medium dose (MD) and high dose (HD) of Oats (O) and <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> (M) containing 2 g/kg, 6 g/kg and 18 g/kg beta-glucans (LD-O, MD-O, HD-O and LD-M, MD-M, HD-M) compared to HFD control group for 6 weeks. The treatment study was carried out in obese rats induced by HFD for 8 weeks followed by adding <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> powder containing 6 g/kg, 12 g/kg and 18 g/kg beta-glucans in the diets as low, medium and high doses. The interesting findings of this study overall are, the diets with a <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> appeared to be stronger lowering plasma lipid than the diets with enriched oats which include their beneficial effect in lowering weight. The results showed that both oats and <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> enriched diets had significantly higher faecal fat exclusion compared to the HFD; while <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> enriched diet had lower levels of plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) level, total fat mass deposition and body weight gain compared to oat enriched diets. The HD-M group had the highest amount of faecal fat exclusion among all groups. In comparison to HFD, the HD-M diet prevented the increase in plasma TAG, fat deposition and body fat index and also resulted in decreased energy efficiency. Negative correlations were found between the amount of <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> supplementation and body weight gain, plasma TAG, and total fat masses. This study demonstrated that lowering of plasma TAG and prevention of BWG using a <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> enriched diet was also possibly influenced by eritadenine content in <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom.</b> We found that the HD-M group significantly increased liver weight per 100 g body weight and liver TAG compared with rats fed the LD-M and MD-M diets but it was not significantly different from rats fed the HFD. The rats in the HD-M group showed the highest incidence of hepatic ballooning, resulting from decreased ratio of liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which can probably be attributed to eritadenine contained in <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> This decrease ratio of PC to PE has been associated with increase membrane permeability and hence promoting influx of lipoproteins into the liver. Unlike the prevention study, the treatment study showed no significant effects. The <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> did not accomplish the dietary treatment effect on existing obesity. In conclusion, this study revealed that a <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> enriched diet was more powerful in preventing high-fat diet induced obesity than oats enriched diet through the increased fat faecal exclusion; however, increased TAG in liver can be an issue when ingesting a high dose of <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushroom.</b> But, the addition of choline chloride to the diet may help to prevent this side effect. This warrants further investigation. The treatment study showed that <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> enriched diet was not sufficient to reverse obesity. This information may provide significant information assisting the use of <b>Shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> and oats as functional foods for the prevention of obesity...|$|R

The smell was evaluated using powdered dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Age, original preference (OP), sex, sensory intensity (SI), hedonic preference (HP), and sample amount were set as parameters. About 70 % of panelists liked dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> There were significant correlations among age, OP, and SI. There was also a significant correlation between OP and HP, but no significant correlation between SI and HP. However, when the panelists were classified by OP, there was an optimal value between SI and HP for likers and neutralists. The calculated optimal concentration of dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> for likers and neutralists ranged widely. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between SI and HP for dislikers, and their HP decreased according to the increase in the amount of the substance. The results showed that different concentrations of odorous components in dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were needed to satisfy different consumer preferences.|$|R

30|$|The {{smell of}} food {{is one of}} the most {{important}} factors in assessing its quality. Concerning the smell of dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> [Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler], 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 -pentathiepane, commonly known as lenthionine, has been reported as a key compound. However, other compounds have not been studied sufficiently in connection with smell. From the results of sensory intensity studies and sensory evaluations of dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> a positive significant correlation at 1 % risk was observed between sensory intensity and sulfur perception. This showed that the smell of dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> was characterized by a sulfurous smell. Also, comparing the sensory intensity with the amounts of volatile components showed positive significant correlations at 1 % risk between sensory intensity and three compounds: 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane, 1, 2, 4, 6 -tetrathiepane, and lenthionine. Furthermore, significant correlations at 5 % risk were obtained between the amounts of these three compounds and sensory intensity by multiple regression analysis. This showed that the smell of dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> depended on these compounds. The partial regression coefficient of 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane was larger than those of the others, and so it was proposed that 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane could serve as an indicator to estimate the smell of dried <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of high-oxygen {{packaging}} (HOP) with initial 80 % and 100 % oxygen on fresh <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushrooms</b> was studied. Initial air in package was the control treatment. All the samples were stored at 10 °C with RH 90 % for 9 days. Respiration rate, hardness, TSS, and color were determined, and sensory quality was evaluated during the storage. Results indicated that high-oxygen packaging retarded the anaerobic metabolism occurrence and HOP with initial 100 % oxygen could maintain the lightness of shitake mushroom better than 80 % oxygen. Hardness and TSS did not show significant difference between high-oxygen packaging and control treatment. However, neither initial 100 % O 2 nor 80 % O 2 could reduce the respiration rate of fresh <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Sensory quality especially the aroma, cap color and gill color of fresh <b>shiitake</b> <b>mushroom</b> could be better maintained in high-oxygen packaging than control treatment.
