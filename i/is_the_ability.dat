5|$|Episodic memory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime.

5|$|Homeostasis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of an {{open system}} to {{regulate}} its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms.

5|$|Motor {{learning}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to refine}} patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition.

5|$|Semantic memory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to learn}} facts and relationships. This sort of memory is {{probably}} stored {{largely in the}} cerebral cortex, mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information.|$|E
5|$|Working memory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of {{the brain}} to {{maintain}} a temporary representation {{of information about the}} task that an animal is currently engaged in.

5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to resist}} the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it {{has been referred to}} as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding {{an element of}} third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, {{can also be used}} as weapons. Another new feature <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E

This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{contribute to}} antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and {{preventing them from}} catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are {{commonly referred to as}} antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E
