40|$|Abstract. Cyanogenic glycosides {{are found}} in many native and {{naturalized}} plants throughout North Amer-ica. The glycosides themselves are not toxic, but they yield hydrogen cyanide (<b>hydrocyanic</b> or prussic <b>acid)</b> when they are hydrolyzed by b-glycosidases, either {{as a result of}} injury to the plant cells or by microbial action in the rumen. Hydrogen cyanide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Cyanide ion binds with iron in cytochrome oxidase, interfering with cellular respiration. The clinical effects are peracute, often resulting in death less than 1 hour after ingestion. This study describes a case that resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in a herd of goats after exposure to California holly (Heteromeles arbutifolia). Acute poisonings by plants containing cyanogenic glycosides are infrequently reported in goats. This is largely because of their browsing habits, which limit the amount of any 1 plant that is ingested. It is also likely that cases of acute death in goats are not eval-uated and go undiagnosed. Goats have been used as experimental models for chronic cyanide ingestion; 10 therefore, their response to repeated subtoxic expo-sures has been well described. A clinical case of acute morbidity and mortality in a herd of goats after inges-tion of Heteromeles arbutifolia is presented. A backyard herd of 60 goats was maintained long-term on a diet consisting mostly of squash and cactus, and free access to a mineral block. In February 2002, after pruning what were believed to be olive trees, a neighbor donated the clippings that were subsequently fed to the goat herd. The clippings were later identified as H. arbutifolia. Within 4 hours of feeding, 3 animals died, and 7 were moribund. The affected animals were tachycardic and had marked jugular pulses. Mucous membranes were pale pink. No treatment was institut-ed in the affected, surviving goats. Field necropsies revealed multifocal hemorrhages in lungs and heart and congestion of the gastrointestinal tract. Kidney, lung, and liver were examined histologically from 3 animals. In addition, heart and abomasum were ex-amined from 2 of 3 animals and small intestine fro...|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen cyanide is weakly acidic with a pKa of 9.2. It {{partially}} ionizes {{in water}} solution {{to give the}} cyanide anion, CN−.

Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies.

25|$|The {{preparations}} {{contained in}} these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful preparations such as dilute <b>hydrocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> were ordered in the one country and dispensed {{according to the national}} pharmacopoeia in another. As a result, the Medical Act of 1858 ordained that the General Medical Council should publish a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, to be called the British Pharmacopoeia, which would be a substitute throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the separate pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been published in Latin. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This dissatisfaction was probably owing partly {{to the fact that the}} majority of the compilers of the work were not engaged in the practice of pharmacy, and therefore competent rather to decide upon the kind of preparations required than upon the method of their manufacture. The necessity for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized manuals.|$|E
25|$|Jack W. Szostak {{suggested}} that geothermal activity provides greater {{opportunities for the}} origination of life in open lakes {{where there is a}} buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains bicarbonate and calcium ions has the most optimal range. This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to Melvin Calvin, certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage. Some of these compounds like <b>hydrocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the stromatolites have been created. David Ward of Montana State University described the formation of stromatolites in hot mineral water at the Yellowstone National Park. Stromatolites survive in hot mineral water and in proximity to areas with volcanic activity. Processes have evolved in the sea near geysers of hot mineral water. In 2011, Tadashi Sugawara from the University of Tokyo created a protocell in hot water.|$|E

Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas.

60|$|Concluding Remarks on the Effects of the {{foregoing}} Agents.--As the glands, when excited, transmit some influence to the surrounding tentacles, causing them to bend and their glands to pour forth an increased amount of modified secretion, I was anxious to ascertain whether the leaves included any element having the nature of nerve-tissue, which, though not continuous, served as the channel of transmission. This led me to try the several alkaloids and other substances which are known to exert a powerful influence on the nervous system of animals; I was at first encouraged in my trials by finding that strychnine, digitaline, and nicotine, which all act on the nervous system, were poisonous to Drosera, and caused {{a certain amount of}} inflection. <b>Hydrocyanic</b> <b>acid,</b> again, which is so deadly a poison to animals, caused rapid movement of the tentacles. But as several innocuous acids, though much diluted, such as benzoic, acetic, &c., as well as some essential oils, are extremely poisonous to Drosera, and quickly cause strong inflection, it seems probable that strychnine, nicotine, digitaline, and <b>hydrocyanic</b> <b>acid,</b> excite inflection by acting on elements in no way analogous to the nerve-cells of animals. If elements of this latter nature had been present in the leaves, it might have been expected that morphia, hyoscyamus, atropine, veratrine, colchicine, curare, and diluted alcohol would have produced some marked effect; whereas [page 224] these substances are not poisonous and have no power, or only a very slight one, of inducing inflection. It should, however, be observed that curare, colchicine, and veratrine are muscle-poisons--that is, act on nerves having some special relation with the muscles, and, therefore, could not be expected to act on Drosera. The poison of the cobra is most deadly to animals, by paralysing their nerve-centres,* yet is not in the least so to Drosera, though quickly causing strong inflection.|$|E

But it is this very difficulty which the principle of unconscious selection removes. Undoubtedly no fancier ever did intentionally make such an attempt. All that we need suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently marked to catch the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier, and then unconscious selection carried on for many generations, that is, the wish of succeeding fanciers to excel their rivals, would do the rest. In the case of the Fantail we may suppose that the first progenitor of the breed had a tail only slightly erected, as may now be seen in certain Runts (6/45. See Neumeister's figure of the Florence Runt, tab. 13 in 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht.') with some {{increase in the number of}} the tail-feathers, as now occasionally occurs with Nuns.
