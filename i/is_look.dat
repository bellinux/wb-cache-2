The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But {{all you have to}} do <b>is</b> <b>look</b> at me to know / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E

As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to [...] "We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. [...] "One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, <b>is</b> <b>look</b> like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a choice we're making.'" [...] Around 1:30am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound [...] "sha-lum sha-lin-gay". Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. [...] "If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," [...] he announced.|$|E

New York Times correspondent Howard W. French said that according to his sources, Rice herself made the remark. The Congo Wars spearheaded by Rwanda led to over five million deaths. In 2012, when serving as UN ambassador, Rice opposed efforts to publicly censure Rwandan President Paul Kagame for again supporting a Congolese rebel group, this time in the 2012 Congo conflict, despite the sacking of the regional capital of Goma. The Rwandan government was a client when Rice worked at Intellibridge in 2001–02.|$|E

[...] Thus, the wreckage of a UK military aircraft is automatically a protected place even if the physical remains have not been previously discovered or identified. [...] Shipwrecks need to be specifically designated, and designation as a protected place applies only to vessels that sank after 4 August 1914 (the date of the United Kingdom's entry into the First World War). [...] The Act makes it an offence to interfere with a protected place, to disturb the site or to remove anything from the site. [...] Divers may visit the site but the rule <b>is</b> <b>look,</b> don't touch and don't penetrate. [...] The law concerning protected places applies anywhere in the world, but in practice, outside the UK, the sanctions can only be enforced against UK citizens, UK flagged ships, or vessels landing in the UK, unless backed by local legislation. [...] The first and only license granted in respect of a vessel designated a protected place was granted to Mike Williams of the Nautical Archaeology Society, for a project to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the loss of the M2 submarine including the placing of a white ensign underwater.|$|E

He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of [...] "weakness," [...] but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that “necessity” will make her love him once again.|$|E
