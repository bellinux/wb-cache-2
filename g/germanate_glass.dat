Intense {{green and red}} emissions centred at 525, 546, and 657 nm, corresponding to the transitions H- 2 (11 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2), S- 4 (3 / 2) -> 4 I(15 / 2), and F- 4 (9 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2), respectively, were simultaneously observed at room temperature. The quadratic dependence of the 525, 546, and 657 nm emissions on excitation power indicates that a two-photon absorption process occurs under 975 nm laser diode (LD) excitation. The Raman spectrum investigation indicates that oxychloride <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> has the maximum phonon energy at similar to 805 cm(- 1). The thermal stability of this oxychloride <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> is evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal stability factor Delta T (Delta T = T-x-T-g) is 187 degrees C.

40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} data, measured for two thallium <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> compositions, {{are presented}} and compared with previously published data for caesium germanate glasses. The measured coordination number, n(Ge-O), for the 10 mol%Tl 2 O thallium <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> {{is in good}} agreement with the average coordination number measured for the equivalent caesium germanate. However, while n(Ge-O) declines for caesium germanate glasses {{as the amount of}} modifier increases above 18 mol% Cs 2 O, n(Ge-O) for the 30 mol% Tl 2 O thallium <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> remains high with, on average, 4. 40 +/- 0. 03 oxygen neighbours per germanium. The difference in behaviour of the germanium coordination, compared to caesium germanate glasses, arises from a change in the average thallium environment, as the role of the thallium changes from that of a modifier (similar to an alkali), to a role where some of the thallium atoms act as network formers. This is supported by Tl- 205 NMR measurements which indicate the presence of two thallium environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we present}} three facile {{approaches}} to achieve wavelength tunable luminescence {{in the same}} host material with single dopant, i. e., by modulating doping level, preparation temperature, and atmosphere. Based on these methods, ultra-broadband tunable near-infrared luminescence with the largest full width at half maximum of about 500 [*]nm covering the whole windows of optical communication has been obtained in bismuth-doped <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses.</b> Wavelength tunable luminescence is also observed with the change of excitation wavelength. Systematical strategy was followed to approach the physical origin of the near-infrared luminescence and we proposed that three different bismuth active centers contribute to the near-infrared luminescence in the <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses.</b> A comprehensive explanation for the tunable luminescence is given, combining the concentration, energy transfer, and chemical equilibrium of these active centers in the glasses. With the increase of melting temperatures and the increase of reducing extent of the preparation atmosphere, bismuth species transform from Bi ³ ⁺ to Bi ² ⁺, Bi ⁺, Bi ⁰ and bismuth clusters, and then to bismuth colloid. Of particular interest is that red tunable luminescence was also observed by modulating doping level, preparation atmosphere, and excitation wavelength. Besides, the trapped-electron centers in <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses</b> can interact with bismuth species of high valence states leading {{to the formation of}} bismuth active centers of low valence states and the decrease of trapped-electron centers.

40|$|The {{work within}} this thesis investigates the {{characteristics}} and sensing properties of novel near- and mid-infrared tellurite and <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> fibres {{and their potential}} as sensing elements. An asymmetric splicing method for fusion-splicing tellurite and <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> fibres to standard silica fibre is demonstrated. The thermal and strain sensing properties of these glass fibres have been studied by analysing the properties of optical fibre Fabry-Perot cavities, which were formed when these high refractive index fibres were spliced to silica fibre, and fibre Bragg gratings. Using fibre F-P interferometer, the normalized thermal sensitivity of tellurite and germanate fibre {{was measured to be}} 10. 76 × 10 - 6 /°C and 15. 56 × 10 - 6 /°C respectively, and the normalized strain sensitivity of tellurite and germanate fibre was also measured with values of 0. 676 × 10 - 6 /με and 0. 817 × 10 - 6 /με respectively. These results show good agreement with measurements using fibre Bragg gratings in these fibres and are reasonably consistent with the values predicted using available published data for glasses of similar compositions.

The luminescent spectra exhibited that the upconversion luminescence originates from the Mn 2 + ions. The dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the pump power reveals that a two-photon excitation process dominates in the conversion of infrared radiation to the visible emission. It is suggested that the simultaneous absorption of two infrared photons produces the population of upper excited states, {{which leads to the}} characteristic visible emission.

The Ge-O coordination number (N(GeO)) increased from 4. 0 ± 0. 2 to 4. 5 ± 0. 2 with the decrease in x from 0. 98 to 0. 81. The increase in N(GeO) {{is consistent with a}} structural model that assumes that all oxygen form Ge-O-Ge and P-O-Ge linkages between Ge polyhedra and P tetrahedra and that new GeO(5) or GeO(6) polyhedra are formed with isolated PO(4) units when P(2) O(5) is added to GeO(2). The bond valencies in the P-O bonds of the PO(4) tetrahedra are greater than unity and are balanced in P-O-Ge bridges with underbonded Ge-O links in the GeO(5) or GeO(6) polyhedra. Mixed site connections are expected for the GeO(5) (or GeO(6)) and PO(4) units in glasses with relatively low (< 20  mol%) P(2) O(5) content due to the overwhelming fraction of GeO(4) tetrahedra.

As observed previously in alkali <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses,</b> the average Ge-O coordination number, n(GeO), is found to rise above four as Tl(2) O is added to the glass. However, whereas for alkali germanates n(GeO) has its maximum value (similar to 4. 36 +/- 0. 03) at similar to 19 mol % R(2) O (e. g., R = Cs), for thallium germanates it continues to rise until 30 mol % Tl(2) O, with a higher maximum value of 4. 44 +/- 0. 02. For low Tl(2) O content, most thallium cations are on modifier sites with a high coordination number (6 or greater). As the Tl(2) O content increases, glass former [TlO(3) ] sites become increasingly common, and it is predicted from an extrapolation of the results that a glass with a composition of 50 mol % Tl(2) O would be composed entirely of [TlO(3) ] and [GeO(4) ] units. It is shown that the presence of [TlO(3) ] units allows higher coordinated Ge units to share an oxygen, and this is why n(GeO) continues to rise beyond the composition for which it is a maximum in alkali germanates.

40|$|This work {{studied the}} spectroscopic {{properties}} of Er 3 +/Tm 3 + co-doped bismuth <b>germanate</b> <b>glass.</b> Through Tm 3 + co-doping and 980 nm LD pumping, the enhanced green (H- 2 (11 / 2), S- 4 (3 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2)) and red (F- 4 (9 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2)) upconversion emission {{as well as}} 2. 7 mu m emission (I- 4 (11 / 2) -> I- 4 (13 / 2)) of Er 3 + ions were observed. Meanwhile, the 1. 5 mu m emission (Er 3 +:I- 4 (13 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2)) is significantly suppressed. Broadband 1. 8 mu m emission (Tm 3 +:F- 3 -(4) -> H- 3 (6)) is got. The luminescent characteristics and dominant energy transfer mechanisms between Er 3 + and Tm 3 + ions are investigated. The emission cross section at 2. 7 gm of this glass {{is found to be}} as high as 1. 10 x 10 (- 20) cm(2). Therefore, the spectroscopic characteristics of Er 3 +/Tm 3 + co-doped bismuth <b>germanate</b> <b>glass</b> indicate it is a potential active medium for optical upconversion and mid-infrared luminescence devices.

40|$|The non-isothermal {{devitrification}} of lithium <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses,</b> {{examined by}} DTA and XRD, is reported and discussed. The glass compositions are {{expressed by the}} general formula: xLi 2 O(1 -x) GeO 2 with x = 0. 050, 0. 125, 0. 167, 0. 200 and 0. 250. All the glasses studied, unlike GeO 2 glass, exhibit internal crystal nucleation without the addition of any nucleating agent. The devitrification processes occur {{in one or more}} steps. Phases which crystallized at each step are identified and crystallization mechanisms proposed. These crystallization mechanisms are related to structures of the crystallizing phases. Activation energy values as well as those for glass transition temperatures, do not vary linearly with increase in Li 2 O content but pass through a maximum at x = 0. 200...|$|R
40|$|The glass {{samples were}} {{prepared}} {{in the series}} xK 2 O–(100 − x) GeO 2 with 0 < x < 27. 0, where x denotes the K 2 O mol%, by the solution method with high homogeneity. Brillouin spectroscopy has been performed for potassium <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses</b> with increasing alkali contents. The sound velocities and the elastic moduli were measured by Brillouin scattering in 90 A scattering geometry. Acoustic velocities for both longitudinal and transverse wave, Debye velocity, elastic moduli and Debye temperatures have been determined with all K 2 O mol% contents. Each property shows its maximum at about 15 mol% K 2 O content. This indicates that about 15 mol% K 2 O content provides the maximum sound velocity. It {{has been found that}} the glass transition temperatures are related to the Debye temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the Ge–O {{coordination}} number, nGeO, in <b>germanate</b> <b>glasses</b> is {{of paramount}} importance for understanding the germanate anomaly and relating the glass structure to its thermophysical properties. By careful measurement using high resolution neutron diffraction on two samples of 40 PbO. 60 GeO 2 glass, it is clearly demonstrated that the average Ge–O coordination number, nGeO, is much less than the value, 4. 77 (5), previously obtained by use of neutron diffraction [Umesaki et al., Physica B 213 (1995) 490]. However, {{it is also clear that}} nGeO is still significantly greater than four (~ 4. 1), and this is supported by the observed asymmetry of the Ge–O peak in the real-space total correlation functions. The average Pb–O coordination number is a little in excess of three, typical of Pb 2 + with a sterically active lone-pair of electrons...|$|R
