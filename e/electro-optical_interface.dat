40|$|An analog <b>electro-optical</b> <b>interface</b> {{has been}} studied, which uses the well known field effect of index {{modulation}} in thin homeotropic layers of nematic liquid crystal, achieved under a. c. electric field. Such a device {{is able to}} present in real-time 64 analog samples of an electric signal in a few milliseconds on a coherent optical set. By means of this interface, electric signals such as electro encephalograms, engine vibrations or SONAR signals can be spectrally analyzed in real-time by optical Fourier transform...|$|E
40|$|The <b>electro-optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> for {{the central}} and endcap calorimeters of the CMS {{experiment}} at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are readout boxes that receive optical signals via fiber-optic waveguides from the calorimeter $ 9 scintillator megatiles that comprise the active elements of the detector and decode these signals for energy measurement. The phototransducers housed within the readout boxes are Hybrid Photodiodes (HPDs) which detect and amplify the $ 9 optical signals. Digitization is provided by preamplifiers or by QIE (Charge, Integration, and Encode) chips. Output signals am then transmitted from the readout boxes to Trigger/DAQ systems located off-detector. Design concepts and $ 9 construction details are presented for the first pre-production-prototype readout boxes. (2 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a design for fiber-optic sensing and control in advanced aircraft Electronic Engine Control (EEC). The recommended architecture is an on-engine EEC which contains electro-optic interface circuits for fiber-optic sensors. Size and weight are reduced by multiplexing arrays of functionally similar sensors on a pairs of optical fibers to common <b>electro-optical</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The architecture contains interfaces to seven sensor groups. Nine distinct fiber-optic sensor types {{were found to}} provide the sensing functions. Analysis revealed no strong discriminator (except reliability of laser diodes and remote electronics) {{on which to base}} a selection of preferred common interface type. A hardware test program is recommended to assess the relative maturity of the technologies and to determine real performance in the engine environment...|$|R
40|$|This chapter covers some of {{the latest}} {{developments}} in optical correlation techniques for face recognition using the concept of spectral fusion and placing a special emphasis on its practical aspects and applications for face recognition. Optical correlation is reviewed as a method to carry out instantly a decision on the target form (form to be recognized). A range of relevant practical topics is discussed, such as JTC (Joint Transform Correlator) and the Vander-Lugt architectures. Both of them are based on the " 4 f" optical setup and on a comparison between the target image and a reference image. The similarity between the two images is achieved by the detection of a correlation peak. The development of suitable algorithms for optical correlation and new technologies in <b>electro-optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> has significantly improved the processing capacity of optical correlators and reduce their sizes. To overcome the limitations of a decision taken by a simple detection of a correlation peak, more complex decision algorithms are required. These algorithms necessitate the integration of new correlation filters and the realization of multiple correlations and reconfigurable multi-channel architectures...|$|R
40|$|Results of a {{study to}} design an optimal {{architecture}} for electro-optical sensing and control in advanced aircraft and space systems are described. The propulsion full authority digital Electronic Engine Control (EEC) was the focus for the study. The recommended architecture is an on-engine EEC which contains electro-optic interface circuits for fiber-optic sensors on the engine. Size and weight are reduced by multiplexing arrays of functionally similar sensors {{on a pair of}} optical fibers to common <b>electro-optical</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The architecture contains common, multiplex interfaces to seven sensor groups: (1) self luminous sensors; (2) high temperatures; (3) low temperatures; (4) speeds and flows; (5) vibration; (6) pressures; and (7) mechanical positions. Nine distinct fiber-optic sensor types were found to provide these sensing functions: (1) continuous wave (CW) intensity modulators; (2) time division multiplexing (TDM) digital optic codeplates; (3) time division multiplexing (TDM) analog self-referenced sensors; (4) wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) digital optic code plates; (5) wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) analog self-referenced intensity modulators; (6) analog optical spectral shifters; (7) self-luminous bodies; (8) coherent optical interferometers; and (9) remote electrical sensors. The report includes the results of a trade study including engine sensor requirements, environment, the basic sensor types, and relevant evaluation criteria. These figures of merit for the candidate interface types were calculated from the data supplied by leading manufacturers of fiber-optic sensors...|$|R
