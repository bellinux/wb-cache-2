Subsequent empirical research on gender earnings differentials will demonstrate the effectiveness of this initiative across countries.|$|R

Complex geometries, which are driven by the need for higher fuel mass flow rates, makes casting fuel grains for hybrid rockets expensive and time consuming {{due in part to}} equipment costs.

The proposed solution is implemented into an open-source message-passing MPSoC through developing a POSIX-like thread API, which shows excellent scalability using application kernels used for benchmarking in shared-memory systems. This approach efficiently draws strengths from the on-chip distributed private memory that opens the way to exposing the multithreading programmability/capabilities of that component as a general-purpose accelerator...|$|R

Our approach uses a simulation platform, to model and simulate computational science environments, and metamorphic testing, to check the correctness of energy consumption in these systems...|$|R

The use of inverted indexes and compression techniques is partially accountable for the current performance achievement of web search engines. In this paper, we introduce {{a new class of}} compression techniques for inverted indexes, the Adaptive Frame of Reference, that provides fast query response time, good compression ratio and also fast indexing time. We compare our approach against a number of state-of-the-art compression techniques for inverted index based on three factors: compression ratio, indexing and query processing performance. We show that significant performance improvements can be achieved. ...|$|R

Reducing the cost of personal remittances is the most promising area of policy intervention for several reasons. First, it will stanch a drain on the resources of poor migrants and their families back home. Second, it will increase flows through formal channels, especially banks. Third, it will improve financial access for the poor in developing countries. Cost is usually not an <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> remittance...|$|R

Features of model objects are extracted at levels that are most appropriate to yield only the necessary yet sufficient details, together they form the kernel. Instead of relying on image segmentation, a method of feature localization based on locales is developed. It is shown that the deployment of the recognition kernel and locales in a pyramidal (multiresolution) framework delivers good retrieval results. 1...|$|R
