5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E

5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

5000|$|An airline carrier's {{collective}} bargaining agreement with <b>flight</b> <b>crews</b> stipulates the maximum seating capacity of regional aircraft; as such, any aircraft that exceeds this capacity must operate as a mainline flight.

50|$|Contributing to the {{accident}} were (1) the <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> failure to monitor airspeed {{in relation to}} the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the black}} boxes and {{communication}} transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the ExcelAire's <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> {{and the air}} traffic controllers, trying {{to piece together the}} scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on instrument flights in positive control airspace.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|Director of <b>Flight</b> <b>Crew</b> Operations Deke Slayton {{selected}} the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookie Donn F.

Slayton replaced him with Chaffee, and NASA announced the crew selection on March 21, 1966. James McDivitt, David Scott and Russell Schweickart were named as the backup crew.|$|E

5|$|On September 3, a C-130 Hercules {{air force}} flight left Caracas, Venezuela for Spain, with a <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> of 8 and 60 {{members of the}} Central University of Venezuela choir. That night, heavy {{rainfall}} from the hurricane forced the plane {{to land on the}} Azores island of Terceira Island, Portugal. After attempting twice to land in hurricane-force winds, the plane crashed in a hill one mile from the runway of Lajes Field, killing all 68 aboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members of the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> were killed upon impact.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
