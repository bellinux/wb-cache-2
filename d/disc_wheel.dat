25|$|In the 1989 Tour de France, 1988 winner Pedro Delgado {{was the big}} favourite, with Fignon, Stephen Roche, and Erik Breukink listed {{together}} as top contenders. After Delgado inexplicably was nearly three minutes late {{for the start of}} the prologue time trial, the race was open to all contenders, and ended up a battle between Greg LeMond and Fignon. LeMond won a minute in the time trial in stage five, using aerobars which enabled a new and more aerodynamic riding position (also known as tri-bars as they had previously only been used in triathlons), a new type of teardrop-shaped aerodynamic helmet in the time trials and a rear <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> Fignon used normal road handlebars and a bicycle with both front and rear disc wheels, which left him more affected by cross winds. LeMond led the general classification after that stage by 5 seconds. In the tenth stage, Fignon beat LeMond by 12 seconds, and became the new leader, 7 seconds ahead of LeMond. In the time trial of stage 15, LeMond again won time on Fignon, and took back the leading position. Fignon came back by dropping LeMond on Alpe d'Huez, taking back the lead, and after he won alone at Villard-de-Lans the next day, the margin was 50 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Fignon {{had won the}} Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a {{very capable}} time trialist. It seemed {{improbable}} that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short course. This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer {{against one of the}} fastest chrono-specialists in the world. LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position. He rode the time trial with a [...] rear <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> a cut-down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip-on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win. Holding his time trialing position LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon, who used a pair of disc wheels but chose to go helmetless and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times, LeMond rode flat-out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 8 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-Élysées, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.|$|E
50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> style (bypass) is {{very similar}} in design to the drum style {{humidifier}}s; this type of furnace humidifier replaces the foam drumming {{with a number of}} plastic discs with small grooves on both sides. This allows for a very large evaporative surface area, without requiring a great deal of space. Unlike the drum style humidifiers, the <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> does not need regular replacement.|$|E
50|$|Solid <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} as well, though in outdoor {{settings}} these are generally not used on the front wheel because they are difficult to handle in crosswinds. <b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> provide a significant aerodynamic advantage when mounted on the rear wheel improving laminar flow over the rear half of the bike. Recent developments in technology {{have given rise to}} <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> with a dimpled surface like a golf ball, also in the name of aerodynamics. <b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> are not permitted at the Ironman World Championships in Kona Hawaii, as large crosswinds are not uncommon and present an unsafe situation to athletes.|$|R
50|$|All models had Budd {{split rim}} <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> with 12.20×20-20” tires. Dual rear {{mud and snow}} tires were used.|$|R
50|$|Mavic {{makes some}} of the most popular and {{successful}} carbon <b>disc</b> <b>wheels,</b> which have been used to win many races.|$|R
50|$|The wobbly-web {{wheel is}} a form of metal <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> where the disc is 'wobbled' into spokes. This {{provides}} a stiffer, lightweight wheel.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Design== The BFB {{comprises}} {{a single}} disc, with teardrop-shaped indentations to give rigidity, and lightening holes to reduce weight. The advantage over a spoked wheel {{is that a}} <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> carries the tyre (the metal hoop shrunk onto the wheel to provide contact with the rail) more efficiently; spoked wheels are prone to shrink over time, causing the tyre to work loose, whilst in a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> this is less pronounced. Disc wheels also distribute the weight more evenly, reducing the hammer effect on, and thus the damage to, the rail.|$|E
5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} use spoked {{driving wheels}} of cast steel. A few makers have favoured variants of this, seeking a more weight-efficient design by using {{various forms of}} hollow or girder spoke, rather than solid oval-section spokes. One {{of the most successful}} of these designs was the Bulleid Firth Brown (or BFB) wheel, often incorrectly confused with the Boxpok wheel. This had some features of the wobbly web, being developed from a flat <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> with short, wide [...] "spokes" [...] formed in it by displacing teardrop-shaped sections of the disc into another plane. Except for a few small lightening holes, this <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> is consistently one wall thickness thick, all around the disc.|$|E

50|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{designed}} to minimize aerodynamic drag. A full disc is usually heavier than traditional spoke wheels, and {{can be difficult to}} handle when ridden with a cross wind. For this reason, international cycling organizations often ban <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> or limit their use to the rear wheel of a bicycle. However, international triathlon federations were (and are still) less restrictive and is what led to the wheels' initial usage growth in popularity in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The Sports Junior was an English {{automobile}} manufactured between 1920 and 1921. A 10 hp two-seater with a four-cylinder Peters engine, it had detachable <b>disc</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Emery was {{the first}} rider from the USA to ride a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was made for the USA team by {{aerodynamics}} expert Chester Kyle. In 1987, Emery {{became involved in the}} development of a new style of aerodynamic handlebars.|$|E
50|$|Wire wheels, {{with their}} {{excellent}} weight-to-strength ratio, soon became popular for light vehicles. For everyday cars, wire wheels were soon {{replaced by the}} less expensive metal <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> but wire wheels remained popular for sports cars up to the 1960s. Spoked wheels are still popular on motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, {{the company}} was founded by {{motorsports}} engineer Leigh Sargent and released its first carbon fiber <b>disc</b> <b>wheel.</b> Zipp was acquired by bicycle component manufacturer SRAM in November 2007. In October 2010, Zipp relocated from its original design and manufacturing facility in Speedway, Indiana to an expanded site in Indianapolis.|$|E
50|$|Transmission {{of power}} to the rear wheels was {{achieved}} using a four speed manual stick-shift gear-box. There was no synchromesh. The car was fitted with conventional steel <b>disc</b> <b>wheels,</b> with perforated <b>wheel</b> <b>discs</b> (featuring a ring of holes between the hub and the tyre) replacing the plain discs in 1937.|$|R
50|$|The Ravailler was a French {{automobile}} manufactured only in 1907. Possibly {{the first}} successful amphibious car, it was a 20 hp vehicle complete with steel hull, chain drive, and <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> with solid tires.|$|R
50|$|The Wolseley Wasp {{was a light}} {{saloon car}} {{produced}} by Wolseley Motors Limited in 1935 and 1936. It was {{an updated version of}} the Wolseley Nine model with a larger engine and steel <b>disc</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bulleid Firth Brown wheel was a {{locomotive}} wheel {{developed for the}} Southern Railway in the late 1930s. It was a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{in contrast to the}} usual spoked wheels in general use on British railways. The wheel was designed by Oliver Bulleid and developed by the steel company Firth Brown of Sheffield.|$|E
50|$|Key {{features}} of the wobbly web wheel are that they are designed as a modification of the <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> with additional shaping, rather than a spoked wheel with merged spokes. They can be manufactured by either pressing from sheet steel, or by casting in light alloys. To avoid stress risers, the webs are formed into smooth curves, rather than sharply defined spokes.|$|E
50|$|The {{truck was}} {{powered by the}} larger of Studebaker's L-head six-cylinder {{flathead}} engines and mated to a 3-speed manual transmission. Studebaker offered a Borg-Warner 3-speed transmission with overdrive as an option. Other options included, a radio, heater, wire reinforced sliding back window and turn indicators. Two wheel options were available including a stamped steel <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> and a stamped steel 'artillery' spoked wheel.|$|E

5000|$|The Sun {{automobile}} of Toledo {{was a small}} two-seat roadster, {{with power}} coming from a [...] four-cylinder engine, produced in 1921 and 1922 only. It featured a 91-inch (2311 mm) wheelbase, <b>disc</b> <b>wheels,</b> and a claimed 50 mpg and 50 mph.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nut {{embedded}} <b>disc</b> grinding <b>wheels,</b> {{also known}} as disc grinding or F-Type wheels, are required for many production jobs. Nut pull-out is a common problem encountered in <b>disc</b> grinding <b>wheels.</b> The present work proposes a simple fixture, using which {{the integrity of the}} nut in the grinding wheel can be assessed. This method can be adopted by any grinding wheel manufacturer for a realistic estimate of nut pull out strength in double <b>disc</b> grinding <b>wheels...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Standboden {{site was}} {{extensively}} occupied during the Neolithic period. Tree ring analysis has found settlements from 3160 BC, 2850 BC, 2820 BC, 2750-2690 BC and 2660-2620 BC. Strandboden {{and the nearby}} Ländti site were discovered and first excavated by E. von Fellenberg and V. Gross in 1881/82. The site was also explored in 1937, 1960, 1980, 1985/86 and 2005. One {{of the most interesting}} discoveries was a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> from 2750 BC.|$|E
50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> {{may simply}} be a fairing that clips onto a traditional, spoke wheel, {{addressing}} the drag that the spokes generate by covering them; or the disc can be integral to the wheel with no spokes inside. In the latter case carbon fiber is the material of choice. A spoke wheel with a disc cover may not be legal under UCI Union Cycliste Internationale rules {{because it is a}} non-structural fairing but are again acceptable under ITU International Triathlon Union rules.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory of}} a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> {{depends on their}} {{behaviour}} as a stressed skin structure. Their materials {{are assumed to be}} , but flexible. Such a skin is stiff against tensile loads in the plane of the skin, but flexible for loads perpendicular to it. A flat disc is thus strong for [...] loads in the plane of the disc and also for torques. It is flexible for axial loads, perpendicular to the disc plane and also for nutating, wobble of the axle at an angle to the main axis.|$|E
50|$|Engers {{also used}} large gears, {{creating}} {{a fashion that}} led to increasingly higher gears being used by many competitors, often inappropriately. For all this technical innovation, Engers' records were set {{in the days before}} low profile bikes, tri-bars, <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> and skin suits.|$|R
50|$|In {{the town}} had a factory for steel <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> and rims which around ⅝ of the {{production}} is for the market in European union.Other big factory Metarem is {{for the needs of}} the farming constructions and farming transport machines.It had companies for cardboard.|$|R
50|$|The model {{purchase}} by Belgium {{was not a}} pack gun and {{was equipped}} for towing by motor transport. The Belgian model had a one-piece box-trail that was hinged to fold upwards to reduce towing length and was equipped with steel <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> with rubber tires.|$|R
50|$|A {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> particularly for front wheels, is the lack of airflow through the wheels, which is important for cooling the brake discs. The rear wheels of single-seat racing cars are driven by driveshafts from the transaxle and the brakes are usually mounted inboard in any case, away from the wheels. Later Lotus designs, from the 26 onwards, used spoked wheels, although this was more about the shrinking diameter of racing tyres, especially fronts, rather than brake cooling. With an open-wheel racing car, any shrouding from the wheels was never a serious limitation.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Peterson Tuners {{developed}} {{a line of}} Virtual Strobe electronic strobe tuners that use a LCD dot-matrix display to emulate a mechanical strobe <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> creating a stroboscopic effect. Peterson began using the [...] "Strobo" [...] name {{for all of its}} new Virtual Strobe line of products. According to the company, this was a response to other manufacturers using the word [...] "strobe" [...] for non-strobe tuners. The Peterson 'strobo' tuner line guarantees 1/10th cent accuracy, or higher by using patented technology. Peterson claims the Virtual Strobe display delivers higher resolution than needle or LED-based tuners.|$|E
50|$|Maunsell was {{succeeded in}} 1937 by Oliver Vaughan Snell Bulleid, who brought {{experience}} gained under Sir Nigel Gresley at the LNER. He designed the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear that was compact {{enough to fit}} within the restrictions of his Pacific designs, the Merchant Navy class of 1941 and the Light Pacific design of 1945. Ever the innovator, Bulleid introduced welded steel boilers and steel fireboxes which were easier to repair than the copper variety, whilst a new emphasis on cab ergonomics was followed. Established locomotive design practices were altered in his designs, with the wheels changed from the traditional spoked to his BFB <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> design, giving better all-round support to the tyre.|$|E
50|$|Equipment used is very specialized, and {{component}} manufacturers {{can spend}} vast sums {{of time and}} money on wind tunnel testing to ensure their product is faster than the competition's. Deep section or solid <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> are often used to reduce turbulence around the spokes, but these can affect handling in windy conditions. In the UK the front wheel must have a minimum of 45% open area when viewed from the side, for safety reasons. UCI events still permit the use of <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> for the front, but it is very unusual. Many components are modified for aerodynamic efficiency, and manufacturers are now developing more integrated systems, such as brakes built into the fork or frame so as not to disturb the airflow.|$|R
50|$|The Lancia Astura {{was a more}} {{powerful}} and more luxurious version of this car {{based on the same}} platform. Besides the engines, main differences between the two cars were the Artena's Michelin <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> instead of the Astura's Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels, and the Astura's longer wheelbase.|$|R
5000|$|Characteristic of ÜK {{locomotives}} are e.g. <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> on {{the carrying}} axles and {{the omission of}} the front side windows in the driver's cabs. Even preheaters, feed pumps, Frontschürzen, smoke deflectors and other equipment not essential for {{the operation of the}} locomotives were sometimes left out.|$|R
