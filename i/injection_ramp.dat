40|$|The LHC {{follows a}} complex {{operational}} cycle with 12 major phases that include equipment tests, preparation, beam <b>injection,</b> <b>ramping</b> and squeezing, finally {{followed by the}} physics phase. This cycle is modelled and enforced with a state machine, whereby each operational phase is represented by a state.

The State Machine framework was developed to cater for building independent or embedded state machines. They safely drive between the states executing tasks bound to transitions and broadcast related information to interested parties. The framework encourages users to program their own actions. Simple configuration management allows the operators to define and maintain complex models themselves. An emphasis was also put on easy interaction with the remote state machine instances through standard communication protocols. On top of its core functionality, the framework offers a transparent integration with other crucial tools used to operate LHC, such as the LHC Sequencer.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the effects of multiple injections (pilot, split, and, post injection) on the combustion process and specific NOx and soot engine-out emissions fm Heavy-Duty DI diesel engine (displacement 2. 02 l), equipped with an advanced two-actuator, Electronic Unit Injector (EUI) system. Investigated parameters were the amount of fuel injected during each injection pulse, the dwell time between the injection pulses, and the start of injection (SOl). Two engine loads (25 % and 75 %) at 1200 rpm, conforming to European Stationary C (ESC) measuring points, were selected for the experiments. Both "conventional" measuring techniques and flame imaging using the AVL VisioScopeTM system were used. A key characteristic of the EUI system is that the injection pressure increases during the <b>injection</b> (<b>ramp</b> shape) which allows the second injection to be injected at a higher injection pressure than the first. It was found that a reduction in soot emission could be obtained at low load with a long dwell between the and second pulses. In contrast, at high load the multiple injections did not show any improvement, and soot emissions were even worse with very late injection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{horizontal}} and vertical betatron tunes of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) mainly depend {{on the strength of}} the quadrupole magnets, but are also affected by the quadrupole component in the main dipoles. In case of systematic misalignments, the sextupole component from the main dipoles and sextupole corrector magnets also affect the tunes due to the feed down effect. During the first years of operation of the LHC, the tunes have been routinely measured and corrected through either a feedback or a feed forward system. In this paper, the evolution of the tunes during <b>injection,</b> <b>ramp</b> and flat top are reconstructed from the beam measurements and the settings of the tune feedback loop and of the feed forward corrections. This gives the obtained precision of the magnetic model of the machine with respect to quadrupole and sextupole components. Measurements at the injection plateau show an unexpected large decay whose origin is not understood. This data is discussed together with the time constants and the dependence on previous cycles. We present results of dedicated experiments that show that this effect does not originate from the decay of the main dipole component. During the ramp, the tunes drift by about 0. 022. It is shown that this is related to the precision of tracking the quadrupole field in the machine and this effect is reduced to about 0. 01 tune units during flat top...|$|E

A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model for flow field, spray, spray-wall interactions, combustion, and emission formation processes {{have been used to}} carry out the computations. The optimized omega combustion chamber geometry was used in the diesel engine model instead of baseline cylindrical geometry and the results were verified for this improved combustion chamber geometry. Results for different injection modes indicate that using the <b>ramp</b> <b>injection</b> rate curve, the spray-wall impinging is increased due to higher injection rate at the end of injection duration. Also the increased in-cylinder temperature, piston surface temperature and higher turbulence intensity leads to enhanced wall-film evaporation. Soot mass fraction also decreases due to improved air-fuel mixing and evaporation of wall-film by reduction of the fuel rich zones especially in the impingement regions. Results for different injection modes indicate that using the <b>ramp</b> <b>injection</b> rate shape slightly retards the combustion process and improves combustion characteristics while maintaining lower NOx and considerably lower soot emissions compared to the boot and rectangle injection modes. Also, in this injection mode, because of the high pressure injection, higher spray droplet velocities (higher Weber number) and increased wall spray height than the other modes, it could be said that the dominant impingement regime may be the splashing regime.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the different control strategies {{deployed in the}} LHC cryogenic system in order to compensate the beam induced effects in real-time. LHC beam is inducing important heat loads along the 27 km of beam screens due to synchrotron radiations, image current and electron clouds. These dynamic heat loads disturb significantly the cryogenic plants and automatic compensations are mandatory to operate the LHC at full energy. The LHC beam screens must be maintained in an acceptable temperature range around 20 K to ensure a good beam vacuum, especially during beam <b>injections</b> and energy <b>ramping</b> where the dynamic responses of cryogenic systems cannot be managed with conventional feedback control techniques. Consequently, several control strategies such as feed-forward compensation have been developed and deployed successfully on the machine during 2015 where the beam induced heat loads are forecast in real-time to anticipate their future effects on cryogenic systems. All these developments have been first entirely modeled and simulated dynamically to be validated, allowing then a smooth deployment during the LHC operation...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An equivalent contrast-enhanced (CE) MRA injection protocol was developed with controlled injection modalities (injection rate, volume, and dose) in rabbits and pigs. P 792, a blood pool contrast agent, was injected in 17 male New Zealand rabbits and five farm pigs with variable injection schemes (mono- and multiphasic). From the gadolinium (Gd) blood concentration data, a simulation of an MR acquisition was performed to evaluate the impact of such an injection protocol on MR arterial signal and to select the best injection protocol. RESULTS: An empirical relationship between the arterial peak concentration and the injection parameters {{was found in the}} rabbits and pigs, allowing precise prediction of the first-pass profile. Of the four injection scheme strategies tested (standard bolus and bi-, tri-, and multiphasic injection protocols), the multiphasic "ramp" injection protocol provided the most optimal contrast agent pharmacokinetics with a durable plateau of concentration.

Part of the shear layer flow is directed upstream forming a recirculation zone that enhances mixing and provides flameholding benefits. Significant (passive) control authority over the flow is demonstrated by using variable mass <b>injection</b> through the <b>ramp,</b> and also by varying {{the level of}} heat release in the flow. molecular mixing was measured employing the hypergolic hydrogen-fluorine chemical reaction.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the high {{luminosity}} expected from the Large Hadron Collider, the beta function at the interaction points must be minimised.

Secondly, simulations of beam parameters based on the strength of the magnets extracted from the control system are introduced and validated with measurements.

40|$|Predator {{pressure}} and olfactory cues (alarm substance) {{have been shown}} to modulate Mauthner cell (M-cell) initiated startle escape responses (C-starts) in teleost fish. The regulation of such adaptive responses to potential threats is thought to involve the release of steroid hormones such as cortisol. However, the mechanism by which cortisol may regulate M-cell excitability is not known. Here, we used intrasomatic, in vivo recordings to elucidate the acute effects of cortisol on M-cell membrane properties and sound evoked post-synaptic potentials (PSPs). Cortisol tonically decreased threshold current in the M-cell within 10 min before trending towards baseline excitability over an hour later, which may indicate the involvement of non-genomic mechanisms. Consistently, current <b>ramp</b> <b>injection</b> experiments showed that cortisol increased M-cell input resistance in the depolarizing membrane, i. e., by a voltage-dependent postsynaptic mechanism. Cortisol also increases the magnitude of sound-evoked M-cell PSPs by reducing the efficacy of local feedforward inhibition (FFI). Interestingly, another pre-synaptic inhibitory network mediating prepulse inhibition (PPI) remained unaffected. Together, our results suggest that cortisol rapidly increases M-cell excitability via a post-synaptic effector mechanism, likely a chloride conductance, which, in combination with its dampening effect on FFI, will modulate information processing to reach threshold. Given the central role of the M-cell in initiating startle, these results are consistent with a role of cortisol in mediating the expression of a vital behavior...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on decerebrate adult cats to {{examine the effect of}} brainstem-evoked fictive locomotion on the threshold voltage (Vth) at which action potentials were initiated in hindlimb motoneurones. Measurements of the voltage threshold of the first spike evoked by intracellular <b>injection</b> of depolarizing <b>ramp</b> currents or square pulses were compared during control and fictive locomotor conditions. The sample of motoneurones included flexor and extensor motoneurones, and motoneurones with low and high rheobase currents. In all 38 motoneurones examined, action potentials were initiated at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials during fictive locomotion than in control conditions (mean hyperpolarization - 8. 0 ± 5. 5 mV; range - 1. 8 to - 26. 6 mV). Hyperpolarization of Vth occurred immediately at the onset of fictive locomotion and recovered in seconds (typically < 60 s) following the termination of locomotor activity. The Vth of spikes occurring spontaneously without intracellular current injection was also reduced during locomotion. Superimposition of rhythmic depolarizing current pulses on current ramps in the absence of locomotion did not lower Vth to the extent seen during fictive locomotion. We suggest that Vth hyperpolarization results from an as yet undetermined neuromodulatory process operating during locomotion and is not simply the result of the oscillations in membrane potential occurring during locomotion. The hyperpolarization of Vth for action potential initiation during locomotion is a state-dependent increase in motoneurone excitability. This Vth hyperpolarization may be a fundamental process in the generation of motoneurone activity during locomotion and perhaps other motor tasks...|$|R
40|$|Time-averaged {{measurements}} of pressure, temperature, velocity, and injectant mole fraction are presented using the planar laser-induced iodine fluorescence technique {{in the complex}} three-dimensional compressible flowfield around a swept ramp fuel injector. Within the range of thermodynamic conditions present in the test case studied, the technique's accuracy {{is estimated to be}} 4 % for pressure, temperature, and velocity and 3 % for injectant mole fraction. Comparisons with numerical simulations using the SPARK three-dimensional Navier-Stokes computer code with an algebraic turbulence model are made at the centerplane of the flowfield as well as on three crossflow planes downstream of the injector. Calculations and measurements are in good agreement throughout the flowfield, with deviations on the order of 5 %; however, in specific regions, such as in the base of the ramp, deviations are larger. A weak asymmetry in the incoming flowfield appears to be amplified by boundary-layer separation occurring when the ramp-generated shock reflects off the tunnel walls. Ramp-generated vortices are weaker in the calculated results due to the effects of numerical viscosity in the vortex cores. This leads to less turning and mixing of the jet plume than observed in the experiments. The rate of decay of the maximum injectant mole fraction with streamwise distance is greater for the present <b>ramp</b> <b>injection</b> scheme than for previously measured transverse injection schemes.

40|$|Instability, flow {{separation}} and transition are essential aspects of high speed flows with shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction. Supersonic flows with jet <b>injection,</b> compression <b>ramp</b> and cavity, either individually or in combination, are numerically studied by solving directly the compressible Navier-Stokes equations {{to better understand}} the transition of high speed laminar boundary layer to turbulence and the influence of {{flow separation}}. A sonic jet injected into a Mach 6. 69 crossflow is studied through both two-dimensional(2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) simulations. Effects of the momentum flux ratio (Jp) are evaluated. A 3 D global instability is observed with a critical value of Jp below but close to 0. 1. The most unstable mode is found to have a spanwise wavelength of 8 times the incoming boundary layer displacement thickness. Streamwise vortices are observed at the saturated stage. Ramp flow is studied at Mach number 4. 8 and Reynolds numbers of 6, 843 and 3, 422. The flow is stable in two dimensions. Simulations in 3 D show that the flow is globally unstable at higher Reynolds number, while being stable at the lower Reynolds number, suggesting that a critical Reynolds number for instability exists between these two Reynolds numbers. The most unstable mode for the ramp flow has a spanwise wavelength of 12 times the incoming boundary layer displacement thickness. For the ramp flow with higher Reynolds number, breakdown to turbulence is observed, however this occurs downstream of the region where the global mode is active, suggesting that the global mode does not lead to transition directly but provides a disturbance seed which gives rise to transient growth, leading to streaks which subsequently breakdown to turbulence. Effects of an upstream cavity and a downstream sonic jet injection on the Mach 4. 8 ramp flow are studied. It is found that the jet could greatly increase flow separation while the cavity has little effect. Similar configuration is studied for a supersonic ramp flow at Mach 5. 3 with a Mach 3. 6 jet injection for a practical application to rocket stage separation. Effects of cavity and jet on laminar boundary layer separation are firstly evaluated through a 2 D parametric study. Ramp flow with turbulent boundary layer is simulated at greater detail in 3 D. Then a slot jet is switched on to evaluate the laminar and turbulent inflow effect on the flow separation. A shorter separation bubble is observed, though the rates at which the separation point moves upstream are comparable for laminar and turbulent inflow...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of motoneurone dynamic sensitivity in compensating for the low-pass filter properties of muscle {{was assessed by}} stimulating cat muscle units (MUs) with impulse discharges generated by two current-to-rate converters: (i) a spinal motoneurone, sensitive to both the input intensity and its first derivative, and (ii) a linear current-to-rate converter, i. e. a neurone model with the same static sensitivity as the motoneurone but lacking dynamic sensitivity. Discharges generated by injection of sine-wave currents in three motoneurones of the ‘fast’ type and in the three related model versions were applied to the axon of forty-six MUs. The MU isometric tension was modulated at {{the frequency of the}} current sine wave (0. 5 - 20 Hz). Phase and gain of the current-to-force transduction were measured. When MUs were driven by the model, the force lagged the current by 90 deg at 1 Hz in slow MUs and at around 5 Hz in fast MUs. Under motoneurone drive, the 90 deg phase lag was attained at frequencies about twice as high. The gain of the transduction (peak-to-peak force modulation/peak-to-peak current modulation) decayed when the modulation frequency was increased. In all but five units, the cut-off frequency, Fco (gain attenuated by − 3 dB), was higher when the unit was motoneurone driven (FcoCell) then when it was model driven (FcoMod). In both conditions, Fco was inversely correlated with the MU's time-to-peak. The advantage conferred by the motoneurone dynamic sensitivity was expressed by the Fco ratio (FcoCell/FcoMod). Across the MU population this ratio ranged from 0. 6 - 2. 8, was inversely correlated with the time-to peak, and was directly correlated with the half-tension rate, i. e. the impulse rate at which MUs develop 50 % of their maximal tetanic force. The largest improvement (Fco ratio > 2. 0) was found in units with mechanical features similar to those presumably coupled ‘in vivo’ to the motoneurones utilized for stimulation. This estimate was confirmed in experiments in which trains of pulses, generated by <b>injection</b> of <b>ramp</b> currents in another motoneurone and the related model, were used to activate eight MUs, selected for being similar to that connected ‘in vivo’ to the motoneurone. As expected, for any given current slope the rising phase of isometric tension was steeper when units were motoneurone driven than when they were model driven. The gain (force slope/current slope) was plotted against the ramp slope to identify the cut-off slope, Sco, at which the gain was attenuated by − 3 dB. In this homogeneous MU sample, the ratio expressing the advantage of the motoneurone drive (ScoCell/ScoMod, equivalent to the Fco ratio), ranged from 2. 62 – 2. 97, values comparable with those observed in sine-wave experiments when the motoneurone and muscle units were properly matched...|$|R
40|$|Modern gas {{turbines}} are operating at peak {{turbine inlet temperature}} well beyond the maximum endurable temperature of turbine blade material. As a result, hot gas-contacting blades or vanes have to be cooled intensively by using various cooling technologies, such as film cooling and internal cooling, {{in order to increase}} the fatigue lifetime of the engine. In the present study, a series of experimental investigations were conducted to explore innovative cooling strategies for improved exterior and interior cooling of gas turbine blades. For the exterior cooling, the effectiveness of novel film cooling designs with coolant <b>injection</b> from Barchan-Dune-Shaped <b>ramp</b> (BDSR) and Barchan-Dune-Shaped injection compound (BDSIC) were evaluated in great detail, in comparison to that of conventional circular holes. While a high-resolution Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was used to conduct detailed flow field measurements to quantify the dynamic mixing process between the coolant streams and the mainstream flows over the test plates, Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) technique was used to map the corresponding adiabatic film cooling effectiveness on the surface of interest based on a mass-flux analog to traditional temperature-based cooling effectiveness measurements. The measured effectiveness maps were correlated with the characteristics of the flow structures revealed from the detailed PIV measurement in order to elucidate underlying physics to explore/optimize design paradigms for a better protection of the critical components of turbine blades. Beside exploration of novel cooling designs for film cooling, an experiment was performed to examine the compressibility effect on film cooling effectiveness by using PSP and PIV technique. The experimental studies were conducted in a transonic, open-circuit wind tunnel located at Iowa State University. The measured effectiveness revealed that the mainstream compressibility has limited effect on film effectiveness, and the effectiveness of transonic speed flow can be studied in a relative low-speed wind tunnel. Pertinent to interior cooling of turbine blades, finally, an experimental investigation was also conducted to quantify the characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer flows over a dimpled surface. Many interesting flow features over the dimpled surfaces, such as the separation of incoming boundary layer flow at the dimple front rim, the formation and shedding of unsteady Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices over the dimple cavity, the impingement of the high-speed incoming flow onto the back rim of the dimple, and the generation of strong upwash flow over the back rim of dimple, were revealed clearly and quantitatively. This was found to correlate well with the enhanced heat transfer performance of dimpled surface design reported in previous studies...|$|R
