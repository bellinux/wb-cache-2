5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to <b>find</b> <b>those</b> who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E

In Ireland, branches are still organised on this basis, but in the UK starting in 1998 there was a reorganisation such that members of most branches are employed by a single company e.g. Virgin Midlands - this was required in the fragmented world of the privatised railway because the private companies would not allow access for non-employees onto their premises.|$|E
25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems. The questionnaire takes less than one minute to administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick screening tool {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to <b>find</b> <b>those</b> who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E

50|$|The {{settings}} of a (regulating) controller governing either a machine or process (like an airplane or chemical reactor) are found {{by using a}} mathematical algorithm that minimizes a cost function with weighting factors supplied by a human (engineer).

25|$|Through {{methods such as}} X-ray {{crystallography}} and NMR spectroscopy, {{the information}} about 3D structures of target molecules has increased dramatically, and so has structural information about the ligands. This drives rapid development of structure-based drug design. Some of these new drugs target membrane receptors. Current approaches to structure-based drug design {{can be divided into}} two categories. The first category is about determining ligands for a given receptor. This is usually accomplished through database queries, biophysical simulations, and the construction of chemical libraries. In each case, a large number of potential ligand molecules are screened to <b>find</b> <b>those</b> fitting the binding pocket of the receptor. This approach is usually referred to as ligand-based drug design. The key advantage of searching a database is that it saves time and power to obtain new effective compounds. Another approach of structure-based drug design is about combinatorially mapping ligands, which is referred to as receptor-based drug design. In this case, ligand molecules are engineered within the constraints of a binding pocket by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either atoms or molecules. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures can be discovered.|$|E
25|$|Neoteny {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other species. It {{is important to note}} the difference between partial and full neoteny when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life; this might then provide some insight into the cause of neoteny in those species. Partial neoteny is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs progenesis, but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form; this can be seen in Lithobates clamitans. Full neoteny is seen in Ambystoma mexicanum and some populations of Ambystoma tigrinum, which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life. Lithobates clamitans is partially neotenous: it delays its maturation through the winter season, because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available: it can <b>find</b> <b>those</b> resources much more easily in the larval form. This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny; the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly, so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult. Ambystoma tigrinum retains its neotenous features for a similar reason, however the retention is permanent {{due to the lack of}} resources available throughout its lifetime. This is another example of an environmental cause of neoteny in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form. A few species of birds show partial neoteny. A couple of examples of such species are the manakin birds Chiroxiphia linearis and Chiroxiphia caudata. The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood, but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature. In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species. In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times, the birds may show partial neoteny in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate. In this instance, neoteny is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for them to try to mate while the females are still immature.|$|E

40|$|Image patches are {{fundamental}} elements for object modeling and recognition. However, {{there has not}} been a panoramic study in the literature on the structures of the whole ensemble of natural image patches. In this article, we study the mathematical structures of the ensemble of natural image patches and map image patches into two types of subspaces which we call “explicit manifolds” and “implicit manifolds” respectively. On explicit manifolds, one <b>finds</b> <b>those</b> simple and regular image primitives, such as edges, bars, corners and junctions. On implicit manifolds, one <b>finds</b> <b>those</b> complex and stochastic image patches, such as textures and clutters. On these manifolds, different perceptual metrics are used. Then we show a unified framework for learning a probabilistic model on the space of patches by pursuing both types of manifolds under a common information theoretical principle. The connection between the two types of manifolds are realized through image scaling which changes the entropy of the image patches. The explicit manifolds live in low entropy regimes while the implicit manifolds live in high entropy regimes. In experiments, we cluster the natural image patches and compare the two types of manifolds with a common information theoretical criterion. We also study the transition of the manifolds over scales and show that the complexity peak in a middle entropy regime where most objects and parts reside...|$|R

A widely supported campaign arose to overturn the convictions, which were quashed in 1991 when forensic tests cast doubt on the authenticity of detectives' notes from an interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself. Two detectives were charged in 1992 with perverting the course of justice and were acquitted in 1994.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its initial publication, The Fountainhead has received relatively little attention from literary critics.
