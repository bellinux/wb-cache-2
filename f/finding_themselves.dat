Barbarian war bands increasingly began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly <b>finding</b> <b>themselves</b> cut off deep in the enemy's rear.|$|E

40|$|Both {{dividend}} policy and CEO risk aversion have been subjects of tremendous research {{over the past}} 30 years. The current gap is how both topics are sporadically considered in tandem. We provide {{a solution to this}} by analyzing dividend changes in the context of CEO risk-taking incentives. Our findings suggest that risk-taking propensity, often overlooked in comparison to pay-performance incentives, negatively explains dividend increases. When we account for a firm’s cash flow volatility, we see that risk-taking sensitivities carry a positive relationship with payout. These <b>findings</b> <b>themselves</b> speak to the belief that much of our current understanding regarding dividends must be refocused to encapsulate the effects that CEO characteristics have on payout policy...|$|R

The paper first discusses relevant issues from the literature concerning gender and interviewing. It {{then goes on to}} describe the two {{research projects}}, both of which involved interviews with men, firstly about health in general, and secondly with men who had had a heart attack. The experience of the researcher in each project was quite different, and the paper discusses possible reasons for this, including the part played by gender.

40|$|ABSTRACT Research for an arts {{project is}} often {{as much about}} the {{experience}} of looking for information as the <b>findings</b> <b>themselves.</b> This article is about an investigation into the presence of submarines in British waters. The research was for a new body of work that resulted in the presentation of film, installation and interactive work at festivals, in galleries and online. In this case the fieldwork, into the inevitably political realm of nuclear submarines, led to a series of uneasy situations. There are two locations in the British Isles where submarines harbor: the Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth, in the southwest of England, and the Clyde Naval Base at Faslane in Scotland. From these two places I watched submarines make their dignified way around Plymouth Sound or up the Firth of Clyde and likewise watche...|$|R

Methodologically, a trifocal model has been designed entailing: a close-up view at locally produced interactional moves in mediated professional-patient encounters recorded at family planning clinics; an intermediate view focusing on the mediators’ responses to a situational questionnaire; and a distance view of their tested individual dispositions. The interest of the analysis lies in the presentation of an innovative research model built on the core construct of empathy, and in the working hypotheses that may be derived from the interplay between its three in-built perspectives, {{rather than in the}} <b>findings</b> <b>themselves</b> which are hardly generalizable given the limited set of data under scrutiny...|$|R

Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed the first line of defence. These troops were steadily pushed back, but the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected. Allied air superiority helped tip the balance, providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics. <b>Finding</b> <b>themselves</b> heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting coming to an end on 7 September 1942.|$|E

The survivors, following authorisation from the French captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Grézy that the Viet Minh had laid ambushes along the most direct path. The French hacked a new path through the jungle until they reached Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who warned them of Viet Minh units following them. The French attempted to turn for Phong-Saly {{to the north and}} met an allied convoy travelling down the Nam Hou in canoes. The two forces combined and sailed down the river towards Muong Khoua.|$|E

Therefore the empirical evidences {{can be hard to}} directly infer on the effectiveness of prudential capital controls not to mention the mixed <b>findings</b> <b>themselves.</b> For example, if the reduced volatility could be explained by prudential inflow measures, then the reversed causality can be still valid since the more developed domestic capital markets with smaller fluctuations could also temper foreign investors’ incentive to inject capital inflow due to smaller interest differential.

The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. <b>Finding</b> <b>themselves</b> helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E

Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and <b>finding</b> <b>themselves</b> hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the fact that they had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} the whole 20th Infantry Brigade {{had been assigned}} the task of advancing through the Australian centre towards Nongora, in the end only one infantry battalion, the 2/15th, and a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion was committed. Stepping off on 30 November, this force struck north from Nongora towards the Song River. The lead company crossed the river west of a fjord and shortly after completing this manoeuvre, a force of Japanese engaged them with machine gun fire, killing one and wounding three others. Still in contact, the Australian company secured the crossing enabling two other companies from the 2/15th to come across. While the lead company fixed the Japanese position, the other two conducted a passage of lines manoeuvre and bypassed the Japanese machine gun position as they continued the advance towards Nongora. The lead company then also broke contact and followed them, {{and in the early}} afternoon, <b>finding</b> <b>themselves</b> confronted by a high feature to their front which blocked their path east towards Nongora, they established a defensive position short of their objective; meanwhile, the 2/15th's fourth company, following up in reserve, found the Japanese machine gun position abandoned and subsequently occupied it.|$|E

The article concludes with recommendations for assessing the validity of the Word construct in applied corpus-based vocabulary research.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to debates about agency (meaning the behaviour of individuals) and structure, by drawing on empirical research into personal debt. Consideration of debt allows for debate about agency and structure beyond the narrow confines of welfare, {{and for the}} examination of agency in relation to citizens {{at different points in}} the broader socio-economic structure, not solely poor people. Based on the research <b>findings,</b> <b>themselves</b> grounded in interviewees' experience, the question of why two people in the same material circumstances will have different experiences becomes reframed as why two people whose exercise of agency is the same, face very different outcomes? It is argued that while the research supports a ‘both-and’ rather than ‘either-or’ approach to understanding agency and structure, a ‘both-and’ approach still does not fully capture the experience of interviewees. The key point is that the exercise of agency is overlaid onto structural inequality, and it is understanding the exercise of ‘agency within structure’ that is critical...|$|R
