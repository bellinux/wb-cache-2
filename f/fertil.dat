The need for irrigation within Honduras' banana farming operations became important for economic development. These irrigated banana fields were located in the <b>fertil</b> valleys of Sula, Agu√°n y La Ceiba along the Atlantic coast. And today, irrigation is still {{very important for the}} agriculture sector of Honduras as it provides for internal consumption and seeks to amplify exports in non-traditional crops.|$|E

[...] And what the people but a herd confus'd, [...] A miscellaneous rabble, who extol [...] 50 [...] Things vulgar, & well weigh'd, scarce worth the praise, [...] They praise and they admire they know not what; [...] And know not whom, but as one leads the other; [...] And what delight to be by such extoll'd, [...] To live upon thir tongues and be thir talk, [...] Of whom to be disprais'd were no small praise? [...] His lot who dares be singularly good. [...] Th' intelligent among them and the wise [...] Are few; and glory scarce of few is rais'd.

[...] Famous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known; [...] Where glory is false glory, attributed [...] To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. [...] 70 [...] They err who count it glorious to subdue [...] By Conquest far and wide, to over-run [...] Large Countries, and in field great Battels win, [...] Great Cities by assault: what do these Worthies, [...] But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave [...] Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote, [...] Made Captive, yet deserving freedom more [...] Then those thir Conquerours, who leave behind [...] Nothing but ruin wheresoe're they rove, [...] And all the flourishing works of peace destroy, [...] 80 [...] Then swell with pride, and must be titl'd Gods, [...] Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, [...] Worship't with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice; [...] One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the other, [...] Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce men, [...] Rowling in brutish vices, and deform'd, [...] Violent or shameful death thir due reward.

[...] Shall I seek glory then, as vain men seek [...] Oft not deserv'd? I seek not mine, but his [...] Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am. [...] To whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply'd. [...] Think not so slight of glory; therein least, [...] Resembling thy great Father: he seeks glory, [...] 110 [...] And for his glory all things made, all things [...] Orders and governs, nor content in Heaven [...] By all his Angels glorifi'd, requires [...] Glory from men, from all men good or bad, [...] Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption; [...] Above all Sacrifice, or hallow'd gift [...] Glory he requires, and glory he receives [...] Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or Greek, [...] Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declar'd; [...] From us his foes pronounc't glory he exacts. [...] 120 [...] To whom our Saviour fervently reply'd. [...] And reason; since his word all things produc'd, [...] Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, [...] But to shew forth his goodness, and impart [...] His good communicable to every soul [...] Freely; of whom what could he less expect [...] Then glory and benediction, that is thanks, [...] The slightest, easiest, readiest recompence [...] From them who could return him nothing else, [...] And not returning that would likeliest render [...] 130 [...] Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? [...] Hard recompence, unsutable return [...] For so much good, so much beneficence. [...] But why should man seek glory? who of his own [...] Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs [...] But condemnation, ignominy, and shame? [...] Who for so many benefits receiv'd [...] Turn'd recreant to God, ingrate and false, [...] And so of all true good himself despoil'd, [...] Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take [...] 140 [...] That which to God alone of right belongs; [...] Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, [...] That who advance his glory, not thir own, [...] Them he himself to glory will advance. [...] So spake the Son of God; and here again [...] Satan had not to answer, but stood struck [...] With guilt of his own sin, for he himself [...] Insatiable of glory had lost all, [...] Yet of another Plea bethought him soon. [...] Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so deem, [...] 150 [...] Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass: [...] But to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain'd [...] To sit upon thy Father David's Throne; [...] By Mother's side thy Father, though thy right [...] Be now in powerful hands, that will not part [...] Easily from possession won with arms; [...] Judaea now and all the promis'd land [...] Reduc't a Province under Roman yoke, [...] Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul'd [...] With temperate sway; oft have they violated [...] 160 [...] The Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts, [...] Abominations rather, as did once [...] Antiochus: and think'st thou to regain [...] Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring? [...] So did not Machabeus: he indeed [...] Retir'd unto the Desert, but with arms; [...] And o're a mighty King so oft prevail'd, [...] That by strong hand his Family obtain'd, [...] Though Priests, the Crown, and David's Throne usurp'd, [...] With Modin and her Suburbs once content. [...] 170 [...] If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal, [...] And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow; [...] But on Occasions forelock watchful wait. [...] They themselves rather are occasion best, [...] Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free [...] Thy Country from her Heathen servitude; [...] So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie [...] The Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign, [...] The happier raign the sooner it begins, [...] Raign then; what canst thou better do the while? [...] 180 [...] To whom our saviour answer thus return'd. [...] All things are best fullfil'd in thir due time, [...] And time there is for all things, Truth hath said: [...] If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told [...] That it shall never end, so when begin [...] The Father in his purpose hath decreed, [...] He in whose hand all times and seasons roul. [...] What if he hath decreed that I shall first [...] Be try'd in humble state, and things adverse, [...] By tribulations, injuries, insults, [...] 190 [...] Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, [...] Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting [...] Without distrust or doubt, that he may know [...] What I can suffer, how obey? who best [...] Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who first [...] Well hath obey'd; just tryal e're I merit [...] My exaltation without change or end. [...] But what concerns it thee when I begin [...] My everlasting Kingdom, why art thou [...] Sollicitous, what moves thy inquisition? [...] 200 [...] Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall, [...] And my promotion will be thy destruction? [...] To whom the Tempter inly rackt reply'd. [...] Let that come when it comes; all hope is lost [...] Of my reception into grace; what worse? [...] For where no hope is left, is left no fear; [...] If there be worse, the expectation more [...] Of worse torments me then the feeling can. [...] I {{would be at the}} worst; worst is my Port. [...] My harbour and my ultimate repose, [...] 210 [...] The end I would attain, my final good. [...] My error was my error, and my crime [...] My crime; whatever for it self condemn'd [...] And will alike be punish'd; whether thou [...] Raign or raign not; though to that gentle brow [...] Willingly I could flye, and hope thy raign, [...] From that placid aspect and meek regard, [...] Rather then aggravate my evil state, [...] Would stand between me and thy Fathers ire, [...] (Whose ire I dread more then the fire of Hell,) [...] 220 [...] A shelter and a kind of shading cool [...] Interposition, as a summers cloud. [...] If I then to the worst that can be hast, [...] Why move thy feet so slow to what is best, [...] Happiest both to thy self and all the world, [...] That thou who worthiest art should'st be thir King? [...] Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detain d [...] Of the enterprize so hazardous and high; [...] No wonder, for though in thee be united [...] What of perfection can in man be found, [...] 230 [...] Or human nature can receive, consider [...] Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent [...] At home, scarce view'd the Gallilean Towns [...] And once a year Jerusalem, few days [...] Short sojourn; and what thence could'st thou observe? [...] The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, [...] Empires, and Monarchs, and thir radiant Courts [...] Best school of best experience, quickest in sight [...] In all things that to greatest actions lead. [...] The wisest, unexperienc't, will be ever [...] 240 [...] Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, [...] (As he who seeking Asses found a Kingdom) [...] Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: [...] But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit [...] Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes [...] The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and state, [...] Sufficient introduction to inform [...] Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal Arts, [...] And regal Mysteries; that thou may'st know [...] How best their opposition to withstand. [...] 250 [...] With that (such power was giv'n him then) he took [...] The Son of God up to a Mountain high. [...] It was a Mountain at whose verdant feet [...] A spatious plain out strech't in circuit wide [...] Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flow'd, [...] Th' one winding, the other strait and left between [...] Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, [...] Then meeting joyn'd thir tribute to the Sea: [...] <b>Fertil</b> of corn the glebe, of oyl and wine, [...] With herds the pastures throng'd, with flocks the hills, [...] 260 [...] Huge Cities and high towr'd, that well might seem [...] The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so large [...] The Prospect was, that here and there was room [...] For barren desert fountainless and dry. [...] To this high mountain top the Tempter brought [...] Our Saviour, and new train of words began. [...] Well have we speeded, and o're hill and dale, [...] Forest and field, and flood, Temples and Towers [...] Cut shorter many a league; here thou behold'st [...] Assyria and her Empires antient bounds, [...] 270 [...] Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence on [...] As far as Indus East, Euphrates West, [...] And oft beyond; to South the Persian Bay, [...] And inaccessible the Arabian drouth: [...] Here Ninevee, of length within her wall [...] Several days journey, built by Ninus old, [...] Of that first golden Monarchy the seat, [...] And seat of Salmanassar, whose success [...] Israel in long captivity still mourns; [...] There Babylon the wonder of all tongues, [...] 280 [...] As antient, but rebuilt by him who twice [...] Judah and all thy Father David's house [...] Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, [...] Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis [...] His City there thou seest, and Bactra there; [...] Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, [...] And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates, [...] There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, [...] The drink of none but Kings; of later fame [...] Built by Emathian, or by Parthian hands, [...] 290 [...] The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there [...] Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, [...] Turning with easie eye thou may'st behold. [...] All these the Parthian, now some Ages past, [...] By great Arsaces led, who founded first [...] That Empire, under his dominion holds [...] From the luxurious Kings of Antioch won. [...] And just in time thou com'st to have a view [...] Of his great power; for now the Parthian King [...] In Ctesiphon hath gather'd all his Host [...] 300 [...] Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild [...] Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid [...] He marches now in hast; see, though from far, [...] His thousands, in what martial equipage [...] They issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms [...] Of equal dread in flight, or in pursuit; [...] All Horsemen, in which fight they most excel; [...] See how in warlike muster they appear, [...] In Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings. [...] He look't and saw what numbers numberless [...] 310 [...] The City gates out powr'd, light armed Troops [...] In coats of Mail and military pride; [...] In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong, [...] Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice [...] Of many Provinces from bound to bound; [...] From Arachosia, from Candaor East, [...] And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs [...] Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales, [...] From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains [...] Of Adiabene, Media, and the South [...] 320 [...] Of Susiana to Balsara's hav'n. [...] He saw them in thir forms of battell rang'd, [...] How quick they wheel'd, and flying behind them shot [...] Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face [...] Of thir pursuers, and overcame by flight; [...] The field all iron cast a gleaming brown, [...] Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn, [...] Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight; [...] Chariots or Elephants endorst with Towers [...] Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners [...] 330 [...] A multitude with Spades and Axes arm'd [...] To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, [...] Or where plain was raise hill, or over-lay [...] With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke; [...] Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, [...] And Waggons fraught with Utensils of war. [...] Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, [...] When Agrican with all his Northern powers [...] Besieg'd Albracca, as Romances tell; [...] The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win [...] 340 [...] The fairest of her Sex Angelica [...] His daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights, [...] Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. [...] Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; [...] At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum'd, [...] And to our Saviour thus his words renew'd. [...] That thou may'st know I seek not to engage [...] Thy Vertue, and not every way secure [...] On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark [...] To what end I have brought thee hither and shewn [...] 350 [...] All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold [...] By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou [...] Endeavour, as thy Father David did, [...] Thou never shalt obtain; prediction still [...] In all things, and all men, supposes means, [...] Without means us'd, what it predicts revokes. [...] But say thou wer't possess'd of David's Throne [...] By free consent of all, none opposite, [...] Samaritan or Jew; how could'st thou hope [...] Long to enjoy it quiet and secure, [...] 360 [...] Between two such enclosing enemies [...] Roman and Parthian? therefore one of these [...] Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian first [...] By my advice, as nearer and of late [...] Found able by invasion to annoy [...] Thy country, and captive lead away her Kings [...] Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus bound, [...] Maugre the Roman: it shall be my task [...] To render thee the Parthian at dispose; [...] Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league [...] 370 [...] By him thou shalt regain, without him not, [...] That which alone can truly reinstall thee [...] In David's royal seat, his true Successour, [...] Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes [...] Whose off-spring in his Territory yet serve [...] In Habor, and among the Medes dispers't, [...] Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph lost [...] Thus long from Israel; serving as of old [...] Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt serv'd, [...] This offer sets before thee to deliver. [...] 380 [...] These if from servitude thou shalt restore [...] To thir inheritance, then, nor till then, [...] Thou on the Throne of David in full glory, [...] From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond [...] Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear. [...] To whom our Saviour answer'd thus unmov'd. [...] Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm, [...] And fragile arms, much instrument of war [...] Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, [...] Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear [...] 390 [...] Vented much policy, and projects deep [...] Of enemies, of aids, battels and leagues, [...] Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. [...] Means I must use thou say'st, prediction else [...] Will unpredict and fail me of the Throne: [...] My time I told thee, (and that time for thee [...] Were better farthest off) is not yet come; [...] When that comes think not thou to find me slack [...] On my part aught endeavouring, or to need [...] Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome [...] 400 [...] Luggage of war there shewn me, argument [...] Of human weakness rather then of strength. [...] My brethren, as thou call'st them; those Ten Tribes [...] I must deliver, if I mean to raign [...] David's true heir, and his full Scepter sway [...] To just extent over all Israel's Sons; [...] But whence to thee this zeal, where was it then [...] For Israel or for David, or his Throne, [...] When thou stood'st up his Tempter to the pride [...] Of numbring Israel which cost the lives [...] 410 [...] Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites [...] By three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal [...] To Israel then, the same that now to me. [...] As for those captive Tribes, themselves were they [...] Who wrought their own captivity, fell off [...] From God to worship Calves, the Deities [...] Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, [...] And all the Idolatries of Heathen round, [...] Besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes; [...] Nor in the land of their captivity [...] 420 [...] Humbled themselves, or penitent besought [...] The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy'd [...] Impenitent, and left a race behind [...] Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce [...] From Gentils, but by Circumcision vain, [...] And God with Idols in their worship joyn'd. [...] Should I of these the liberty regard, [...] Who freed, as to their antient Patrimony, [...] Unhumbl'd, unrepentant, unreform'd, [...] Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps [...] 430 [...] Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them serve [...] Thir enemies, who serve Idols with God. [...] Yet he at length, time to himself best known, [...] Remembring Abraham by some wond'rous call [...] May bring them back repentant and sincere, [...] And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, [...] While to their native land with joy they hast, [...] As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, [...] When to the promis'd land thir Fathers pass'd; [...] To his due time and providence I leave them. [...] 440 [...] So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend [...] Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. [...] So fares it when with truth falshood contends.|$|E
6000|$|SO spake the Son of God; and Satan stood [...] A while as mute, confounded what to say, [...] What to reply, confuted and {{convinced}} [...] Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift; [...] At length, collecting all his serpent wiles, [...] With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:-- [...] "I see thou know'st what is {{of use to}} know, [...] What best to say canst say, to do canst do; [...] Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words [...] To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart [...] 10 [...] Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape. [...] Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult, [...] Thy counsel would be as the oracle [...] Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems [...] On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old [...] Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds [...] That might require the array of war, thy skill [...] Of conduct would be such that all the world [...] Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist [...] In battle, though against thy few in arms. [...] 20 [...] These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide? [...] Affecting private life, or more obscure [...] In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive [...] All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself [...] The fame and glory--glory, the reward [...] That sole excites to high attempts the flame [...] Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure [...] AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise, [...] All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, [...] And dignities and powers, all but the highest? [...] 30 [...] Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe. The son [...] Of Macedonian Philip had ere these [...] Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held [...] At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down [...] The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled [...] The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode. [...] Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, [...] Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. [...] Great Julius, whom now all the world admires, [...] The more he grew in years, the more inflamed [...] 40 [...] With glory, wept that he had lived so long [...] Ingloroious. But thou yet art not too late." [...] To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:-- [...] "Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth [...] For empire's sake, nor empire to affect [...] For glory's sake, by all thy argument.

Here thou behold'st [...] Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds, [...] 270 [...] Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on [...] As far as Indus east, Euphrates west, [...] And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay, [...] And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth: [...] Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall [...] Several days' journey, built by Ninus old, [...] Of that first golden monarchy the seat, [...] And seat of Salmanassar, whose success [...] Israel in long captivity still mourns; [...] There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues, [...] 280 [...] As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice [...] Judah and all thy father David's house [...] Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, [...] Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis, [...] His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there; [...] Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, [...] And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates; [...] There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, [...] The drink of none but kings; of later fame, [...] Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands, [...] 290 [...] The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there [...] Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon, [...] Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold. [...] All these the Parthian (now some ages past [...] By great Arsaces led, who founded first [...] That empire) under his dominion holds, [...] From the luxurious kings of Antioch won. [...] And just in time thou com'st to have a view [...] Of his great power; for now the Parthian king [...] In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host [...] 300 [...] Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild [...] Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid [...] He marches now in haste. See, though from far, [...] His thousands, in what martial equipage [...] They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms, [...] Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit-- [...] All horsemen, in which fight they most excel; [...] See how in warlike muster they appear, [...] In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings." [...] He looked, and saw what numbers numberless [...] 310 [...] The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops [...] In coats of mail and military pride. [...] In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong, [...] Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice [...] Of many provinces from bound to bound-- [...] From Arachosia, from Candaor east, [...] And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs [...] Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales; [...] From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains [...] Of Adiabene, Media, and the south [...] 320 [...] Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven. [...] He saw them in their forms of battle ranged, [...] How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot [...] Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face [...] Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight; [...] The field all iron cast a gleaming brown. [...] Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn, [...] Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight, [...] Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers [...] Of archers; nor of labouring pioners [...] 330 [...] A multitude, with spades and axes armed, [...] To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, [...] Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay [...] With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke: [...] Mules after these, camels and dromedaries, [...] And waggons fraught with utensils of war. [...] Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, [...] When Agrican, with all his northern powers, [...] Besieged Albracea, as romances tell, [...] The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win [...] 340 [...] The fairest of her sex, Angelica, [...] His daughter, sought by many prowest knights, [...] Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane. [...] Such and so numerous was their chivalry; [...] At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed, [...] And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:-- [...] "That thou may'st know I seek not to engage [...] Thy virtue, and not every way secure [...] On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark [...] To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew [...] 350 [...] All this fair sight. Thy kingdom, though foretold [...] By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou [...] Endeavour, as thy father David did, [...] Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still [...] In all things, and all men, supposes means; [...] Without means used, what it predicts revokes. [...] But say thou wert possessed of David's throne [...] By free consent of all, none opposite, [...] Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope [...] Long to enjoy it quiet and secure [...] 360 [...] Between two such enclosing enemies, [...] Roman and Parthian? Therefore one of these [...] Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first, [...] By my advice, as nearer, and of late [...] Found able by invasion to annoy [...] Thy country, and captive lead away her kings, [...] Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound, [...] Maugre the Roman. It shall be my task [...] To render thee the Parthian at dispose, [...] Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league. [...] 370 [...] By him thou shalt regain, without him not, [...] That which alone can truly reinstall thee [...] In David's royal seat, his true successor-- [...] Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes [...] Whose offspring in his territory yet serve [...] In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed: [...] The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost [...] Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old [...] Their fathers in the land of Egypt served, [...] This offer sets before thee to deliver. [...] 380 [...] These if from servitude thou shalt restore [...] To their inheritance, then, nor till then, [...] Thou on the throne of David in full glory, [...] From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond, [...] Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear." [...] To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:-- [...] "Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm [...] And fragile arms, much instrument of war, [...] Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, [...] Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear [...] 390 [...] Vented much policy, and projects deep [...] Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues, [...] Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. [...] Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else [...] Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne! [...] My time, I told thee (and that time for thee [...] Were better farthest off), is not yet come. [...] When that comes, think not thou to find me slack [...] On my part aught endeavouring, or to need [...] Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome [...] 400 [...] Luggage of war there shewn me--argument [...] Of human weakness rather than of strength. [...] My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes, [...] I must deliver, if I mean to reign [...] David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway [...] To just extent over all Israel's sons! [...] But whence to thee this zeal? Where was it then [...] For Israel, or for David, or his throne, [...] When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride [...] Of numbering Israel--which cost the lives [...] 410 [...] of threescore and ten thousand Israelites [...] By three days' pestilence? Such was thy zeal [...] To Israel then, the same that now to me. [...] As for those captive tribes, themselves were they [...] Who wrought their own captivity, fell off [...] From God to worship calves, the deities [...] Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, [...] And all the idolatries of heathen round, [...] Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes; [...] Nor in the land of their captivity [...] 420 [...] Humbled themselves, or penitent besought [...] The God of their forefathers, but so died [...] Impenitent, and left a race behind [...] Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce [...] From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain, [...] And God with idols in their worship joined. [...] Should I of these the liberty regard, [...] Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony, [...] Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed, [...] Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps [...] 430 [...] Of Bethel and of Dan? No; let them serve [...] Their enemies who serve idols with God. [...] Yet He at length, time to himself best known, [...] Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call [...] May bring them back, repentant and sincere, [...] And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, [...] While to their native land with joy they haste, [...] As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, [...] When to the Promised Land their fathers passed. [...] To his due time and providence I leave them." [...] 440 [...] So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend [...] Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. [...] So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.|$|E

Not that faire field [...] Of Enna, where Proserpin gathring flours [...] Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis [...] 270 [...] Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain [...] To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove [...] Of Daphne by Orontes, and th' inspir'd [...] Castalian Spring might with this Paradise [...] Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile [...] Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, [...] Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove, [...] Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son [...] Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye; [...] Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, [...] 280 [...] Mount Amara, though this by som suppos'd [...] True Paradise under the Ethiop Line [...] By Nilus head, enclos'd with shining Rock, [...] A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote [...] From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend [...] Saw undelighted all delight, all kind [...] Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: [...] Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, [...] Godlike erect, with native Honour clad [...] In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, [...] 290 [...] And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine [...] The image of thir glorious Maker shon, [...] Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, [...] Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't; [...] Whence true autoritie in men; though both [...] Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; [...] For contemplation hee and valour formd, [...] For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, [...] Hee for God only, shee for God in him: [...] His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd [...] 300 [...] Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks [...] Round from his parted forelock manly hung [...] Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: [...] Shee as a vail down to the slender waste [...] Her unadorned golden tresses wore [...] Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd [...] As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd [...] Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway, [...] And by her yeilded, by him best receivd, [...] Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride, [...] 310 [...] And sweet reluctant amorous delay. [...] Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, [...] Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame [...] Of natures works, honor dishonorable, [...] Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind [...] With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, [...] And banisht from mans life his happiest life, [...] Simplicitie and spotless innocence. [...] So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight [...] Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: [...] 320 [...] So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair [...] That ever since in loves imbraces met, [...] Adam the goodliest man of men since borne [...] His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. [...] Under a tuft of shade that on a green [...] Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side [...] They sat them down, and after no more toil [...] Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd [...] To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease [...] More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite [...] 330 [...] More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, [...] Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes [...] Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline [...] On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: [...] The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde [...] Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; [...] Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles [...] Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems [...] Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, [...] Alone as they.

[...] 410 [...] Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, [...] Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power [...] That made us, and for us this ample World [...] Be infinitly good, and of his good [...] As liberal and free as infinite, [...] That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here [...] In all this happiness, who at his hand [...] Have nothing merited, nor can performe [...] Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires [...] From us no other service then to keep [...] 420 [...] This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees [...] In Paradise that beare delicious fruit [...] So various, not to taste that onely Tree [...] Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, [...] So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, [...] Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst [...] God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree, [...] The only sign of our obedience left [...] Among so many signes of power and rule [...] Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n [...] 430 [...] Over all other Creatures that possesse [...] Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard [...] One easie prohibition, who enjoy [...] Free leave so large to all things else, and choice [...] Unlimited of manifold delights: [...] But let us ever praise him, and extoll [...] His bountie, following our delightful task [...] To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours, [...] Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. [...] To whom thus Eve repli'd. O thou for whom [...] 440 [...] And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, [...] And without whom am to no end, my Guide [...] And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. [...] For wee to him indeed all praises owe, [...] And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy [...] So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee [...] Preeminent by so much odds, while thou [...] Like consort to thy self canst no where find. [...] That day I oft remember, when from sleep [...] I first awak't, and found my self repos'd [...] 450 [...] Under a shade on flours, much wondring where [...] And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. [...] Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound [...] Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread [...] Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd [...] Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went [...] With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe [...] On the green bank, to look into the cleer [...] Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. [...] As I bent down to look, just opposite, [...] 460 [...] A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd [...] Bending to look on me, I started back, [...] It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd, [...] Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks [...] Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt [...] Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, [...] Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, [...] What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, [...] With thee it came and goes: but follow me, [...] And I will bring thee where no shadow staies [...] 470 [...] Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee [...] Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy [...] Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare [...] Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd [...] Mother of human Race: what could I doe, [...] But follow strait, invisibly thus led? [...] Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall, [...] Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, [...] Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, [...] Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, [...] 480 [...] Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair Eve, [...] Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art, [...] His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent [...] Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart [...] Substantial Life, to have thee by my side [...] Henceforth an individual solace dear; [...] Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim [...] My other half: with that thy gentle hand [...] Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see [...] How beauty is excelld by manly grace [...] 490 [...] And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. [...] So spake our general Mother, and with eyes [...] Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd, [...] And meek surrender, half imbracing leand [...] On our first Father, half her swelling Breast [...] Naked met his under the flowing Gold [...] Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight [...] Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms [...] Smil'd with superior Love, as Jupiter [...] On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds [...] 500 [...] That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip [...] With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd [...] For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne [...] Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind. [...] Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two [...] Imparadis't in one anothers arms [...] The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill [...] Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, [...] Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, [...] Among our other torments not the least, [...] 510 [...] Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines; [...] Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd [...] From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: [...] One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd, [...] Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n? [...] Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord [...] Envie them that? can it be sin to know, [...] Can it be death? and do they onely stand [...] By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, [...] The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? [...] 520 [...] O fair foundation laid whereon to build [...] Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds [...] With more desire to know, and to reject [...] Envious commands, invented with designe [...] To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt [...] Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, [...] They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? [...] But first with narrow search I must walk round [...] This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd; [...] A chance but chance may lead where I may meet [...] 530 [...] Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side, [...] Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw [...] What further would be learnt. Live while ye may, [...] Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, [...] Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. [...] So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd, [...] But with sly circumspection, and began [...] Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam. [...] Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n [...] With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun [...] 540 [...] Slowly descended, and with right aspect [...] Against the eastern Gate of Paradise [...] Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock [...] Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds, [...] Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent [...] Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; [...] The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung [...] Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. [...] Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat [...] Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night; [...] 550 [...] About him exercis'd Heroic Games [...] Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand [...] Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares [...] Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. [...] Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven [...] On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr [...] In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd [...] Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner [...] From what point of his Compass to beware [...] Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. [...] 560 [...] Gabriel, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n [...] Charge and strict watch that to this happie place [...] No evil thing approach or enter in; [...] This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare [...] A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know [...] More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man [...] Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way [...] Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; [...] But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, [...] Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks [...] 570 [...] Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: [...] Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade [...] Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew [...] I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise [...] New troubles; him thy care must be to find. [...] To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: [...] Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, [...] Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, [...] See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass [...] The vigilance here plac't, but such as come [...] 580 [...] Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour [...] No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, [...] So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds [...] On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude [...] Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. [...] But if within the circuit of these walks [...] In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom [...] Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know. [...] So promis'd hee, and Uriel to his charge [...] Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd [...] 590 [...] Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n [...] Beneath th' Azores; whither the prime Orb, [...] Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd [...] Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth [...] By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there [...] Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold [...] The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: [...] Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray [...] Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; [...] Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, [...] 600 [...] They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests [...] Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; [...] She all night long her amorous descant sung; [...] Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament [...] With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led [...] The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon [...] Rising in clouded Majestie, at length [...] Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, [...] And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw. [...] When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th' hour [...] 610 [...] Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest [...] Mind us of like repose, since God hath set [...] Labour and rest, as day and night to men [...] Successive, and the timely dew of sleep [...] Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines [...] Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long [...] Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; [...] Man hath his daily work of body or mind [...] Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, [...] And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies; [...] 620 [...] While other Animals unactive range, [...] And of thir doings God takes no account. [...] Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East [...] With first approach of light, we must be ris'n, [...] And at our pleasant labour, to reform [...] Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, [...] Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown, [...] That mock our scant manuring, and require [...] More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: [...] Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, [...] 630 [...] That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, [...] Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; [...] Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. [...] To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. [...] My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst [...] Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains, [...] God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more [...] Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. [...] With thee conversing I forget all time, [...] All seasons and thir change, all please alike. [...] 640 [...] Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, [...] With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun [...] When first on this delightful Land he spreads [...] His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, [...] Glistring with dew; fragrant the <b>fertil</b> earth [...] After soft showers; and sweet the coming on [...] Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night [...] With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, [...] And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train: [...] But neither breath of Morn when she ascends [...] 650 [...] With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun [...] On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, [...] Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, [...] Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night [...] With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, [...] Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. [...] But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom [...] This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? [...] To whom our general Ancestor repli'd. [...] Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, [...] 660 [...] Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, [...] By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land [...] In order, though to Nations yet unborn, [...] Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise; [...] Least total darkness should by Night regaine [...] Her old possession, and extinguish life [...] In Nature and all things, which these soft fires [...] Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate [...] Of various influence foment and warme, [...] Temper or nourish, or in part shed down [...] 670 [...] Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow [...] On Earth, made hereby apter to receive [...] Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. [...] These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, [...] Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, [...] That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; [...] Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth [...] Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: [...] All these with ceasless praise his works behold [...] Both day and night: how often from the steep [...] 680 [...] Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard [...] Celestial voices to the midnight air, [...] Sole, or responsive each to others note [...] Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands [...] While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk [...] With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds [...] In full harmonic number joind, thir songs [...] Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. [...] Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd [...] On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place [...] 690 [...] Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd [...] All things to mans delightful use; the roofe [...] Of thickest covert was inwoven shade [...] Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew [...] Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side [...] Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub [...] Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, [...] Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin [...] Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought [...] Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, [...] 700 [...] Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay [...] Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone [...] Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here [...] Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; [...] Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower [...] More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, [...] Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, [...] Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess [...] With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs [...] Espoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed, [...] 710 [...] And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, [...] What day the genial Angel to our Sire [...] Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd, [...] More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods [...] Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like [...] In sad event, when to the unwiser Son [...] Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar'd [...] Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd [...] On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. [...] Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood, [...] 720 [...] Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd [...] The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav'n [...] Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe [...] And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night, [...] Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, [...] Which we in our appointed work imployd [...] Have finisht happie in our mutual help [...] And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss [...] Ordain'd by thee, and this delicious place [...] For us too large, where thy abundance wants [...] 730 [...] Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. [...] But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race [...] To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll [...] Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, [...] And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. [...] This said unanimous, and other Rites [...] Observing none, but adoration pure [...] Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower [...] Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off [...] These troublesom disguises which wee wear, [...] 740 [...] Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene [...] Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites [...] Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd: [...] Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk [...] Of puritie and place and innocence, [...] Defaming as impure what God declares [...] Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. [...] Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain [...] But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? [...] Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source [...] 750 [...] Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, [...] In Paradise of all things common else. [...] By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men [...] Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee [...] Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure, [...] Relations dear, and all the Charities [...] Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. [...] Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, [...] Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, [...] Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, [...] 760 [...] Whose Bed is undefil'd and chast pronounc't, [...] Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd. [...] Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights [...] His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, [...] Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile [...] Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, [...] Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours [...] Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, [...] Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings [...] To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. [...] 770 [...] These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, [...] And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof [...] Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on, [...] Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek [...] No happier state, and know to know no more. [...] Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone [...] Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, [...] And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim [...] Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd [...] To thir night watches in warlike Parade, [...] 780 [...] When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. [...] Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South [...] With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, [...] Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part [...] Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. [...] From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld [...] That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. [...] Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed [...] Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook, [...] But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, [...] 790 [...] Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. [...] This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd [...] Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen [...] Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd [...] The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: [...] Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. [...] So saying, on he led his radiant Files, [...] Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct [...] In search of whom they sought: him there they found [...] Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; [...] 800 [...] Assaying by his Devilish art to reach [...] The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge [...] Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, [...] Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint [...] Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise [...] Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise [...] At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, [...] Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires [...] Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. [...] Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear [...] 810 [...] Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure [...] Touch of Celestial temper, but returns [...] Of force to its own likeness: up he starts [...] Discoverd and surpriz'd. As when a spark [...] Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid [...] Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store [...] Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine [...] With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire: [...] So started up in his own shape the Fiend. [...] Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd [...] 820 [...] So sudden to behold the grieslie King; [...] Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. [...] Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell [...] Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd, [...] Why satst thou like an enemie in waite [...] Here watching at the head of these that sleep? [...] Know ye not then said Satan, filld with scorn, [...] Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate [...] For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; [...] Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, [...] 830 [...] The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, [...] Why ask ye, and superfluous begin [...] Your message, like to end as much in vain? [...] To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. [...] Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, [...] Or undiminisht brightness, to be known [...] As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure; [...] That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, [...] Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now [...] Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. [...] 840 [...] But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account [...] To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep [...] This place inviolable, and these from harm. [...] So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke [...] Severe in youthful beautie, added grace [...] Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, [...] And felt how awful goodness is, and saw [...] Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd [...] His loss; but chiefly to find here observd [...] His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd [...] 850 [...] Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, [...] Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, [...] Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, [...] Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, [...] Will save us trial what the least can doe [...] Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. [...] The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage; [...] But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, [...] Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie [...] He held it vain; awe from above had quelld [...] 860 [...] His heart, not else dismai'd. Now drew they nigh [...] The western point, where those half-rounding guards [...] Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind [...] Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief [...] Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. [...] O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet [...] Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne [...] Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, [...] And with them comes a third of Regal port, [...] But faded splendor wan; who by his gate [...] 870 [...] And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, [...] Not likely to part hence without contest; [...] Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. [...] He scarce had ended, when those two approachd [...] And brief related whom they brought, wher found, [...] How busied, in what form and posture coucht. [...] To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. [...] Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib'd [...] To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge [...] Of others, who approve not to transgress [...] 880 [...] By thy example, but have power and right [...] To question thy bold entrance on this place; [...] Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those [...] Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? [...] To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. [...] Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, [...] And such I held thee; but this question askt [...] Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain? [...] Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, [...] Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, [...] 890 [...] And boldly venture to whatever place [...] Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change [...] Torment with ease, & soonest recompence [...] Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; [...] To thee no reason; who knowst only good, [...] But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object [...] His will who bound us? let him surer barr [...] His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay [...] In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. [...] The rest is true, they found me where they say; [...] 900 [...] But that implies not violence or harme. [...] Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd, [...] Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. [...] O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, [...] Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, [...] And now returns him from his prison scap't, [...] Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise [...] Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither [...] Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; [...] So wise he judges it to fly from pain [...] 910 [...] However, and to scape his punishment. [...] So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, [...] Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight [...] Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, [...] Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain [...] Can equal anger infinite provok't. [...] But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee [...] Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them [...] Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they [...] Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, [...] 920 [...] The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd [...] To thy deserted host this cause of flight, [...] Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. [...] To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. [...] Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, [...] Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood [...] Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide [...] The blasting volied Thunder made all speed [...] And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. [...] But still thy words at random, as before, [...] 930 [...] Argue thy inexperience what behooves [...] From hard assaies and ill successes past [...] A faithful Leader, not to hazard all [...] Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. [...] I therefore, I alone first undertook [...] To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie [...] This new created World, whereof in Hell [...] Fame is not silent, here in hope to find [...] Better abode, and my afflicted Powers [...] To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; [...] 940 [...] Though for possession put to try once more [...] What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; [...] Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord [...] High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, [...] And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. [...] To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd. [...] To say and strait unsay, pretending first [...] Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, [...] Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't, [...] Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, [...] 950 [...] O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! [...] Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? [...] Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; [...] Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, [...] Your military obedience, to dissolve [...] Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream? [...] And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem [...] Patron of liberty, who more then thou [...] Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd [...] Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope [...] 960 [...] To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? [...] But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; [...] Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre [...] Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, [...] Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, [...] And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne [...] The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. [...] So threatn'd hee, but Satan to no threats [...] Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. [...] Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, [...] 970 [...] Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then [...] Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel [...] From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King [...] Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, [...] Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels [...] In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. [...] While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright [...] Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes [...] Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round [...] With ported Spears, as thick as when a field [...] 980 [...] Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends [...] Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind [...] Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands [...] Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves [...] Prove chaff. On th' other side Satan allarm'd [...] Collecting all his might dilated stood, [...] Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov'd: [...] His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest [...] Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe [...] What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds [...] 990 [...] Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise [...] In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope [...] Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements [...] At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne [...] With violence of this conflict, had not soon [...] Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray [...] Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen [...] Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, [...] Wherein all things created first he weighd, [...] The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire [...] 1000 [...] In counterpoise, now ponders all events, [...] Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights [...] The sequel each of parting and of fight; [...] The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; [...] Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. [...] Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, [...] Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then [...] To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more [...] Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now [...] To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, [...] 1010 [...] And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign [...] Where thou art weigh'd, & shown how light, how weak, [...] If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew [...] His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled [...] Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.|$|E

[...] Thus Adam his illustrous Guest besought: [...] And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. [...] 110 [...] This also thy request with caution askt [...] Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works [...] What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, [...] Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? [...] Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve [...] To glorifie the Maker, and inferr [...] Thee also happier, shall not be withheld [...] Thy hearing, such Commission from above [...] I have receav'd, to answer thy desire [...] Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain [...] 120 [...] To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope [...] Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, [...] Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, [...] To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: [...] Anough is left besides to search and know.

[...] 130 [...] Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n [...] (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host [...] Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) [...] Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep [...] Into his place, and the great Son returnd [...] Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father from his Throne beheld [...] Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. [...] At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought [...] All like himself rebellious, by whose aid [...] 140 [...] This inaccessible high strength, the seat [...] Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, [...] He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud [...] Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; [...] Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, [...] Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines [...] Number sufficient to possess her Realmes [...] Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent [...] With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: [...] But least his heart exalt him in the harme [...] 150 [...] Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n, [...] My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire [...] That detriment, if such it be to lose [...] Self-lost, {{and in a moment}} will create [...] Another World, out of one man a Race [...] Of men innumerable, there to dwell, [...] Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd [...] They open to themselves at length the way [...] Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, [...] And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, & Heav'n to Earth, [...] 160 [...] One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. [...] Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, [...] And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee [...] This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: [...] My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee [...] I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep [...] Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, [...] Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill [...] Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. [...] Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, [...] 170 [...] And put not forth my goodness, which is free [...] To act or not, Necessitie and Chance [...] Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. [...] So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake [...] His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. [...] Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift [...] Then time or motion, but to human ears [...] Cannot without process of speech be told, [...] So told as earthly notion can receave. [...] Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n [...] 180 [...] When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; [...] Glorie they sung to the most High, good will [...] To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: [...] Glorie to him whose just avenging ire [...] Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight [...] And th' habitations of the just; to him [...] Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd [...] Good out of evil to create, in stead [...] Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring [...] Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse [...] 190 [...] His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. [...] So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son [...] On his great Expedition now appeer'd, [...] Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd [...] Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love [...] Immense, and all his Father in him shon. [...] About his Chariot numberless were pour'd [...] Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, [...] And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, [...] From the Armoury of God, where stand of old [...] 200 [...] Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd [...] Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, [...] Celestial Equipage; and now came forth [...] Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, [...] Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide [...] Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound [...] On golden Hinges moving, to let forth [...] The King of Glorie in his powerful Word [...] And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. [...] On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore [...] 210 [...] They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss [...] Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, [...] Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes [...] And surging waves, as Mountains to assault [...] Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. [...] Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, [...] Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: [...] Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim [...] Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode [...] Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; [...] 220 [...] For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine [...] Follow'd in bright procession to behold [...] Creation, and the wonders of his might. [...] Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand [...] He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd [...] In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe [...] This Universe, and all created things: [...] One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd [...] Round through the vast profunditie obscure, [...] And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, [...] 230 [...] This be thy just Circumference, O World. [...] Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, [...] Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound [...] Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme [...] His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, [...] And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth [...] Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd [...] The black tartareous cold infernal dregs [...] Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd [...] Like things to like, the rest to several place [...] 240 [...] Disparted, and between spun out the Air, [...] And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. [...] Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light [...] Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure [...] Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East [...] To journie through the airie gloom began, [...] Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun [...] Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle [...] Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good; [...] And light from darkness by the Hemisphere [...] 250 [...] Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night [...] He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: [...] Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung [...] By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light [...] Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; [...] Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout [...] The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, [...] And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd [...] God and his works, Creatour him they sung, [...] Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. [...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. [...] Immediately the Mountains huge appeer [...] Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave [...] Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: [...] So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low [...] Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, [...] Capacious bed of Waters: thither they [...] 290 [...] Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld [...] As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; [...] Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, [...] For haste; such flight the great command impress'd [...] On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call [...] Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) [...] Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, [...] Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, [...] If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, [...] Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, [...] 300 [...] But they, or under ground, or circuit wide [...] With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, [...] And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; [...] Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, [...] All but within those banks, where Rivers now [...] Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. [...] The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle [...] Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: [...] And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth [...] Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, [...] 310 [...] And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; [...] Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. [...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now [...] Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, [...] Or wander with delight, and love to haunt [...] 330 [...] Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd [...] Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground [...] None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist [...] Went up and waterd all the ground, and each [...] Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth [...] God made, and every Herb, before it grew [...] On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: [...] So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. [...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. [...] And God made two great Lights, great for thir use [...] To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, [...] The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, [...] And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day [...] 350 [...] In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, [...] And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. [...] Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay [...] With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales [...] 400 [...] Of Fish that with thir Finns & shining Scales [...] Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft [...] Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate [...] Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves [...] Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance [...] Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, [...] Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend [...] Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food [...] In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, [...] And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk [...] 410 [...] Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate [...] Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan [...] Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep [...] Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, [...] And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles [...] Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. [...] Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares [...] Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon [...] Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd [...] Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge [...] 420 [...] They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime [...] With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud [...] In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork [...] On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: [...] Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise [...] In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, [...] Intelligent of seasons, and set forth [...] Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's [...] Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing [...] Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane [...] 430 [...] Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire [...] Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: [...] From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song [...] Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings [...] Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal [...] Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: [...] Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd [...] Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck [...] Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes [...] Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit [...] 440 [...] The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre [...] The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground [...] Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds [...] The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine [...] Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue [...] Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus [...] With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, [...] Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. [...] The Sixt, and of Creation last arose [...] With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, [...] 450 [...] Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde, [...] Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, [...] Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait [...] Op'ning her <b>fertil</b> Woomb teem'd at a Birth [...] Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, [...] Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose [...] As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns [...] In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; [...] Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: [...] The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: [...] 460 [...] Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks [...] Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung: [...] The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd [...] The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free [...] His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, [...] And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, [...] The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale [...] Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw [...] In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground [...] Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould [...] 470 [...] Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd [...] His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, [...] As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land [...] The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. [...] At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, [...] Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans [...] For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact [...] In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride [...] With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: [...] These as a line thir long dimension drew, [...] 480 [...] Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all [...] Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde [...] Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd [...] Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept [...] The Parsimonious Emmet, provident [...] Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, [...] Pattern of just equalitie perhaps [...] Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes [...] Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd [...] The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone [...] 490 [...] Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells [...] With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, [...] And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names, [...] Needlest to thee repeated; nor unknown [...] The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, [...] Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes [...] And hairie Main terrific, though to thee [...] Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. [...] Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld [...] Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand [...] 500 [...] First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire [...] Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, [...] By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt [...] Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; [...] There wanted yet the Master work, the end [...] Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone [...] And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd [...] With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect [...] His Stature, and upright with Front serene [...] Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence [...] 510 [...] Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, [...] But grateful to acknowledge whence his good [...] Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes [...] Directed in Devotion, to adore [...] And worship God Supream, who made him chief [...] Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father (For where is not hee [...] Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. [...] Let us make now Man in our image, Man [...] In our similitude, and let them rule [...] 520 [...] Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, [...] Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, [...] And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. [...] This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man [...] Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd [...] The breath of Life; in his own Image hee [...] Created thee, in the Image of God [...] Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. [...] Male he created thee, but thy consort [...] Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, [...] 530 [...] Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, [...] Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold [...] Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, [...] And every living thing that moves on the Earth. [...] Wherever thus created, for no place [...] Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st [...] He brought thee into this delicious Grove, [...] This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, [...] Delectable both to behold and taste; [...] And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food [...] 540 [...] Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds, [...] Varietie without end; but of the Tree [...] Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, [...] Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; [...] Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, [...] And govern well thy appetite, least sin [...] Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. [...] Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made [...] View'd, and behold all was entirely good; [...] So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: [...] 550 [...] Yet not till the Creator from his work [...] Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd [...] Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, [...] Thence to behold this new created World [...] Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd [...] In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, [...] Answering his great Idea. Up he rode [...] Followd with acclamation and the sound [...] Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd [...] Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire [...] 560 [...] Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) [...] The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, [...] The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood, [...] While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.

So sung [...] The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, [...] That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led [...] To Gods Eternal house direct the way, [...] A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold [...] And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, [...] Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way [...] Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest [...] 580 [...] Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seaventh [...] Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun [...] Was set, and twilight from the East came on, [...] Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount [...] Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne [...] Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, [...] The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down [...] With his great Father (for he also went [...] Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge [...] Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, [...] 590 [...] Author and end of all things, and from work [...] Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, [...] As resting on that day from all his work, [...] But not in silence holy kept; the Harp [...] Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, [...] And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, [...] All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire [...] Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice [...] Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds [...] Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.

[...] That Glory never shall his wrath or might [...] 110 [...] Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace [...] With suppliant knee, and deifie his power [...] Who from the terrour of this Arm so late [...] Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, [...] That were an ignominy and shame beneath [...] This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods [...] And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, [...] Since through experience of this great event [...] In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't, [...] We may with more successful hope resolve [...] 120 [...] To wage by force or guile eternal Warr [...] Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, [...] Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy [...] Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n. [...] So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain, [...] Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: [...] And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer. [...] O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, [...] That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr [...] Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds [...] 130 [...] Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King; [...] And put to proof his high Supremacy, [...] Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, [...] Too well I see and rue the dire event, [...] That with sad overthrow and foul defeat [...] Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host [...] In horrible destruction laid thus low, [...] As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences [...] Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains [...] Invincible, and vigour soon returns, [...] 140 [...] Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state [...] Here swallow'd up in endless misery. [...] But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now [...] Of force believe Almighty, since no less [...] Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours) [...] Have left us this our spirit and strength intire [...] Strongly to suffer and support our pains, [...] That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, [...] Or do him mightier service as his thralls [...] By right of Warr, what e're his business be [...] 150 [...] Here {{in the heart of}} Hell to work in Fire, [...] Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; [...] What can it then avail though yet we feel [...] Strength undiminisht, or eternal being [...] To undergo eternal punishment? [...] Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd. [...] Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable [...] Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, [...] To do ought good never will be our task, [...] But ever to do ill our sole delight, [...] 160 [...] As being the contrary to his high will [...] Whom we resist. If then his Providence [...] Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, [...] Our labour must be to pervert that end, [...] And out of good still to find means of evil; [...] Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps [...] Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb [...] His inmost counsels from their destind aim. [...] But see the angry Victor hath recall'd [...] His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit [...] 170 [...] Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail [...] Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid [...] The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice [...] Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder, [...] Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage, [...] Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now [...] To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. [...] Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn, [...] Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. [...] Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, [...] 180 [...] The seat of desolation, voyd of light, [...] Save what the glimmering of these livid flames [...] Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend [...] From off the tossing of these fiery waves, [...] There rest, if any rest can harbour there, [...] And reassembling our afflicted Powers, [...] Consult how we may henceforth most offend [...] Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, [...] How overcome this dire Calamity, [...] What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, [...] 190 [...] If not what resolution from despare. [...] Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate [...] With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes [...] That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides [...] Prone on the Flood, extended long and large [...] Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge [...] As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, [...] Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove, [...] Briarios or Typhon, whom the Den [...] By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast [...] 200 [...] Leviathan, which God of all his works [...] Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream: [...] Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam [...] The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff, [...] Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, [...] With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind [...] Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night [...] Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: [...] So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay [...] Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence [...] 210 [...] Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will [...] And high permission of all-ruling Heaven [...] Left him at large to his own dark designs, [...] That with reiterated crimes he might [...] Heap on himself damnation, while he sought [...] Evil to others, and enrag'd might see [...] How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth [...] Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn [...] On Man by him seduc't, but on himself [...] Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd. [...] 220 [...] Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool [...] His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames [...] Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld [...] In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale. [...] Then with expanded wings he stears his flight [...] Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air [...] That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land [...] He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd [...] With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; [...] And such appear'd in hue, as when the force [...] 230 [...] Of subterranean wind transports a Hill [...] Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side [...] Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible [...] And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire, [...] Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, [...] And leave a singed bottom all involv'd [...] With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole [...] Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, [...] Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood [...] As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength, [...] 240 [...] Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. [...] Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, [...] Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat [...] That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom [...] For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee [...] Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid [...] What shall be right: fardest from him is best [...] Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream [...] Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields [...] Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail [...] 250 [...] Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell [...] Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings [...] A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time. [...] The mind is its own place, and in it self [...] Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n. [...] What matter where, if I be still the same, [...] And what I should be, all but less then hee [...] Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least [...] We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built [...] Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: [...] 260 [...] Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce [...] To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: [...] Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n. [...] But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, [...] Th' associates and copartners of our loss [...] Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool, [...] And call them not to share with us their part [...] In this unhappy Mansion, or once more [...] With rallied Arms to try what may be yet [...] Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? [...] 270 [...] So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub [...] Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright, [...] Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, [...] If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge [...] Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft [...] In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge [...] Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults [...] Their surest signal, they will soon resume [...] New courage and revive, though now they lye [...] Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, [...] 280 [...] As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, [...] No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. [...] He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend [...] Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield [...] Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, [...] Behind him cast; the broad circumference [...] Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb [...] Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views [...] At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, [...] Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, [...] 290 [...] Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. [...] His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine [...] Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast [...] Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, [...] He walkt with to support uneasie steps [...] Over the burning Marle, not like those steps [...] On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime [...] Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; [...] Knotholes he so endur'd, till on the Beach [...] Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd [...] 300 [...] His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't [...] Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks [...] In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades [...] High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge [...] Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd [...] Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew [...] Busiris and his Memphian Chivalrie, [...] While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd [...] The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld [...] From the safe shore their floating Carkases [...] 310 [...] And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown [...] Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, [...] Under amazement of their hideous change. [...] He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep [...] Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, [...] Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost, [...] If such astonishment as this can sieze [...] Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place [...] After the toyl of Battel to repose [...] Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find [...] 320 [...] To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n? [...] Or in this abject posture have ye sworn [...] To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds [...] Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood [...] With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon [...] His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern [...] Th' advantage, and descending tread us down [...] Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts [...] Transfix us {{to the bottom of this}} Gulfe. [...] Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. [...] 330 [...] They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung [...] Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch [...] On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, [...] Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. [...] Nor did they not perceave the evil plight [...] In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; [...] Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd [...] Innumerable. As when the potent Rod [...] Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day [...] Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud [...] 340 [...] Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, [...] That ore the Realm of impious Pharoah hung [...] Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile: [...] So numberless were those bad Angels seen [...] Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell [...] 'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; [...] Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear [...] Of their great Sultan waving to direct [...] Thir course, in even ballance down they light [...] On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; [...] 350 [...] A multitude, like which the populous North [...] Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass [...] Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons [...] Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread [...] Beneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands. [...] Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band [...] The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood [...] Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms [...] Excelling human, Princely Dignities, [...] And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; [...] 360 [...] Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now [...] Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd [...] By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. [...] Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve [...] Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, [...] Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, [...] By falsities and lyes the greatest part [...] Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake [...] God their Creator, and th' invisible [...] Glory of him, that made them, to transform [...] 370 [...] Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd [...] With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, [...] And Devils to adore for Deities: [...] Then were they known to men by various Names, [...] And various Idols through the Heathen World. [...] Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, [...] Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, [...] At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth [...] Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, [...] While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? [...] 380 [...] The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell [...] Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix [...] Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, [...] Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd [...] Among the Nations round, and durst abide [...] Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd [...] Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd [...] Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, [...] Abominations; and with cursed things [...] His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd, [...] 390 [...] And with their darkness durst affront his light. [...] First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood [...] Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, [...] Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud [...] Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire [...] To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite [...] Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, [...] In Argob and in Basan, to the stream [...] Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such [...] Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart [...] 400 [...] Of Solomon he led by fraud to build [...] His Temple right against the Temple of God [...] On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove [...] The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence [...] And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell. [...] Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons, [...] From Aroer to Nebo, and the wild [...] Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon [...] And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond [...] The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, [...] 410 [...] And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool. [...] Peor his other Name, when he entic'd [...] Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile [...] To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. [...] Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd [...] Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove [...] Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; [...] Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. [...] With these came they, who from the bordring flood [...] Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts [...] 420 [...] Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names [...] Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, [...] These Feminine. For Spirits when they please [...] Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft [...] And uncompounded is their Essence pure, [...] Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb, [...] Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, [...] Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose [...] Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure, [...] Can execute their aerie purposes, [...] 430 [...] And works of love or enmity fulfill. [...] For those the Race of Israel oft forsook [...] Their living strength, and unfrequented left [...] His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down [...] To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low [...] Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear [...] Of despicable foes. With these in troop [...] Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd [...] Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns; [...] To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon [...] 440 [...] Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, [...] In Sion also not unsung, where stood [...] Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built [...] By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, [...] Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell [...] To Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, [...] Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd [...] The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate [...] In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, [...] While smooth Adonis from his native Rock [...] 450 [...] Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood [...] Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale [...] Infected Sions daughters with like heat, [...] Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch [...] Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led [...] His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries [...] Of alienated Judah. Next came one [...] Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark [...] Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off [...] In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, [...] 460 [...] Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers: [...] Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man [...] And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high [...] Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast [...] Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, [...] And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. [...] Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat [...] Was fair Damascus, on the <b>fertil</b> Banks [...] Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. [...] He also against the house of God was bold: [...] 470 [...] A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King, [...] Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew [...] Gods Altar to disparage and displace [...] For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn [...] His odious offrings, and adore the Gods [...] Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd [...] A crew who under Names of old Renown, [...] Osiris, Isis, Orus and their Train [...] With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd [...] Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek [...] 480 [...] Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms [...] Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape [...] Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd [...] The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King [...] Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan, [...] Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, [...] Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd [...] From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke [...] Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. [...] Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd [...] 490 [...] Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love [...] Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood [...] Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee [...] In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest [...] Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd [...] With lust and violence the house of God. [...] In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns [...] And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse [...] Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, [...] And injury and outrage: And when Night [...] 500 [...] Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons [...] Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. [...] Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night [...] In Gibeah, when hospitable Dores [...] Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. [...] These were the prime in order and in might; [...] The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd, [...] Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held [...] Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth [...] Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born [...] 510 [...] With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd [...] By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove [...] His own and Rhea's Son like measure found; [...] So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet [...] And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top [...] Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air [...] Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff, [...] Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds [...] Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old [...] Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields, [...] 520 [...] And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles. [...] All these and more came flocking; but with looks [...] Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd [...] Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief [...] Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost [...] In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast [...] Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride [...] Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore [...] Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd [...] Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears. [...] 530 [...] Then strait commands that at the warlike sound [...] Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard [...] His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd [...] Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: [...] Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld [...] Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't [...] Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind [...] With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd, [...] Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while [...] Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: [...] 540 [...] At which the universal Host upsent [...] A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond [...] Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. [...] All in a moment through the gloom were seen [...] Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air [...] With Orient Colours waving: with them rose [...] A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms [...] Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array [...] Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move [...] In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood [...] 550 [...] Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd [...] To highth of noblest temper Hero's old [...] Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage [...] Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd [...] With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, [...] Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage [...] With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase [...] Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain [...] From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they [...] Breathing united force with fixed thought [...] 560 [...] Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd [...] Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now [...] Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front [...] Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise [...] Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield, [...] Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief [...] Had to impose: He through the armed Files [...] Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse [...] The whole Battalion views, thir order due, [...] Thir visages and stature as of Gods, [...] 570 [...] Thir number last he summs. And now his heart [...] Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength [...] Glories: For never since created man, [...] Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these [...] Could merit more then that small infantry [...] Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood [...] Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd [...] That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side [...] Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds [...] In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son [...] 580 [...] Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; [...] And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel [...] Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, [...] Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, [...] Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore [...] When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell [...] By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond [...] Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd [...] Thir dread Commander: he above the rest [...] In shape and gesture proudly eminent [...] 590 [...] Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost [...] All her Original brightness, nor appear'd [...] Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess [...] Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n [...] Looks through the Horizontal misty Air [...] Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon [...] In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds [...] On half the Nations, and with fear of change [...] Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon [...] Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face [...] 600 [...] Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care [...] Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes [...] Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride [...] Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast [...] Signs of remorse and passion to behold [...] The fellows of his crime, the followers rather [...] (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd [...] For ever now to have their lot in pain, [...] Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't [...] Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung [...] 610 [...] For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, [...] Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire [...] Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, [...] With singed top their stately growth though bare [...] Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd [...] To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend [...] From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round [...] With all his Peers: attention held them mute. [...] Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, [...] Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last [...] 620 [...] Words interwove with sighs found out their way. [...] O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers [...] Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife [...] Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, [...] As this place testifies, and this dire change [...] Hateful to utter: but what power of mind [...] Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth [...] Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd, [...] How such united force of Gods, how such [...] As stood like these, could ever know repulse? [...] 630 [...] For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, [...] That all these puissant Legions, whose exile [...] Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend [...] Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat. [...] For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n, [...] If counsels different, or danger shun'd [...] By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns [...] Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure [...] Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, [...] Consent or custome, and his Regal State [...] 640 [...] Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, [...] Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. [...] Henceforth his might we know, and know our own [...] So as not either to provoke, or dread [...] New warr, provok't; our better part remains [...] To work in close design, by fraud or guile [...] What force effected not: that he no less [...] At length from us may find, who overcomes [...] By force, hath overcome but half his foe. [...] Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife [...] 650 [...] There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long [...] Intended to create, and therein plant [...] A generation, whom his choice regard [...] Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: [...] Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps [...] Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: [...] For this Infernal Pit shall never hold [...] Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse [...] Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts [...] Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, [...] 660 [...] For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr [...] Open or understood must be resolv'd. [...] He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew [...] Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs [...] Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze [...] Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd [...] Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's [...] Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, [...] Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. [...] There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top [...] 670 [...] Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire [...] Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign [...] That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, [...] The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed [...] A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands [...] Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd [...] Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, [...] Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, [...] Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell [...] From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts [...] 680 [...] Were always downward bent, admiring more [...] The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, [...] Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd [...] In vision beatific: by him first [...] Men also, and by his suggestion taught, [...] Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands [...] Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth [...] For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew [...] Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound [...] And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire [...] 690 [...] That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best [...] Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those [...] Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell [...] Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings, [...] Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, [...] And Strength and Art are easily outdone [...] By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour [...] What in an age they with incessant toyle [...] And hands innumerable scarce perform [...] Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, [...] 700 [...] That underneath had veins of liquid fire [...] Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude [...] With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, [...] Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: [...] A third as soon had form'd within the ground [...] A various mould, and from the boyling cells [...] By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, [...] As in an Organ from one blast of wind [...] To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. [...] Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge [...] 710 [...] Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound [...] Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, [...] Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round [...] Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid [...] With Golden Architrave; nor did there want [...] Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, [...] The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, [...] Nor great Alcairo such magnificence [...] Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine [...] Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat [...] 720 [...] Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove [...] In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile [...] Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores [...] Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide [...] Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth [...] And level pavement: from the arched roof [...] Pendant by suttle Magic many a row [...] Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed [...] With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light [...] As from a sky. The hasty multitude [...] 730 [...] Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise [...] And some the Architect: his hand was known [...] In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, [...] Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, [...] And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King [...] Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, [...] Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. [...] Nor was his name unheard or unador'd [...] In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land [...] Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell [...] 740 [...] From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove [...] Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn [...] To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, [...] A Summers day; and with the setting Sun [...] Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, [...] On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, [...] Erring; for he with this rebellious rout [...] Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now [...] To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape [...] By all his Engins, but was headlong sent [...] 750 [...] With his industrious crew to build in hell. [...] Mean while the winged Haralds by command [...] Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony [...] And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim [...] A solemn Councel forthwith to be held [...] At Pandaemonium, the high Capital [...] Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd [...] From every and Band squared Regiment [...] By place or choice the worthiest; they anon [...] With hundreds and with thousands trooping came [...] 760 [...] Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates [...] And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall [...] (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold [...] Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair [...] Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry [...] To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) [...] Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, [...] Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees [...] In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, [...] Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive [...] 770 [...] In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers [...] Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, [...] The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, [...] New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer [...] Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd [...] Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, [...] Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd [...] In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons [...] Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room [...] Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race [...] 780 [...] Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, [...] Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side [...] Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, [...] Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon [...] Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth [...] Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance [...] Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; [...] At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.

But far within [...] And in thir own dimensions like themselves [...] The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim [...] In close recess and secret conclave sat [...] A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, [...] Frequent and full. After short silence then [...] And summons read, the great consult began.|$|E
6000|$|Now Morn her rosie {{steps in}} th' Eastern Clime [...] Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearle, [...] When Adam wak't, so customd, for his sleep [...] Was Aerie light, from pure {{digestion}} bred, [...] And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound [...] Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan, [...] Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song [...] Of Birds on every bough; {{so much the}} more [...] His wonder was to find unwak'nd Eve [...] With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek, [...] 10 [...] As through unquiet rest: he on his side [...] Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love [...] Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld [...] Beautie, which whether waking or asleep, [...] Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice [...] Milde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, [...] Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake [...] My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, [...] Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, [...] Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field [...] 20 [...] Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring [...] Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, [...] What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, [...] How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee [...] Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. [...] Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye [...] On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. [...] O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, [...] My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see [...] Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night, [...] 30 [...] Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd, [...] If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee, [...] Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, [...] But of offence and trouble, which my mind [...] Knew never till this irksom night; methought [...] Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk [...] With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, [...] Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time, [...] The cool, the silent, save where silence yields [...] To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake [...] 40 [...] Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes [...] Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light [...] Shadowie sets {{off the face of}} things; in vain, [...] If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, [...] Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, [...] In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment [...] Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. [...] I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; [...] To find thee I directed then my walk; [...] And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways [...] 50 [...] That brought me on a sudden to the Tree [...] Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, [...] Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: [...] And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood [...] One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n [...] By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd [...] Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; [...] And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, [...] Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, [...] Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? [...] 60 [...] Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? [...] Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold [...] Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? [...] This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme [...] He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd [...] At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: [...] But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, [...] Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, [...] Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit [...] For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: [...] 70 [...] And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more [...] Communicated, more abundant growes, [...] The Author not impair'd, but honourd more? [...] Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve, [...] Partake thou also; happie though thou art, [...] Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: [...] Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods [...] Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, [...] But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes [...] Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see [...] 80 [...] What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. [...] So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, [...] Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part [...] Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell [...] So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought, [...] Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds [...] With him I flew, and underneath beheld [...] The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide [...] And various: wondring at my flight and change [...] To this high exaltation; suddenly [...] 90 [...] My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, [...] And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd [...] To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night [...] Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. [...] Best Image of my self and dearer half, [...] The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep [...] Affects me equally; nor can I like [...] This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; [...] Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, [...] Created pure. But know that in the Soule [...] 100 [...] Are many lesser Faculties that serve [...] Reason as chief; among these Fansie next [...] Her office holds; of all external things, [...] Which the five watchful Senses represent, [...] She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, [...] Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames [...] All what we affirm or what deny, and call [...] Our knowledge or opinion; then retires [...] Into her private Cell when Nature rests. [...] Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes [...] 110 [...] To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, [...] Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, [...] Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. [...] Som such resemblances methinks I find [...] Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, [...] But with addition strange; yet be not sad. [...] Evil into the mind of God or Man [...] May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave [...] No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope [...] That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, [...] 120 [...] Waking thou never wilt consent to do. [...] Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks [...] That wont to be more chearful and serene [...] Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, [...] And let us to our fresh imployments rise [...] Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours [...] That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells [...] Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. [...] So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, [...] But silently a gentle tear let fall [...] 130 [...] From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire; [...] Two other precious drops that ready stood, [...] Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell [...] Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse [...] And pious awe, that feard to have offended. [...] So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. [...] But first from under shadie arborous roof, [...] Soon as they forth were come to open sight [...] Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen [...] With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim, [...] 140 [...] Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, [...] Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East [...] Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains, [...] Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began [...] Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid [...] In various style, for neither various style [...] Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise [...] Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung [...] Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence [...] Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, [...] 150 [...] More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp [...] To add more sweetness, and they thus began. [...] These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, [...] Almightie, thine this universal Frame, [...] Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! [...] Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens [...] To us invisible or dimly seen [...] In these thy lowest works, yet these declare [...] Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: [...] Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, [...] 160 [...] Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs [...] And choral symphonies, Day without Night, [...] Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, [...] On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll [...] Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. [...] Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, [...] If better thou belong not to the dawn, [...] Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn [...] With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare [...] While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. [...] 170 [...] Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, [...] Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise [...] In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, [...] And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. [...] Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st [...] With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, [...] And yee five other wandring Fires that move [...] In mystic Dance not without Song, resound [...] His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. [...] Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth [...] 180 [...] Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run [...] Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix [...] And nourish all things, let your ceasless change [...] Varie to our great Maker still new praise. [...] Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise [...] From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, [...] Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, [...] In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, [...] Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, [...] Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, [...] 190 [...] Rising or falling still advance his praise. [...] His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, [...] Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, [...] With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. [...] Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, [...] Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. [...] Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, [...] That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, [...] Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; [...] Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk [...] 200 [...] The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; [...] Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, [...] To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade [...] Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. [...] Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still [...] To give us onely good; and if the night [...] Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, [...] Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. [...] So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts [...] Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. [...] 210 [...] On to thir mornings rural work they haste [...] Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row [...] Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr [...] Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check [...] Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine [...] To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines [...] Her mariageable arms, and with her brings [...] Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn [...] His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld [...] With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd [...] 220 [...] Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd [...] To travel with Tobias, and secur'd [...] His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. [...] Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth [...] Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf [...] Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd [...] This night the human pair, how he designes [...] In them at once to ruin all mankind. [...] Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend [...] Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade [...] 230 [...] Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, [...] To respit his day-labour with repast, [...] Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, [...] As may advise him of his happie state, [...] Happiness in his power left free to will, [...] Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, [...] Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware [...] He swerve not too secure: tell him withall [...] His danger, and from whom, what enemie [...] Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now [...] 240 [...] The fall of others from like state of bliss; [...] By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, [...] But by deceit and lies; this let him know, [...] Least wilfully transgressing he pretend [...] Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. [...] So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld [...] All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint [...] After his charge receivd, but from among [...] Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood [...] Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light [...] 250 [...] Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires [...] On each hand parting, to his speed gave way [...] Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate [...] Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide [...] On golden Hinges turning, as by work [...] Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. [...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her <b>fertil</b> growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. [...] Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet [...] 350 [...] His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train [...] Accompani'd then with his own compleat [...] Perfections, in himself was all his state, [...] More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits [...] On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long [...] Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold [...] Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. [...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile [...] Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd [...] Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. [...] Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb [...] Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons [...] Then with these various fruits the Trees of God [...] 390 [...] Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. [...] This day I have begot whom I declare [...] My onely Son, and on this holy Hill [...] Him have anointed, whom ye now behold [...] At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; [...] And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow [...] All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: [...] Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide [...] United as one individual Soule [...] 610 [...] For ever happie: him who disobeyes [...] Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day [...] Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls [...] Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place [...] Ordaind without redemption, without end. [...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted. Eevning approachd [...] (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, [...] We ours for change delectable, not need) [...] Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn [...] 630 [...] Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, [...] Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd [...] With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: [...] In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, [...] Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. [...] They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet [...] Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd [...] With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. [...] Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd [...] From that high mount of God, whence light & shade [...] 640 [...] Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd [...] To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there [...] In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd [...] All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, [...] Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr [...] Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, [...] (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng [...] Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend [...] By living Streams among the Trees of Life, [...] Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, [...] 650 [...] Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept [...] Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course [...] Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne [...] Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd [...] Satan, so call him now, his former name [...] Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, [...] If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, [...] In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught [...] With envie against the Son of God, that day [...] Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd [...] 660 [...] Messiah King anointed, could not beare [...] Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. [...] Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, [...] Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre [...] Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd [...] With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave [...] Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream [...] Contemptuous, and his next subordinate [...] Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. [...] Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close [...] 670 [...] Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree [...] Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips [...] Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts [...] Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; [...] Both waking we were one; how then can now [...] Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; [...] New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise [...] In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate [...] What doubtful may ensue, more in this place [...] To utter is not safe. Assemble thou [...] 680 [...] Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; [...] Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night [...] Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, [...] And all who under me thir Banners wave, [...] Homeward with flying march where we possess [...] The Quarters of the North, there to prepare [...] Fit entertainment to receive our King [...] The great Messiah, and his new commands, [...] Who speedily through all the Hierarchies [...] Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. [...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said. [...] Son, thou in whom my glory I behold [...] In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, [...] Neerly it now concernes us to be sure [...] Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms [...] We mean to hold what anciently we claim [...] 720 [...] Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe [...] Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne [...] Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; [...] Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie [...] In battel, what our Power is, or our right. [...] Let us advise, and to this hazard draw [...] With speed what force is left, and all imploy [...] In our defence, lest unawares we lose [...] This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. [...] To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer [...] 730 [...] Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, [...] Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes [...] Justly hast in derision, and secure [...] Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, [...] Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate [...] Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power [...] Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event [...] Know whether I be dextrous to subdue [...] Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. [...] So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers [...] 740 [...] Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host [...] Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, [...] Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun [...] Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. [...] Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies [...] Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones [...] In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which [...] All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more [...] Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, [...] And all the Sea, from one entire globose [...] 750 [...] Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd [...] At length into the limits of the North [...] They came, and Satan to his Royal seat [...] High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount [...] Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs [...] From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold, [...] The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call [...] That Structure in the Dialect of men [...] Interpreted) which not long after, hee [...] Affecting all equality with God, [...] 760 [...] In imitation of that Mount whereon [...] Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, [...] The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; [...] For thither he assembl'd all his Train, [...] Pretending so commanded to consult [...] About the great reception of thir King, [...] Thither to come, and with calumnious Art [...] Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, [...] If these magnific Titles yet remain [...] 770 [...] Not meerly titular, since by Decree [...] Another now hath to himself ingross't [...] All Power, and us eclipst under the name [...] Of King anointed, for whom all this haste [...] Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, [...] This onely to consult how we may best [...] With what may be devis'd of honours new [...] Receive him coming to receive from us [...] Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, [...] Too much to one, but double how endur'd, [...] 780 [...] To one and to his image now proclaim'd? [...] But what if better counsels might erect [...] Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? [...] Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend [...] The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust [...] To know ye right, or if ye know your selves [...] Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before [...] By none, and if not equal all, yet free, [...] Equally free; for Orders and Degrees [...] Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. [...] 790 [...] Who can in reason then or right assume [...] Monarchie over such as live by right [...] His equals, if in power and splendor less, [...] In freedome equal? or can introduce [...] Law and Edict on us, who without law [...] Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, [...] And look for adoration to th' abuse [...] Of those Imperial Titles which assert [...] Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? [...] Thus farr his bold discourse without controule [...] 800 [...] Had audience, when among the Seraphim [...] Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd [...] The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, [...] Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe [...] The current of his fury thus oppos'd. [...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United. But to grant it thee unjust, [...] That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: [...] Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, [...] 830 [...] Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, [...] Equal to him begotten Son, by whom [...] As by his Word the mighty Father made [...] All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n [...] By him created in thir bright degrees, [...] Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers [...] Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, [...] But more illustrious made, since he the Head [...] One of our number thus reduc't becomes, [...] 840 [...] His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done [...] Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. [...] That we were formd then saist thou? & the work [...] 850 [...] Of secondarie hands, by task transferd [...] From Father to his Son? strange point and new! [...] Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw [...] When this creation was? rememberst thou [...] Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? [...] We know no time when we were not as now; [...] Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd [...] By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course [...] Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature [...] Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. [...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise, [...] Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly [...] These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth [...] Impendent, raging into sudden flame [...] Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel [...] His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire. [...] 890 [...] Then who created thee lamenting learne, [...] When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. [...] So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found, [...] Among the faithless, faithful only hee; [...] Among innumerable false, unmov'd, [...] Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd [...] His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; [...] Nor number, nor example with him wrought [...] To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind [...] Though single. From amidst them forth he passd, [...] 900 [...] Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind [...] Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught; [...] And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd [...] On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.|$|E

[...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom toile, but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the <b>fertil</b> burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E
