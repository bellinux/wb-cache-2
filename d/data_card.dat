40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} nature of managed-care hassles in primary care physicians' offices and to {{determine}} the feasibility of practice-based research methods to study the problem. Methods 16 internists and 10 family physicians volunteered to collect data about managed-care hassles during or shortly after the office visit for 15 consecutive patients using preprinted <b>data</b> <b>cards.</b> Outcome measures Number of hassles, time required for hassles, and interference with quality of care and doctor-patient relationship. Results Physicians adapted easily to using <b>data</b> <b>cards.</b> Before the pilot study, participants estimated a hassle rate of 10 % and thought that interference with quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship was infrequent. Of 376 total visits for which the physicians completed <b>data</b> <b>cards,</b> 23 % of visits generated 1 or more hassles. On average, a physician who saw 22 patients daily experienced 1 hassle lasting 10 minutes for every 4 to 5 patients. More than 40 % of hassles were reported as interfering with quality of care, the doctor-patient relationship, or both. Conclusions The high hassle rate, {{in addition to the}} interference of hassles with quality of care and the doctor-patient relationship, suggests the need for further investigation into managed-care hassles using practice-based research methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Communication and {{co-operation}} {{processes in}} healthcare and welfare require {{the involvement of}} all parties involved, including health professionals as well as patients. Generally, professionals can and will easily communicate via trusted health networks. To enforce both communication and co-operation between professionals and patients and to guarantee the required degree of involvement of patients in shared care environments, smart cards are widely used. They serve as person identifiers {{on the one hand}} and as security token on the other hand. Acting as storage media and portable application systems, patient <b>data</b> <b>cards</b> enable patient-controlled exchange and the use of personal health data for specific purposes such as prescription and disease management. Additionally, patient status data such as the emergency data or the immunisation record may be stored in and communicated by patient <b>data</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe wide use {{of smart}} card {{automatic}} fare collection (AFC) systems in public transit makes it popular to analyse public transit user behaviour based on smart <b>card</b> <b>data.</b> Most smart-card-based researches are time-related, but smart <b>card</b> <b>data</b> time is not always reliable because smart card systems are usually off-line and lack of maintenance in China, and smart <b>card</b> <b>data</b> of different buses often shares different time references. This paper explores the application of dynamic time warping to unify time reference of smart <b>card</b> <b>data.</b> Based on {{the analysis of the}} relationship between boarding time in smart <b>card</b> <b>data</b> and arrival-departure time in automatic vehicle location (AVL) <b>data,</b> a smart <b>card</b> <b>data</b> time reference unification algorithm was proposed. The results indicate that the algorithm can work out reliable time offsets by numerical calculation and runs well with integral automatic vehicle location data. Due {{to the fact that the}} time reference of smart <b>card</b> <b>data</b> for each bus changes daily, the best way to put an end to smart card time reference problem is to make smart card systems online, such as combining smart card readers with automatic vehicle location systems...|$|R
