40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Two econometric {{models were}} {{developed}} to forecast consumption, production, and price of <b>hardwood</b> lumber, and removals and price of <b>hardwood</b> sawlog stumpage. Four eastern U. S. regions were represented in the models. <b>Hardwood</b> lumber consumption by manufacturing, shipping, residential construction, and nonresidential construction industries was recognized. <b>Hardwood</b> sawlog stumpage removals from nonindustrial private and forest industry ownerships were identified {{in each of the}} four eastern regions. Each model consisted of behavioral relationships which explain consumption, production, or removals as a function of price and other explanatory variables. Estimates of these relationships were developed using annual time series data for the sample period 1960 to 1976. Based on the analysis of historical simulations, the models appeared to provide adequate predictive ability to be used to develop forecasts. <b>Hardwood</b> lumber consumption, production, and price were forecast to increase to the year 2030. Manufacturing and shipping industries increase their share of <b>hardwood</b> lumber consumption over this time period. <b>Hardwood</b> lumber production shares increase for the two southern regions. <b>Hardwood</b> sawlog stumpage removals for the nonindustrial private and forest industry ownerships were forecast to increase. The nonindustrial private share of <b>hardwood</b> sawlog stumpage removals declines. <b>Hardwood</b> sawlog stumpage prices were forecast to decline in three of the four eastern regions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Analysis of the {{long-term}} spatial pattern and dynamics of <b>hardwood</b> patches in the Coast Range of Oregon provides numerous ecological insights. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances {{have contributed to the}} development of a patchy mosaic of vegetation types in the area. Some <b>hardwood</b> patches in the Coast Range may be the precursors to stable vegetation states. The five objectives for the study were to: 1) develop the methodology for studying patch dynamics at landscape scales; 2) describe changes in the areal extent and occurrence of <b>hardwood</b> patches; 3) characterize the sizes and shapes, and size and shape changes of <b>hardwood</b> patches in the west-central Coast Range of Oregon; 4) describe the shift in within-patch heterogeneity and within-patch vegetation composition features of <b>hardwood</b> patches; and 5) characterize patches occurring in riparian areas. A viable methodology was developed for the detailed study of the change in vegetation patches across landscapes using scanned, georeferenced aerial photos, aerial photo interpretation of <b>hardwood</b> patches, and GIS techniques. Patch locations and characteristics were compared to a suite of environmental and other variables. The <b>hardwood</b> patch mosaic was not a stable landscape feature. The total area covered by <b>hardwood</b> patches, the weighted mean size of <b>hardwood</b> patches, and the number of patches sampled declined from 1939 to 1993. Forest Service lands showed the most dramatic drop in <b>hardwood</b> area, while private non-industrial lands showed the most dramatic increase in <b>hardwood</b> area. Most patches present in 1939 either disappeared or decreased in size. In 1993, <b>hardwood</b> patches were found closer to streams and on lower slope positions than in 1939. This may be associated with historic disturbance patterns of fire, logging, and grazing that occurred on the upper slopes, allowing for alder establishment on these sites. <b>Hardwood</b> patch shapes became more complex over time, especially in riparian areas. Core area:edge area ratios increased. <b>Hardwood</b> patches were less heterogeneous in within-patch composition than expected, with large conifers the main non-hardwood cover type within patches; within-patch heterogeneity declined during the study period. Recent management practices are likely increasing <b>hardwood</b> fragmentation and shape complexity, and restricting the landscape distribution of <b>hardwood</b> patches...|$|R

5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their <b>hardwoods.</b> Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the <b>hardwoods</b> in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella bombycina is a {{saprobic}} species. Fruit bodies grow singly or {{in small}} groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead <b>hardwoods.</b> Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for <b>hardwoods,</b> {{it has been reported}} growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it. Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V.bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.|$|E
