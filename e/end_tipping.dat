40|$|AbstractSystems {{and methods}} are {{described}} for monitoring {{temporal and spatial}} moisture content changes in clay embankments using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) imaging. The methodology is based upon development of a robust relationship between fill resistivity and moisture content and its use in the transformation of resistivity image differences in terms of relative moisture content changes. Moisture level and moisture content movement applications are exemplified using two case histories from the UK. The first is the BIONICS embankment, near Newcastle (NE England), which was constructed in 2005 using varying degrees of compaction of a medium plasticity sandy, silty clay derived from the Durham Till. The second is a Victorian embankment south of Nottingham (Central England), constructed in 1897 using <b>end</b> <b>tipping</b> of Late Triassic siltstone and mudstone taken from local cuttings. Climate change forecasts for the UK suggest that transportation earthworks will be subjected to more sustained, higher temperatures and increased intensity of rainfall. Within the context of preventative geotechnical asset maintenance, ERT imaging can provide a monitoring framework to manage moisture movement and identify failure trigger conditions within embankments, thus supporting on demand inspection scheduling and low cost early interventions...|$|E

40|$|Soil nailing is {{commonly}} used for stabilizing cut slopes and retaining structures. The technique is, however, seldom used in stabilizing old loose fill slopes that were not constructed to the current standards. There is a concern that soil-nailed loose fill slopes may not render safety during heavy rainstorms. Little work {{has been carried out}} to investigate the behavior of soil-nailed loose fill slopes. This paper presents a comprehensive field test on a loose fill slope that was constructed by <b>end</b> <b>tipping</b> without any compaction - in the same way old fill slopes were formed. The slope was 4. 75 m high, 9 m wide, and 33 deg to the horizontal. Two rows of five grouted nails were installed at a grid of 1. 5 m × 1. 5 m at an inclination of 20 deg from the horizontal. A surface grillage was used to connect the six nails {{in the middle of the}} grid. Performance of the nailed slope was monitored with various instruments for about six months until the slope was tested to fail by surcharging and wetting. The overall results show that soil nailing with a surface grillage is a potentially effective way to enhance the stability of old fill slopes. © 2008 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The optical beam {{deflection}} (OBD) technique {{is used in}} many Atomic Force Microscopes to measure the motion of a cantilever as it probes the scanned surface.

Table-top AFM systems often use manual alignment. For industrial applications automatic alignment is necessary. This paper describes a method to automate this alignment procedure, using a laser induced thermo-mechanical response to actively bend the cantilever.
