500|$|Originally, Shannon McMahon {{was to be}} a {{recurring}} character and was due to be featured in [...] "The Truth", the series finale of The X-Files. However, Lawless, who has a history of miscarriages, became pregnant shortly after part two of these episodes was filmed; her high-risk pregnancy prevented her returning to the series for future episodes. Carter called Lawless [...] "hot stuff", saying it was [...] "fun" [...] having a female Super Soldier, something that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him or to the show's production crew.|$|E
500|$|In a November 2014 {{cover story}} for Out {{promoting}} The Imitation Game, Cumberbatch opened up about sexual experimentation {{during his time}} in boarding schools stating, [...] "While there was experimentation, it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me as, 'Oh, this is that!' It was just boys and their penises, {{the same way with}} girls and vaginas and boobs. It wasn't out of desire." [...] LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, [...] "Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people. It is often difficult for those growing up to find role models who demonstrate that it is equally okay to be gay or straight." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Yoda" [...] was {{originally}} written by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{during the initial}} run of the second Star Wars movie, the 1980 American epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke {{in the ways of}} The Force following the demise of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, [...] "Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] He {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use [...] "Lola"—"which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is quite}} {{out of the}} question. She is very young, and such a thing <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her. And {{we are not the}} same sort of people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens!" [...] whispered Mrs. Travers. [...] "This <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] Those words {{seemed to}} lose {{themselves}} {{in the folds of}} the scarf without reaching d'Alcacer, who continued in his gentle tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, {{let me have}} my say out. You {{have accused}} me, I say, and I believe that you have accused him. But it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> you, I dare say, to accuse yourself." ...|$|R
500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E
2500|$|Seinfeld co-creator Larry David based George {{largely on}} himself. Seinfeld and David created the {{character}} as a counterpoint to Seinfeld's character. In {{the first draft}} of the show's pilot script, called [...] "Stand-Up" [...] at the time, George's name was Bennett and he, like Jerry, was a comedian. In that same draft, the scene in the pilot in which George and Jerry discuss a woman Jerry met earlier, saw George and Jerry discussing their stand-up act. This idea however, was quickly abandoned and his name was changed to George, the real estate broker instead. George's last name comes from Michael Costanza, a college classmate of Seinfeld. [...] "Louis", George's middle name is a homage to Lou Costello, whose 1950s television series The Abbott and Costello Show, inspired Seinfelds writing style. Although he is often asked whether he wanted to play the character, Larry David has said that he was only interested in writing the show, that, not only did he not want to act on the show, but it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him and, even if it had, he highly doubted that NBC would have approved of his being cast.|$|E
60|$|It <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> {{her that}} Sidney might {{possibly}} marry a plain woman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; every bit. She does lots of {{embroidery}} {{and work}} of all kinds when she is waiting for him or sitting with him, and luckily it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him to ask what it is for.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> {{you that}} though we might {{love each other}} very warmly as friends--and so I am sure we always shall--yet we might not suit each other in all respects as man and wife?" ...|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Precious Ramotswe {{that there}} might be {{disadvantages}} to being the best-known lady detective in Botswana. But when she receives a threatening anonymous letter, she is compelled to reconsider her previously-unconquerable belief in a kind world and good neighbours.|$|R
60|$|The lady {{almost fell}} back {{on the floor in}} her astonishment. The idea <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
60|$|It <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him {{to reckon}} up {{the amount of}} his bedclothes before {{retiring}} to rest.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{was silent}} for some time, It <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that this letter would be brought home to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> {{me in that}} light," [...] she said. [...] "Clara needs a chaperon, and I need a companion. We {{were talking}} {{yesterday}} of going to Cairo for the winter. My only fear is that I am robbing you of your niece." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As Vicar of Chuntsey, in Essex," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been {{forcibly}} {{dressed up}} as an old woman and made {{to take part in}} a crime in the character of an old woman. Never once. My experience may be small. It may be insufficient. But it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it is not," [...] replied Mrs Denman. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> insured in my life, because {{although}} I hear of fires {{every day in}} London, it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me until lately {{that there was any}} probability of my house being burned. I know it was very foolish of me, but I shall see to having it done directly." ...|$|R
60|$|Charteris took a seat, {{and faced}} this {{difficulty}} {{in all its}} aspects. The idea <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him before. And yet {{it should have been}} obvious.|$|E
60|$|Now it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Direck to ask {{why there}} were no Indian nor Chinese Utopias, and even Mr. Carmine seemed {{surprised}} to discover this deficiency.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} {{now that}} it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me that a man whose hair at fifty-five was already streaked with grey, must have passed through some terrible ordeal.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who died}} in action are denoted by a diamond, those who were missing (MIAs, POWs, and others) are denoted with a cross. When {{the death of one}} who was {{previously}} missing is confirmed, a diamond is superimposed over the cross. If the missing were to return alive, which <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> date, the cross is to be circumscribed by a circle.|$|R
6000|$|Daisy {{turned to}} Winterbourne, {{beginning}} to smile again. He was still more perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though {{it seemed to}} prove, indeed, {{that she had a}} sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Winterbourne to offer me any tea," [...] she said with her little tormenting manner.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{difficulty}} which, indeed, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> even <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me till that moment. I stammered and hesitated.|$|R
60|$|He {{kissed her}} silently. There really was anguish in her tone, {{and he was}} frightened. It <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that she meant what she said quite, quite seriously.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{might catch}} {{some of the}} water that is finding {{its way through the}} roof," [...] Mistress Pemberton said as if such a {{possibility}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her before.|$|E
60|$|The eyebrows quivered on the stained-glass man. It <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him, perhaps, that {{to stand}} for Parliament a man must look like it; he {{examined}} Shelton with some curiosity.|$|E
60|$|He was aghast, silent from sheer confusion. This was a {{point of}} view which <b>had</b> <b>never</b> once <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That thought <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] replied Betty, [...] "because our {{reason for}} going forth to preach the Gospel to the heathen is the simple one that God {{commands}} {{us to do}} so. Yet {{it seems to me}} quite consistent with that command that God may have other ways and methods of making His truth known to men, but this being a mere speculation does not free us from our simple duty." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gelernter {{is known}} for his critiques of {{cultural}} illiteracy on America's college campuses. In 2015, he commented, [...] "They students know nothing about art. They know nothing about history. They know nothing about philosophy. And because they have been raised as not even atheists, they don’t {{rise to the level of}} atheists, insofar as they’ve never thought about the existence or nonexistence of God. It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> them. They know nothing about the Bible." ...|$|R
60|$|The idea {{of flight}} without Jess <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> John, {{and now that}} she {{suggested}} it, it struck him as so absurd that he broke into {{the ghost of a}} laugh.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{listened to}} this {{assertion}} with some interest; it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her that Mr. Touchett {{was likely to}} discuss her matrimonial prospects with Lord Warburton. [...] "Has he told you that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suggested}} it! Oh no, I didn't--it {{was new to}} me, it {{frightened me}} at the time, but it started me thinking {{about a lot of}} things that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E
60|$|Adams's puzzled look increased, {{and finally}} {{settled on the}} horizon. The matter <b>had</b> evidently <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him before in that light. After a short silence he turned again to Christian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is out of the question, mamma. It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me for a moment as otherwise. He has got to go to Oxford and take his degree before he thinks of such a thing. I shall be quite an old woman by that time, and he will have {{forgotten}} me. You may be sure, mamma, that whatever I did say to him was quite plain. I wish you could have been here and heard it all, and seen it all." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} {{occasion}} that I saw Isabel she was, as I have said, climbing a tree--and a very creditable tree--for her own private satisfaction. It was a lapse {{from the high}} seriousness of politics, and I perceived she felt that I might regard it as such and attach too much importance to it. I had some difficulty in reassuring her. And it's odd <b>to</b> note now--it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me before--that from that day to this I do not think I have ever reminded Isabel of that encounter.|$|R
