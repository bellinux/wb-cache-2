Similar requirements are now becoming common on large solar power installations that likewise might cause instability {{in the event of a}} widespread <b>disconnection</b> of generating <b>units.</b> Depending on the application the device may, during and after the dip, be required to: ...|$|R
40|$|Generation loss {{contingencies}} in {{electric power}} systems {{result in a}} deviation of system frequency from nominal, a condition which must be corrected promptly {{in order to prevent}} further degradation of the power system. Automatic load-shedding using underfrequency relays is one of the techniques used to correct abnormal frequency deviations and prevent the risk of uncontrolled outages. If sufficient load is shed following a contingency to preserve interconnections and keep generators on-line, the system can be restored with relative speed and ease. On the other hand, if a declining frequency condition is not dealt with adequately, a cascading <b>disconnection</b> of generating <b>units</b> may develop, leading to a possible total system blackout. This thesis develops and tests a new systematic method for setting underfrequency relays offering a number of advantages over conventional methods. A discretized swing equation model is used to evaluate the system frequency following a contingency, and the operational logic of an underfrequency relay is modeled using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The proposed approach computes relay settings with respect to a subset of all plausible contingencies for a given system. A method for selecting the subset of contingencies for inclusion in the MILP is presented. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that given certain types of degrees of freedom in the relay setting problem, it is possible to obtain a set of relay settings that limits damage or <b>disconnection</b> of generating <b>units</b> for each and every possible generation loss outage in a given system, while attempting to shed the least amount of load for each contingency...|$|R
40|$|The high {{penetration}} {{level of}} Distributed Generation (DG) power plants into Distribution Networks (DN) has highlighted {{the necessity to}} develop proper control techniques to supply customers with voltage levels contained within regulatory limits and to offer ancillary services to the DN. Compared with traditional centralized control techniques, decentralized ones act locally requiring less investments in terms of communication systems or remote sensing. This paper deals with optimization issues for local reactive power control of voltage profiles in Medium Voltage (MV) radial distribution systems. The proposed optimized controller {{is based on a}} sensitivity analysis approach aimed at minimizing reactive power injection into the DN and active power losses while avoiding DG <b>units</b> <b>disconnection</b> as much as possible. Validation of the proposed controller has been conducted on a real MV Italian distribution system...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, a 1000 Hz {{tone for}} 200 ms {{represents}} a 10p coin, and 1000 Hz for 350 ms represents a 50p coin. Prior to this system, the earliest UK pay-on-answer payphones used a resistance, {{inserted into the}} loop for one or several short periods followed by a short flash (complete <b>disconnection),</b> to signal <b>units</b> of money inserted. Phreaks simulated these signals by unscrewing the microphone cover of the handset and inserting into the microphone circuit a resistor in parallel with a press-to-open push-button, getting the timing correct was difficult and failure to do this {{would result in the}} relay set controlling the call at the exchange to release, dropping the call. This was hard to do inconspicuously in outdoor payphones, and was more common indoors (e.g., in student halls of residence). Manipulating a telephone in this way was obviously illegal and carried the specific offence of 'Abstracting Electricity' from the GPO (later the Post Office and later still BT.) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project proposed a modified unit commitment that schedules connection and <b>disconnection</b> of generating <b>units</b> {{in response to}} load. A modified generation control is also proposed that controls steam units under automatic generation control, fast responding diesels, gas turbines and hydro units under a feedforward control, and wind turbine array output under a closed loop array control. This modified generation control and unit commitment require prediction of trend wind power variation one hour ahead and the prediction of error in this trend wind power prediction one half hour ahead. An improved meter for predicting trend wind speed variation is developed. Methods for accurately simulating the wind array power from {{a limited number of}} wind speed prediction records was developed. Finally, two methods for predicting the error in the trend wind power prediction were developed. This research provides a foundation for testing and evaluating the modified unit commitment and generation control that was developed to maintain operating reliability at a greatly reduced overall production cost for utilities with wind generation capacity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{possibility}} to use Decentralized Generation (DG) units for voltage support in Distribution Networks during and after a Short Circuit (S/C) event is discussed. Two types of DG units will be examined, Combined Heat-Power (CHP) plants and Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG). Earlier approaches would oblige the <b>disconnection</b> of these <b>units</b> during grid disturbances, {{in order to avoid}} unwanted conditions such as interference with the protection system and islanding [1]. Newer grid codes for Transmission Networks like [2], taking into consideration the increased share of these units in energy production have set specific Fault Ride-Through (FRT) criteria which oblige them to stay connected during SC events when they are combined to large plants directly connected to the transmission grid, such as (off shore) wind farms [...] If ever more DG is connected directly to distribution grids, the same reasoning leading to applying rault ride through criteria to DG connected in large groups to transmission grids, may be applied to DG connected to distribution grids, as a loss of a a large amount of DG connected to distribution grids has the same adverse effect as using DG connected directly to the transmission grid...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of a power}} system is to economically supply energy to match system demand with a required level of security. The temporal and stochastic variability of demand and supply and the inability to efficiently store electrical energy are characteristics of the electricity industry. The reliability of the power system {{is influenced by the}} reliability of the generators and, {{in the event of a}} contingency, their dynamic response. Reliability comes at a price and to operate the system economically a balance must be achieved between the reliability level and the acceptable cost. The system operator must therefore schedule units in advance taking into consideration energy costs, dynamic response and reliability. To facilitate the decision-making process, suitable optimisation techniques and models of individual units and of the overall system are required. A boiler model based on fundamental physical laws is proposed. It is suitable for analysing plant dynamics in the longer time-scales, i. e., beyond 10 seconds, following a major system contingency such as loss of a large generator. It can predict the reserve capacity of the unit and also the variation of critical internal parameters that may cause <b>disconnection</b> of the <b>unit</b> from the system during a severe system transient. Identification and validation of control parameters wa...|$|R
40|$|To improve safety, reliability, and {{efficiency}} of automotive vehicles and other technical applications, embedded systems commonly use fault diagnosis consisting of fault detection and isolation. Since many systems are constructed as distributed embedded systems including multiple control units, {{it is necessary to}} perform global fault isolation using for example a central unit. However, the drawbacks with such a centralized method are the need of a powerful diagnostic unit and the sensitivity against <b>disconnections</b> of this <b>unit.</b> Two alternative methods to centralized fault isolation are presented in this thesis. The first method performs global fault isolation by a istributed sequential computation. For a set of studied systems, themethod gives, compared to a centralizedmethod, amean reduction inmaximumprocessor load on any unitwith 40 and 70 %for systems consisting of four and eight units respectively. The second method instead extends the result of the local fault isolation performed in each unit such that the results are globally correct. By only considering the components affecting each specific unit, the extended result in each agent is kept small. For a studied automotive vehicle, the second method gives, compared to a centralized method, a mean reduction in the sizes of the results and the maximum processor load on any unit with 85 and 90 % respectively. To perform fault diagnosis, diagnostic tests are commonly used. If the additional evaluation of tests can not improve the fault isolation of a component then the component is ready. Since the evaluation of a test comes with a cost in for example computational resources, it is valuable to minimize the number of tests that have to be evaluated before readiness is achieved for all components. A strategy is presented that decides in which order to evaluate tests such that readiness is achieved with as few evaluations of tests as possible. Besides knowing how fault diagnosis is performed, it is also interesting to assess the effect that fault diagnosis has on for example safety. Since fault tree analysis often is used to evaluate safety, this thesis contributes with a systematic method that includes the effect of fault diagnosis in fault trees. The safety enhancement due to the use of fault diagnosis can thereby be analyzed and quantified...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium verticillioides (= Fusarium moniliforme) {{a common}} fungal {{contaminant}} of maize {{throughout the world}} has been associated with diseases in both man and animals. The structure of the fumonisins, a family of structurally related mycotoxins isolated from cultures associated with the high incidence of human oesophageal cancer in the Transkei region in South Africa and with equine leucoencephalomalacia, a neurological disorder in horses and donkeys, has been established. The main mycotoxin, fumonisin B 1 consists of the diester formed by the C(14) and C(15) hydroxyl groups of (2 S, 3 S, 5 R, 10 R, 12 S, 14 S, 15 R, 16 R) - 2 - amino- 12, 16 -dimethyleicosane- 3, 10, 14, 15 -pentaol with the Si carboxy group of propane- 1, 2, 3 -tricarboxylic acid. A comparison of the structures of the 28 known fumonisins reveals that they share a common structural motif for the C(11) -C(20) unit, and probably also the same stereochemistry for the 4 stereogenic centres present in this <b>unit.</b> <b>Disconnection</b> of the C(9) –C(10) bond in a retrosynthetic analysis of the fumonisins C 20 backbone (C 19 in the fumonisin C series) identifies (3 S, 5 S, 6 R, 7 R) - 3, 7 -dimethylundecane- 1, 5, 6 -triol as a common building block for the synthesis of any of the fumonisins. In the dissertation the retrosynthetic analysis of this 3, 7 -dimethylundecane- 1, 5, 6 -triol building block identifies (3 S, 4 R, 5 R) - 5 -methylnonane- 1, 3, 4 -triol as a viable target which in turn could be derived from a simple starting material trans- 4 -hexen- 3 -one. Key reactions identified to realise the required transformations leading to the identified target included kinetic enzymatic resolution of the racemic alcohol obtained from trans- 4 -hexen- 3 -one, and a pivotal role for both the [2, 3]-Wittig rearrangement and the use of Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation methodology as these reactions generated the requisite stereogenic centres present in (3 S, 4 R, 5 R) - 5 -methylnonane- 3, 4 -diol. In this manner a synthetic route from trans- 4 -hexen- 3 - one to (2 R, 3 R, 4 R, 5 R, 6 E) - 4 -(benzyloxy) - 2, 3 -epoxy- 5 -methylnon- 6 -en- 1 -ol using appropriate functional group transformations and protective group strategies, with complete stereochemical control, were developed in this work. Alternative strategies to overcome problems encountered during the synthesis are presented for future work. The conversion of the 4 -(benzyloxy) - 2, 3 -epoxy- 5 -methylnon- 6 -en- 1 -ol intermediate to the protected 5 - methylnonane- 1, 3, 4 -triol target could not be carried out due to time constraints and material shortages.
