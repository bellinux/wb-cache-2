5|$|During {{the first}} season of The X-Files, Deep Throat {{provided}} Mulder and Scully with information {{they would have been}} otherwise unable to obtain. As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he {{was in a position to}} <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of information. Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, we <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{deal about}} early Gaelic law, often called Brehon Laws, which helps {{reconstruct}} native legal practices.

25|$|The {{mass media}} face {{a number of}} {{pressures}} that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims {{in terms of their}} credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} protagonists, Mihai {{is the most}} level-headed, experienced, and least anti-heroic of the group. Despite his old age and being human, Mihai has skills that equate or even exceed most of the cast. However, Mihai has a terrible sense of {{direction}} and has a constant run of bad luck. He and Badou share a close bond along with Kiri and Mimi, and also shares concern for Heine and Naoto. So far, his link to the underground is not as deep as the others, but Richter Berthein seems to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal about the assassin.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1947 essay, George Orwell {{wrote that}} [...] "The {{morality}} of Shakespeare's later tragedies is not religious {{in the ordinary}} sense, and certainly is not Christian. Only two of them, Hamlet and Othello, are supposedly occurring inside the Christian era, and even in those, apart from the antics of the ghost in Hamlet, {{there is no indication}} of a ‘next world’ where everything is to be put right.... We do not <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal about Shakespeare's religious beliefs, and from the evidence of his writings {{it would be difficult to}} prove that he had any." ...|$|E

Jared has trouble controlling his anger, and is prone to flashes of violence that he later regrets. While {{at the beginning of the}} story he shows no hobbies or particular interests like Simon's love for animals and Mallory's fencing, he shows evidence of wanting to keep records of his experiences with faeries, making additional notes in Arthur's Field Guide and practicing his drawing, and is revealed to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal about faerie lore in [...] "Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles".|$|E
