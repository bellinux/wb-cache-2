40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} on the original solution of a <b>flange</b> <b>shaft</b> {{as part of the}} root area of a 5 kW wind turbine blade. There were analyzed the causes that led to the shaft breakage under wind loadings in extreme weather conditions, and consequently technical solutions have been searched in order to improve the shaft design making it more reliable as mechanical strength at extreme wind loadings. The <b>flange</b> <b>shaft</b> is a welded subassembly that keeps the blades attached to the rotor hub. The first part of the paper consists in an analysis referring the loading status, the materials used for blade manufacturing, the identification of critical areas where the breaking was initiated and also the causes for which the materials assumed and specified in the technical design and manufacturing technology failed under loading at wind gusts of about 30 m/sec. Based on this preliminary analysis, {{the second part of the}} paper presents the technical solutions which were considered in reference to the materials and the improved design concept aiming to provide the right mechanical strength necessary to withstand specific wind loadings in extreme weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Residual {{stresses}} play a {{key role}} in thermo-mechanically coupled forming processes for industrial mass production. They are an unavoidable consequence of the alternating inhomogeneous fields of temperature and mechanical stress developing in tools and components dependent on the process parameters applied. Because of their influence on the behavior of the components produced, a great interest exists to get reliable information about origin and distribution of the relevant residual stress fields and to understand the basic principles of their formation. In this paper the development of residual stress in tools (steel AISI H 11) used for the thermo-mechanical forming operation of cylindrical <b>flange</b> <b>shafts</b> (steel SAE 6150) is outlined. The loading situation of the tool is simulated by thermal fatigue tests, providing information about cyclic stress and plastic deformation during the manufacturing process. Furthermore the residual stress states of the <b>flange</b> <b>shafts</b> manufactured are presented and discussed. Chip forming manufacturing operations are challenging tasks and tensile residual stresses can be avoided using adapted process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Examination {{revealed}} that misalignment {{in the assembly}} of the bearing resulted in the failure. Evidences suggest that {{the distance between the}} bearing housing and the <b>flange</b> of the <b>shaft</b> was smaller than that of the permissible limit. This has resulted in sliding of the balls on one of the shoulders of the groove of the inner and outer races. Because of this, there was severe stressing of the cage material leading to fracturing of the cage. Once this failure occurred, the balls and the outer race came out of the bearing assembly.

40|$|The {{deflection}} of the crankshaft which transfers {{the power}} of motor to the pump of the compressor directly affects the vibration, noises and wear problems in the rotary compressor, therefore, with the requirement of higher reliability, {{it is important to}} obtain it exactly in compressor design. Various forces that the crankshaft suffers were calculated by theoretical analysis in the operation process of the compressor. And based on the finite element method (FEM), the deflection of the crankshaft was obtained by simulation in the rotary compressor. And then the measurements were performed concerning the orbit of the top dead centre of the crankshaft with non-contacting displacement sensors in the compressor. In comparison with the tests, the validity of the calculation method was verified. It was found that the results of calculation were good agreement with the tests’. In addition, several factors which affect the deflection of the crankshaft were analyzed with the FEM, and the influences of <b>flange</b> height, <b>shaft</b> diameter, mechanical air gap in the motor, rotor weight on the deflection were found distinctly, which as a primary theoretical basis is provided for the compressor design...|$|R

50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed spindle. A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle <b>shaft</b> <b>flange</b> is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{line shaft}} would be {{suspended}} from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area. One pulley on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building. The other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts. In manufacturing where there were {{a large number of}} machines performing the same tasks, the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated. In other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements, the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes. Shafts were usually horizontal and overhead but occasionally were vertical and could be underground. Shafts were usually rigid steel, made up of several parts bolted together at <b>flanges.</b> The <b>shafts</b> were suspended by hangers with bearings at certain intervals of length. The distance depended on the weight of the shaft and the number of pulleys. The shafts had to be kept aligned or the stress would overheat the bearings and could break the shaft. The bearings were usually friction type and had to be kept lubricated. Pulley lubricator employees were required {{in order to ensure that}} the bearings did not freeze or malfunction.|$|R

40|$|Proper {{alignment}} of rotating device has long ago {{been identified as}} a pre-requisite to safe and reliable uses. Loud noise levels, frequently vibrating floors, fiasco of bearings and lubrication system are the types of machine breakage that are the results of the shaft misalignment. To get efficient torque and hence power transfer, shaft alignment plays a crucial role like while connecting to a motor and pump in any kind of industrial usage. Achieving proper alignment involves far more than merely setting the machines so that the shafts remain coaxial. This involves the designing and implementation of devices and of the apparatus into which the equipment is integrated. Here, first we have worked on the importance as well as methods of the alignment and various type of misalignments and measuring it with several tools. To replicate the motor-pump setting, an experimental set up is constructed in a driver and a driven motor which are connected with each other by <b>flange</b> coupling. Proper <b>shaft</b> alignment is done with the help of different alignment devices and readings leading us to the efficiency of power transfe...|$|R

It is essential that strength of Drum Assembly which is composed of spin drum, <b>shaft,</b> <b>flange</b> is improved to attain that target. In term of spin drum, {{it is difficult to}} realize joint strength required at high speed operation because joint strength of mechanical press-joining method is low remarkably in comparison with welding. Also in case of shaft system, stress from bending and twisting are complexly loaded onto the shaft supporting the horizontal drum, causing problems in fracture strength and fatigue life.

40|$|Misalignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of {{rotating}} machinery having couplings between the shafts. Ideal alignment is a chimera and the coupling <b>flanges</b> of the <b>shafts</b> are never ideally aligned, presenting angular and/or parallel misalignment (defined also as radial misalignment or offset). In particular, during the shaft rotation, if coupling misalignment between the shafts of a statically aligned line is excessive, a periodical change, of the load on the bearings in hyperstatic shaft-lines, occurs. If the rotating machine is equipped with oil-film bearings, the change of the loads on the bearings causes also the variation of their oil-film dynamic characteristics, i. e. damping and stiffness, and the complete system cannot be considered as linear. In the paper, this phenomenon is modelled accurately and analyzed by considering the simulated response of a misaligned rotor train in the time domain. A finite element model is used for the hyperstatic rotor, while bearing characteristics are calculated by integrating Reynolds equation (considering the actual type and dimensions of the bearings) as a function of the instantaneous load acting on the bearings, caused by the coupling misalignment. Nonlinear effects are highlighted and the spectral components of system response are analyzed, in order to give pertinent diagnostic information...|$|R
40|$|Coupling is a {{mechanical}} component used for transmitting power from one shaft to another shaft rotating at particular RPM {{at a long}} distance. In <b>flange</b> coupling two <b>shafts</b> are connected together at their ends {{with the help of}} flanges for transmitting power.

Today every manufacturing industry has a challenge to increase the strength to weight ratio of the component. In the project our objective is to decrease the weight of flange coupling. For this, composite material aluminium silicon carbide is used for the flange which is light in weight and good thermal and mechanical properties. In the project we used Finite Element Analysis method to optimize the flange coupling design. In the work design of flange coupling is made by using CATIA V 5 design software and static structural analysis is carried out in ANSYS workbench software and the stress and deformation was calculated. The Finite Element Analysis results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage.

40|$|Volvo Construction Equipment’s {{driveline}} {{development department}} initiated this thesis work. It {{was calculated for}} two students working for 20 week period of time, which equals 30 hp each. The reason for Volvo CE to start the cooperation was {{the large number of}} variance of companion <b>flanges</b> and propeller <b>shafts</b> generating additional work for several departments within Volvo. The problem statement consisted of questions, which should result in information about the number of variants and combinations of propeller <b>shafts</b> and companion <b>flanges</b> used; the reason for the quantity of variants and what factors are affecting the choice of propeller <b>shafts</b> and companion <b>flanges.</b> They should also give answers to how article reduction can be implemented and what recommendations can be given to Volvo for the future. Using a Gantt chart as a planning tool helped the working process to progress in a structured way. Different methods of data collection were done to secure the problem understanding. Tools such as a literature review, function diagrams, and interviews were used to complete the data collection. Co-workers from the purchasing department and the part number reduction team were interviewed. Besides the in-house contact an opportunity was given to interview the suppliers during visits at their factories. Computer software was used as a resource of confirming information and mapping currently used components. The mapping process resulted in interesting findings, which were further researched. Together with the information from the interviews, reasons for the variety of used components were clarified. To deepen the problem understanding a more detailed variation mapping was made, showing what driveline components were generating most variants of companion flanges. The findings made and the recommendations received from the suppliers were unitized in a best case scenario. The questions from the problem statement were analyzed and answered. The recommendations given regarding to Volvo Construction Equipment’s propeller shaft program included guidelines for modularization. The success of modularization is based on among other factors, on particular documentation, continuous communication and close cooperation with the suppliers. This report can be defined as the first step towards a modularized propeller shaft program for Volvo CE’s haulers and wheel loaders...|$|R
