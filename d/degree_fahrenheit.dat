5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

The typical temperature in this area during the winter is around 25 <b>degrees</b> <b>Fahrenheit.</b> The Canadian Maritimes have seasons very similar to the New England areas. New Brunswick has cold winters ranging from approximately 19-31 <b>degrees</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> and hot summers with temperatures from 72-77 <b>degrees</b> <b>Fahrenheit.</b> Prince Edward Island has a climate similar to New Brunswick with temperatures ranging from 46-71 <b>degrees</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> in the summer and 11-26 <b>degrees</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> in the winter.

25|$|Two of the {{earliest}} such units of measure to come into use were the horsepower and the <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit.</b> The horsepower was defined by James Watt in 1782 as the power required to raise 33,000 pounds of water through a height of one foot in one minute and the <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> was first defined by Daniel Fahrenheit in about 1713 as being a temperature scale having its lower calibration point (0°F) at temperature where a supersaturated salt/ice mixture froze and its upper calibration point at body temperature (96°F). In 1777 the Royal Society, under the chairmanship of Henry Cavendish, proposed {{the definition of the}} Fahrenheit scale be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32°F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212°F.|$|E
25|$|The British {{thermal unit}} (Btu) {{is defined as}} the heat needed to raise the {{temperature}} of one pound of water by one <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit.</b> It was in use before 1859 as a unit of heat based on imperial units rather than the metric units used by the French—Clément-Desormes having defined the calorie in terms of the kilogram and degrees centigrade in 1824.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} and measurements with his electric motor led Joule {{to estimate the}} mechanical equivalent of heat as 4.1868 joules per calorie of work to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit.</b> He announced his results {{at a meeting of}} the chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Cork in August 1843 and was met by silence.|$|E

25|$|The International System of Units {{specifies}} {{a particular}} scale for thermodynamic temperature. It uses the kelvin scale for measurement and selects the triple point {{of water at}} 273.16K as the fundamental fixing point. Other scales have been in use historically. The Rankine scale, using the <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> as its unit interval, is still in use {{as part of the}} English Engineering Units in the United States in some engineering fields. ITS-90 gives a practical means of estimating the thermodynamic temperature to a very high degree of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Clay is dug {{from the}} ground, checked for {{impurities}} {{and placed on}} the wheel to be molded. Once the potter gets the shape he desires, the potter stops the wheel, allowing the access water to run of. The artist then spins it again to ensure the water is off then it is placed in a kiln. The kiln was usually a pit dug {{in the ground and}} heated by fire; these were estimated to reach a temperature of 950 degree Celsius (1,742 <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit).</b> Later kilns were built above ground to be easier to maintain and ventilate. During the firing of the pottery, artists went through a three-phase firing in order to achieve the right colour (further reading).|$|E
25|$|Large, {{explosive}} {{volcanic eruptions}} inject water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) {{into the stratosphere}} to heights of 16–32 kilometres (10–20nbsp&mi) above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols. The SO2 emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact. The aerosols increase the Earth's albedo—its reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space—and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Several eruptions during the past century have caused {{a decline in the}} average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a <b>degree</b> (<b>Fahrenheit</b> scale) for periods of one to three years; sulfur dioxide from the eruption of Huaynaputina probably caused the Russian famine of 1601–1603.|$|E

500|$|Electricity and gas {{companies}} rely on weather forecasts {{to anticipate}} demand, {{which can be}} strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating (heating degree day) or cooling (cooling degree day). These quantities {{are based on a}} daily average temperature of [...] Cooler temperatures force heating degree days (one per <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit),</b> while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days. In winter, severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as people turn up their heating. Similarly, in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather. By anticipating a surge in demand, utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases, or in some circumstances, supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts.|$|E

6000|$|Observations {{bearing on}} {{the second of the}} three points have been made by Becquerel in France, by La Cour in Jutland and Iceland, and by Rivoli at Posen. The results are {{perfectly}} congruous. Becquerel's observations[51] were made under wood, and about a hundred yards outside in open ground, at three stations in the district of Montargis, Loiret. There was a difference of more than one <b>degree</b> <b>Fahrenheit</b> between the mean annual temperatures in favour of the open ground. The mean summer temperature in the wood was from two to three degrees lower than the mean summer temperature outside.

As far as regards the mean winter temperatures, there is an excess in favour of the forest, but so trifling in amount as to be unworthy of much consideration. Libri found that the minimum winter temperatures were not sensibly lower at Florence, after the Apennines had been denuded of forest, than they had been before.[53] The disheartening contradictoriness of his observations on this subject led Herr Rivoli to the following ingenious and satisfactory comparison.[54] Arranging his results according to the wind that blew on the day of observation, he set against each other the variation of the temperature under wood from that without, and the variation of the temperature of the wind from the local mean for the month:-- ...|$|E
