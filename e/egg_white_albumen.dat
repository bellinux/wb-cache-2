40|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> foam, <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or electric mixer) until they become frothy.

When the <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are beaten, air is added and the <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> protein, <b>albumen,</b> is denatured.

5000|$|Ovotransferrin (conalbumin) is a {{glycoprotein}} of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>albumen.</b> <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> <b>albumen</b> {{is composed}} of multiple proteins and ovotransferrin is the most heat reliable protein of them all. It has a molecular weight of 76,000 daltons and contains about 700 amino acids. Ovotransferrin makes up approximately 13% of egg albumen (in contrast to ovalbumin, which comprises 54%). As {{a member of the}} transferrin and metalloproteinase family, ovotransferrin has been found to produce heat shock proteins. When these heat shock proteins are induced in the skin, they provide protection against cold stress and other environmental stresses. Ovotransferrin is folded in a way that forms two lobes (N- and C- terminals) and each lobe consists of a binding site. Each lobe is then divided into two domains of 160 amino acid residues. Its structure also consists of fifteen disulfide crosslinks and no free sulfhydryl groups. Disulfide groups stabilize the tertiary structures of proteins. Transferrins, are iron binding proteins and acute phase reactants of animal serum. It has a binding log of 15 at a pH of 7 or above, meaning that the iron binding capacity of ovotransferrin rapidly decreased at a pH that is less than 6. This family is also known for their role in cell maturation by transporting essential nutrients to developing embryos. [...] Ovotransferrin functions as an antimicrobial agent and transports iron to the developing embryo. Because they bind to iron, this makes it difficult for harmful bacteria to be nutritionally satisfied with them so it acts as an antimicrobial.|$|E

50|$|In the Philippines, balut eaters prefer salt or a chili, {{garlic and}} vinegar (white or coconut sap) mixture to season their eggs. The eggs are savored for their balance of textures and flavors; the broth {{surrounding}} the embryo is sipped from the egg before the shell is peeled, and the yolk and young chick inside can be eaten.

In Vietnam, balut are eaten with a pinch of salt, lemon juice, plus ground pepper or ginger and Vietnamese mint leaves called rau răm.

50|$|The {{bird egg}} is a fertilized gamete (or, {{in the case}} of some birds, such as chickens, {{possibly}} unfertilized) located on the yolk surface and surrounded by <b>albumen,</b> or <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> The <b>albumen</b> in turn is surrounded by two shell membranes (inner and outer membranes) and then the eggshell. The chicken eggshell is 95-97% calcium carbonate crystals, which are stabilized by a protein matrix. Without the protein, the crystal structure would be too brittle to keep its form and the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Eggshell formation requires gram amounts of calcium being deposited within hours, which must be supplied via the hen’s diet.|$|R
