25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> to form an amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> the resin in the {{composite}} softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding Tg then exerts mechanical overload {{on the board}} components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require high Tg matrix.|$|E

25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} microstructural {{feature of}} a polymer is its architecture and shape, which {{relates to the}} way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain {{with one or more}} substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the atomic}} {{structure}} of glass shares {{characteristics of the}} structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature.</b> A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, {{and in some cases}} will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.|$|E

25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E
25|$|When block {{copolymer}} micelles don't display the characteristic relaxation processes of surfactant micelles, these are called kinetically frozen micelles. These {{can be achieved}} in two ways: when the unimers forming the micelles are not soluble in the solvent of the micelle solution, or if the core forming blocks are glassy at the temperature in which the micelles are found. Kinetically frozen micelles are formed when either of these conditions is met. A special example in which both of these conditions are valid is that of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide). This {{block copolymer}} {{is characterized by the}} high hydrophobicity of the core forming block, PS, which causes the unimers to be insoluble in water. Moreover, PS has a high <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> which is, depending on the molecular weight, higher than room temperature. Thanks to these two characteristics, a water solution of PS-PEO micelles of sufficiently high molecular weight can be considered kinetically frozen. This means that none of the relaxation processes, which would drive the micelle solution towards thermodynamic equilibrium, are possible. Pioneering work on these micelles was done by Adi Eisenberg. It was also shown how the lack of relaxation processes allowed great freedom in the possible morphologies formed. Moreover, the stability against dilution and vast range of morphologies of kinetically frozen micelles make them particularly interesting, for example, for the development of long circulating drug delivery nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the <b>glass</b> <b>transition</b> <b>temperature</b> and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
