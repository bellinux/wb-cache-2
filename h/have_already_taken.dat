5|$|Greek mythology {{culminates in}} the Trojan War, fought between Greece and Troy, and its aftermath. In Homer's works, {{such as the}} Iliad, the chief stories <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> shape and substance, and {{individual}} themes were elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The Trojan War also elicited great interest in the Roman culture because {{of the story of}} Aeneas, a Trojan hero whose journey from Troy led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid (Book II of Virgil's Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy). Finally there are two pseudo-chronicles written in Latin that passed under the names of Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptians {{took time}} to regroup for a final assault on the villages inner defenses, {{bringing}} reinforcements. During this reprieve, the defenders repaired the mortars and PIAT that were damaged by the flood and the dust, and {{made a series of}} raids on Egypt-held structures. At 14:00, the Egyptians counterattacked but were met with heavy fire and took many casualties. This prompted the Israelis to move their only working communications device to a safer location, but it broke down, and contact with the brigade HQ was only restored at 16:00. At 17:00, the villagers again reported that their situation was critical, and that an attempted counterattack failed. The Negev Brigade intelligence officer, David Niv, intercepted an Egyptian radio message where the commander of the assault claimed to <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> the village.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 an {{election}} promise by Viktor Yanukovych (leader of the Party of Regions) to adopt Russian {{as the second}} official language might also have increased the turnout of his base, but it was rebutted during the campaign by his opponent (Viktor Yushchenko), who pointed out that Yanukovych could <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> steps towards this change {{while he was a}} Prime Minister of Ukraine if this had really been his priority. During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities. Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{highlights}} India's inefficient energy consumption and mentions the dramatic under-representation of these {{economies in the}} global capital markets. The report also emphasizes the enormous populations that exist within the BRIC nations, which makes it relatively easy for their aggregate wealth to eclipse the G6, while per-capita income levels remain far below the norm of today's industrialized countries. This phenomenon, too, will affect world markets as multinational corporations will attempt {{to take advantage of}} the enormous potential markets in the BRICs by producing, for example, far cheaper automobiles and other manufactured goods affordable to the consumers within the BRICs in lieu of the luxury models that currently bring the most income to automobile manufacturers. India and China have already started making their presence felt in the service and manufacturing sector respectively in the global arena. Developed economies of the world <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> serious note of this fact.|$|E

25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken.</b> Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2006, Colin Gleadell, {{writing in}} The Telegraph, {{noted that the}} Stuckist's first {{exhibition}} in central London had brought [...] "multiple sales" [...] for leading artists of the movement, and that this {{raised the question of}} how good they were at painting. He observed that [...] "Whatever the critics may say, buyers from the UK, the US and Japan <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> a punt. Six of Thomson's paintings have sold for between £4,000 and £5,000 each. Joe Machine, a former jailbird who paints for therapeutic reasons, has also sold six paintings for the same price." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} heavily self-referential and {{contains}} {{a number of}} meta-references.

[...] In another scene later in the episode, when Lisa points out to Marge that Marge is showing signs of gambling problems, Comic Book Guy shows up again wearing a T-shirt that says [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] and tells Lisa: [...] "Hey, I'm watching you!"

500|$|The same spring, on 12 May 1787, {{the still}} {{hesitant}} Wilberforce held {{a conversation with}} William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt's estate in Kent. Under {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Wilberforce Oak" [...] at Holwood, Pitt challenged his friend: [...] "Wilberforce, why don't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade? You <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> great pains to collect evidence, and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you. Do not lose time, or the ground will be occupied by another." [...] Wilberforce's response is not recorded, but he later declared in old age that he could [...] "distinctly remember the very knoll on which I was sitting near Pitt and Grenville" [...] where he made his decision.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{temple of}} Aphrodite was so rich that it {{employed}} {{more than a}} thousand hetairas, whom both men and women had given to the goddess. Many people visited the town on account of them, and thus these hetairas contributed to the riches of the town: for the ship captains frivolously spent their money there, hence the saying: 'The voyage to Corinth is not for every man'. (The story goes of a hetaira being reproached by a woman for not loving her job and not touching wool, and answering her: 'However you may behold me, yet in this short time I <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> down three pieces'.)" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June, Montgomery ordered Bradley to take Cherbourg {{while the}} British {{were to take}} Caen by 23 June. In Operation Epsom, the British VII Corps {{commanded}} by Sir Richard O'Connor attempted to outflank Caen from the west by breaking through the dividing line between the Panzer Lehr and the 12th SS to take the strategic Hill 112. Epsom began well with O'Connor's assault force, the British 15th Scottish Division breaking through and with the 11th Armoured Division stopping the counter-attacks of the 12th SS Division. General Friedrich Dollmann of the 7th Army had to commit the newly arrived II SS Corps to stop the British offensive. Dollmann, fearing that Epsom would be a success, committed suicide {{and was replaced by}} SS Oberstegruppenführer Paul Hausser. O'Connor, at the cost of about 4,000 men, had won a salient [...] deep and [...] wide but placed the Germans into an unviable long-term position. There was a strong sense of crisis in the Allied command as the Allies had advanced only about [...] inland, at a time when their plans called for them to <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> Rennes, Alençon and St. Malo. After Epsom, Montgomery had to tell General Harry Crerar that the activation of the First Canadian Army would have to wait as there was room at present in the Caen sector only for the newly arrived XII Corps under General Neil Ritchie, which caused some tension with Crerar who was anxious to get into the field. Epsom had forced further German forces into Caen but all through June and the first half of July Rommel, Rundstedt and Hitler were engaged in planning for a great offensive to drive the British into the sea; it was never launched and would have required the commitment {{of a large number of}} German forces to the Caen sector).|$|E
