Players may transform at any time after the letter [...] "B" [...] appears in the [...] "Beast Indicator" [...] below the players' life <b>energy</b> <b>indicators.</b> The Beast Indicator appears blue when storing the energy needed for transforming. When the Beast Indicator is fully charged, the word [...] "BEAST" [...] appears, and the player can activate Beast Mode by pressing a certain button. During Beast Mode, the amount of fighting moves available to the character increases, the character becomes heavier, 3% of the character's life energy recovers and the character's jumping ability increases. While in Beast Mode, the Beast Indicator turns yellow. The yellow area decreases according to damage sustained by the character. The yellow area does not recharge during the current round. When the yellow area completely depletes, the Beast Mode will negate when the character is hit by an effective technique from the opponent.|$|E

Many different <b>energy</b> use <b>indicators</b> are used in LCA studies, accounting for energy use in different ways. Often, however, the choice behind which <b>energy</b> use <b>indicator</b> is applied is poorly described and motivated. To contribute to a more purposeful selection of <b>energy</b> use <b>indicators</b> and to ensure consistent and transparent reporting of energy use in LCA, a general framework for <b>energy</b> use <b>indicator</b> construction and reporting in LCA studies will be presented in this article. The framework differentiates between 1) renewable and nonrenewable energies, 2) primary and secondary energies, and 3) energy intended for energy purposes versus energy intended for material purposes. This framework is described both graphically and mathematically. Furthermore, the framework is illustrated through application {{to a number of}} <b>energy</b> use <b>indicators</b> that are frequently used in LCA studies: cumulative energy demand (CED), nonrenewable cumulative energy demand (NRCED), fossil energy use (FEU), primary fossil energy use (PFEU), and secondary energy use (SEU).

It seeks to contribute to the strategies necessary to preserve the supply-demand balance of Turkey. For this purpose, two different models were used to train the ANN approach. In Model 1, main <b>energy</b> <b>indicators</b> such as total production of primary energy per capita, total gross electricity generation per capita and final energy consumption per capita were used in the input layer of the ANN while sectoral energy consumption per capita was used in Model 2.
