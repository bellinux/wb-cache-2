50|$|A hair <b>dryer,</b> hairdryer or <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> is an {{electromechanical}} device designed to blow normal or hot air over damp hair {{to accelerate the}} evaporation of water particles and dry the hair. <b>Blow</b> <b>dryers</b> allow better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds inside each strand. These hydrogen bonds are powerful (allowing for stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair.|$|R
50|$|Hairstyles using <b>blow</b> <b>dryers</b> {{usually have}} volume and discipline, {{which can be}} further {{improved}} {{by the use of}} styling products and hairbrushes during drying to add tension, hold and lift.|$|R

5000|$|After being {{frustrated}} with the product and tool choices available, Webb (along {{with the help of}} Board member and investor Janet Gurwitch) developed a line specifically for Drybar and blowouts. In 2013, after testing the line in about 70 Sephora locations, Drybar then went ahead with 300+ Sephora shops and QVC to launch their line of products. [...] These products range from brushes to a <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> to hair accessories to various spritzes, sprays, and creams. [...] These products are for home usage in order to lengthen the life of a Drybar blowout or for customers to achieve the look on their own. Buttercup, the official <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> used at Drybar, is the Drybar mascot and is sold for at-home use.|$|R

Too much heat can cause damage to the hair. Adding some rinse-free or leave-in hair conditioner could help moisturizing hair while using hair dryer to heat.|$|R
5000|$|Body {{cathexis}} drives multiple behaviors, such as clothing {{choices and}} weight management, and cosmetics purchases. Studies {{show that people}} are more satisfied with their hair and eyes than their waists. [...] Consumers who were more satisfied with their bodies were more frequent users of such preening products as hair conditioner, <b>blow</b> <b>dryers,</b> cologne, facial bronzer, tooth polish and pumice soap.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a similar}} vein, asset-numbering labels on {{corporate}} equipment (PCs and the like) are often designed to leave an imprint {{of either the}} serial number, or the word [...] "VOID" [...] if the label is peeled off. However, this can easily be defeated by warming up the label using a <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> {{so it will be}} more flexible and forgiving to removal (and reapplication).|$|R
25|$|The washlet {{can replace}} toilet paper completely, but many users opt to use both wash and paper in combination—although use of paper {{may be omitted}} for {{cleaning}} of the vulva. Some wipe before washing, some wash before wiping, some wash only, and some wipe only—each according to his/her preference. Another frequent feature is a <b>blow</b> <b>dryer,</b> often adjustable between 40°C and 60°C, used to dry the washed areas.|$|R

50|$|The next {{ingredient}} used is polymer or resin. Polymers are {{the most}} effective and important component of hair mousse, which acts as a conditioning agent. These resins are long chain molecules that form a film on the hair allowing a tighter grip on the hair strands, making it harder to brush off and form a resistant film. This allows users to comb or brush their hair, as well as apply heat from a <b>blow</b> <b>dryer</b> without the mousse leaving the hair stiff.|$|R

Known as [...] "Airdry The Electric Towel", these units were used in restrooms, barbershops and factories. Airdry Corporation moved to Chicago and San Francisco in 1924 to centralize their distribution.|$|R
