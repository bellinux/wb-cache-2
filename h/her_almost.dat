25|$|If Mary {{really does}} know {{everything}} physical {{there is to}} know about the experience of color, then this effectively grants <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> omniscient powers of knowledge. Using this, she will be able to deduce her own reaction, and figure out exactly what the experience of seeing red will feel like.|$|E
25|$|Devastated after Shelley's death, Mary {{returned}} to England. She paid for Clairmont {{to travel to}} her brother's home in Vienna where she stayed for a year, before relocating to Russia, where {{she worked as a}} governess from 1825 to 1828. The people she worked for treated <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> {{as a member of the}} family. Still, what Clairmont longed for most of all was privacy and peace and quiet, as she complained in letters to Mary Shelley.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{precisely}} why I {{want you to}} stop. And <b>her</b> cousin, <b>almost</b> <b>her</b> brother: what an idea that it won't do! Haven't you stayed here before when {{there has been no}} one?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her brother {{stared at}} <b>her</b> and <b>almost</b> gasped with astonishment.|$|R

25|$|HMS Flirt was {{launched}} in 1782 but was completed too late to see any significant service in the American War of Independence. She then {{spent most of the}} years of peace in British waters. She sailed to Jamaica in 1791, but was laid up in Deptford in November 1792, and did not return to service before being sold in 1795. Daniel Bennett purchased her, had <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> rebuilt, and then employed her as a whaler in the South seas Fisheries. A French privateer captured her in 1803 as Flirt was returning to Britain from a whaling voyage.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, {{determined}} {{to get rid of}} his wife, Grand Duke Nicholas expelled Alexandra from the Nicholas Palace publicly accusing her of infidelity with her confessor Vasily Lebedev. Grand Duchess Alexandra, leaving behind her jewelry, clothes and possessions, had to move to her parents' house. The same year, Alexandra suffered a carriage accident which left <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> completely paralyzed. She could move neither her legs nor her right arm. Alexandra asked her brother-in-law, Tsar Alexander II, for help. Appalled by the scandal, Alexander II was not sympathetic towards Alexandra and instead made her leave Russia indefinitely to look for medical treatment abroad. Alexander II himself paid for the trip expenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} lack of linguistic information on Genie from the previous six months left some ambiguities about the rate and timeline of Genie's early vocabulary and grammar acquisition. Curtiss and Fromkin quickly decided that Genie's linguistic abilities were not yet at a usefully testable level, so {{for the rest of}} Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> every day for observations. They soon realized existing linguistic tests would not yield meaningful results, so although they also incorporated a few existing tests, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, into their exams, they designed a set of 26 new tests from which they extrapolated most of their data. Curtiss also wrote down every spontaneous utterance she heard from Genie, ultimately recording approximately a few thousand.|$|E
60|$|The old man {{regarded}} <b>her</b> curiously; <b>almost</b> suspiciously, Patsy thought.|$|R
60|$|He {{clutched}} <b>her</b> hands <b>almost</b> roughly {{and raised}} {{them to his}} lips.|$|R
60|$|At {{the jail}} door Helen's self-consciousness {{increased}} mightily. <b>Her</b> resolution <b>almost</b> failed <b>her.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the {{complete}} collapse of her marriage, Alexandra lived {{separated from her}} husband who expelled her from their household in 1879. A carriage accident left <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> completely paralyzed and, in November 1880, Alexandra went abroad to improve her health, compelled by her brother-in-law Tsar Alexander II. The following year, she asked her nephew, Tsar Alexander III, {{to allow her to}} return to Russia and she settled in Kiev. She recovered her mobility and, in 1889, she founded the Pokrov of Our Lady Monastery, a convent of nursing nuns with its own hospital, to provide free treatment for the poor. She dedicated {{the rest of her life}} to the work at the hospital. In 1889, she became an Orthodox nun under the name Anastasia. She died at the convent in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Bayern is a bay ridgling bred in Kentucky by Helen Alexander. His sire, Offlee Wild was a {{successful}} racehorse whose wins included the Massachusetts Handicap in 2004 (beating Funny Cide) and the Suburban Handicap in 2005. Before Bayern, {{the best of his}} progeny was Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner She Be Wild. As of 2014, Offlee Wild stands at the Pin Oak Lane Farm in Pennsylvania. Bayern's dam Alittlebitearly was, as her name suggests, born prematurely on December 14, 2002, which made <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> useless for racing purposes. The age of a Thoroughbred racehorse advances by one year on January 1, meaning that Alittlebitearly officially became a yearling when less than a month old and, if raced, would have had to compete on level terms with horses who could be up to 11 months older.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, {{during a}} seven-month visit to England, he was {{appointed}} conductor at the London Drury Lane Theatre by its then-musical director, the popular French musician Louis Antoine Jullien. He was impressed with its quality when he first heard the orchestra perform at a promenade concert. In London he also learned that he knew far more English than he had supposed, although still did not understand half of what was said in conversation. He began writing his Mémoires. During his stay in England, the February Revolution broke out in France. Berlioz arrived back in France in 1848, only to be informed {{that his father had}} died shortly after his return. He went back to his birthplace to mourn his father along with his sisters. Meanwhile, Harriet's health was declining due to alcohol abuse and she suffered a series of strokes that left her an invalid. Berlioz paid for four servants to look after her on a permanent basis and visited <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> daily. He began composition of his Te Deum.|$|E
60|$|Even at that moment, with <b>her</b> heart <b>almost</b> breaking, Nell's fair face flushed.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>her</b> questioningly, <b>almost</b> fiercely. <b>Her</b> words, however, seemed spoken without intent.|$|R
60|$|It was Maggie who answered. Her {{tone was}} lifeless, but <b>her</b> manner <b>almost</b> composed.|$|R
500|$|Glasgow fought {{almost an}} entirely {{separate}} battle as the German armoured cruisers ignored <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> completely and she inconclusively dueled the light cruisers [...] and [...] Glasgow broke {{contact with the}} German squadron at 20:05 and discovered Monmouth, listing and down by the bow, having extinguished her fires, 10 minutes later. She was trying to turn north to put her stern to the heavy northerly swell and was taking water at the bow. There was little that Glasgow could do to assist the larger ship as the moonlight illuminated both ships and the Germans were searching for them.|$|E
500|$|Howard Gordon, the {{executive}} producer of 24, said that, during character development, they [...] "wanted an actress that had the strength and intelligence to be a first lady, yet have the unpredictability of never knowing when she might snap." [...] Jean Smart was their first choice. [...] Smart later told The New York Times that she decided she was eager to play the role after reading the character's introductory scene, and commented that in <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> 30years of acting she had come across few roles that offered the possibilities that this one did: a character that is sexy, mysterious, and powerful, yet is mentally unstable and has lost her trust and respect for her husband.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Fuji class was derived {{from that of the}} British s, albeit about [...] smaller. The Fuji-class ships {{improved}} on the Royal Sovereigns in several ways; they were about [...] faster, they incorporated superior Harvey armour, and their guns, although smaller and lighter, were the same as those of the later [...] and were protected by armoured hoods (gun turrets). The two ships of the class were almost identical even though they were designed by two different naval architects, Yashima by Philip Watts and Fuji by George C. Mackrow. The primary difference was that Yashima had her deadwood cut away aft and was fitted with a balanced rudder. This made <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> a knot faster than her sister and gave her a smaller turning circle at the cost of a weaker stern that required careful attention when drydocked lest it sag.|$|E
60|$|The dazed girl {{sat up in}} bed and listened, while <b>her</b> heart <b>almost</b> stood still.|$|R
25|$|About sixty Carmelite convents were reopened in France during <b>her</b> lifetime, <b>almost</b> {{all with}} <b>her</b> support.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> grey, <b>almost</b> sardonic eyes rested all {{the while}} on Ursula, as if summing her up.|$|R
500|$|Lee had to {{work through}} the issue of how to write Anna's personality, in that some of her colleagues felt Anna should be more {{dysfunctional}} and co-dependent, like Vanellope von Schweetz in Wreck-It Ralph. Lee disagreed with that position, but it took <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> a year {{to figure out how to}} convincingly articulate [...] "this is what Anna's journey is. No more than that. No less than that." [...] In the end, Lee successfully argued Anna's journey should be presented as a simple coming-of-age story, [...] "where she goes from having a naive view of life and love– because she's lonely– to the most sophisticated and mature view of love, where she's capable of the ultimate love, which is sacrifice." [...] Lee also had to let go of some ideas that she liked, such as a scene portraying Anna and Elsa's relationship as teenagers, which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between Anna and Elsa.|$|E
500|$|Robert the Wise, King of Naples, died on 20 January 1343. In his testament, he {{declared}} his granddaughter, Joanna I, his sole heir, excluding Louis's younger brother, Andrew, Joanna's husband, from becoming co-ruler. Louis {{and his mother}} regarded this as an infringement of a previous agreement between the late kings of Naples and Hungary. He visited his bride's father, Charles of Moravia, in Prague {{to persuade him to}} intervene on Andrew's behalf with Charles's former tutor, Pope Clement VI, the overlord of the Kingdom of Naples. Louis also sent envoys to his Neapolitan relatives and the high officials of the kingdom, urging them to promote his brother's interests. Their mother, Elizabeth, left for Naples in the summer, taking with <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> the whole royal treasure, including more than [...] of silver and [...] of gold. During her seven-month-long stay in Italy, she was only able to persuade her daughter-in-law and the pope to promise that Andrew would be crowned as Joanna's husband.|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> {{every day in the}} studio. I wish she was still here. She was jazz to her core". The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E
50|$|Aeka {{has been}} {{struggling}} with problems, initiated usually by Kyoka. Most {{of the people around}} her taunt <b>her</b> for <b>almost</b> <b>her</b> entire enrollment at Kouhei's school. The whole class tends to laugh at her or not hang out with her, even if they're not directly involved in bullying her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sinking of}} the Lusitania is mentioned; 1,198 people died with <b>her,</b> {{including}} <b>almost</b> a hundred children.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>her</b> body <b>almost</b> doesn’t move, we {{only see}} a severe, {{sometimes}} frightened, sometimes completely desperate-for-love face expression.|$|R
500|$|According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC, [...] "It's {{worth noting}} that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after <b>her,</b> <b>almost</b> all would be female singers... When The Beatles hit America, they changed the {{paradigm}} of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with {{an emphasis on the}} female." [...] Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, asserted that [...] "Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow... She certainly raised the standards of all of them... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers." [...] According to Fouz-Hernández, subsequent female singers such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, and Pink were like her [...] "daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her." [...] Madonna has also influenced male artists, inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians.|$|E
500|$|Upon her arrival, Marie {{was welcomed}} enthusiastically by the American people, with [...] "whistle of steamers, roar of guns in white smoke puffs against gray fog, voices cheering in a {{stinging}} rain". She was formally greeted by Jimmy Walker, the serving Mayor of New York City. Constance Lily Morris, author of On Tour with Queen Marie, {{wrote that the}} people were excited for Marie's arrival mainly because of <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> mythical allure, which had been created by papers and rumour throughout her life; she observed that [...] "the modest Queen of the Belgians [...] had once come with her king for a brief visit and years ago the dusky Hawaiian ruler had honored us, {{but there had been}} no others. The time could not have been better set." [...] Marie was also fairly popular within suffragette circles, where she was viewed as [...] "a woman whose wits had devised many a coup d'état, whose brains had thought out many a difficult problem for her people, who had used the gifts given her to further every good purpose".|$|E
500|$|When Adrien Dorval {{auditioned for}} his part on [...] "Kush", Kindler did not like his performance, but Wood did, as he {{believed}} the actor's performance was perfect for a character who was stranded on a plane. For the same episode, Sarah Strange and Thai-Hoa Lee {{had to learn how}} to speak Standard Tibetan phonetically a week in advance of filming. Katharine Isabelle guest starred in [...] "Nubbins" [...] as Sophie. While filming her scenes, Isabelle complained of a dry eye problem, which kept making <b>her</b> <b>almost</b> tear up. However, it ended up being beneficial for her portrayal of her character. Canadian actor Daryl Shuttleworth guest stars as a fight promoter in [...] "Warriors". During a readthrough of the script, Shuttleworth decided his character should speak with a British accent like in the film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The producers wanted to cast Rekha Sharma in [...] "Instinct" [...] as she appeared in several other Vancouver-based productions, including Battlestar Galactica. The producers felt she [...] "rocked" [...] her audition, as she brought a lot of energy to her character.|$|E
60|$|And now {{she would}} have thanked him for having saved her, but he cut <b>her</b> short <b>almost</b> roughly.|$|R
60|$|She {{answered}} him volubly, <b>almost</b> hysterically. <b>Her</b> manner was absolutely foreign. He listened to <b>her</b> protestations <b>almost</b> in bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|The words escaped <b>her</b> suddenly, <b>almost</b> {{frightening}} <b>her,</b> {{though all}} along {{she knew that}} she had meant to speak.|$|R
