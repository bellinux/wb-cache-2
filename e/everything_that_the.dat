The courts have taken a broad approach to this exception, and have shown a considerable amount of deference to the Government. For instance, in Public Prosecutor v.

Several accounts of the Bayonne entertainments survive. One spectacle, mounted on the Bidasoa river, is a particularly famous example of Catherine’s entertainments as ephemeral works of art. The entertainments began with a banquet on the Île d’Aguineau. As guests were ferried on decorated boats to the island, they passed, among other spectacles, Arion riding two dolphins, harpoonists spearing an artificial whale that spouted red wine, and six tritons sitting on a giant turtle, blowing conch shells. Charles IX was transported on a barge dressed {{to look like a}} floating fortress. The banquet was followed by a ballet of nymphs and satyrs.

500|$|The loss of New Orleans {{came as a}} {{tremendous}} shock to the Confederacy, and a spate of recriminations followed. Members of Congress, noting {{the failure of the}} ironclads, blamed the navy in particular, and suggested that {{there was no need for}} a separate Navy Department. Hoping to forestall such a proposal, Mallory was able to persuade the Congress instead to investigate the conduct of the department. Each house put five of its members on the investigating committee. The chairman, Senator Clement C. Clay, was known as one of Mallory's friends, as was Representative [...] Ethelbert Barksdale. They were at least partially balanced by Representative Henry S. Foote, a persistent critic of secession and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire Davis administration had done. Also weighing in against Mallory was Senator Charles M.

Not all of her health scares were brought on by hypochondria; in 1869, she had to cancel her trip to Balmoral Castle when she became ill at the railway station. In 1870, she was suffering from severe rheumatism and problems with her joints. In July 1871, she suffered from congestion in her lungs, an illness severe enough to appear in the Court Circular, which announced that her illness caused [...] "much anxiety to members of the royal family". In 1873, she was forced to recuperate in France as a result of illness, and in the 1880s she travelled to Germany to see an oculist for her eyes.|$|E
500|$|Karen Moore, a Paramount executive, {{suggested}} to Bennett that Nicholas Meyer, writer of The Seven-Per-Cent Solution {{and director of}} Time After Time, could help resolve the screenplay issues. Meyer had also never seen an episode of Star Trek.

To offset fan expectation that Spock would die, Meyer had the character [...] "killed" [...] in the Kobayashi Maru simulator in the opening scene. The effects company required a completed script in just 12 days. Meyer wrote the screenplay uncredited and for no pay before the deadline, surprising the actors and producers, and rapidly produced subsequent rewrites as necessary. One draft, for example, had a baby in Khan's group, who is killed with the others in the Genesis detonation. Meyer later said: ...|$|E

500|$|Sakanaction {{found that}} {{after moving to}} Tokyo, where the band stood in the Japanese music scene was a lot clearer to them.

The music the band created on Shin-shiro was a mix of <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band wanted to try musically, and an attempt to make a more [...] "colorful" [...] album inspired by both new wave and live performance-style arrangements. They increased the tempo on the songs for the album, and focused on the beat of each song more than whether each song was structurally a pop song or not. Consciously attempting to create an album with a more popular sound, Yamaguchi was anxious about how his works would be received, and felt that these anxieties expressed themselves more on the album.
