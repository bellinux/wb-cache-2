25|$|On day {{two of the}} inquiry, Major Cooper gave {{evidence}} in respect of the flight of the aircraft, {{based on interviews with}} between 100 and 150 witnesses. He stated that the final manoeuvring of the aircraft was consistent with the pilot experiencing engine trouble and attempting to return to Croydon Airport. He stated {{that it was impossible to}} state that the engine had suffered a partial failure due to the partial obstruction of the petrol pipe. In the week before the crash, the aircraft had been away from Croydon for six days, having landed at Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Ostend, Belgium and Lympne, Kent, before returning to Croydon on the morning of 24 December. No licensed engineer was available at any of the airports away from Croydon. On arrival at Croydon, the engine was reported to be running rough. Routine servicing was carried out and the oil tank drained and refilled with <b>fresh</b> <b>oil.</b> The engine had then been ground tested, including being run for 20 minutes. Major Cooper opined that further investigation should have been undertaken given the report of rough running. It was revealed that a chart recording engine speeds during a flight from Ostend to Lympne was available, but Major Cooper had chosen not to analyse it. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he would arrange for the document to be analysed to see if it would reveal any rough running in the engine. Evidence was given in respect of the petrol pipe. Major Cooper stated that it would not have been passed as fit for use in military aircraft, due to its construction. The inquiry was adjourned until 27 January.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, Al Jazeera {{reported}} that the gulf ecosystem was [...] "in crisis", citing a decline in seafood catches, as well as deformities and lesions found in fish. In Louisiana, 4.6 million pounds of oily material {{was removed from the}} beaches in 2013, over double the amount collected in 2012. Oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on 55 miles of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013. Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the Florida panhandle, where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand. Researchers looking at sediment, seawater, biota, and seafood found toxic compounds in high concentrations that they said was due to the added oil and dispersants. Although Gulf fisheries recovered in 2011, a 2014 study {{of the effects of the}} oil spill on bluefin tuna by researchers at Stanford University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, published in the journal Science, found that toxins released by the oil spill sent fish into cardiac arrest. The study found that even very low concentrations of crude oil can slow the pace of fish heartbeats. BP disputed the study, which was conducted as part of the federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment process required by the Oil Pollution Act. The study also found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than <b>fresh</b> <b>oil.</b> Another peer-reviewed study, released in March 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the United States and Australia and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs. BP responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the Gulf, but The New York Times {{reported that}} the BP statement was contradicted by the study.|$|E

50|$|Pączki are deep-fried {{pieces of}} dough shaped into {{flattened}} spheres {{and filled with}} confiture or other sweet filling. Pączki are usually covered with powdered sugar, icing, glaze or bits of dried orange zest. A small amount of grain alcohol (traditionally, Spiritus) {{is added to the}} dough before cooking; as it evaporates, it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough. The common opinion is that the ideal pączek is fluffy {{and at the same time}} a bit collapsed, with a bright stripe around - it is supposed to guarantee that the dough was fried in <b>fresh</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to monitoring oil contamination and wear metals, modern usage of OA includes {{the analysis of}} the additives in oils to determine if an extended drain interval may be used. Maintenance costs can be reduced using OA to determine the remaining useful life of additives in the oil. By comparing the OA results of new and used oil, a tribologist can determine when an oil must be replaced. Careful analysis might even allow the oil to be [...] "sweetened" [...] to its original additive levels by either adding <b>fresh</b> <b>oil</b> or replenishing additives that were depleted.|$|E
5000|$|Although, IP Standard {{test methods}} exist {{the more common}} methods for TBN are ASTM standardised, such as the {{potentiometric}} titration for fresh oils (Test method TBN ASTM D2896). A sample is typically dissolved in a pre-mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and acetic acid and titrated with standardised perchloric acid in glacial acetic acid for <b>fresh</b> <b>oil</b> samples. 2 The end point is detected using a glass electrode which is immersed in an aqueous solution containing the sample, and connected to a voltmeter/potentiometer. This causes an ion exchange in the outer solvated layer at the glass membrane, so a change in potential is generated which can be measured by the electrode. 5 When the end point of the chemical reaction is reached, which is shown by an inflection point on the titration curve using a specified detection system, the amount of titrant required is used to generate a result which is reported in milligrams of potassium hydroxide equivalent per gram of sample (mg of KOH/g).2Potentiometric titration for used oils (Test method TBN ASTM D4739): a sample is dissolved in a solvent mixture of Toluene/ Propan-2-ol /Chloroform with 0.5% deionised water and then titrated with standardised alcoholic hydrochloric acid. The detection system {{is equivalent to the}} <b>fresh</b> <b>oil</b> method. The used oil method uses a less polar solvent and weaker titrant, which will not dissolve the wear metals produced during operation, hence it is more suitable to analyse used oils. 6 ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{consumption}} of cooking oils may exacerbate some allergic diseases. In the present study, {{the effects of}} naturally oxidized olive oil on immediate- and/or delayed-type allergic reactions were investigated in BALB/c mice. Methods: Mouse models of 3 types of allergic reactions: contact hypersensitivity (CHS), active cutaneous anaphylaxis (ACA), and DNFB-induced hypersensitivity, were orally administered naturally oxidized olive oil that was obtained by keeping the oil {{at room temperature for}} more than 3 years. The effects of ultraviolet ray (UV) -irradiated olive oil and other dietary oils as well as their possible oxidation products on CHS were also investigated. Results: Naturally oxidized olive oil had a high peroxide value (POV) and exacerbated CHS, ACA, and DNFB-induced hypersensitivity in a POV-dependent manner. UV-irradiated olive oil, corn oil, sesame oil and triolein had high POVs, but almost the same acid value (AV) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) level as <b>fresh</b> <b>oils.</b> <b>Fresh</b> olive <b>oil</b> and the representative oxidation product with a high AV or TBARS level had no effect on CHS, whereas all UV-irradiated oils and naturally oxidized olive oil exacerbated it. Conclusions: Oxidized dietary oils that have high POVs exacerbated immediate- and/or delayed-type allergic reactions regardless of the different oil constituents or oxidation processes...|$|R
