5000|$|... It {{provides}} {{a method of}} controlled escape for gasoline vapors during the refueling process. It has a mechanism which closes the vent in the event the vehicle rolls over, to prevent spilling of VOCs or fuel in general. It also acts as a <b>fill</b> <b>limiter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The tanks have {{fittings}} for filling, liquid outlet, emergency {{relief of}} excess pressure, fuel level gauge {{and sometimes a}} vapour outlet. These may be separate valves mounted {{into a series of}} 3 to 5 holes in a plate welded into the tank shell, or may be assembled onto a multi-valve unit which is bolted into one large hole on a boss welded, {{or in the case of}} an aluminium tank, extruded as part of the tank shell.Modern fill valves are usually fitted with an automatic <b>fill</b> <b>limiter</b> (AFL) to prevent overfilling. The AFL has a float arm which restricts the flow significantly but does not shut it off entirely. This is intended to cause the pressure in the line to rise enough to tell the bowser to stop pumping but not cause dangerously high pressures. Before AFLs were introduced, it was common for the filler (with integral check valve) to be screwed directly into the tank, as the operator had to open an ullage valve at the tank while filling, allowing vapour out of the top of the tank and stopping filling when liquid started coming out of the ullage valve to indicate that the tank was full. Modern tanks are not fitted with ullage valves.|$|E
40|$|International audienceImpact {{limiting}} {{components of}} packages for {{the transport of}} radioactive materials are often designed as wood filled steel constructions. Wood absorbs {{major part of the}} impact energy in order to minimise the impact load acting upon the containment. Dynamic impact experiments with wood <b>filled</b> impact <b>limiters</b> showed different crushing mechanisms for axially loaded wood depending on their lateral constraint. Tests on spruce wood samples () were performed in order to clarify the influence of strain rate from static to 30 Â s on a) compression strength, b) stress at a global strain level of 50 %, and c) energy absorption capacity at 50 % deformation, including statistical evaluation of the results. Results were as follows: strain rate increase led to significantly higher compression strength, stress and strain energy at a strain level of 50 %. Lateral strain restriction had no effect on compression strength; it had a significant effect on stress and strain energy at strain level of 50 %. Therefore, the definition of a general yield curve for wood under large deformations is not possible, the yield curve has to be chosen taking into account lateral constraints...|$|R
