5|$|American policymakers, {{including}} Kennan and John Foster Dulles, {{acknowledged that}} the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas. The United States, acting through the CIA, funded {{a long list of}} projects to counter the communist appeal among <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> Europe and the developing world.

5|$|As Romania faced indecision {{about its}} future, the Corps {{was still the}} subject of unionist propaganda, spread by Romanian <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> the capitals of Entente nations. From his {{temporary}} home in France, Bocu reestablished România Mare as the tribune of Romanian diaspora politics and unionist aspirations. He was joined there by Octavian Goga, who had crossed over Bolshevik territory and Finland with false papers, claiming to be a Volunteer Corps veteran.|$|E

After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles.|$|E
5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation. The Church {{eventually became}} the dominant influence in Western civilisation {{into the modern}} age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E
5|$|His {{grouping}} {{lost much}} of its supporters to the newly formed National Peasants' Party, and scored under 2% in the 1927 elections. Around 1930, Averescu began opposing the universal suffrage he had endorsed earlier, and issued an appeal to the <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> order to have it discarded from legislation on the basis that it was easily influenced by the parties in power. He and his supporter, the pro-authoritarian poet Octavian Goga, received criticism from the left-wing Poporanist journal Viața Românească, who claimed that Averescu had in fact provoked and encouraged widespread electoral irregularities during his time in office.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 Rambhadradas {{established}} a religious {{and social service}} institution called Tulsi Peeth (The seat of Tulsi) in Chitrakoot, where, according to the Ramayana, Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile. As {{the founder of the}} seat, the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally, the Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon him by Sadhus and <b>intellectuals.</b> <b>In</b> the Tulsi Peeth, he arranged for a temple devoted to Rama and his consort Sita to be constructed, which is known as Kanch Mandir ("glass temple").|$|E

25|$|What {{is today}} broadly called Afrocentrism evolved {{out of the}} work of African-American <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the {{activism}} of African-American <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities.

25|$|Păunescu's {{visit to}} Chicago was {{followed}} by those of the nationalist official writer Eugen Barbu and by Eliade's friend Constantin Noica (who had since been released from jail). At the time, Eliade contemplated returning to Romania, but was eventually persuaded by fellow Romanian <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> exile (including Radio Free Europe's Virgil Ierunca and Monica Lovinescu) to reject Communist proposals. In 1977, he joined other exiled Romanian <b>intellectuals</b> <b>in</b> signing a telegram protesting the repressive measures newly enforced by the Ceauşescu regime. Writing in 2007, Romanian anthropologist Andrei Oișteanu recounted how, around 1984, the Securitate unsuccessfully pressured to become an agent of influence in Eliade's Chicago circle.|$|E
