500|$|Despite {{constant}} media attention, Mukerji remains guarded {{about her}} personal life. Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her {{interactions with the}} media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; {{she said in a}} 2011 interview, [...] "Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don't do that, then <b>I</b> <b>end</b> up being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable." [...] Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy. On 9 December 2015, she gave birth to their daughter, named Adira.|$|E

Amid the [...] "raw and unfinished" [...] cityscape, the president found the public buildings [...] "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected." [...] He moved into the nearly completed President's Mansion (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, [...] "Before <b>I</b> <b>end</b> my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof." [...] The Senate of the Sixth Congress {{met for the first}} time in the new Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. Several days later, on November 22, Adams delivered his fourth State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Senate chamber. This would be the last annual message any president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, One by One was {{considered}} the band's heaviest album, as Grohl described the sound as a darker and more aggressive approach {{as opposed to the}} band's usual work. Grohl said that the album mainly focused on the energy of live performances, which he attributed to both the extensive touring preceding the compositions, and the short period during which the re-recordings were done. The frontman added that although the previous albums had songs which were never played live, the track listing on One by One was compared to a set list where he would play all songs every night. As the results of the early recording sessions had manager John Silva complimenting the songs that did not sound like the band's previous work, and suggesting Grohl to [...] "stop trying to write hit singles and go back to being weird", the band decided to be more experimental in addition to writing music meant to be played in full arenas. The variety included moody songs such as [...] "Have It All" [...] and [...] "Tired of You", the seven-minute [...] "epic opus" [...] album closer [...] "Come Back", and the alternating dynamics of [...] "Halo", which drew inspiration from Tom Petty, Cheap Trick and Guided by Voices. Grohl added that the sonority tried to blend dissonance and melody: [...] "We figured we're gonna get mean, we're gonna get ugly. And then <b>I</b> <b>end</b> up putting this four-part harmony on it, and all of sudden it's beautiful. Like 'wait a second, {{it was supposed to be}} gross, and now it's gorgeous'." ...|$|E

[...] He was {{defeated}} by Igor Pavličić of the Democratic Party.

Each letter also included one-third of a 408-symbol cryptogram which the killer claimed contained his identity.

2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself. She devoted most of {{her attention to the}} dialogue: [...] "What Stout writes actually sounds good when you say it out loud, but the stuff that makes you laugh out loud and fall {{on the floor in the}} books doesn't work most of the time when you transpose it directly into actors' mouths. Frequently <b>I</b> <b>end</b> up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout. I see the script process as writing his second draft." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fox hired Terry Erdmann (Blue Blaze {{code name}} [...] "Silver Fox") {{and a team}} of publicists {{including}} Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at Star Trek conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody knew what to do with Buckaroo Banzai. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew". Lithgow said, [...] "I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour. I mean it; it's that complicated. But it's terrific. Every time I tell people about it, I get so excited that <b>I</b> <b>end</b> it by saying, Buckaroo Banzai, remember where you heard it first!" ...|$|E
