In 1699, the impost placed on the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the short- and long-run {{relationship between}} inbound tourism and total <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> goods in general, and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products in particular. An empirical {{study was conducted}} using monthly data on inbound tourism, total <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> goods, and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products for the period between 2000 and 2012, in Portugal. The results reveal that inbound tourism and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products are cointegrated. Therefore a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables can be inferred. The Granger causality test results suggest that inbound tourism in Portugal stimulates growth <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> in general. Furthermore, <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> goods and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products also stimulate inbound tourism. Our empirical findings provide important policy implications concerning international tourism and trade. inbound tourism; exports; agro-food products; cointegration; Granger causality; Portugal; international tourism; trade...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{the long-run}} and short-run {{relationship}} between merchandise export volume and its determinants, foreign income, relative prices and exchange rate variability, using {{the techniques of}} cointegration and error correction. The model was estimated for Irish exports and sectoral exports SITC 0 - 4 and SITC 5 - 8 to the European Union using quarterly data for the period 1979 - 1992. The sectoral classification corresponds to the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> mainly indigenous Irish firms and multinationals, respectively. We find that exchange rate volatility has {{a negative effect on}} the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> the multinational sector but no effect on the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> the indigenous sector in the short run.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} products {{by the same}} firm are systematically interconnected. Using Swedish firm-registry data from 1997 - 2011, I first document that the distribution <b>of</b> firm <b>export</b> sales is skewed towards their best performing products (‘superstars’). I then use a novel instrumental variable approach to identify if the ‘superstar’ products induce more trade of non-superstar products. I find evidence that the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> low-ranked (non-star) products of a firm complement the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> a single superstar product to each destination. Extending the ‘superstar’ concept to a ‘superstar core’ of products strengthens this result (this includes the top decile of products in terms <b>of</b> <b>export</b> value). The results show that a 1 % increase in the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> the superstar product and the superstar core increases the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> non-star products by 0. 13 % and 0. 376 %. Hence, I find that the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> non-star products complements the superstar while conversely, the same complementarity is not found using low-ranked products as placebo-superstars. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} identifying a new, sizeable and systematic intra-firm-destination one-way complementarity between products that is missing in the current models of multi-product exporters...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>export</b> taxes on primary commodities; almost 40 countries applied export taxes in recent years. The case of Argentina, {{which is a}} prominent user <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> tax and a leading exporter of soybean products, is then considered. In 2006, it taxed <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> soybeans, soybean meal and soybean oil, respectively, at 23. 5 percent, 19. 3 percent, and 20 percent. We simulate the effects of altering these taxes. Removing export taxes on soybean oil and meal, but continuing the tax on soybeans causes <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> meal and oil to rise and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> soybeans to fall. <b>Exports</b> <b>of</b> each product increase when taxed uniformly at 10 percent.

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> primary goods, say agricultural goods.

Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
