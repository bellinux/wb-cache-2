40|$|ESTIMATION {{of cardiac}} output by the indicator-dilution method has been de-scribed by Kinsman, Moore, and Hamilton 1 {{utilizing}} dye; however, radioactive methods for determination of cardiac output owe their inception to Prinzmetal and co-workers, 2 who recorded radioactivity {{as a function}} of time by means of a counter over the heart after an intravenous injection of radioactive Na 24. Nylin and Celander 3 utilized red cells tagged with radioactive phosphorus. They determined the dilution by serially sampling arterial blood at short time intervals and using beta-particle assay methods; an external counter was not adaptable to this mnethod. Huff and associates 4 used a narrow-angle scintillation counter and radioactive iodinated human albumin and found an excellent cor-relation of radioactive determinations of car-diac output with those obtained by cardiac catheterization. By this method, the passage of radioactive substance through the heart is detected by placing a gamma-ray detector on the skin {{between the first and second}} ribs at the left parasternal line. Count rates {{as a function of}} time are obtained that are similar to those obtained by direct arterial blood sam-pling. The curve written during the initial passage of the radioactive substance through the heart presents two peaks that represent the tracer passage through the right and left ventricles, respectively. The area under the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>curve</b> is divided into the equilib-rium counting rate.

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of the thermal {{conductivity}} of specimens of Cu + 10 at. % Al and Cu + 10 at. % Au in (i) the fully annealed state (ii) the deformed and aged at liquid helium temperatures state and (iii) aged under room-temperature conditions. Results have reflected an increase in the dislocation thermal resistivity for the room-temperature aged specimens by a factor of 5. 6 for the Cu + 10 at. % Al and 4. 6 for the Cu + 10 at. % Au alloy. Measurements of residual electrical resistivity on a sample of Cu + 10 at. % Al in the three different states have confirmed that the changes observed in the thermal conductivity results are not due to changes in the electronic thermal conduction. The changes in the lattice resistivity are therefore interpreted as due to formation of Cottrell atmospheres for the room-temperature aged specimens, - the observed enhanced thermal resistance due to solute atmosphere formation is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions of Ackerman and Klemens, (1971). Further, the Ackerman and Klemens annealing temperature dependence of the scatteri. ng for the deformed alloys in which Cottrell atmospheres have already formed and attained equilibrium with the dislocations, was experimentally tested in this research work. Good correlation between theory and eKxperiment was achieved and moreover, the results confirmed the experimental work of Mitchell et al., (1971). Measurements on a Cu + 10 at. % Al sample deformed at liquid helium temperatures and aged at several higher cryogenic temperatures have shown that the dislocation thermal resistivity increases vd. th increasing ageing temperatures. This is interpreted as due to systematic segregation of solute atoms to the dislocations as the ageing temperature is raised. An average value for the scattering in the deformed but not aged Cu + 10 at, % Al samples has been determined to be 0. 31 x 10 - 7 W - 1 cm 3 k 3 and is considered to be representative of the scattering in the pure copper - the value is in agreement to that predicted by Charsley et al., (1968), from their <b>extrapolated</b> <b>curve</b> of scattering after room-temperature ageing versus aluminium content in copper alloys and to those for Leaver, (1969), for alpha-brass. A knowledge of the scattering in the pure metal was used to determine dislocation densities in the Cu + 10 at. % Au specimen deformed at liquid helium temperatures and thus an accurate value for the scattering in the Cu + 10 at. % Au aged at room-temperature was deduced. This was used to deduce more accurately the dislocation densities introduced in the Cu + 10 at. % Au specimen of Leaver, (1969), which was plastically deformed at room-temperature by between 2 and 12 % tensile strain. It has been shown that Leaver underestimated his dislocation densities. Critical consideration of the 1971 theory of Ackerman and Klemens has been presented. It has been concluded that reasonable qualitative correlation between theory and experiment exists for the specimens tested but quantitative agreement is very poor...|$|E

Determination {{of the actual}} magnitude of the hydrograph and duration of the inflow recession requires knowledge of the changes of seepage rates with surface head in the reservoirs. This thesis develops three independent methods of determining seepage under saturated flow conditions from stage recorder and pan evaporation records: the application of Darcy's Law; the application of <b>extrapolated</b> <b>curves</b> of storage decline versus pan evaporation to zero pan evaporation; {{and the application of}} a three dimensional regression model.
