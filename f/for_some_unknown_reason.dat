Despite this, Yeul remains supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, and it is later revealed that she allowed herself to be reborn in order to be with Caius. Only one manifestation of Yeul is openly hostile towards the travelers and resentful of her fate.

The final incarnation, who shares a strong bond with Noel and wishes for a new life, is allowed to leave and live as a normal human.
