5|$|As a diplodocid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Dinheirosaurus {{possessed a}} whip-tail. If it did, {{it is likely}} that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with {{supersonic}} speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died within a few minutes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the {{sarcophagus}} {{was installed}} on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains {{to say a}} daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, Hélie then {{served in}} the 11e Régiment Parachutiste de Choc. By definition, there was no {{information}} on this passage, however <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he remained in Indochina.|$|R

5|$|Seated at {{an ornate}} wooden table, wearing a pearl tiara and flowing silk, is Sigismunda (called Ghismonda in Boccaccio's {{original}} tale), the heroine {{of one of}} the novelle. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Hogarth modelled her on his wife, Jane. She clasps a golden goblet containing the heart of her murdered husband, Guiscardo.|$|E
5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{there has been a}} significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} the boys thought of rolling down the steep slope, and taking their chance, but this they agreed would be a last resource, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the slope ended in an {{absolute}} precipice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Mr. Slope, {{how long}} I have been officiating as a clergyman in this city?" [...] Mr. Slope's wish was now nearly fulfilled. Mr. Harding had become angry, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he might commit himself.|$|R
60|$|Tressilian paused an instant. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{indifferent}} {{to him by}} what road he left a spot now so odious to his recollections; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the postern door was locked, and his retreat by that pass rendered impossible.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> in {{the early}} 1660s Morgan was active {{with a group of}} privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and {{settlements}} in the Caribbean and Central America. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene parrot {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, {{where they lived}} in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered dubious, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct in the wild even earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Theban Hills are {{dominated}} by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or 'The Peak'. It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, {{more than a thousand}} years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{then told}} the story of the {{intervention}} of the tiger in their behalf, and said that afterward an Indian lady had succored them, hinting {{that at the end of}} the war <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Ned would present his father with a daughter-in-law.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take my {{word for}} it, it would. Look all around. There was Adelaide Schropner,--but that was before your time, and you would not remember." [...] Considering that Adelaide Schropner had been for many years a grandmother, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Isa would not remember.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{historian}} Charles Dodd he was executed in York in 1610, in {{the reign of}} James I. The Catholic Encyclopedia thinks <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Dodd had confused him with another Catholic martyr, Thomas Atkinson, {{although there was a}} Marian priest called Nicholas Atkinson.|$|R
5|$|The earthen mound {{that once}} covered the tomb is now visible {{only as an}} {{undulation}} approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 inches) in height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on {{the western end of}} the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> there was an ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, {{it may have been}} quarried.|$|E
5|$|Until 1295, Nicholas was {{referred}} to as Nicholas of St Andrews (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he adopted de Sancto Andrea when he finished training at St Andrews and went elsewhere, and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back.|$|E
60|$|He {{went to the}} telephone. Before he {{had left}} New York on his travels, Arthur Mifflin had been living at a hotel near Washington Square. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> still there. He called up the number. The night-clerk was an old {{acquaintance}} of his.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} two days <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> they would make as long and speedy {{journeys}} as the animals could accomplish. After that, being well in their own country, they would cease to travel rapidly, as no pursuit had ever been attempted in former instances.|$|R
6000|$|But in {{his heart}} he knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not [...] "all right," [...] and that they stood in {{imminent}} danger of death by drowning.

5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge {{was simply}} {{assigned}} a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} them, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> true. They were huge {{and ran up}} for fifty or sixty feet without a bough. Moreover, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the god climbed better than we could. The Kalubi began to move inland in an {{indeterminate}} fashion, and I asked him where he was going.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> highly <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{he died in}} Königsberg in 1865.|$|R
50|$|Dr Hans-Georg Krug. Little {{is known}} of when he joined Pers S Z but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> he joined in early 1940.

5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> {{he died on}} either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given {{to him in the}} 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> the Mahdi {{would send}} down {{a large body}} of troops from those besieging Khartoum, as soon as he heard of the arrival of the small British force on the river, and every gun might be needed to {{maintain}} the position and repel attacks until the arrival of reinforcements across the desert.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{here that}} Kean {{brings up the}} cerebellum, the center in the brain that {{controls}} finer movements, controls the timing of movement. Very important. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> a malfunction {{in this area of}} the brain was what was the root of kuru, as the symptoms (shuffling, uncontrollable laughing) were typical of that area of the brain.|$|R
50|$|Ontong Java {{was visited}} by English missionary George Brown in mid 19th century. Brown {{described}} {{the population as}} Polynesian and referred to the place as Lua Niua. He recorded {{the existence of a}} two-class system in Ontong Java and, based on <b>it,</b> inferred <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probable</b> <b>that</b> exogamous classes formerly existed in Samoa as well.|$|R
