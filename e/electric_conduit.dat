5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, <b>electric</b> <b>conduits,</b> and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the geometric constraint-based paradigm to support the design of electrical installation. A system has been developed, using graph-based algorithms, to facilitate the construction of an electrical installation design and to allow the calculation, visualization and interaction in real time with a 3 D model. Virtual engineering is a usercentered process that provides a collaborative framework to integrate all of the models, data and decision-support tools needed for good engineering design. The ceiling conduit mesh, in electrical design, is automatically constructed and also routes to define the shortest path are generated. Furthermore, the system automatically detects obstacles in the architectonic design and provides a new avoiding path for the <b>electric</b> <b>conduit.</b> 1...|$|E

Inspired by buddhist monks' saffron robes and the native Filipino balete vine, New used flexible orange casing used for <b>electric</b> <b>conduits</b> accented by plastic cable ties to form his unique perception of the balete vine. These pieces intertwined with the exterior and interior architecture of the art gallery. Balete remained {{on display at the}} Ateneo Art Gallery until December of the same year.|$|R
40|$|Microbes are {{ubiquitous}} in our biosphere, and inevitably live in communities. They excrete {{a variety of}} metabolites and support the growth of other microbes in a community. According {{to the law of}} chemical equilibrium, the consumption of excreted metabolites by recipient microbes can accelerate the metabolism of donor microbes. This is the concept of syntrophy, which is a type of mutualism and governs the metabolism and growth of diverse microbes in natural and engineered ecosystems. A representative example of syntrophy is found in methanogenic communities, where reducing equivalents, e. g., hydrogen and formate, transfer between syntrophic partners. Studies have revealed that microbes involved in syntrophy have evolved molecular mechanisms to establish specific partnerships and interspecies communication, resulting in efficient metabolic cooperation. In addition, recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that microbial interspecies transfer of reducing equivalents also occurs as electric current via biotic (e. g., pili) and abiotic (e. g., conductive mineral and carbon particles) <b>electric</b> <b>conduits.</b> In this review, we describe these findings as examples of sophisticated cooperative behavior between different microbial species. We suggest that these interactions have fundamental roles in shaping the structure and activity of microbial communities...|$|R
50|$|Those {{involved}} in the energy sector are looking to optimise the knowledge of their distribution networks (pipelines, <b>electric</b> lines, <b>conduits)</b> in order to reinforce on one hand their ability to intervene, maintain, expand and implement, {{and on the other}} hand, to reinforce their contingency plans in the case of disasters. They must also adapt to international environmental standards that {{are becoming more and more}} stringent, all while maintaining their productivityNetwork managers thus need reliable geographic data, turnkey business information systems adapted to the location of their assets, the management of their distribution networks, risk management, the study of new implantation sites.IGN France International assists them in implementing customised solutions that range from the simple mapping of a site to the implementation of a comprehensive geographic information system. IGN France International assists those {{involved in}} the energy field and brings them a better knowledge of their networks, increased development and reinforced intervention ability.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of users - {{students and teachers}} - in the laboratories of the Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito in the last time, has congested the access to those laboratories. The proposal formulated by the research group Ecitrónica seeks {{to take advantage of}} a electric distribution net in the campus in order to create a domotic net that offers access facilities, control of the equipments of the laboratory, saving of energy and improvement of the quality of service for the students. The research group applied the Power Line Communications technology (PLC) and explored better alternatives of digital modulation, codification and detection of mistakes, connect, protocols of transmission of information and new applications; all that was based on the estimation of the channel (spread <b>electric)</b> like <b>conduit.</b> This project facilitates the development of research skills of teachers and students. The research meant an advance in the application of new technologies of communications for the solution of a need of the program of Electronics Engineering of the ECI. In this paper we present the concepts and basic beginning of the system of transmission of information across the electrical net of low tension of the laboratory of electronics in the campus...|$|R
50|$|Cameron {{traveled}} to continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States in March 1923, investigating foreign operating procedures and innovations. He returned the next year, steadfast in {{his belief that}} trams were superior to buses and that overhead wires were more cost effective than <b>conduit</b> <b>electric</b> collection systems; confirming the view regarding conduit collection he held before his travels. Under Cameron's direction, the MMTB also created a General Scheme for the future development of Melbourne's trams, including new lines, extensions to existing lines, and the abandonment or conversion to electric traction of the cable tram system. Cameron's plan for electrification of the cable system saw resistance from City of Melbourne, Collins Street churches, and town planning groups, who complained that electric trams were noisy, would hold up traffic, and that the electric wires and poles were an eyesore.|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell Stud contact system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the <b>electric</b> power cable <b>conduit.</b> This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of air through the conduit, clearing it of any gas.|$|R
50|$|By 1888, Washington was {{expanding}} {{north of}} Boundary Street NW {{into the hills}} of Washington Heights and Petworth. Boundary Street was becoming such a misnomer that in 1890 it was renamed Florida Avenue. Climbing the hills to the new {{parts of the city}} was difficult for horses, but electric streetcars could do it easily. In the year following the successful demonstration of the Richmond streetcar, four electric streetcar companies were incorporated in Washington D.C. The Eckington and Soldiers' Home Railway was the first to charter, on June 19, 1888, and started operation on October 17. Its tracks started at 7th Street and New York Avenue NW, east of Mount Vernon Square, and traveled 2.5 miles to the Eckington Car Barn at 4th and T Streets NE via Boundary Street NE, Eckington Place NE, R Street NE, 3rd Street NE and T Street NE. Another line ran up 4th Street NE to Michigan Avenue NE. A one-week pass cost $1.25. In 1889, the line was extended along T Street NE, 2nd Street NE and V Street NE to Glenwood Cemetery, but the extension proved unprofitable and was closed in 1894. At the same time, an extension was built along Michigan Avenue NE to the B&O railroad tracks. In 1895, the company removed its overhead trolley lines in accordance with its charter and attempted to replace them with batteries. These proved too costly and the company replaced them with horses in the central city. In 1896, Congress directed the Eckington and Soldier's Home to try compressed air motors and to substitute underground electric power for all its horse and overhead trolley lines in the city. The compressed-air motors were a failure and in 1899 the company switched to the standard underground <b>electric</b> power <b>conduit.</b>|$|R
