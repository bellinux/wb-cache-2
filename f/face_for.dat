5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as {{a slap in the}} <b>face</b> <b>for</b> Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E

5|$|The storyline {{over the}} WWE United States Championship began when Booker T, Orlando Jordan, and Christian each {{explained}} why {{they thought they}} deserved a title match against the champion, Chris Benoit.

5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one that would save <b>face</b> <b>for</b> the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the <b>face</b> <b>for</b> grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own <b>face</b> <b>for</b> Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E
