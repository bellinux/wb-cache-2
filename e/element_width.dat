One of {{the objectives of the}} research presented in this thesis is to investigate if there is any improvement of plastic section rotation capacities steel box girder with profiled webs. All the tested specimens were loaded under four point bending. Three dimensional (3 D) computer models analysed using the finite element method were used throughout the study. Results from pre-existing experimental work for 1 - section steel girder were used to validate the results obtained from the finite element analysis. Consequently, establishment of steel box girders were made and then validated with the classical beam theory. Failure mode of steel box girders with profiled webs starts with yielding followed by local buckling of the compression flanges. Incline folds in profiled webs at the compression area are able to cope with higher stresses as compared to horizontal folds. Rotation capacity percentage increament of steel box girder with flat webs as compared to the equivalent steel box girders with profiled webs was about 99. 55 % with 0. 16 standard deviation. The increment is about,double the rotation capacity of a girder with flat webs to the girder with profiled webs. Hence, the contribution from webs was significant to the rotation capacity. Rotation capacities increase significantly as the flange thickness and web thickness increase. While, as the yield stress, flange internal <b>element</b> <b>width</b> and flange external <b>element</b> <b>width</b> of steel plate box girders with the profiled webs are increased, the rotation capacities experience reduction...|$|E

These devices offer rapid, near-to-patient analysis, either at the patient’s home or the doctor’s office. Most Point-of-Care devices use microfluidic principles, since they use small volumes of fluids, handled by microscale channels. When comparing the Point-of-Care devices to conventional testing methods, they benefit from a much smaller reagent consumption, but suffer {{when it comes to}} sensitivity and detection limit. The objective of this research was to study how the mixing performance of a microfluidic immunoassay cartridge can be enhanced. For this purpose, several micromixer geometries, from literature, were studied using a finite element method approach, which was used to characterize and optimize the system. The mixing efficiency of these micromixer was evaluated by measuring the relative concentration variance of the structures at the outlet against the one inlet, a measure which has also been used in other studies. After the most effective structure was identified, the impact of various parameters, such as pressure, channel length, <b>element</b> <b>width</b> and height, were studied using the same methods. For selecting a micromixer design, along with the mixing efficiency, other parameters were taken into account. These parameters were the probability of air droplet formation, which heavily affects the immunoassay performance, and the manufacturing complexity, which directly impacts the cost of the cartridge. The results of the simulations showed that a slanted rip micromixer, with an element height of 0. 25 mm, <b>element</b> <b>width</b> 1 mm, a channel length of 40 mm, was best suited for this application. The experimental validation, conducted on injection molded polystyrene cartridges, confirmed the mixing behavior predicted in the simulations. Additionally, it revealed that air droplets were rarely formed when blood plasma was flowed through the cartridge. The approach used in this work is often used when studying micromixer geometries. However, there currently are no studies which investigate the parameter configuration of the slanted rips micromixer and their influence on the mixing efficiency. Moreover, most of the chaotic advection micromixers from literature study the micromixer as a standalone component, rather than in an assembly. In this work, factors influencing the performance of other cartridge components are taken into account...|$|E

Lorentz microscopy has provided unique insight into the detailed magnetisation reversal mechanisms in acicular elements with widths in the range 100 - 300 nm.

Design of this probe involves a detailed consideration of its physical and geometrical parameters.

The comb sizing (<b>element</b> <b>width</b> plus gap) determines the length of the generating wave. Parameter characterization of the comb transducer without time delay features was performed in [1]. A diverse discussion of techniques for transducer design is described in [4] and some practical NDE applications in guided wave generation are described in [5]. Unfortunately, practical considerations make it difficult to alter a comb’s geometry, consequently, restricting the ability to generate an arbitrary point on the dispersion curve. The goal of the current study is to overcome this restriction without adjustment or building another probe, by introducing a time delay profile. This means that each transducer element is excited with some time delay. An arbitrary phase velocity for the excitation of a desired point on the dispersion curve is then selected by determining the appropriate time delay value...|$|E

(Note that it is nevertheless possible to determine internal length scale parameters by connecting the fluctuating local variables in the individual realizations - which is what we have done above in case of compression). Therefore, only simple shear loading of the Cosserat medium is considered for validation purposes. We simulate a thin strip with the same width and height as the beam network and a thickness of D= 0.05 H. By using only 1 element for the thickness, this loading state is similar to a plane stress loading. The intrinsic length requires a mesh which captures the thickness of the boundary layer.

Two different tension-softening curves (TSCs) with the assumptions of 2 -dimensional (2 -D) and 3 -dimensional (3 -D) random fiber orientations were obtained from the micromechanics-based modeling, and linear elastic compressive and tensile models before the occurrence of cracks were obtained from the mechanical tests and rule of mixture. Finite element analysis incorporating smeared crack model was used due to the multiple cracking behaviors of structural UHPFRC beams, and the characteristic length of two times the <b>element</b> <b>width</b> (or two times the average crack spacing at the peak load) was suggested as a result of parametric study. Analytical results showed that the assumption of 2 -D random fiber orientation is appropriate to a non-reinforced UHPFRC beam, whereas the assumption of 3 -D random fiber orientation is suitable for UHPFRC beams reinforced with steel and GFRP rebars due to disorder of fiber alignment from the internal reinforcements.

The roughness of periodic gratings is affected by changing either inter-element spacing (groove width, G) or <b>element</b> <b>width</b> (ridge width, R). Peripheral neural responses to gratings depend quantitatively on a spatial variable, G, and a temporal variable, grating temporal frequency (F t), with changes in R acting indirectly through concomitant changes in F t. We investigated, psychophysically, the contribution of temporal cues to human tactile {{perception of}} roughness, using gratings varying in either R or G. Gratings were scanned across the immobile fingerpad with controlled movement speed (S) and contact force. In one experiment, we found that roughness magnitude estimates depended on both G and F t. In a second experiment, discrimination of the roughness of gratings varying in either R or G was affected by manipulating Ft. Overall, the effect of G on roughness judgments was much stronger than that of Ft, probably explaining why many previous studies using surfaces that varied only in inter-element spacing led {{to the conclusion that}} temporal factors play no role in roughness perception. However, the perceived roughness of R-varying gratings was determined by Ft and not spatial variables. Roughness judgments were influenced by G and Ft in a manner entirely consistent with predicted afferent response rates.

The media in the present study combined a relatively flat web of nanofibers with a cellulosic fiber support media. A CFD grid suited to calculating the flow patterns through the cellulosic media structure would be far too coarse to simulate flow around the nanofiber web elements. This scale difference forces some assumption about the interaction between the media layers. Our models are limited to two dimensions, representing cross-sections cut through the media. Our initial studies modeled the nanofiber web alone, {{on the assumption that the}} flow around the nanofibers is not greatly influenced by the presence of the downstream cellulosic fibers.
