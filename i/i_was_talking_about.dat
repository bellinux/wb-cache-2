500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> when I wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

So I will tell myself, [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up".

2500|$|Ever since 1986, it {{is common}} for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona's name as a token of recognition, even in remote places. The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England. In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms {{reserved}} for legends. In the Argentine film El Hijo de la Novia ("Son of the Bride"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron, [...] "They idolized him and then crucified him." [...] When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Maradona." [...] He is the subject of the film El Camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. [...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> him, but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> what I was thinking about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E

I will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> something that I know (at least a little) about. For the past twenty plus years <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> studying the linkage between science and public policy making. The science <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> science as defined by the scientific method, which posits that we should follow such tenets as causation, empiricism, objectivity, and replication. The public policy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the policies that are determined through our democratic process, highlighted by its construction by our governing bodies, implementation by our executives, and interpretation by our courts...|$|R

James later told Debbie Kruger that [...] " [...] was not {{necessarily}} about me, but let's say I thought I knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> I wrote it with Simon Hussey; the music Simon and I wrote together and I wrote the lyrics.
