50|$|There is the {{alternative}} option of indirect energy conversion by employing the Indirect Matrix Converter (Fig. 5) or the Sparse matrix converter which {{was invented by}} Prof. Johann W. Kolar from the ETH Zurich. As with the DC-link based VSI and CSI controllers (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), separate stages are provided for voltage and current conversion, but the DC-link has no intermediate storage element. Generally, by employing matrix converters, the storage element in the DC-link is eliminated {{at the cost of}} a larger number of semiconductors. Matrix converters are often seen as a future concept for variable speed drives technology, but despite intensive research over the decades they have until now only achieved low <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration.</b> However, citing recent availability of low-cost, high performance semiconductors, one larger drive manufacturer has over past few years been actively promoting matrix converters.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> and {{internet}} intensity for Taiwan manufacturing firms, and analyses whether the relationships are substitutes or complements. The sample observations are based on 153, 081 manufacturing plants, and covers 26 two-digit industry categories and 358 geographical townships in Taiwan. The Heckman selection model is used to accommodate sample selectivity for unobservable data for firms that use the internet. The empirical results from two-stage estimation show that: (1) {{a higher degree of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> will not affect the probability that firms will use the internet, but will affect the total expenditure on internet intensity; (2) for two-digit industries, <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> generally decreases the total expenditure on internet intensity; and (3) <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> and internet intensity are substitutes...|$|E
40|$|Although some {{companies}} {{have been successful in}} software reuse, many research projects on reuse have had little <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration.</b> Often the proposed technology has been too ambitious or exotic, or did not scale up. REBOOT emphasizes industrial applicability of the proposed technology in a holistic perspective: a validated method through a Methodology Handbook, a stabilized tool set around a reuse library, a training package, and initial software repositories of reusable components extracted from company-specific projects. This article presents the REBOOT approach to software reuse, covering both organizational and technical aspects and the experiences made so far from the applications. 1...|$|E

40|$|A new {{econometric model}} to {{forecast}} <b>industrial</b> robot <b>penetration</b> is proposed. This model {{consists of the}} following three components: (1) Application of a "learning curve" for industrial robot prices; (2) Application of an extended production function taking account of industrial robot population effects; (3) Introduction of a demand function for "augmented equivalent labor force", in order to integrate the above two components. The validation of the proposed model was made for the <b>penetration</b> of advanced <b>industrial</b> robots in the Japanese manufacturing industry. The forecasts of I. R. penetration by this model were compared with the simple logistic curve model and also with the forecasts by JIRA (Japan Industrial Robot Association) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Modern {{reactive}} {{control system}} are typically very complex entities, and their design poses substantial challenges. In addition to ensuring functional correctness, other steps may be required: with safety analysis, the behavior is analyzed, and proved compliant to some requirements considering possible faulty behaviors; diagnosis and diagnosability are forms of reasoning on the run-time explanation of faulty behaviors; planning and synthesis allow the automated construction of controllers that implement desired behaviors. Symbolic Model Checking (SMC) is a formal technique for ensuring functional correctness that {{has achieved a}} substantial <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> in the last decade. In this paper, we show how SMC {{can be used as}} a convenient framework to express safety analysis, diagnosis and diagnosability, and synthesis. We also discuss how model checking tools can be used and extended to solve the resulting computational challenges. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCondition {{monitoring}} methods {{based on}} electrical signals analysis {{have been used}} for mechanical and electrical fault detection for a while now. Moreover, the research focus has shifted from single-phase signals analysis to three-phase signals approaches. The main advantages of using three-phase approaches can be stated as separation of balanced and unbalanced electrical quantities as well as better performances in terms of mechanical faults detection. However, such approaches still have a low <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> in part due to their relatively higher complexity compared to single-phase approaches. The current paper proposes an easy to implement method for condition monitoring of bearings, which takes into account the whole three-phase electrical signals. After presenting the theoretical development of the method, the algorithm for computing mechanical faults indicators is given. Moreover, the paper presents experimental results of the proposed approach, using electrical signals acquired on a dedicated test bench...|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} metabolic {{engineering tools}} and strategies to engineer synthetic enzyme pathways, {{the number and}} diversity of commodity and specialty chemicals that can be derived directly from renewable feedstocks is rapidly and continually expanding. This of course includes a number of monomer building-block chemicals {{that can be used}} to produce replacements to many conventional plastic materials. This review aims to highlight numerous recent and important advancements in the microbial production of these so-called ‘biomonomers’. Relative to naturally-occurring renewable bioplastics, biomonomers offer several important advantages, including improved control over the final polymer structure and purity, the ability to synthesize non-natural copolymers, and allowing products to be excreted from cells which ultimately streamlines downstream recovery and purification. To highlight these features, a handful of biomonomers have been selected as illustrative examples of recent works, including polyamide monomers, styrenic vinyls, hydroxyacids, and diols. Where appropriate, examples of their <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration</b> to date and end-product uses are also highlighted. Novel biomonomers such as these are ultimately paving the way towards new classes of renewable bioplastics that possess a broader diversity of properties than ever before possible...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{international}} comparisons of <b>industrial</b> robot <b>penetration.</b> The results of comparisons are summarized as follows: (a) There {{is a big}} gap of robot density between the leading country, Japan and other major developed market economy countries. (b) However, the penetration trend curves show a very similar pattern among those countries. (c) Therefore, the differences of I. R. penetration can be expressed by introducing a time-lag for each country. The time-lag of other countries are estimated by regression analysis for multi-national time-series data, resulting in a figure of 4. 4 to 7. 8 years behind Japan. (d) With regard to the application and industrial distribution of I. R., remarkable differences are found between Japan and other countries, namely, with regard to assembly robots in the Japanese electric/electronics industry as opposed to welding robots in the automotive industry of other countries...|$|R
40|$|The present work gives a {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} factors that affect reciprocal labor and the demand of the work force in rural Ecuador. Through the data obtained in the Life Conditions Survey of 2005 - 2006, this work asseses the probability for an Ecuadorian household to participate in community work, exchange labour force with other families and to hire additional workers. The results show that the engagement in this type of community work is fundamentally influenced by factors such as: ethni­city, spatial land distribution, agricultural credit, <b>industrial</b> agriculture <b>penetration</b> and road infrastruc­ture at the province level. The number of international migrants of the household is not relevant for these aspects. Finally, the probability for a rural home to hire agricultural laborers seems to be strongly connected to ethnicity, credit availability and land spatial distribution. </p...|$|R

Accordingly, the main aim of the present research is to identify and prioritize the investment opportunities in Chabahar Free Zone (CFZ) from the perspective of investment managers and experts and active investors in this zone based on four criteria “creation and foreign exchange earnings, attracting foreign investment and technology transfer, creating industrial linkage between <b>industrial</b> areas, <b>penetration</b> in foreign markets ” using the analytic hierarchal process. To this end, after collecting data from 30 individuals of the study population and analyzing them using Expert Choice Software, findings show that the most important priorities of investment in CFZ are including infrastructure, industry, educational, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, service and business sectors respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{environmental}} sustainability, which is unprecedented in both magnitude and complexity, presents {{one of the}} biggest challenges faced by modern society. Design engineers can make significant contributions by incorporating environmental awareness into product and process development. It is critical that engineers make a paradigm shift in product design from centering on cost and performance to balancing economic, environmental, and societal considerations. Although there have been quite a few designs for environment (or ecodesign) tools developed, so far, these tools have only achieved limited <b>industrial</b> <b>penetration.</b> The present-day methods are either too qualitative to offer concrete solutions and not effective for designers with limited experience or too quantitative, costly, and time consuming. Thus, current ecodesign tools cannot be implemented during the early design phases. This paper develops a novel, semiquantitative ecodesign methodology that is targeted specifically toward the early stages of the design process. The new methodology is a combination of environmental life cycle assessment and visual tools such as quality function deployment, functional-component matrix, and Pugh chart. Since the early design process is function-oriented, a new visual tool called the function impact matrix has been developed to correlate environmental impacts with product function. Redesign of office staplers for reduced carbon footprint has been selected as a case study to demonstrate the use of the proposed approach. Life cycle assessment results confirm that the new stapler design generated using this methodology promotes improved environmental performance. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4001890...|$|E
