5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months.</b> Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
25|$|A severe {{drought in}} the United Kingdom {{needs to have}} the high {{pressure}} {{in charge of the}} weather for an extended period, commonly for weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months</b> at a time. Most often sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and intensification of the mid latitude westerlies in the Pacific can bring a stable anticyclone, meaning that the pressure can remain above average for weeks, or <b>even</b> <b>months</b> at a time, allowing the heat to build and dry weather to continue during the anticyclonic system.|$|E

25|$|Mustard gas {{is not a}} {{particularly}} effective killing agent (though in high enough doses it is fatal) but {{can be used to}} harass and disable the enemy and pollute the battlefield.

25|$|Some birds seem to {{lack the}} {{perception}} of grief or quickly accept it- for example, Mallard hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing {{what they were doing}} before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as Mute swans, are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months</b> at a time.|$|E
25|$|So, in 20874 CE, the Jewish year is due {{to begin}} 87d 2h 31 2/18m later than in 2026 CE and 1d 2h 31 2/18m later in the week. In 20874 CE, therefore, the Jewish year {{is due to}} begin at 11.30 3/18 A.M. on Friday, 14 June. Because of the displacements, it {{actually}} begins on Saturday, 15 June. Odd months have 30 days and <b>even</b> <b>months</b> 29, so the starting dates are 2, 15 July; 3, 13 August; 4, 12 September; 5, 11 October; 6, 10 November; 7, 9 December, and 8, 8 January.|$|E

25|$|Hand {{and surface}} {{disinfection}} practices {{are the first}} line of defense against infection. However, these have fallen short of expectations as opportunistic organisms put patients and healthcare workers at risk. Since approximately 80% of infectious diseases are known to be transmitted by touch, and pathogens found in healthcare facilities can survive on inanimate surfaces for days and <b>even</b> <b>months,</b> the microbial burden of frequently touched surfaces is believed to play a significant role in infection causality. Surfaces in hospitals and healthcare facilities are frequently touched and therefore could become reservoirs of infection.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{also charged}} that the {{authorities}} did not organize the siege properly, including failing to keep the scene secure from entry by civilians, while the emergency services were not prepared during the 52 hours of the crisis. The Russian government has been also heavily criticized {{by many of the}} local people who, days and <b>even</b> <b>months</b> after the siege, did not know whether their children were alive or dead, as the hospitals were isolated from the outside world. Two months after the crisis, human remains and identity documents were found by a local driver, Muran Katsanov, in the garbage landfill at the outskirts of Beslan; the discovery prompted further outrage.|$|E
25|$|Each {{month of}} the Islamic {{calendar}} commences on {{the birth of the}} new lunar cycle. Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the crescent (hilal) marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely Alavis, Dawoodis and Sulaymanis and Shia Ismaili Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and <b>even</b> <b>months</b> have 29.|$|E

500|$|Risto Uimonen, an {{election}} {{analyst for the}} Finnish Broadcasting Company, predicted [...] "the toughest negotiations on government formation since the 1970s", as the three biggest parties have differing stances on many issues. Some analysts said that government formation talks could take weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months</b> due to disparities {{on such issues as}} the eurozone bail-outs, taxation, pension reform, foreign aid and immigration. Pasi Saukkonen, {{a political scientist at the}} University of Helsinki, made a comparison between similar EU referendums in Denmark and Ireland (following which a similar referendum passed the measure, though it was in turn followed by a similar proposed measure) where the smaller EU member states wielded immense influence; though he said that such controversial matters usually work out in the end.|$|E
500|$|At {{a cabinet}} meeting chaired by Manmohan Singh on 26 December, the {{decision}} was made to fly her to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore for further care. Mount Elizabeth is a multi-organ transplant specialty hospital. Some doctors criticised the decision as political, questioning the need to transfer an intensive care unit (ICU) patient for organ transplants that were not scheduled for weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months</b> later. Government sources indicate that the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, was personally behind the decision. Hours earlier, Union Minister P. Chidambaram had stated that Jyoti was not in a condition to be moved. An anonymous source quoted by The Sunday Guardian stated that the decision to move her was taken [...] "when it was already clear that she would not survive the next 48 hours".|$|E

500|$|The 1846 {{hurricane}} {{resulted in}} a variety of both geological, geographical, and ecological alterations. In Key West, the local salt pond shifted from its original position, becoming a hindrance to local residents and requiring it to be filled up; eventually, the tourist district of Key West emerged over the former site of the salt pond. By December1846, Sand Key, which was inundated during the hurricane, resurfaced from the waters of the Atlantic. However, it was situated approximately [...] west of its location prior to the hurricane, and <b>even</b> <b>months</b> later, the lighthouse remained under [...] of seawater. Years afterward, greenery on the key was sparse, and little native vegetation existed. Signs of ecological damage remained even in the early 1880s, evidenced by the presence of rushes among the leaves of trees and bushes.|$|E
500|$|Also, hypometabolism. An energy-conserving {{strategy}} used by {{some small}} (under [...] ) birds in which they become inactive and unreactive to external stimuli, and reduce their metabolism causing decreases in body temperature {{by an average of}} [...] below their normal respiration and heart rate. [...] Two types of torpor are recognized. In one type, such as in hummingbirds, torpor may be entered on a daily basis and last only a few hours; other behaviours, such as foraging, continue during non-torpor periods. For other species, torpor may only be entered during cold conditions or when food becomes limited, but may persist for weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months.</b> The extent of unresponsiveness during torpor can be pronounced. A hummingbird in deep torpor, for example, with a body temperature of , will not respond to a variety of external stimuli such as attempts to push it from a perch; only the locking reﬂex of the feet stops the bird from falling. [...] Torpor has been reported in eight orders of birds.|$|E
500|$|Upon birth, a {{child is}} {{initiated}} into the family ritually according to the Rig Veda for the Rigvedi Brahmins. The naming ceremony of the child may happen many weeks or <b>even</b> <b>months</b> later, and {{it is called the}} barsa. In many Hindu communities around India, the naming is almost often done by consulting the child's horoscope, in which are suggested various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called Rashi). However, in Deshastha families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functioning is the one decided by his parents. If a name is chosen {{on the basis of the}} horoscope, then that is kept a secret to ward off casting of a spell on the child during his or her life. [...] During the naming ceremony, the child's paternal aunt has the honour of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, he or she gets their first hair-cut. This is an important ritual as well and is called Jawal.|$|E
