We conducted our study trying to investigate this point in a prospective randomized double blinded manner. Methods. With inclusion criteria of: age (1865 y), volume 90 min, incision length > 10 cm, neck dissection decided during surgery and a postoperative complication within the first 24 hours. Sixty patients planned for total thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled in the study in three groups with twenty patients assigned randomly to each one: group (A) a control group in which no wound infiltration was done, group (B) in which preoperative wound infiltration with 10 mL bupivacaine 0. 5 % was done, and group (C) in which preoperative wound infiltration with 10 mL ropivacaine 0. 75 % was done. Postoperative pain was evaluated by Visual Analogue Score (VAS) with a scale of (0 - 10) at 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours and 16 hours. Results. The {{postoperative pain}} experienced by all the patients reached a maximum point at 1 hour postoperatively then started to decrease to be minimal at 8 hours and almost negligible at 16 hours. Ropivacaine group showed a statistically significant decrease in pain perception at 1 hour postoperatively (P= 0. 028), bupivacaine group showed also a decrease in pain perception at 1 hour but it was not statistically significant. At 4 hours of opération and after; neither ropivacaine nor bupivacaine showed an effect on pain perception. Conclusion.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ultrasound guided abdominal field blocks (USAFB) with port site <b>infiltrations</b> for post-operative <b>analgesia</b> in terms of quality of pain relief, opioid consumption and patient satisfaction for day care surgeries Methods : Eighty patients presenting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to two groups either to receive port-site infiltration of local anaesthetic (n = 40, Group A) or USAFB (n = 40, Group B group). Numeric rating scores (NRS) were measured postoperatively to primarily assess the pain severity and opioid requirements. Data were analysed using Chi-Square test/Fisher′s exact test for categorical data and Mann-Whitney test/unpaired t-test for quantitative data. Results: The study group (Group B) had significantly reduced NRS and opioid consumption over 24 h. The overall fentanyl consumption in patients receiving port infiltrations was approximately twice (200 ΁ 100 μg) as compared to patients in USAFB group (120 ΁ 74 μg) (P < 0. 0001). Maximum fentanyl consumption was 400 μg (Group A) and 262 μg (Group B) over 24 h and the minimum requirement was 50 μg and zero, respectively.

We hypothesized that as a component of multimodal analgesia, local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> followed by continuous infusion of ropivacaine would result in reduced postoperative opioid consumption and lower pain scores compared with infiltration alone, and that both of these tech-niques would be superior to placebo. Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 105 patients were randomized into three groups: Group I, in which patients received infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline followed by continuous infusion of 0. 2 % ropivacaine at 5 mL/hr; Group II, in which patients received infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline followed by continuous infusion of saline solution at 5 mL/hr; and Group III, in which patients received infiltration with saline solution followed by continuous infusion of saline solution at 5 mL/hr. All patients received celecoxib, pregabalin, and acetaminophen perioperatively and patient-controlled analgesia; surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Before wound closure, the tissues and periarticular space were infiltrated with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and adrenaline or saline solution and a fenestrated catheter was placed.

40|$|Background: Paravertebral block (PVB) has the {{potential}} to offer long-lasting pain relief because it can uniquely eliminate cortical responses to thoracic dermatomal stimulation. Benefits include a reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), prolonged postoperative pain relief, and potential for ambulatory discharge. Aims: To compare PVB with local <b>infiltration</b> for postoperative <b>analgesia</b> following modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Methods: Forty patients undergoing MRM with axillary dissection were randomly allocated into two groups. Following induction of general anesthesia in group P, a catheter was inserted in the paravertebral space and 0. 3 ml/kg of 0. 25 % of bupivacaine was administered followed by continuous infusion, while in group L, the surgical incision was infiltrated with 0. 3 ml/kg of 0. 25 % bupivacaine. Statistical Analysis: The statistical tests were applied as unpaired student ′t′ test/nonparametric test Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test for comparing different parameters such as VAS score and consumption of drugs. The categorical variables such as nausea and vomiting scores, sedation score, and patient satisfaction score were computed by Chi square test/Fisher exact test. Results: VAS score was significantly lower in group P than in group L throughout the postoperative period. The mean alertness score (i. e., less sedation) was higher in group P in the postoperative period than group L. The incidence of PONV was less in PVB group.

40|$|Introduction: Pain {{control in}} the morbidly obese can be {{especially}} challenging because of increased sensitivity to opioid-induced respiratory depression. The subcostal transversus abdominis plane block {{is associated with a}} large area of spread (T 7 -L 1). The aim {{of the study was to}} test the hypothesis that US-guided TAP blocks can reduce opioid consumption during the first 24  h after of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in comparison with port site local anesthetic <b>infiltration</b> and systemic <b>analgesia.</b> Method: Sixty-three ASA II/III adult patients listed for elective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomly allocated in one of three groups: Group I (OSTAP) received bilateral OSTAP block. Group II (Local) received local anesthetic infiltration at trocar port sites. Group III (Control) placebo group received TAP block and port site infiltration by same volumes of sterile normal saline. Twenty-four hours postopetrative morphine consumption, the dose of fentanyl (μg) required during surgery, equivalent morphine dose in the recovery unit (PACU) and first morphine dose were recorded. The quality of analgesia is assessed by Visual Analogue Scale for 24  h at rest and movement. Results: The mean opioid consumptions in PACU showed significant difference between the three groups, P =  0. 02. The mean 24  h morphine consumption showed statistically significant difference between groups (P value <  0. 001). Significant differences were found between both OSTAP and Local groups with control group (P <  0. 001) and also between OSTAP and Local groups (P =  0. 02). Pain score of OSTAP group was significantly lower than local infiltration group at 6 and 4  h at rest and movement respectively. OSTAP group had faster extubation time than other groups. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were not significant between groups. No signs or symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity or complications were detected. Conclusion: Oblique subcostal TAP block is a good alternative for providing analgesia during the postoperative period. The block is easily performed using ultrasound guidance. It is safe, provides effective analgesia with significant morphine-sparing effect with reduced side-effects of opioids...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Wide {{variation}} in the outcomes of colorectal surgery persists, despite a well-established evidence-base to inform clinical practice. This variation {{may be attributed to}} differences in quality of care, but {{we do not know what}} this means in practical terms of care delivery. This telephone interview study aimed to identify distinguishing characteristics in the organisation of care among colorectal units with the best length of stay results in England. METHODS: Ten English National Health Service hospitals were identified with the shortest length of stay after elective colonic surgery between January 2011 and December 2012. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a senior colorectal surgeon and ward nurse, who were not informed of their performance, at each site. Audio recordings were professionally transcribed and thematically analysed for similarities and differences in practice between units. RESULTS: All ten short length of stay units approached agreed to participate, and 19 of 20 interviews were recorded. These units standardised clinical care based upon an Enhanced Recovery Program. Beyond this, they organised the clinical team to efficiently and reliably deliver this package of care, with the majority of day-to-day care delivered by consultants and nurses. Patients were closely monitored for postoperative deterioration, using a combination of early warning scores, nurses clinical judgement and regular senior medical review. Of note, operative volume and laparoscopy rates in these units were not statistically significantly different from the national average (p[*]=[*] 0. 509 and p[*]=[*] 0. 131, respectively). The postoperative analgesic strategy varied widely between units, from routine epidural use to local anaesthetic <b>infiltration</b> or patient-controlled <b>analgesia.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The Enhanced Recovery Program may be seen as necessary but not sufficient to achieve the best length of stay results. In the study units, consultants and nurses led and delivered the majority of patient care on the ward. High quality teamwork helped detect and resolve clinical issues promptly, with nurses empowered to contact consultants directly if needed. Other units may learn from these teams by adopting protocol-based, consultant- or nurse-delivered care, and by improving coordination and communication between consultants and ward nurses...|$|R
40|$|Many {{consider}} femoral nerve {{block the}} gold standard in pain management following knee arthroplasty. Local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> is an alternate approach that applies the concept of surgical wound infiltration with local anaesthetics. This meta-analysis aims to compare both analgesic treatments for analgesia and functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. This meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement guidelines. The primary outcomes were cumulative i. v. morphine consumption, pain scores at rest and on movement on postoperative day one (analogue scale, 0 - 10). Secondary outcomes included range of motion, quadriceps muscle strength, length of stay and rates of complications (neurologic events, cardiovascular events, falls and knee infections). Fourteen trials, including 1122 adult patients were identified. There {{was no difference in}} i. v. morphine consumption (mean difference: - 2. 0 mg; 95 % CI: - 4. 9, 0. 9 mg; I(2) = 69 %; P= 0. 19), pain scores at rest (mean difference: - 0. 1; 95 % CI: - 0. 4, 0. 3; I(2) = 72 %; P= 0. 80) and pain scores on movement (mean difference: 0. 2; 95 % CI: - 0. 5, 0. 8; I(2) = 80 %; P= 0. 64) on postoperative day one (a negative mean difference favours local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia).</b> The qualities of evidence for our primary outcomes were moderate according to the GRADE system.

40|$|Transversus {{abdominal}} plane (TAP) block has a {{long history}} and there is currently extensive clinical experience around TAP blocks. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the present evidence on the effects of TAP block and to provide suggestions for further studies. There are several approaches to performing abdominal wall blocks, with the rapid implementation of ultrasound-guided technique facilitating a major difference in TAP block performance. During surgery, an abdominal wall block may also be applied by the surgeon from inside the abdominal cavity. Today, there are more than 11 meta-analyses providing a compiled evidence base around the effects of TAP block. These analyses include different procedures, different techniques of TAP block administration and, importantly, they compare the TAP block with a variety of alternative analgesic regimes. The effects of TAP block during laparoscopic cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent to local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> and also seem to be beneficial during laparoscopic colon resection. The effects of TAP are more pronounced when it is provided prior to surgery and these effects are local anaesthesia dose-dependent. TAP block seems an interesting alternative in patients with, for example, severe obesity where epidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia is technically difficult and/or poses a risk. There is an obvious need for further high-quality studies comparing TAP block prior to surgery with local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia,</b> single-shot spinal analgesia, and epidural analgesia.

Total knee arthroplasty patients received two peri-articular injections during surgery followed by continuous infusion, both with ropivacaine (567 mg). Ropivacaine plasma concentrations were determined in blood samples taken at 0, 3, 6 and 24 hours postoperatively.

40|$|Pain {{management}} after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{and total}} hip arthroplasty should permit early mobilization with minimal pain. Local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> (LIA) is a new popular method for decreasing postoperative pain.

40|$|Local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> (LIA) is an {{analgesic}} {{technique that}} has gained popularity {{since it was}} first brought to widespread attention by Kerr and Kohan in 2008.

The analgesic effect duration can then be prolonged by the placement of a catheter to the surgical site for postoperative administration of further local anesthetic. The technique has been adopted for use for postoperative analgesia following a range of surgical procedures (orthopedic, general, gynecological, and breast surgeries). The primary objective of this paper was to determine, based on the current evidence, if LIA is superior when compared to no intervention, placebo, and alternative analgesic methods in patients following total hip arthroplasty, in terms of certain outcome measures.

We conclude {{that the use of}} high-dose ropivacaine infiltration and catheter infusion for total knee arthroplasty in an elderly population does not result in free plasma ropivacaine levels previously associated with toxicity but that raised total plasma levels may be observed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Thoracic {{paravertebral}} block (TPVB) provides superior analgesia {{for breast}} surgery {{when used in}} conjunction with general anesthesia (GA). Although TPVB and GA are often combined, for some patients GA is either contraindicated or undesirable. We present a series of 28 patients who received a TPVB with sedation alone for breast cancer surgery. Methods. A target controlled infusion of propofol or remifentanil was used for conscious sedation. Ultrasound guided TPVB was performed at one, two, or three thoracic levels, using up to 30 [*]mL of local anesthetic. If required, top-up local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> with prilocaine 0. 5 % was performed by the surgeon. Results. Most patients were elderly with significant comorbidities and had TPVB injections at just one level (54 %). Patient choice and anxiety about GA were indications for TVPB in 9 patients (32 %). Prilocaine top-up was required in four (14 %) cases and rescue opiate analgesia in six (21 %). Conclusions. Based on our technique and the outcome of the 28 patients studied, TPVB with sedation and ultrasound guidance appears to be an effective and reliable form of anesthesia for breast surgery. TPVB with sedation is a useful anesthetic technique for patients in which GA is undesirable or poses an unacceptable risk...|$|E
40|$|License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> (LIA) is an analgesic technique that has gained popularity {{since it was}} first brought to widespread attention by Kerr and Kohan in 2008. The technique involves the infiltration of a large volume dilute solution of a long-acting local anesthetic agent, often with adjuvants (e. g., epinephrine, ketorolac, an opioid), throughout the wound {{at the time of}} surgery. The analgesic effect duration can then be prolonged by the placement of a catheter to the surgical site for postoperative administration of further local anesthetic. The technique has been adopted for use for postoperative analgesia following a range of surgical procedures (orthopedic, general, gynecological, and breast surgeries). The primary objective of this paper was to determine, based on the current evidence, if LIA is superior when compared to no intervention, placebo, and alternative analgesic methods in patients following total hip arthroplasty, in terms of certain outcome measures. The outcomes considered were postoperative analgesia scores, joint function/rehabilitation, and length of hospital stay. Secondary objectives were to review available evidence and current knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetics of local anesthetic and adjuvant drugs when administered in this way and the occurrence of adverse events...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{revision}} surgery due to deep infection following {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) {{increased at}} a Norwegian hospital following implementation of fast-track procedures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether selected demographic (age and sex) and clinical (body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, surgery duration, length of hospital stay, cemented versus uncemented prosthesis, and fast-track procedures) factors were associated with higher risk of revision surgery due to deep infection following THA. In a prospective designed study 4, 406 patients undergoing primary THA between January 2001 and January 2013 where included. Rates of infection-related revision surgery within 3 months of THA were higher among males and among patients who received fast-track THA. Adjusting for sex and age, the implemented fast-track elements were significantly associated with increased risk of revision surgery. Risk of infection-related revision surgery was unrelated to body mass index, physical status, surgery duration, length of hospital stay, and prosthesis type. Because local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia,</b> drain cessation, and early mobilization were introduced in combination, it could not be determined which component or combination of components imposed the increased risk. The findings in this small sample raise concern about fast-track THA but require replication in other samples...|$|E
40|$|Background. Various {{postoperative}} pain relief modalities, including continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB), local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> (LIA), and combination therapy, {{have been reported}} for total knee arthroplasty. However, no studies have compared CFNB with LIA for total hip arthroplasty (THA). The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy of CFNB versus LIA after THA. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative outcomes of 93 THA patients (20 men, 73 women; mean age 69. 2 years). Patients were divided into three groups according to postoperative analgesic technique: CFNB, LIA, or combined CFNB+LIA. We measured the following postoperative outcome parameters: visual analog scale (VAS) for pain at rest, supplemental analgesia, side effects, mobilization, length of hospital stay, and Harris Hip Score (HHS). Results. The CFNB+LIA group had significantly lower VAS pain scores than the CFNB and LIA groups on postoperative day 1. There were no significant differences among the three groups in use of supplemental analgesia, side effects, mobilization, length of hospital stay, or HHS at 3 months after THA. Conclusions. Although there were no clinically significant differences in outcomes among the three groups, combination therapy with CFNB and LIA provided better pain relief after THA than CFNB or LIA alone, with few side effects...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Although {{considered}} safe, no pharmacokinetic data of high dose, {{high volume}} local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> (LIA) with ropivacaine {{without the use}} of a surgical drain or intra-articular catheter have been described. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the maximum total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations (Cmax) and corresponding times to maximum concentration (Tmax) of a single shot ropivacaine (200 ml 0. 2 %) and 0. 75 mg epinephrine (1000 μg mL- 1) when used for LIA. Methods: In this prospective cohort study twenty patients were treated with LIA of the knee for primary total knee arthroplasty. Plasma samples were taken at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 minutes and at 24 hours after tourniquet release, in which total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations were determined. Results: Results are given as mean (SD); median (range). Maximum total ropivacaine concentration was 1. 06 (0. 36); 1. 00 (0. 61 - 2. 26) μg mL- 1, corresponding Tmax was 311 (227); 240 (40 - 1440) minutes after tourniquet release (Figure 1). The highest measured unbound ropivacaine concentration was 0. 13 μg mL- 1. Conclusions: Maximumtotal and unbound serum concentrations of ropivacaine remained well below the assumed toxic thresholds of 4. 3 and 0. 56 μg mL- 1, respectively, for systemic toxicity.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the maximum total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations (C-max, C-u max) and corresponding maximum times (T-max, T-u max) of a single-shot ropivacaine (200 ml 0. 2 %) and 0. 75 mg epinephrine (1000 g/ml) when used for LIA in patients for total knee arthroplasty. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 20 patients were treated with LIA of the knee for primary total knee arthroplasty. Plasma samples were taken at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 min and at 24 h after tourniquet release, in which total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations were determined. Results: Results are given as median [IQR]. Highest ropivacaine concentration (C-max) was 1. 06 mu g/ml [0. 34]; highest unbound ropivacaine concentration (C-u max) was 0. 09 mu g/ml [0. 05]. The corresponding time to reach the maximum concentration for total ropivacaine was 312 min [120] after tourniquet release, and for the unbound fraction 265 [110] min after tourniquet release. Conclusion: Although great inter-individual variability was found between the maximum ropivacaine concentrations, both maximum total and unbound serum concentrations of ropivacaine remained well below the assumed systemic toxic thresholds of 4. 3 and 0. 56 mu g/ml...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out on 45 native adult {{dromedary}} camels suffering from disorders of the dulaa. Clinical signs were those of dysphagia and or dyspnoea. Twenty-four camels (53. 33 %) were unable to inflate or extrude their dulaas. These signs were associated with pharyngeal swelling. Therefore the animals were examined radiographically. Fifteen (33. 33 %) camels suffered from collapsed and persistent protrusion of the dulaas. Four (8. 9 %) camels had previous episodes of dysfunction of the dulaa and the owner requested elective surgical excision. The remaining 2 (4. 44 %) animals had previous excision by healers and developed granulation tissue. Surgical management was achieved after light sedation using xylazine (2 % Rompun, Bayer) supplemented with local <b>infiltration</b> <b>analgesia</b> or followed by induction of anaesthesia using ketamine hydrochloride (Ketamidore). The operations were carried out either through the oral cavity or following a pharyngostomy incision at the inter-mandibular region. In the latter instances, temporary tracheotomy was needed. The prevalent surgical affections were impaction with food material associated with ulcer or echymosis or abscesses. Less severe maladies were those of persistent protrusion accompanied with edema, haematoma, lacerations, small foci of abscesses and gangrene. The prognosis was favourable. The study included surgical anatomy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as radiography of the dulaa in health and disease...|$|E
