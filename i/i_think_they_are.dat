25|$|As for the Chinese, I {{have the}} highest opinion {{not only of the}} Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> eminently fitted to make a {{republic}} successful. China, for instance, is infinitely better fitted than is Russia for development along republican lines. In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, but the political unit of China has always been the village. The village people have always had their influence upon the Government. What is more, the average Chinaman is intelligent.|$|E
500|$|On February 2, 2015, Paul {{generated}} controversy {{by suggesting}} that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should {{have the freedom to}} make that decision for their children. In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting [...] "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom." [...] On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.|$|E
500|$|In November 2010, after sister Lauren was recast to Jossa, Jossa {{stated that}} she enjoys working with Fitzgerald, adding {{the two have}} a lot in common. Jossa, in 2012, wanted Lauren and Abi to bond more. She commented: [...] "I think realistically they would when they're going through a family problem like this. It would bring the family a little bit closer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> quite close already and {{they have a lot of}} family banter! They may not like each other as people, but they love each other as family". In December 2012, Fitzgerald {{conducted}} her first magazine interview and spoke of a storyline where Abi comforts Lauren over a relationship break up, saying [...] "It's nice to see the little [...] taking care of the bigger one." ...|$|E

500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian. While {{reading from a}} piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: [...] "I {{have heard of the}} charges made by Stan Love, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> outrageous, which means they are out of the ballpark... I feel great." [...] Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Green had {{her film}} debut, when {{director}} Bernardo Bertolucci cast {{her for the}} role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes. [...] Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to [...] "have the same destiny as Maria Schneider", because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris. Green said that with Bertolucci's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler. Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, [...] "here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> frightened by sex." [...] Her next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin's love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.|$|E
500|$|The fictional {{character}} Stingaree {{proved to}} be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell's Magazine, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series [...] "In the Chains of Crime" [...] was published in June that year, titled [...] "The Ides of March". The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name The Amateur Cracksman, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders [...] "were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie" [...] (Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: [...] "To A.C.D. This form of flattery". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that [...] "there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that [...] "stern moralists" [...] would consider the book's premise [...] "as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left The Spectator reviewer [...] "expressing [...] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Salahuddin had {{observed}} Nabi and his teammate Stirling throughout their BPL campaigns and didn't spot {{much of a}} difference between them and cricketers from Test nations. [...] "I don't see them much different, they seem to catch on-field situations quickly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very hungry," [...] he said.

5000|$|Later in 2010, new {{producer}} Paul Marquess axed the family, except Andrew Moss (Rhys), {{as part of}} his {{overhaul of}} the series. Neville, Suzanne, and Josh left for Spain in July 2010. Rigby expressed her feelings towards the family's exit, saying: [...] "I'm sad it's coming to an end. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> quite emotional when <b>they</b> left. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> quite ready to go.

5000|$|According to Williams, Leroy Jethro Moore could recur on NCIS. [...] "That's {{the whole}} idea, that he's {{recurring}} character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{happy about the}} way things turn out, so I would suspect I'd be back on there." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{one time}} Wren was {{credited}} with {{the design of the}} King's House at Newmarket, Suffolk. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which Charles II, who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that [...] "They were high enough!", at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, [...] "Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> high enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Poet {{and author}} of Iron John, Robert Bly, wrote about Peters' American Poetry Bakeoff book of {{criticism}} as [...] "not maternal ... insights are set down simply, unornamented, as if intended to glance off, and yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> important, and belong to the center ... He deserves numerous readers, particularly among young poets dissatisfied with the celebrities who keep writing the same poem {{over and over again}} ... essay on Robert Creeley is superb; the best essay on his work I know." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was, I wouldn't say hypocritical. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{genuinely}} {{happy to}} see a Chinese director win an Academy Award with good artistic value. I think that pride is genuine, so I would not think that's hypocritical at all. Not only in my judgment, I literally meet people who are genuinely happy. No, no, I don't think so, it's just like they don't want homosexual movie shown in the movies, it's hard to put American logic... It's just something else. I don't know how to describe it, it's just something else. So what can I say?"The word [...] "brokeback" [...] (...) has entered the Chinese lexicon as a slang word for homosexuality. As well as this, the film, upon its release was dubbed by the press [...] "the gay cowboy movie" [...] which is a term that was propelled into the American vernacular.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are [...] "ending for a while". [...] "I'm feeling {{optimistic about the future}} no matter what happens at this point", Ranaldo said. [...] "It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, {{there was a little bit}} of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling – you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that [...] It remains to be seen at this point what happens. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I'd just leave it at that." [...] Ranaldo also suggested there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. [...] "There's tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just happy right now to let the future take its course." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's sound {{has been}} {{described}} as emo pop, pop, pop rock, and power pop. Gaskarth felt the album was [...] "more of a pop-rock/alt-rock album for us. There are definitely elements of pop punk—where we came from. But this album was an effort to develop our sound and hone in [...] on great songwriting rather than conform to the boundaries of a certain genre." [...] Gaskarth mentioned that they [...] "took influence from our older stuff in some of the songs, but in others we went in a new direction, whether that was poppier or more rock or just weird." [...] Gaskarth added that [...] "We stripped a lot of the bells and whistles out this time and I think the songs are better off for it." [...] Barakat said the album was [...] "a good mix of faster type typical ATL songs and also some slow ballad type songs." [...] He added [...] "there are a lot of pop songs, as well as a lot rock songs. There isn’t a mix of the two. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a lot more distinguished this time around." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
5000|$|Pinter {{himself was}} quick to defend the cast and the show, saying [...] "I'm all for it. I admire these people in Pinter's People. <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> they're a great bunch - they're so robust and energetic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> terrific." ...|$|R
5000|$|McCartney said of {{this song}} and other album tracks, [...] "It's {{a bit much}} to call them fillers because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{a bit more than}} that, and each one of them made it past the Beatles test. We all had to like it." ...|$|R

[...] He also explained why they decided to replace Brian with another dog, saying: [...] "It felt like the way that this show was conceived by Seth all those years ago, was this entire family unit including the parents, kids and a dog. So by losing Brian, {{it felt like a}} void needed to be filled both comically, and also for the interpersonal relationships between all the characters. We felt that we needed to fill that role." ...|$|R
