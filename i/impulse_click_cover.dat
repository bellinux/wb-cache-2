5000|$|Evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} are currently evoked using three different methodologies. Stimulus Frequency OAEs (SFOAEs) are measured during {{the application of}} a pure-tone stimulus, and are detected by the vectorial difference between the stimulus waveform and the recorded waveform (which consists of the sum of the stimulus and the OAE). Transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs or TrOAEs) are evoked using a click (broad frequency range) or toneburst (brief duration pure tone) stimulus. The evoked response from a <b>click</b> <b>covers</b> the frequency range up to around 4 kHz, while a toneburst will elicit a response from the region that has the same frequency as the pure tone. Distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs) are evoked using a pair of primary tones [...] and [...] with particular intensity (usually either 65 - 55 dBSPL or 65 for both) and ratio (...) [...] The evoked responses from these stimuli occur at frequencies (...) mathematically related to the primary frequencies, with the two most prominent being [...] (the [...] "cubic" [...] distortion tone, most commonly used for hearing screening) and [...] (the [...] "quadratic" [...] distortion tone, or simple difference tone).|$|R

The primary use of PAM is for detecting bioemissions, a good proportion of which are <b>impulse</b> sounds or <b>clicks.</b> A click detection algorithm based on kurtosis estimation is proposed as a general automatic click detector. The detector works {{under the assumption that}} click trains are embedded in stochastic but Gaussian noise. Under this assumption, kurtosis is used as a statistical test for detection. The algorithm explores acoustic sequences with the optimal frequency bandwidth for focusing on impulse sounds. The detector is successfully applied to field observations, and operates under weak signal to noise ratios and in presence of stochastic background noise. The algorithm adapts to varying click center frequency. Kurtosis appears as a promising approach to detect click trains, alone or in combination with other clicks detector, and to isolate individual clicks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Interaural {{level and}} time {{differences}} (ILD and ITD) are important cues for localizing sound and segregating signal from noise. Evidence indicates that auditory cortex (AC) plays {{a critical role}} in mammalian sound localization, but models of AC binaural processing remain underspecified. A series of experiments was conducted to systematically characterize fMRI tuning to binaural stimulation in human AC. To investigate processing of ILD versus monaural sound, Experiment 1 collected responses to narrowband-filtered Gabor <b>click</b> <b>impulses</b> varying in ILD, average binaural level, monotic level, and presentation rate. Response to monotic sound was greater contralateral to ear of presentation and binaural responses grew with increasingly contralateral ILD values. Contralateral bias was more modest for ILD than for monotic stimulation, and the relationship in bias across the stimulus types was weak, suggesting that ILD tuning is partially independent of monaural level sensitivity. Binaural suppression was observed for diotic and dichotic ILD sound and may actively shape ILD sensitivity. Experiments 2 and 3 presented parametrically modulated ILD and ITD cues carried by Gabor click trains (ILD GCT and ITD GCT). Consistent with Exp. 1, results showed contralateral tuning to ILD GCT, but little tuning to ITD GCT. Additional experiments manipulated ITD in broadband noise-burst trains (ITD NBT; Experiment 4) and in low-frequency noise (ITD LPN; Experiment 5). Modest contralateral tuning to ITD NBT was observed, but only in left hemisphere, consistent with previous neuroimaging and clinical lesion data. Further analysis revealed a similar asymmetry in response to ILD GCT. Analyses of stimulus history effects showed that contralateral tuning to ILD GCT and ITD NBT was enhanced by exposure to prior ipsilateral sound, particularly in right hemisphere responses to ITD, potentially serving to minimize the left hemisphere asymmetry observed. Stimulus history analyses also showed greater sensitivity to "outward" (probe sound more lateralized than adaptor) versus "inward" (adaptor more lateralized than probe) sound location change for both ILD and ITD, consistent with opponent-channel models of binaural processing. Differences in the degree of contralateral bias and hemispheric asymmetry across cue types may be due to reduced BOLD sensitivity to ITD, rather than reflecting distinct AC processing mechanisms for ILD and ITD...|$|R
