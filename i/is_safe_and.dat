5|$|While {{more studies}} of the {{long-term}} effects of the drugs are needed, specially for the newest treatments, existing data on the effects of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate that early-initiated long-term therapy <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> it is related to better outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E

5|$|Hanada and Kasuga {{pick up a}} car {{designated}} for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

5|$|Marsden first {{arrives in}} Albert Square in March 2001, {{investigating}} Phil Mitchell's shooting {{in her first}} case as detective chief inspector. She identifies the five main suspects: Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Marsden arrests Dan for the shooting, although he is later acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. Dan was set up by Phil but it was, in fact, Lisa who shot him. Marsden later arrests Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) for the attempted murder of her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). Little Mo claims self-defence, since she has been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of Trevor. The trial ends, with Trevor's treatment of Little Mo revealed. In 2003, Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) visits Marsden with evidence that Phil killed his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Jill helps set up a honey-trap for Phil in order to obtain a confession from him, with PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and DI Dominic Price (Paul Brennen), but it fails when Kate falls in love with Phil and Marsden fires her. Marsden arrests Phil, but with insufficient evidence and no confession he is released. It later emerges that Lisa <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> well, and Phil is innocent. Marsden later arrests Phil when Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) set him up in an armed robbery.|$|E
5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having {{to accept the fact that}} Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} forms of {{analgesia}} {{suitable for the}} treatment of pain in babies: paracetamol (acetaminophen), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the opioids.

Of the opioids, morphine and fentanyl are most often used in a hospital setting, while codeine is effective for use at home.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} have passed safety standards limiting {{the types of}} toys that can be sold.

Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> what is dangerous, and parents do not always think of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.|$|E

A later study comparing female dogs spayed between 4 and 6 months and after 6 months showed no increased risk.|$|E
