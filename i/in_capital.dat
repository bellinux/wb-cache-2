50|$|An antiquated {{practice}} that still remains in use, especially by older American lawyers {{who grew up}} {{before the arrival of}} computers, is to use all-caps text for text that is legally required to be emphasised and clearly readable. The practice dates to the period of typewriters, which generally did not offer bold text, small capitals, or the opportunity to add marginal notes emphasising key points. Legal writing expert Bryan A. Garner has described the practice as 'ghastly'. In 2002, a US court spoke out against the practice, ruling that simply making text all-capitals has no bearing on whether it is clear and easily readable:Lawyers who think their caps lock keys are instant “make conspicuous” buttons are deluded. In determining whether a term is conspicuous, we look at more than formatting. A term that appears <b>in</b> <b>capitals</b> can still be inconspicuous if it is hidden {{on the back of a}} contract in small type. Terms that are <b>in</b> <b>capitals</b> but also appear in hard-to-read type may flunk the conspicuousness test. A sentence <b>in</b> <b>capitals,</b> buried deep within a long paragraph <b>in</b> <b>capitals</b> will probably not be deemed conspicuous...it is entirely possible for text to be conspicuous without being <b>in</b> <b>capitals.</b>|$|R

At the end of that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased.

Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E
