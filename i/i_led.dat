He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 {{and sentenced to}} a term of 10 years. President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence in December 1921. Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a sanatorium due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison. He has since been cited as the inspiration for numerous politicians.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War <b>I,</b> <b>led</b> {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War <b>I</b> <b>led</b> to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1531 Peter IV Rareş invaded Poland {{in order}} to reoccupy the Pocuţia region (in modern Ukraine), but his army was defeated. Now he {{concluded}} a secret treaty with Ferdinand I of Hungary, but soon had to seek refugee in Transylvania when Suleiman <b>I</b> <b>led</b> an army against him. This was the first occasion when a prince, Stephen V Lăcustă (15381540) was appointed by the sultan. At the same time, the sultan occupied Brăila and Tighina (now in Moldova), and the Budjak region (now in Ukraine). Peter IV Rareş recovered his throne {{in exchange for a}} large sum of money in 1541. His death was followed by a period characterized by fights between pretenders to the throne and among the boyar parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{challenge to}} naval artillery was {{the advent of}} aircraft and armour piercing/incendiary bombs, {{which could be used}} against land based targets in support of troop formations ashore. Although in its infancy during and after World War I, some saw the potential for aircraft and sea based air support and envisioned the role it would have in future conflicts. Among the more notable individuals within the United States was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell had served in World War I, where he eventually commanded all U.S. aircraft in the war and was responsible for leading Allied aircraft in support of the ground offensive during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, one of the first coordinated air-ground offensives in history. Mitchell's experience in World War <b>I</b> <b>led</b> him to believe that battleships were out of date, and he became an increasingly vocal proponent of air power.|$|E

A higher value of P constant indicates a higher concentration of non-radiative recombination centers. At the linear region of the power law fitting curve of PD-EL, the obtained P constants for <b>LED</b> <b>I</b> and <b>LED</b> II are 1.82 and 2.21, respectively; non-radiative recombination centers are greatly decreased in <b>LED</b> <b>I.</b> With the driving current increasing, the increasing rate of PD-EL curves of two devices decrease and gradually merge with each other as one. It is dominated by non-radiative Auger recombination, since the driving current in this region is high. The two LEDs are quenched at high driving current, so that the two curves are gradually becoming identical. <b>LED</b> <b>I</b> and <b>LED</b> II have similar geometric structures, except for the nucleation layer which causes different GaN growth crystal quality, that influence performance of the devices.|$|R

5|$|The English Civil War was {{a battle}} over not only {{religious}} and political beliefs, but also economic and social as well. This war was between Parliamentarians and Royalists and took place from 1642 to 1651, but was broken into several separate engagements. Charles I and his supporters experienced the first two periods of the war, which resulted in King Charles I dissolving Parliament, which would not be called into session again for over ten years. Reasons for this dismissal were because supporters of Long Parliament tried to install two resolutions into English law. One called for consequences against individuals that taxed {{without the consent of}} Parliament and labeled them as enemies of England, while the other stated that innovations in religion would result in the same tag. Each of these policies was aimed at Charles I, in that he was inferior leader as well as a supporter of Catholicism. This prompted the Puritan Revolt and eventually led to the trial and execution of Charles I for treason. The final stage of the English Civil War came in 1649, and lasted until 1651. This time, King Charles II, the son of Charles <b>I</b> <b>led</b> supporters against Parliament. The Battle of Worcester, which took place in 1651, marked the end of the English Civil War. Charles II and other royalist forces were defeated by Parliamentarians and their leader Oliver Cromwell. This war began to take England in different directions regarding religious and political beliefs as well as economic and social. Also, the war constitutionally established that no British monarch was permitted to rule without first having been approved by Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 Pierre Barbet wrote a long study called A Doctor at Calvary {{which was}} later {{published}} as a book.

This was, however, prevented by the Treaty of Saint Germain and the Treaty of Versailles. In 1930, three years before the Nazi era, there were roughly 94 million people all over the world claiming German ancestry, or about 4,5% of the world population at the time.|$|E

The Brixia was later to be sold to the civilian market but the outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>led</b> to the cancellation of the project.|$|E

These highly mobile mounted infantry formed the basis of the Boer Commando, which was the primary organisational unit of the Boers.|$|E

In the summer of 1918 the US government threatened to close the border if Mexican authorities refused to help stop the “food running”.|$|E
