5|$|Old Louisville is a {{historic}} district and neighborhood in central Louisville, Kentucky, USA. It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture. It is also unique in {{that a majority of}} its structures are made of brick, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S. Many of the buildings are in the Victorian-era styles of Romanesque, Queen Anne, Italianate, among others; and a large number of blocks have had <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> buildings razed.

Metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents, but could not require other Metro departments to implement its recommendations. Following several safety lapses, the Federal Transit Administration assumed oversight at WMATA.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E

This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E

5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be better at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E
5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, {{such as the}} silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E

Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E

5|$|The Metroid series {{contains}} gameplay {{elements from}} shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> other characters to interact with. The series {{has been a}} 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs.|$|E
5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are <b>few</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of the board in {{monitoring}} corporate risk. Proponents of riskrelated governance structures such risk committees or Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programs contend that risk monitoring adds value by ensuring that corporate risks are managed. An alternative view is that such governance structures are nothing more than window-dressing in response to regulatory or public pressure. Consistent with the former view, I find that, in the period before the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis, firms with more observable risk oversight structures exhibit (i) lower idiosyncratic and systematic equity risk, (ii) lower credit risk, and (iii) less extreme performance than firms with <b>fewer</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> observable risk oversight structures. I also provide evidence that firms with more observable risk oversight structures experienced higher returns during the worst days of the recent financial crisis and were less susceptible to market fluctuations than firms with <b>fewer</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> observable risk oversight structures. Finally, I find that firms without observable risk oversight structures experienced higher abnormal returns to recent legislative events relating to risk management than firms with observable risk oversight structures...|$|R
