40|$|Objective: {{what do we}} mean by a {{psychological}} intervention {{in the context of}} cancer care? It is critical to know what treatments are included under this term, if data from diverse treatment trials are to be summarized in order to inform clinical practice. We, therefore, aimed to determine how the term psychological intervention has been defined and used to group and compare interventions in reviews of cancer care. Methods: we conducted a review of existing reviews (a metareview). These included systematic and narrative reviews and meta-analyses of interventions that were described as psychological, with the aim of determining: (a) the definitions for psychological interventions that were used and (b) the treatments that were included within this category. Results: we identified 66 relevant reviews. Surprisingly, we were unable to find any explicit definition of the term psychological intervention in these reviews. The reviews included 79 different treatments with little consistency between reviews in which treatments were included. Conclusions: there is confusion about what psychological intervention means in the cancer review literature. A clearer definition is essential to summarize research findings. We propose that rather than simply grouping interventions as psychological, it would be more useful if reviews focussed on specified domains of the interventions, namely content, proposed mechanism, target outcome, and methods of delivery. This would enable greater specificity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>question,</b> more meaningful comparisons, and would hopefully provide clearer answers for the readers of the reviews. A checklist for the summarizing of reports of interventions for review is provided. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Background: There are few collations {{of outcome}} {{measures}} {{used to evaluate}} UK nursing and midwifery practice. This paper makes a clear contribution to our existing knowledge by exposing the range and robustness of outcome measure available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evaluation of nursing and midwifery practice. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> <b>questions</b> answered <b>in</b> this paper are: 1) what patient outcome measures {{have been used in}} studies of nursing and midwifery practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK within the last decade? 2) to what extent have the instruments been tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for validity and reliability with the respective patient populations? <b>The</b> <b>review</b> was conducted <b>in</b> 2002 / 3. Methods: Conventional methods for systematic reviews guided this work. These included: 1) defining terms to be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>review,</b> 2) searching for published and grey literature relevant to <b>the</b> two <b>review</b> <b>questions,</b> 3) selecting studies from this literature that would help to answer <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>questions,</b> 4) appraising studies to further determine their rigor and appropriateness <b>in</b> answering <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>questions</b> and 5) synthesising the findings to enable a comprehensive view of outcome measures used to evaluate nursing and midwifery to be formed. Results and Conclusions: This systematic review identified numerous patient outcome measures, across a range of specialisms, available for the assessment of nursing and midwifery practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> also highlighted <b>the</b> extent to which the instruments have been tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK for validity and reliability and showed the need for further testing of new instruments.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a narrative synthesis of a systematic literature review relating to multi-agency interoperability and major incident decision-making in high risk, high stake environments. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> methodology includes <b>the</b> identification of relevant studies, a critical appraisal of <b>the</b> concepts inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>review</b> <b>question</b> and a narrative {{synthesis of the}} central themes {{that relate to the}} study as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> firstly outlines what, currently, appear to be the perceived defining features of successful interoperability by using the SAFE-T phase model of major incident decision-making. It then considers whether these defining features are realistically achievable in major incident practice. Findings suggest that the current definition of an interoperable network is too demanding for the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of the major incident task environment. Individual teams tend to focus on agency-specific behaviour, as opposed to coordinated multi-team functioning, and so collective interoperability is not achieved. Inevitably, this reduces the ability to perform collaborative behaviours, including decision-making and action implementation. The paper concludes that aiming for the current conceptualisation of interoperability along a hierarchical command structure may actually inhibit effective decision-making. Instead, multi-agency systems would do better to work towards an improved understanding of a non-hierarchical and decentralised yet interoperable major incident management network. Recommendations include the need to relate theory and practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of multi-agency decision-making via simulation-based training and to deepen our understanding of interoperability to prevent inertia in high risk, high stake major incident environments...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Delirium {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} within critical care and {{is linked to}} adverse clinical outcomes, increased mortality and impaired quality of life. Development of delirium {{is thought to be}} caused by multiple risk factors, including disruption of the circadian rhythm. Chronotherapeutic interventions, such as light therapy, music and use of eye shades, have been suggested as an option to improve circadian rhythm within intensive care units. AIM: This review aims to answer the question: Can chronotherapy reduce the prevalence of delirium in adult patients in critical care? DESIGN: This study is a systematic review of quantitative studies. RESEARCH METHOD: Six major electronic databases were searched, and a hand search was undertaken using selected key search terms. Research quality was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme tools. The studies were critically appraised by both authors independently, and data were extracted. Four themes addressing the research question were identified and critically evaluated. FINDINGS: Six primary research articles that investigated different methods of chronotherapy were identified, and the results suggest that multi-component non-pharmacological interventions are the most effective for reducing the prevalence of delirium <b>in</b> critical care. <b>The</b> melatonergic agonist Ramelteon demonstrated statistically significant reductions <b>in</b> delirium; however, <b>the</b> reliability of <b>the</b> results <b>in</b> answering <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>question</b> was limited by the research design. The use of bright light therapy (BLT) and dynamic light application had mixed results, with issues with the research design and outcomes measured limiting the validity of the findings. CONCLUSION: Multi-component non-pharmacological interventions, such as noise and light control, can reduce delirium in critical care, whereas other interventions, such as BLT, have mixed outcomes. Melatonin, as a drug, may be a useful alternative to sedative-hypnotics. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Chronotherapy can reduce the incidence of delirium within critical care, although further research is warranted.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary artery stents are {{prosthetic}} linings {{inserted into}} coronary arteries via a catheter {{to widen the}} artery and increase blood flow to ischaemic heart muscle. They are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). IHD is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality (123, 000 deaths per annum) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK and a major cost to the NHS. Clinical effects of IHD include subacute manifestations (stable and unstable angina) and acute manifestations (particularly myocardial infarction [MI]). Treatment includes attention to risk factors, drug therapy, percutaneous invasive interventions (PCIs) (including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA] and stents) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last decade there has been a steady and significant increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rate of PCIs for IHD. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> UK, rates per million population increased from 174 in 1991 to 437 in 1998. Stents are now used in about 70 % of PCIs. Data from the rest of Europe suggest there is potential for PCI and stent rates to increase considerably. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> UK there is evidence of under-provision and inequity of access to revascularisation procedures. OBJECTIVES: The following questions were addressed. 1. What are the effects and effectiveness of elective stent insertion versus PTCA in subacute IHD, particularly stable angina and unstable angina? 2. What are the effects and effectiveness of elective stent insertion versus CABG in subacute IHD, particularly stable angina and unstable angina? 3. What are the effects and effectiveness of elective stent insertion versus PTCA in acute MI (AMI) ? 4. What are best estimates of UK cost for elective stent insertion, PTCA and CABG <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of <b>review</b> <b>questions</b> 1 to 3 ? 5. What are best estimates of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility for elective stent insertion relative to PTCA or CABG <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of <b>review</b> <b>questions</b> 1 to 3 ? METHODS: A systematic <b>review</b> addressing <b>the</b> objectives was undertaken. DATA SOURCES: A search was made for RCTs comparing stents (inserted during a PTCA procedure) with PTCA alone or with CABG in any manifestation of IHD. The search strategy covered the period from 1990 to November 1999 and included searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIDS ISI, The Cochrane Library), Internet sites, and hand-searches of cardiology conference abstracts and 1999 issues of cardiology journals. Lead researchers and local clinical experts were contacted. Manufacturers' submissions to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence were searched. The search strategy was expanded to look for relevant economic analyses and information to inform the economic model (including searching MEDLINE, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness). Searches focused on research that reported costs and quality of life data associated with IHD and interventional cardiology. STUDY SELECTION: For <b>the</b> <b>review</b> of clinical effectiveness, inclusion criteria were: (i) RCT design; (ii) study population comprising adults with IHD in native or graft vessels (including patients with subacute IHD or AMI); (iii) procedure involving elective insertion of coronary artery stents; (iv) elective PTCA (including PTCA with provisional stenting) or CABG as comparator; (v) outcomes defined as one or more of: combined event rate (or event-free survival), death, MI, angina, target vessel revascularisation, CABG, repeat PTCA, angiographic outcomes; (vi) trials that had closed and reported results for all or almost all recruited patients. For the economic evaluation, studies of adults with IHD were included if they were of the following types: studies reporting UK costs; comparative economic evaluation combining both costs and outcomes; economic evaluations reporting costs and outcomes separately for the years 1998 and 1999 (to ensure current practice was included).

40|$|Abstract Background Balanced {{decisions}} {{about health care}} interventions require reliable evidence on harms as well as benefits. Most systematic reviews focus on efficacy and randomised trials, for which the methodology is well established. Methods to systematically review harmful effects are less well developed and there are few sources of guidance for researchers. We present our own recent experience of conducting systematic reviews of harmful effects and make suggestions for future practice and further research. Methods We described and compared <b>the</b> methods used <b>in</b> three systematic reviews. Our evaluation focused on <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>question,</b> study designs and quality assessment. Results One <b>review</b> <b>question</b> focused on providing information on specific harmful effects to furnish an economic model, the other two addressed much broader <b>questions.</b> All three <b>reviews</b> included randomised and observational data, although each defined the inclusion criteria differently. Standard methods {{were used to assess}} study quality. Various practical problems were encountered <b>in</b> applying <b>the</b> study design inclusion criteria and assessing quality, mainly because of poor study design, inadequate reporting and the limitations of existing tools. All three reviews generated a large volume of work that did not yield much useful information for health care decision makers. The key areas for improvement we identified were focusing <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>question</b> and developing methods for quality assessment of studies of harmful effects. Conclusions Systematic reviews of harmful effects are more likely to yield information pertinent to clinical decision-making if they address a focused question. This will enable clear decisions to be made about the type of research to include <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>review.</b> <b>The</b> methodology for assessing the quality of harmful effects data in systematic reviews requires further development. </p...|$|R

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: It {{was with}} great {{interest}} that we read the recent article by Whiting and colleagues (1) introducing the QUADAS- 2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool, a revision of the tool from 2003 (2). It is important that such pivotal method-ological work about diagnostic review research is made widely avail-able through publication in Annals of Internal Medicine. We would like to discuss some issues related to QUADAS- 2, as some of them attracted our attention when reading the otherwise im-pressive article. First, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original QUADAS tool (2), items 1 and 2 related to variability {{with the potential to}} affect clinical generalizability (external validity) of study results. The term “applicability ” is commonly used as a synonym (3). But, in QUADAS- 2, “applicability ” refers to whether certain aspects of an individual study are matching or not matching <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>question</b> (1). During a systematic <b>review,</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>question</b> (according to Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Out...|$|R
