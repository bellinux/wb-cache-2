Sommerfeld taught an {{advanced}} course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed.

When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received Erwin Schrödinger's papers on wave mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Apocryphal and semi-legendary anecdotal stories {{surround}} {{the creation of}} Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he {{is known to have}} dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, organisational and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community <b>for</b> <b>discussion.</b> The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.|$|E
5|$|At this conference, {{which was}} {{organised}} by Britain with American support, Van der Byl {{rejected the idea}} of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified {{as one of the few}} ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement. The conference was adjourned by the British foreign minister, Anthony Crosland, on 14 December 1976, and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic <b>for</b> <b>discussion.</b> Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.|$|E

5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill.

5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason as a basis <b>for</b> <b>discussion,</b> containing such points important {{to him as the}} requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> and to ensure graduates stay in touch with the university.|$|E

5|$|The central {{administration}} at Huế {{was divided into}} six ministries: Public affairs, finance, rites, war, justice and public works. Each was under a minister, assisted by two deputies {{and two or three}} councillors. Each of these ministries had around 70 employees assigned to various units. The heads of these ministries formed the Supreme Council. A treasurer general and a Chief of the Judicial Service assisted a governor general, {{who was in charge of}} a number of provinces. The provinces were classified into trấn and dinh. These were in turn divided into phủ, huyện and châu. All important matters were examined by the Supreme Council in the presence of Gia Long. The officials tabled their reports <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> and decision-making. The bureaucrats involved in the Supreme Council were selected from the high-ranking mandarins of the six ministries and the academies.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} came in <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were {{not suitable for}} ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available by the spring, 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were rescued from the sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had rescued 1,684 aircrew out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 aircrew and 60 other personnel were rescued. During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal Command. In all, 10,663 persons were rescued by Coastal Command in ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied aircrew, 277 enemy aircrew, and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{frequently}} {{used as an}} ambassador by the king, James I of Scotland. According to the 16th century Bishop of Ross and historian John Lesley, Henry {{was one of the}} men sent to England to arrange the ransom of King James - held in England for most of his youth, not being released until 1424. On 9 June 1425, he and other prelates received a safe-conduct from King Henry VI of England enabling them to travel through England on their way to visit Pope Martin V at Rome. In 1428, Henry was the leader of an embassy sent to King Charles VII of France for a marriage proposal and to renew the Franco-Scottish alliance, and in January 1430, was sent into England <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> of various grievances. On 31 March 1434, Lichton is found in attendance at the Council of Basel, though no more details of his activities there have survived.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2008, Brown's {{leadership}} {{was presented with}} a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of {{holding on to the}} Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the Autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards. McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines {{applied in}} 1990 for {{permission}} to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which {{according to the company}} was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the mean time, Tjæreborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became a political issue within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party were both in favor of increased deregulation of the airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabiet resigned on 3 November over issues regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made.|$|E
5|$|The three {{language}} formula was {{not strictly}} enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession {{to the south}} was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort {{to follow through with}} that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved <b>for</b> <b>discussion</b> by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time.|$|E
