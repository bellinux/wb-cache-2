One such flash flood caused {{a bridge to}} collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route.

25|$|The Australia XI {{match against}} the MCC {{used to be}} seen as {{virtually}} another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950–51 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, but he was too ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss a tired Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> that John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{played in}} the World Series two years earlier, the 1986 Padres {{finished}} in fourth place in the National League West with a disappointing record of 74–88. The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by Larry Bowa on October 24, 1986. Boros said at the time, [...] "I was prepared {{for the fact that}} I wouldn't be coming back. ... It's like the good news and bad news joke. The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> {{that at the end of}} the season I hadn't been fired. The bad news was I hadn't been rehired." ...|$|E
40|$|Is {{it always}} wise to boast about <b>good</b> <b>news?</b> When {{messages}} <b>are</b> verifiable, the standard result from disclosure games <b>is</b> that <b>good</b> <b>news</b> should <b>be</b> disclosed or the receiver will infer that the sender has nothing favorable to report. We reconsider this conclusion when the receiver has private information about sender type. Because better senders expect {{the receiver to}} have more favorable private information about them, {{we find that the}} worst sender type with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> has the most incentive to disclose it. Therefore reporting <b>good</b> <b>news</b> can paradoxically make an unfavorable impression. If the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently rare a unique disclosure equilibrium exists in which <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> disclosed. But if the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> attainable even by mediocre types then two understatement equilibria always exist: a nondisclosure equilibrium in which all types withhold <b>good</b> <b>news</b> and a countersignaling equilibrium in which mediocre types report <b>good</b> <b>news</b> but the best types withhold it. When such equilibria exist, the sender has a legitimate fear of looking overly eager to reveal <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Having a third party disclose the news, or mandating that the sender disclose the news, eliminates this problem...|$|R

2500|$|With a pair {{of centuries}} against the strongest state side in Australia Cowdrey was called up for his debut in the First Test at Brisbane, even though he made 4 and 0 against Queensland. Hutton put Australia in to bat and saw them pile up 601/8. The only <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> that Cowdrey took {{the first of his}} record 120 Test catches to dismiss both Australian openers Les Favell and Arthur Morris. When England finally got to bat on the third day they {{promptly}} collapsed to 25/4, but Cowdrey made 40 and added 72 for the 5th wicket with Trevor Bailey. This did not prevent the follow on, where Cowdrey made 10, and England lost by an innings.|$|E

In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was [...] "obvious in retrospect; but it certainly {{took me a while}} to see it. ...

40|$|Is {{it always}} wise to {{disclose}} <b>good</b> <b>news?</b> We {{find that the}} worst sender with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> has the most incentive to disclose it, so reporting <b>good</b> <b>news</b> can paradoxically make the sender look bad. If the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> attainable by sufficiently mediocre types, or if the sender is already expected to be of a relatively high type, withholding <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> an equilibrium so the standard “unraveling ” argument does not hold.

6000|$|The boys came {{sliding down}} the trail wildly excited, driving the horses before them, and by 5.30 we were all packed on the boat, one hundred and twenty horses and some two dozen men.

6000|$|Now {{her main}} hope was her husband's book: that might save him, yet raise his self-respect to normal. She awaited eagerly {{a letter of}} acceptance. To watch for it without {{appearing}} to do so was difficult. Once she had missed the postman. Still undoubtedly she would have heard {{in the event of}} good news, and <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> sure! To-day, something seemed to cheer her, in spite of Philip's depression. Perhaps it was spring, glorious spring! March had come in as a veritable lamb, and after balmy days Isabel dreaded lowering clouds and rain. As long as she could drive Philip over the country time must appear to pass naturally, while in temporary confinement it would be harder to keep up pretenses. Already what is known in California as a [...] "weather breeder" [...] seemed to overcharge the senses, and even as Isabel left the foothills for the the homeward down-grade spin she felt a change. By early evening clouds were forming above the mountains; next day the sun refused to shine, and by night it rained so hard that March took on an Eastern temper and announced a storm. Isabel was disturbed at the prospect of seclusion. Once she had loved rain as well as sunshine, but now she listened to the incessant downpour with sinking heart. If only the publisher's letter would come. She realized anew her husband's strange condition, which instead of lifting was getting worse. Despondency was gnawing at his self-respect. He was ill, shattered beyond his own control. And his wife felt powerless to call a physician. For Philip had been obdurate with their home-coming, had refused to consult a doctor. Isabel feared to press the matter, yet wondered if she were wise to wait. Perhaps Philip's sudden fall had been more than mere fainting! The shock of public dishonor might have broken a blood vessel of his brain--a vessel so tiny that consciousness had soon returned. She told herself {{that at the end of}} the storm she would unburden her full story to a reliable specialist, then bring him to see her husband. She could no longer endure the strain alone. The determination brought her comfort, while with the force of her definite will she began to plan for intervening hours of rain. First of all, the open fire of the living-room should not die down a moment. Like a vestal watching her lamp, she piled on wood until the dark paneled walls reflected the glow of a rising blaze. Then she enticed Philip and Reginald and madame about the hearth. Cheer within made compelling contrast to a dreary outside. And all day long she strove to divert her husband's mind from desperate musing. Madame read in French, or the boy manipulated toy automobiles between the rugs; and when these things failed, the latest liveliest music was run off on a really fine mechanical piano which until now had been practically forgotten. By early bedtime the strenuous day seemed an improvement on previous ones with pensive opportunity in the open. Isabel was hopeful, glad to believe that Philip would sleep. She felt weary herself, and sank to rest without the usual effort of nights past, and rain fell on.|$|E
