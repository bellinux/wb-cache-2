5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the <b>foreskin</b> over the glans penis. At birth, the <b>foreskin</b> cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the <b>foreskin</b> and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the <b>foreskin</b> naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the <b>foreskin</b> by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the <b>foreskin.</b> Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|The <b>foreskin</b> extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed {{theories}} for the purpose of the <b>foreskin</b> are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The <b>foreskin</b> may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the <b>foreskin</b> at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the <b>foreskin</b> from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the <b>foreskin</b> is opened, adhesions are removed, and the <b>foreskin</b> is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the <b>foreskin</b> is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E

5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the <b>foreskin</b> of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision – {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother 'Please accept from me a promise that I will always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the <b>foreskin</b> of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E
25|$|During puberty, if not before, the tip {{and opening}} of a boy's <b>foreskin</b> becomes wider, {{progressively}} allowing for retraction down the shaft of the penis and behind the glans, which ultimately should be possible without pain or difficulty. The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the <b>foreskin</b> with the glans disintegrates and releases the <b>foreskin</b> to separate from the glans. The <b>foreskin</b> then gradually becomes retractable.|$|E

40|$|Recently, an {{increase}} in incidences of urinary tract infections in uncircumcised male infants has been reported. However, determining {{what is the best}} management for the prepuce of newborns and infants is still to be solved. I investigated prospectively how much <b>foreskins</b> are retracted with age and what correlations it has with urinary tract infection in 122 males children below 15 years of age. Under 6 months of age, the majority of the <b>foreskins</b> were unretractable. As they got older, over 3 years of age, their prepuces became retractable. The incidence of bacteriuria was 11. 4 % in uncircumcised but none in circumcised and hypospadias. In 8 patients showing bacteriuria, their <b>foreskins</b> were retracted below 25 % in length. Among them, 5 patients, in whom E. coli were grown in their urine, showed radiologic renal abnormalities and suffered from high fever indicating systemic infection. However, the other 3 cases infected by Proteus mirabilis in their urine complained of only local penile symptoms...|$|R

Methods: A cross-sectional biomedical survey (ANRS- 12126) conducted in 2007 - 2008 among {{a random sample of}} 1198 men aged 15 to 49 from Orange Farm (South Africa). Face-to-face interviews were conducted by structured questionnaire. Recent HIV infections were evaluated using the BED incidence assay. Circumcision status was selfreported and clinically assessed.

Most respondents agreed that circumcised men could become HIV infected and needed to use condoms, although 19. 3 % (95 %CI: 17. 1 % to 21. 6 %) asserted that AMC protected fully against HIV.

40|$|Human {{telomerase}} RNA (hTER) {{expression in}} skin was examined by {{in situ hybridization}} analysis. All newborn <b>foreskins</b> examined (n = 5) expressed hTER in epidermal basal cells at moderate levels. Telomerase RNA was not detectable in most adult specimens from sun protected areas (six of seven), whereas all samples obtained from sun exposed areas (n = 8) showed moderate hTER signals in epidermal basal cells. Telomerase RNA was also detected at moderate to strong levels in basal cells of psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and the proliferative cells of the anagen hair bulb. Basal cell carcinoma samples (14 of 15) had moderate to high hTER expression throughout the entire tumor, whereas squamous cell carcinomas (seven of eight) showed variable intensities of hTER expression {{but only in the}} cells at the periphery of tumor nests. All melanomas examined (n = 5) had moderate hTER expression in all tumor cells. The hTER signal intensities in skin tumors did not correlate with the age or sex of the donors, the clinical history of the lesions, or the histologic subtypes. To address whether hTER expression correlated with the proliferative state, sequential sections were stained with anti-Ki- 67 antibody, a proliferation marker. In newborn <b>foreskins,</b> squamous cell carcinomas, and basal cell carcinomas, the distributions of hTER and Ki- 67 were similar but not always identical. Telomerase RNA was more abundant than Ki- 67 in the basal and suprabasal layer of newborn <b>foreskins,</b> suggesting that hTER expression is present both in actively cycling and in resting cells...|$|R
