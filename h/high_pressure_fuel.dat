25|$|In its Special Bulletin of 18 February 2008, the AAIB noted {{evidence}} that cavitation {{had taken place}} in both <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fuel</b> pumps, which could be indicative of a restriction in the fuel supply or excessive aeration of the fuel, although the manufacturer assessed both pumps as still being able to deliver full fuel flow. The report noted the aircraft had flown through air that was unusually cold (but not exceptionally so), and concluded that the temperature had not been low enough to freeze the fuel. Tests were continuing in an attempt to replicate the damage seen in the fuel pumps and to match this to the data recorded on the flight. A comprehensive examination and analysis was to be conducted on the entire aircraft and engine fuel system, including modelling fuel flows, taking account of environmental and aerodynamic effects.|$|E

5000|$|More {{expensive}} - much <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fuel</b> {{pumps are}} required to inject the fuel directly into the cylinder. This requires <b>fuel</b> <b>pressures</b> of up to 200 bar, much greater than a traditional multiport injection setup. See direct injection.|$|R
50|$|Turbopumps {{operate in}} much the same way as {{turbocharger}} units for vehicles: <b>higher</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pressures</b> allow <b>fuel</b> to be supplied to higher-pressure combustion chambers for higher-performance engines.|$|R
5000|$|Combat {{and some}} speed models use rubber tubing ("bladder" [...] tank), baby pacifiers, or {{fountain}} pen ink bladders, inflated with fuel {{from a large}} syringe, to hold the <b>fuel</b> under fairly <b>high</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>fuel</b> line is pinched off to prevent fuel loss until the engine is started. The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> of <b>fuel</b> delivery permits {{the use of a}} larger intake on the engine, allowing more air flow than would otherwise be possible, and thus more power. This type of fuel delivery {{is by far the most}} steady until the fuel finally runs out.|$|R

5000|$|Due to many quality {{failures}} by BMW, {{they have}} been forced for the USA market to extend the warranty on the <b>High</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Fuel</b> Pump and also the Injectors to 10 years[...] Owners in other regions are left without support.|$|E

50|$|The engine uses a Bosch <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> direct {{injection}} <b>fuel</b> system with <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> provided by two, cam driven <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> pumps which {{are driven by}} a dedicated camshaft. The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> pumps supply the fuel rails which in turn supply the three injectors for that bank with fuel at a controlled pressure.|$|R

2500|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{is responsible for}} introducing fuel to the combustion zone and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four primary types of {{fuel injector}}s; pressure-atomizing, air blast, vaporizing, and premix/prevaporizing injectors. <b>Pressure</b> atomizing <b>fuel</b> injectors rely on <b>high</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pressures</b> (as much as [...] ) to atomize the fuel. This type of fuel injector {{has the advantage of}} being very simple, but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to withstand such <b>high</b> <b>pressures,</b> and the <b>fuel</b> tends to be heterogeneously atomized, resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.|$|R
5000|$|It {{features}} an exclusive <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> direct <b>fuel</b> injection {{similar to the}} Pumpe Düse (PD) system found in Volkswagen's car engines, the Hydraulic Electronic Unit Injector - HEUI - with electro-hydraulic digital unit injectors and extended durability, developed by the partner company Siemens/VDO. [...] An important advantage is the removable wet cylinder liners which will assist with easier maintenance and lower costs.|$|R
50|$|<b>High</b> <b>pressures</b> {{within a}} reactor provide {{a driving force}} for {{dispersion}} of radioactive materials from a water-cooled reactor. Molten salt fuels and coolants have boiling points far above the SSR's operating temperature, so its core runs at atmospheric pressure. Physical separation of the steam generating system from the radioactive core {{by means of a}} secondary coolant loop eliminates that driving force from the reactor. <b>High</b> <b>pressures</b> within <b>fuel</b> tubes are avoided by venting off fission gases into the surrounding coolant salt.|$|R
50|$|This is why {{fuel flow}} is {{controlled}} automatically. Usually there are 2 systems, one {{to control the}} pressure {{and the other to}} control the flow. The inputs are usually from pressure and temperature probes from the intake and at various points through the engine. Also throttle inputs, engine speed etc. are required. These affect the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fuel</b> pump.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} Peugeot model, {{it is very}} problematic.

All within 3 years of ownership. The EP6 engine is very unreliable for certain countries especially those with humid or hot climates.|$|E

5000|$|One {{requirement}} of the design was {{the ability of the}} engine to be mounted both longitudinally and transversely. Improved fuel efficiency and compliance with Euro 5 emission standards were also design objectives, by 2010 being updated to the Euro 6 standard; four piezo-electric injectors fed with very <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fuel</b> from a common rail inject fuel directly into the combustion chambers to improve combustion compared to previous Mercedes Diesel engines and recirculated exhaust gas reduces the oxygen in the cylinders to [...] "starve" [...] any reactions that would produce NO(x).|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, {{these models}} {{suffered}} badly {{because of the}} summer heat. The electric fuel pump commonly overheated causing fuel to vaporise and render the engine inoperable until the pump cooled down. The overheating of the pump {{was caused by a}} combination of very <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>fuel</b> loads (over [...] ) and a pump that was adapted from what was originally a windscreen wiper motor. As such, it did not cope well with sustained pressures in moderate to high ambient temperatures. Because of the launch late in the Mk I's life, there are relatively few PIs in the original shape.|$|E

5000|$|The {{patented}} US 8432048 B1, hybrid engine, is a turbine-electric {{transmission system}} {{that can be used}} to power warships, airplanes, and power plants. The gas turbine engine includes a compressor, a combustor, and a turbine which are necessary to harness mechanical energy. Inside the gas turbine engine air is taken in and compressed in the cold section of the engine, and brought to a <b>higher</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>Fuel</b> is then sprayed in the air and ignites it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. The heated, high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The exhaust is fed into the power turbine used to power an output shaft for whatever desired application. The power turbine is also connected to the electric generator, which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electric generator driven by the power turbine charges the battery needed in order to drive the motor that supplies compressed air into the combustor.|$|R
