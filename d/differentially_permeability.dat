30|$|Disease states {{associated}} with inflammation like trauma, burns, sepsis, and acute pancreatitis {{are characterized by}} a marked reduction in the vascular endothelial glycocalyx [45]-[47]. The glycocalyx is the primary structure limiting free fluid flux across the vascular space [35]. Furthermore, if tissue injury also occurs, as often {{is the case in}} acute lung injury, vascular endothelial tight junction disruption will also occur in areas typically relatively resistant to fluid translocation, markedly opening up the interstitium to fluid translocation resulting in further imbalance between the intravascular and extravascular fluid and local interstitial edema [48]. Since different vascular regions of the body allow proteins to pass through the capillary membrane at different rates, as exemplified by the loose barrier in the liver and tight barrier in the brain, interstitial edema formation is not usually uniform throughout the body. Many of the plasma proteins in patients experiencing acute systemic inflammation will be cytokines and protein-bound hormones. Thus, the metabolic effect of <b>differentially</b> altered <b>permeability</b> and plasma leak {{may play a role in}} the regional expression of a generalized inflammatory response. Since most, if not all, fluid return from the extravascular space to the vasculature happens via lymphatic drainage [49], if transcapillary leakage is increased, the lymphatic system may become overwhelmed, further contributing to the development of edema and a relative intravascular volume deficit despite no actual loss of fluid outside the body. This fluid flux imbalance is accentuated further by slower lymphatic flow resulting from immobility in bedridden patients. Accumulation of intravascular fluid in the interstitial space is therefore dependent on multiple factors described in the Starling force equation above, permeability of the vascular membrane, as well as the capacity of the lymphatic system [50].|$|R
40|$|Gap-junctional {{intercellular}} communication {{is thought to}} be essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and growth control. Its perturbation entails toxicological implications and it has been correlated with the in vivo tumor-promoting potential of chemicals. Little is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for the tumor promoters interference with the cellular coupling. Moreover, nongenotoxic carcinogens, as well as connexins (gap-junctional protein subunits), are known to be organ-/tissue-specific; this implies that the effect of different agents should be evaluated on their specific target, that is, connexin. To investigate the role of different connexins in regulating gap-junctional gating and to compare the properties of homotypic junctional channels, we evaluated the effects of tissue-specific tumor promoters and anti-promoters on the viability and intercellular coupling (dye-transfer) of HeLa cells stably transfected with cDNAs coding for connexin(cx) 43, cx 40, cx 26 and cx 32. The results demonstrate that the transfectants possess individual junctional <b>permeabilities,</b> <b>differentially</b> affected by the chemicals, they also show different sensitivities to the cytotoxic effect of the compounds. These findings confirm that connexin diversity may be responsible for the different gating properties of gap-junctional channels, being also suggestive for their separate functions and independent regulatory mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The barrier {{function}} of the endothelium {{is controlled by the}} second messengers Ca 2 + and cAMP that <b>differentially</b> regulate the <b>permeability</b> of endothelial cells. The Ca 2 +-elevating agent thrombin has been demonstrated to increase endothelial permeability and to decrease cAMP levels as detected via enzyme immunoassays. To study the effects of thrombin on cAMP with high temporal resolution, we utilised the FRET-based cAMP sensor Epac 1 -camps in single intact human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In these cells, thrombin induced a delayed increase in [cAMP], initiating after about 40 s, with maximum cAMP levels after 130 s of thrombin application. This increase of cAMP levels was Ca 2 +-dependent, but did not require calmodulin (CaM). Pharmacological approaches revealed that phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity and cyclooxygenase (COX) -mediated synthesis of prostaglandins was required for the thrombin-induced elevation of [cAMP]. Furthermore, preincubation of HUVECs with a prostacyclin-receptor antagonist significantly reduced the thrombin-induced increase in [cAMP]. We conclude that thrombin causes the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial cells and that the subsequent stimulation of Gs-coupled prostacyclin receptors then results in an increase in [cAMP]...|$|R
40|$|Endothelial {{cells are}} linked to each other through {{intercellular}} junctional complexes that regulate the barrier and fence function of the vascular wall. The nature of these intercellular contacts varies {{with the need for}} permeability: For example, in brain the impervious blood-brain barrier is maintained by "tight" contacts between endothelial cells. By contrast, in high endothelial venules (HEVs), where lymphocytes continuously exit the bloodstream, the contacts are generally leaky. The precise molecular components that define the type of junction remain to be characterized. An immunoglobulin superfamily molecule named JAM- 2, specifically expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells and HEVs, was recently identified. JAM- 3 was cloned and characterized in the current study, and JAM- 1, - 2, and - 3 were shown to form a novel protein family belonging to the larger cortical thymocyte Xenopus (CTX) molecular family. Using antibodies specific for each of the 3 family members, their specific participation in different types of cell-cell contact in vivo and their specific and differential localization in lateral contacts or tight junctions were demonstrated. Furthermore, it was shown that JAM- 1 and JAM- 2 <b>differentially</b> regulate paracellular <b>permeability,</b> suggesting that the presence of JAM- 1, - 2, or - 3 in vascular junctions {{may play a role in}} regulating vascular function in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} glycation on skin {{permeation}} and accumulation of compounds were evaluated using an in vitro glycated skin model. Glycation {{of the skin}} of hairless mice was induced using vertical diffusion cells and incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 [*]mM glyoxal for 24 [*]h. Flux and accumulation in the skin were determined by applying hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules (Sodium fluorescein; FL-Na and Nile red, respectively) to this in vitro glycated skin model. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of glycation on epidermal–dermal barrier properties, we conducted diffusion experiments with FL-Na and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran using stratum corneum (SC) -stripped glycated skin. The in vitro glycated skin model demonstrated characteristic glycation alterations like a yellowish change in skin color and surface roughness. For low-molecular weight (MW) hydrophilic molecules, flux across glycated full-thickness skin was higher than that across normal skin, {{although there was no}} difference with lipophilic molecules. However, glycated epidermis–dermis showed lower flux, and the difference increased with the MW of the compound. Furthermore, the amount of high-MW hydrophilic molecules accumulated in glycated epidermis–dermis was decreased. These results suggest that glycated SC and epidermis–dermis <b>differentially</b> regulate the <b>permeability</b> of hydrophilic molecules and highlight the importance of controlling drug delivery by modifying the formulation or method of application depending on skin condition.

40|$|Gut {{permeability}} {{is a key}} function often incriminated in {{the development}} of local and systemic inflammation. Chronic consumption of high-fat diets leads to obesity and inflammation. Data in mice revealed a causal increase in intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that may be responsible for adipose tissue development and inflammation (Cani et al, 2009). Whether intestinal or colonic barrier can be modulated by omega- 6 (O 6) or omega- 3 (O 3) PUFA in the context of high-fat diet-induced obesity is poorly understood. Intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro is strengthened by both O 6 and O 3 fatty acids. In vivo, rats chronically fed high fat diets enriched in PUFA did not show different paracellular permeabilities in the jejunum, compared to rats fed a diet rich in saturated fat. Whether colonic permeability is altered has not been reported. We hypothesized that PUFA-enriched diets modulate gut <b>permeability</b> <b>differentially</b> according to <b>permeability</b> pathway and gut site. This hypothesis was tested in 16 obese adult minipigs fed for 2 months with iso-protein and iso-calorie high-fat (12 %) diets based on lard (saturated fat, S), sunflower oil (rich in O 6), or fish oil (rich in O 3). Ileal and colonic mucosa were collected and both para- and trans-cellular permeability were investigated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 and horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers. Gut permeability was assessed without and with an inflammatory challenge (E. coli LPS added at 0. 1 and 10 μg/ml). After two months of regimen, body weight was not different between diet groups. Ileal mucosa density was not affected by the diet. Ileal permeability to FD 4 was not influenced by the diet in the basal state but it tended to be higher with O 3 compared to O 6 diet after LPS challenge (e. g. with LPS 0. 1 μg/ml: 1272 ± 389, 775 ± 355 and 1723 ± 389) ng/cm 2 /h; P = 0. 095). Interestingly, basal colonic permeability to FD 4 was higher with O 3 compared to O 6 diet (692 ± 165, 509 ± 150 and 1032 ± 165 ng/cm 2 /h for diets based on saturated, O 6 and O 3 FA, respectively; P, 0. 05). Dietary treatments did not affect basal ileal or colonic permeability to HRP. However, both ileal and colonic permeability to HRP tended to be higher with O 3 than O 6 diet after LPS challenge. Our data indicate that gut permeability is modulated by dietary FA source regionally and according to permeability pathway. Para-cellular permeability in the colon (but not in the ileum) was affected in the basal state by diet FA composition. Surprisingly, it was higher with the O 3 as compared to O 6 -enriched diet. The same trends for differences between O 3 and O 6 diets on para- or trans-cellular permeability were also revealed under inflammatory condition...|$|R
40|$|Claudin {{proteins}} {{comprise a}} recently described family of tight junction proteins that <b>differentially</b> regulate paracellular <b>permeability.</b> Since other tight junction proteins show alterations in distribution or expression in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) we assessed expression of claudins (CL) 2, 3 and 4 in IBD. CL 2 was strongly expressed along the inflamed crypt epithelium, whilst absent or barely detectable in normal colon. In contrast, CL 3 and 4 were present throughout normal colonic epithelium and were reduced or redistributed in the diseased surface epithelium. In a T 84 -cell culture model of the gut barrier, paracellular permeability decreased with time after plating and correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of CL 2. Addition of IFN/TNF led to further decreases in CL 2 and 3, the redistrbution of CL 4 and a marked increase in paracellular permeability. Conversely, IL- 13 dramatically increased CL 2, with little effect on CL 3 or 4, but also resulted in increased paracellular permeability. Expression of CL 2 did not correlate with proliferation or junctional reorganisation after calcium ion depletion. Re-expression of CL 2 in response to IL- 13 was inhibited by phophatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor, LY 294002, which also restored the ion permeability to previous levels. CL 2 expression could be stimulated {{in the absence of}} IL- 13 by activation of phospho-Akt in the phophatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway. These results suggest that INF/TNF and IL- 13 have differential effects on CL 2, 3 and 4 in tight junctions, which may lead to increased permeability via different mechanisms. <br/...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a simple dye transfer method that allows quantification of the gap-junction permeability of small cultured cells. Fluorescent dyes (calcein and Lucifer yellow) were perfused into one cell of an isolated cell pair using a patch-type micropipette in the tight-seal whole cell configuration. Dye spreading into the neighboring cells was monitored using a low-light charge-coupled device camera. Permeation rates for calcein and Lucifer yellow were then estimated by fitting {{the time course of}} the fluorescence intensities in both cells. For curve fitting, we used a set of model equations derived from a compartment model of dye distribution. The permeation rates were correlated to the total ionic conductance of the gap junction measured immediately after the perfusion experiment. Assuming that dye permeation is through a unit-conductance channel, we were then able to calculate the single-channel permeance for each tracer dye. We have applied this technique to HeLa cells stably transfected with rat-Cx 46 and Cx 43, and to BICR/M 1 Rk cells, a rat mammary tumor cell line that has very high dye coupling through endogenous Cx 43 channels. Scatter plots of permeation rates versus junctional conductance did not show a strictly linear correlation of ionic versus dye permeance, as would have been expected for a simple pore. Instead, we found that the data scatter within a wide range of different single-channel permeances. In BICR/M 1 Rk cells, the lower limiting single-channel permeance is 2. 2 ± 2. 0 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s and the upper limit is 50 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s for calcein and 6. 8 ± 2. 8 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s and 150 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s for Lucifer yellow, respectively. In HeLa-Cx 43 transfectants we found 2. 0 ± 2. 4 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s and 95 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s for calcein and 2. 1 ± 6. 8 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s and 80 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s for Lucifer yellow, and in HeLa-Cx 46 transfectants 1. 7 ± 0. 3 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s and 120 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s for calcein and 1. 3 ± 1. 1 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s and 34 × 10 − 12 mm 3 /s for Lucifer yellow, respectively. This variability is most likely due to a yet unknown mechanism that <b>differentially</b> regulates single-channel <b>permeability</b> for larger molecules and for small inorganic ions...|$|R
40|$|The plant cuticle is a {{heterogeneous}} lipidic layer {{that covers the}} epidermis of the aerial organs of terrestrial plants. The research described here examines the role of cuticle lipids in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses and in tomato fruit development. ^ Analysis of cuticle composition in response to water deficit stress demonstrated that Arabidopsis responded to stress by altering cuticle wax and cutin composition and higher order cuticle structure. Cuticle changes were associated with reduction of foliar water loss and cuticle permeability and the abundance of specific cuticle gene transcripts. It is proposed that water deficit-stress induced cuticle production serves as {{an important component of}} plant acclimation to drought. ^ Plants also respond to biotic stress by cuticle alteration. Resistant and susceptible cultivars of wheat were shown to <b>differentially</b> alter cuticle <b>permeability</b> and lipid composition in response to infestation by Hessian fly larvae. Changes in permeability were correlated with changes in cuticle lipid amount. Changes in specific cuticle lipids correlated well with the abundance of cuticle-associated gene transcripts. It is proposed that the induction of specific wax constituents and the maintenance of cutin amounts are important components of wheat seedling resistance to Hessian fly infestation. ^ Recent studies have implicated the cuticle as an important determining factor of tomato fruit shelf life. Furthermore, recent research has intimated that cuticle development is regulated alongside other fruit ripening processes. Analysis of cuticle lipid composition of slow or non-ripening tomato fruit mutants that have long shelf life, revealed aberrant cuticle development patterns accompanied by specific compositional changes that may be related to long shelf life. Additionally, the observed cuticle developmental patterns of two of these mutants challenged the notion that these mutants are equivalent in their non-ripening phenotypes. ^ A forward genetics approach was used to identify three tomato mutants, cd (cutin deficient) 1, cd 2 and cd 3, whose fruit cuticles had severe deficiencies in cutin content and unique, but altered cuticle ultrastructure. Characterization of the mutants revealed surprising alterations in cuticle physicochemical properties including increased cuticle surface stiffness and increased proportions of both hydrophilic and multiply-bonded polymeric constituents. Furthermore, the results indicated a lack of correlation between cutin amount and permeability of the cuticle to water, but implicated cutin as an important determinant of fruit resistance to microbial infection. ^ Several genes have been implicated in Arabidopsis cuticle lipid synthesis. A candidate gene approach revealed that the locus underlying the previously characterized cer 8 mutant was allelic to LACS 1, one of nine Arabidopsis long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases thought to activate acyl chains. It was also demonstrated that LACS 1 has overlapping function with LACS 2 in both cutin and wax synthesis. Evidence is presented that LACS 1 is a functionally novel acyl-CoA synthetase that preferentially modifies both VLCFAs for wax synthesis, and long chain (C 16) fatty acids for cutin synthesis. ...|$|R
