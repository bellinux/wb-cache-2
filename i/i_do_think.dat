25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. Several US public schools banned The Simpsons merchandise and T-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". In the season two opening episode [...] "Bart Gets an F", Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade. Several critics thought that the episode [...] "Bart Gets an F" [...] {{was a response to}} these controversies. However, Brooks denied that it was a response and added, [...] "we're mindful of it. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> it's important for us that Bart does badly in school. There are students like that. Besides, I'm very wary of television where everybody {{is supposed to be a}} role model. You don't run across that many role models in real life.

[...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I think if I were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E

Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that we both have people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{historians and}} {{commentators}} hold {{the view that}} Bush {{was one of the}} most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a [...] "transformative" [...] one, and said that [...] "some people hate him, some people love him, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as [...] "the most noteworthy president since FDR" [...] and said that the Patriot Act [...] "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" [...] as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} Uematsu's {{compositions}} is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu {{has stated that}} he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat. His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is [...] "Aerith's Theme" [...] from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said [...] "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> there is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality." [...] He has been named one of the [...] "Innovators" [...] in Time Magazines [...] "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" [...] feature. He has also been called the [...] "John Williams of the video game world" [...] and been credited for [...] "increasing the appreciation and awareness" [...] of video game music.|$|E
500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here", said Chris.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with {{numerous}} directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. India Hill of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "When Beyoncé does something, you listen. Not just because her lyrics are infectious and her beats are always catchy, but because if she has something to say, you know it’s going to be important." [...] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian commented [...] "It is not an {{exaggeration to say that}} there is no other living musical artist who could ignite such a broad and unavoidable conversation just by releasing a new album – even a visual one, and it’s her second visual album – or who could turn an hour-long, visually narrative film for that album into a Saturday night watch-with-your-friends event on subscription cable channel." [...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms… <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love". In 2017, she released the controversial music video for [...] "Formation", which includes representations of racial injustice against African Americans in the United States during the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E
