[...] There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. [...] It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. [...] The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially psalters. [...] Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John [...] "seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert's coffin to protect it".|$|E
500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking hogweed, hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but {{with the use of}} Latin as a universal language.|$|E

For it is by their names that men commonly regulate their account of their distinct species of mixed modes, seldom allowing or considering any number of simple ideas to make one complex one, but such collections as there be names for. Thus, though the killing {{of an old man}} be as fit in nature to be united into one complex idea, as the killing a man's father; yet, there being no name standing precisely for the one, as there is the name of PARRICIDE to mark the other, it is not taken for a particular complex idea, nor a distinct species of actions from that of killing a young man, or any other man.|$|E

Victor Hugo's Légende des Siècles alone might be named with it for largeness, and even that with much less of a new starting-point in conception and treatment. Whitman breaks with all precedent.

But he is saved from isolation by the depth of his Americanism; with the movement of his predominant nation he is moved. His comprehension, energy, and tenderness are all extreme, and all inspired by actualities.
