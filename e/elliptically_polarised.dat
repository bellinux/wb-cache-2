40|$|We {{explore a}} plasma based {{analogue}} of a helical undulator {{capable of providing}} circularly and <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> betatron radiation. We focus on ionisation injection configurations and in the conditions where the laser pulse driver can force collective betatron oscillations over the whole trapped electron bunch. With an analytical model and by employing three dimensional simulations and radiation calculations, we find that circularly or <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> laser drivers can force helical betatron oscillations, which produce circularly/elliptically polarised betatron x-rays. We assess the level of polarisation numerically and analytically, and find {{that the number of}} circularly polarised photons can be controlled by tuning the laser pulse driver polarisation. We show the production of betatron radiation that is circularly polarised up to < 40 % close to regions of maximum photon flux. The total flux of circularly polarised betatron radiation drops for <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> drivers, and is negligible when using linear polarisation. Our results can be tested today in current experimental facilities. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, submitted for publicatio...|$|E

40|$|Polarisation {{effects in}} the {{microcavity}} parametric oscillator are studied using a simple model in which two chi-three optical parametric oscillators are coupled together. It is found that there are, in general, a number of steady states of the model under continuous pumping. There are both continuous and discontinuous thresholds, at which new steady-states appear as the driving intensity is increased: at the continuous thresholds, the new state has zero output intensity, whereas at the discontinuous threshold it has a finite output intensity. The discontinuous thresholds have no analog in the uncoupled device. The coupling also generates rotations of the linear polarisation of the output compared with the pump, and shifts in the output frequencies as the driving polarisation or intensity is varied. For large ratios {{of the interaction between}} polarisations to the interaction within polarisations, of the order of 5, one of the thresholds has its lowest value when the pump is <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised.</b> This is consistent with recent experiments in which the maximum output was achieved with an <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> pump.

This latest development has demanded more capacity and higher bandwidth in communication links. Static links, which {{are the focus of}} this thesis, {{are an integral part of}} this mobile system in delivering high capacity data transmission using backhauls or nomadic links. Multi polarised antennas with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any antenna is <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> as it can never be perfectly circularly or linearly polarised. This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and cross-polar linear components, which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> antenna prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign.

The time dependent magnetic field was taken as <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> {{in such a way that}} the resulting field vector rotates in the XZ plane. In the limit of low anisotropy, the dynamical responses of the system are studied as functions of temperature and the amplitudes of the magnetic field. As the temperature decreases, it aws found that the system undergoes multiple dynamical phase transitions. In this limit, the multiple transitions were studied in details and the phase diagram for this observed multicritical behaviour was drawn in the field amplitude and temperature palne. The natures (continuous/discontinuous) of the transitions are determined by the temperature variations of fourth order Binder cumulant ratio and the distributions of the order parameter near the transition points. The transitions are supported by finite size study. The temperature variations of the variances of dynamic order parameter components (for different system sizes) indicate the existence of diverging length scale near the dynamic transition points.

A description is given of some alternative methods of treating the scattering problem, with particular reference to the application of Green's function to the single cylinder and its application to the plane grating. The literature concerned with multiple grating configurations is also surveyed. A polarisation cascade matrix is derived which describes the transmission of a normally incident <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> wave through a grating of parallel wires whose angle is arbitrary.

The product of a series of matrices representing a series of gratings whose wires are at different angles to a fixed direction gives the total complex transmission and reflection coefficients.

These results confirm that such a series of gratings can be used to design either broad-band polarisation rotators for linear polarization, or broad-band circular or elliptical polarisers or analysers.

The following cases were investigated: <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised,</b> monochromatic incident field, two-colour incident field with incommensurable frequencies, coherent super position of an incident field and its third harmonic, and superposition of a laser field and a static electric field. For elliptical polarisation, the ellipticity angle of the harmonics differ from the ellipticity of the incident laser and we established {{that there is an}} offset angle between the major axis of the incident laser's polarisation ellipse and that of the harmonics generated. The variation is greatest in the plateau region. Resonance-enhanced ionisation was studied when a high frequency field was applied in addition to a fundamental field. In contrast to these changes in the ionisation rate only small variations have been obtained in the harmonic generation rate. Results for frequency-mixing exhibit a difference in the strength of the harmonics, although the behaviour is the same in terms of the length of the plateau and the cut-off order. Also we found a marked change between sum-frequency and difference frequency processes, which depends on the harmonic order. In addition to a strong production of even harmonics, {{it was found that the}} variation of the rate of ionisation and harmonic generation in the presence of a static field oscillates as a function of the strength of the latter.

40|$|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) {{has been}} {{utilised}} {{in various forms}} in sensors for many years. It is usually based on angular or wavelength interrogation of the reflectivity minimum found with Transverse Magnetic (TM) light. However, as the SPR is traversed {{there is also a}} very rapid change in the phase of the reflected TM light there being no such change in the Transverse Electric (TE) light. Presented in the thesis a new SPR sensor has been developed that exploits this rapid change in optical phase. Linearly polarised light of mixed TM/TE polarisation is passed through a polarization modulator, which adds a small amplitude modulation to the polarisation. This modulated light is incident on a gold film 40 nm thick evaporated onto the base of a SF 2 prism in the Kretschmann-Raether, configuration. The coupling of the TM polarised light to the SPR is dependant on the properties of the dielectric medium adjacent to the gold film. The SPR shifts when this sensed medium undergoes a change in refractive index (or index or thickness if it is a bound analyte layer). This in turn causes a change in the reflected <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> light. The change of the resultant modulated polarisation dither is interrogated {{through the use of a}} phase sensitive detectors. Initially a simple photo diode coupled with a lock-in amplifier was used to monitor the modulated signal. This was expanded into an imaging technique by using two cameras (64 by 64 pixels) fabricated with the equivalent of a lock-in amplifier on each of the 4096 pixels.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of soliton pulses {{for use in}} nonlinear optical devices is mathematically modelled by Maxwell-Bloch systems of equations for the interaction of light with a uniform distribution of quantum-mechanical atoms. We study the Reduced Maxwell-Bloch (RMB) equations occurring when an ensemble of rotationally symmetric 3 -level atoms is assumed. The model applies for on and off-resonance conditions and is completely integrable using Inverse Scattering theory, since it arises as the compatibility condition of a 3 x 3 AKNS-system. Furthermore this integrability remains valid for all timescales of the optical field because only the “one-way wave approximation” is required during the derivation. Solutions are constructed in two ways: 1. Darboux-Bäcklund transforms are applied, generating single soliton pulses of ultrashort (< 1 ps) duration, and families of <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> 2 -solitons not possible in lower dimensional problems. 2. A general Inverse Scattering scheme is developed and tested. The Direct Scattering Problem is dealt with first to obtain {{a complete set of}} scattering data. Subsequently the Inverse Problem is solved both formally and then in explicit closed form for the special case that the reflection coefficients vanish for real values of the spectral parameter. In this case the main result is a determined system of n linear algebraic equations which yield the n-soliton of our RMB-system. It is confirmed that the 1 -solitons found by means of Darboux transform are precisely the same as those given by the full mechanism of Inverse Scattering. Finally we calculate the invariants of the motion for the RMB-equations, and derive an evolution equation giving the variation with propagation distance of the invariant functionals when the original RMB-system is modified by an arbitrary perturbing term.

Gratings are etched into the polyimide by irradiating a phase mask of period 1. 1 #mu#m with the output from a KrF excimer laser of wavelength 248 nm with fluences above the threshold required for ablation. Grating depths from 10 to 190 nm have been achieved using a simple pulse from the laser, and the liquid crystal azimuthal anchoring energy is determined {{as a function of}} the grating depth. Values up to 1. 3 x 10 "-" 5 Jm"-" 2 are found. Discrepancies are found when comparisons are made between experimental data and a theory based upon elastic strain energy minimisation. A modified theory taking finite polar anchoring into account shows better agreement. Polarised excimer laser radiation at normal incidence is used to induce an anisotropy which gives rise to homogeneous liquid crystal alignment. The strength of the azimuthal anchoring energy is similar to that produced by grating alignment. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the alignment originates from the stronger depletion of polyimide chains parallel to the exposure polarisation direction. The dependence of beam fluence and exposure time on the anchoring energy is measured, and the degradation mechanism of the polyimide is investigated {{as a function of the}} exposure. We find that oxidative degradation takes place. We also use these techniques to identify the chemical composition of the polyimide material. Pretilted liquid crystal alignment has also been achieved, with pretilt angles up to 3. 7 deg. A tilted polymer distribution is generated by oblique exposure of the polyimide to an <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> beam. We measure the liquid crystal pretilt angle as a function of the angle of incidence, and exposure time and present a theoretical analysis of the polyimide chain azimuthal distribution which agrees with the experimental results. Finally, a simple and novel technique to achieve pretilted grating alignment is shown.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{report on the}} {{development}} and implementation of baseband recording techniques for searches for radio emission from neutron stars. Ultra-bright pulses are a sporadic type of neutron star emission that have intrinsic widths of less than a microsecond. Propagation through the interstellar medium broadens these radio pulses and consequently reduces their peak flux densities. Pre-detection dedispersion can be performed on data taken with baseband recorders to completely mitigate the dispersive aspect of this broadening. However, such ``coherent'' dedispersion is computationally expensive, and so its application has historically been limited to narrow bands and/or short observation times. This thesis describes the first wide-bandwidth searches of large data sets for ultra-bright pulses using pre-detection dedispersion techniques. The equations that determine the efficiency and sensitivity of such searches are presented, and practical data processing algorithms are discussed. The results of large-scale searches for ultra-bright pulses using the Parkes and Green Bank radio telescopes are also presented. These revealed three new emitters [...] PSRs J 1823 - 3021 A, J 0218 + 4232, and B 1957 + 20. This increases the number of millisecond pulsars documented to emit ultra-bright pulses from two to five. In addition, millisecond pulsars that emit ultra-bright pulses are confirmed to be rare. The ultra-bright pulses from all of the five millisecond pulsar emitters are analysed in further detail. Three of these pulsars emit pulsed X-rays. The phases of the ultra-bright pulses always correlate in phase with the X-ray pulses, but have variable phase relations to ordinary radio emission. Structure in the emission of PSRs B 1937 + 21 and J 1824 - 2452 A is seen at timescales as short as 8 and 20 ns, respectively. The ultra-bright pulses of PSR J 1824 - 2452 A are found to be highly <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised.</b> Their position angles vary widely. This may mean that local effects are dominating over the global magnetic field during the emission events. However, I also report the likely detection of an ultra-bright pulse from PSR J 1823 - 3021 A that consists of two disjoint bursts. As these must originate from widely separated regions of the pulsar magnetosphere, macroscopic excitations seem to occur during ultra-bright emission events. I also describe searches for ultra-bright pulses and periodic emission from neutron stars in globular clusters. The ultra-bright pulse searches, whilst not revealing any new emitters, place new bounds on the existence of energetic millisecond pulsars. The Fourier-domain searches of globular clusters revealed 42 previously known pulsars. One new pulsar is reported [...] PSR J 0024 - 7204 Z in 47 Tucanae...|$|E
