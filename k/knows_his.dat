5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna over his eyes and tends to break out in dance every so often. No one <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> real name or past. He speaks in semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, but apparently does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E

Keating <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise that it will be built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.|$|E

The Ferreiras help Shirley {{to deal with her}} neighbour from hell, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson), which leads to Shirley and Ash becoming close and starting a secret relationship. Shirley is unhappy that Ash refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, as he <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> father will be furious if he discovers them together.

5|$|Matt tracks Bullseye, but is {{attacked}} by Elektra, {{who plans to}} use her own training in martial arts to avenge her father's death. She defeats and injures Matt; when she manages to remove his mask, she discovers Matt's secret identity and innocence. Forced to fight Bullseye alone, Elektra is overpowered and killed by the hitman. A wounded Matt {{makes his way to}} a church, where he is looked after by his confidante, Father Everett, who <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> secret identity. After recovering slightly, Matt fights Bullseye, who had followed him to the church. Bullseye discovers that loud noise is Matt's weakness and prepares to kill him with a spiked piece of wood after incapacitating him. Matt blocks the attack and hears an FBI sniper stationed on the neighboring building preparing to fire. As the bullet is fired, Matt moves out of the bullet's path and pulls Bullseye's hands into it. When Bullseye pleads for mercy, Matt throws him from the church's steeple. Bullseye lands on the hood of Urich's car, severely injured but alive.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

25|$|During a later {{trip through}} Hypertime, Kon-El accidentally discovers this Superboy while finding himself in that version's reality. During this visit, Kon-El discovers that this Superboy {{is a young}} Clark Kent, and by this means realizes the Superman of his reality must, therefore, be an adult Clark Kent. Sometime after {{returning}} to the main DC Universe, Kon-El reveals to Superman that he now <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> secret identity.|$|E
25|$|The radio drama also {{introduced}} female characters into The Shadow's realm, most notably Margo Lane (played by Agnes Moorehead, among others) as Cranston's love interest, crime-solving partner {{and the only}} person who <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> identity as The Shadow. Four years later, the character was introduced into the pulp novels. Her sudden, unexplained appearance in the pulps annoyed readers and generated a flurry of hate mail printed in The Shadow Magazine's letters page.|$|E
25|$|Achatinidae are {{a family}} of rather large land snails, and, {{in spite of their}} size, one that poses {{tremendous}} taxonomic problems, and Dolf {{is one of the few}} people who <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> way in the chaotic taxonomy of this group. He devoted various papers partly or wholly to the family and introduced six new species and subspecies. He was a friend of the recently deceased American Achatinidae specialist Albert Raymond Mead (1915–2009). They regularly exchanged opinions, but did not publish jointly.|$|E

25|$|Cristobel's {{little boy}} in the romance Sir Eglamour of Artois is {{similarly}} delivered into a new family at the very start {{of his life and}} only <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> real mother when, like Sir Degaré, he wins her hand in marriage in a tournament {{near the end of the}} tale.

25|$|In her {{dressing}} room, Raoul implores Christine to reconsider {{her decision to}} sing and asks her to leave with him at once if she still loves him.

25|$|Jung's next roles {{would be}} in highly romantic roles that played off his {{established}} screen image. In the box office hit A Moment to Remember he played an architect whose wife (played by Son Ye-jin) is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease and in the Netherlands-set Daisy, he played a hired assassin {{who falls in love}} with a street artist played by Jun Ji-hyun. He portrayed a happily committed fireman in Sad Movie, and rekindled a romance with an old friend in A Good Rain <b>Knows.</b> <b>His</b> big-budget martial arts films The Restless and Reign of Assassins would also have romantic elements.|$|E

25|$|Abrahams {{is badly}} beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> last {{chance for a}} medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is {{overcome}} that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams {{can get on with}} his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} loosely follows {{the plot of}} the second novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Living Dead in Dallas. In addition, the {{character}} of Sophie-Anne Leclerq, initially introduced in the sixth novel Definitely Dead, was introduced as a major supporting character.

Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.|$|E
25|$|Eddie sends Kat and Alfie {{on holiday}} to Spain and runs the pub in their absence. He teaches Liam about {{antiques}} but considers returning to Upton Park as he hasn't seen anywhere {{to move his}} business to. When Carol discovers that Eddie has allowed Liam to skip school, they argue and Carol tells him {{to stay away from}} her and Liam. Eddie discovers that someone is squatting in a local lock-up and decides to take over the premises. Eddie asks Liam to watch his stock, which he leaves in the gardens. Eddie's son, Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), poses {{as a member of the}} council to force the squatter out. Eddie returns to find his stock on fire and cannot extinguish the flames. He confronts Michael, thinking he started the fire, but Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) told Liam that she was responsible in revenge for comments Anthony and Tyler made about her grandfather Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick).

He later gets a letter that intrigues Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and she becomes fascinated by Eddie.

60|$|It {{was not to}} be concealed, nor was it so {{doubtful}} as {{to leave}} me any room to question it, but the second of the three was my Lancashire husband. I was frightened to death; I never was in such a consternation in my life; I though I should have sunk into the ground; my blood ran chill in my veins, and I trembled as if I had been in a cold fit of ague. I say, there was no room to question the truth of it; I <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> clothes, I <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> horse, and I <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R

500|$|Sellers {{became a}} top {{student at the}} school, excelling in drawing in particular. However, he was prone to laziness, but his natural talents {{shielded}} him from criticism by his teachers.

500|$|The Greene Knight {{tells the}} same story as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, with a few differences. Notably, the knight, here named [...] "Bredbeddle", is only wearing green, not green-skinned himself. The poem also states the knight has been asked by his wife's mother (not Morgan in this version) to trick Gawain. He agrees because he <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> wife is {{secretly}} in love with Gawain, and hopes to deceive both. Gawain falters in accepting a girdle from her, and the Green Knight's purpose is fulfilled in a small sense. In the end, he acknowledges Gawain's ability and asks to accompany him to Arthur's court.|$|E
