Data from the 2009 and 2010 field seasons showed: EBC was widely distributed along Campbell and Chester creeks; EBC leaf litter in streams broke down rapidly and supported similar shredder communities to native tree species; and EBC foliage supported significantly less terrestrial invertebrate biomass relative to native deciduous tree species, and contributed significantly less terrestrial invertebrate biomass to streams compared to mixed native vegetation, but riparian EBC did not appear to affect the amount of terrestrial invertebrate prey ingested by juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).

40|$|Introduction. <b>Bird</b> <b>cherry</b> Padus avium Mill, Rosaceae, is {{widespread}} in Ukraine, especially in forests and foreststeppe areas. <b>Bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits {{have long been}} used in medicine and is a valuable medicinal raw materials. They stated to posess astringent, anti-inflammatory, phytoncidal properties. <b>Bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits {{are included in the}} USSR Pharmacopoeia IX ed., The State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation, The State Pharmacopoeia of Republic of Belarus. In Ukraine there are no contemporary normative documents for this medicinal plant material, therefore it is the actual to develop projects in the national monographs "dry <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruit" and "fresh <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruit" {{to be included in the}} State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. According to European Pharmacopoeia recommendation method of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is prescribed only for the identification of the herbal drug. The principles of thinlayer chromatography and application of the technique in pharmaceutical analysis are described in State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. As it is effective and easy to perform, and the equipment required is inexpensive, the technique is frequently used for evaluating medicinal plant materials and their preparations. The TLC is aimed at elucidating the chromatogram of the drug with respect to selected reference compounds that are described for inclusion as reagents. Aim of this study was to develop methods of qualitative analysis of <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits for a monograph in the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine (SPU). Materials and Methods. The object of our study was dried <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits (7 samples) and fresh <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits (7 samples) harvested in 2013 - 2015 in Kharkiv, Poltava, Luhansk, Sumy, Lviv, Mykolaiv regions and the city Mariupol. Samples were registered in the department of SPU State Enterprise "Pharmacopeia center". In accordance with the Ph. Eur. and SPU requirements in "identification C" determination was performed by TLC. TLC was performed on glass-backed silica gel F 254 Merck plates, size 20 x 10 cm. Test solutions from samples of dried raw material were prepared by extraction of 1 % solution of hydrochloric acid in 95 % ethanol with ultrasound for 60 minutes at 50 º C. As mobile phase solvent mixture ethyl acetate - anhydrous acetic acid - formic acid - water ratio (100 : 10 : 10 : 25) was selected. For preparation the reference solution 1 mg chrysanthemin was dissolved in 10 mL of 1 % solution of hydrochloric acid in 95 % ethanol. Fresh <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits test solutions of the samples were crushed to mash (free of seeds), 10 mL of methanol was added and treated with ultrasound for 15 minutes. As mobile phase solvent mixture formic acid anhydrous-waterbutanol ratio (16 : 19 : 65) was selected. Two reference solutions were used. First was prepared from 2 mg chrysanthemum dissolved in 5 mL of methanol and second was Pharmacopoeial Reference Standard SPU of <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> extract dissolved in 0. 2 mL of methanol with ultrasound bath. Test solutions and the reference solutions were placed onto the chromatographic plates and placed into the chamber. When the chromatograms developed, the plates were taken out, then observed the spots in daylight. Results and discussion. In the chromatogram it was observed for all dry <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits samples two pink-red color zones, one of which coincided for Rf and color of chrysanthemin, and the other one was slightly lower. The chromatogram for all samples of fresh raw material showed two pinkish-violet zones, one of which had Rf and color corresponded chrysanthemin, and the second one was slightly lower. Compared with <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> extract, it was observed two pinkish-violet zones, coincided with Rf and color of <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> (SPU) extract zones. In accordance with the requirements of Ph. Eur. identification by TLC is obligatory. Division of anthocyanins of plant raw materials was observed sufficiently in our chosen solvent systems and methods of analysis that allows to recommend these systems and methods of analysis for inclusion in the relevant sections of monographs for <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruit, dried and fresh for SPU. Conclusion. It was confirmed the opportunity to include in the national monographs "Bird cherry fruits fresh " and " <b>Bird</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits dry" in section "Identification C" analysis of anthocyanin by TLC in chosen systems and methods...|$|R
