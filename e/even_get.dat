5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not <b>even</b> <b>get</b> into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this {{would go a long way}} towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused on the basis of the work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or <b>even</b> <b>get</b> involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E

25|$|As {{reported}} by the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus around 600 BC, charge (or electricity) could be accumulated by rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber.

25|$|The FIA {{decided that}} the 'Mass Damper' system used by Renault {{up to this point}} of the season did not meet the {{technical}} regulations, and it was banned – a polemical decision, since the FIA itself was consulted about the system during its development, and authorised its use.

25|$|Flying a Tempest, French ace Pierre Clostermann {{claimed the}} first Allied combat {{encounter}} with a Dornier 335 in April 1945. In his book The Big Show (pp.273–274) he describes leading a flight of four Hawker Tempests from No. 3 Squadron RAF over northern Germany, when he intercepted a lone Do 335 flying at maximum speed at treetop level. Detecting the British aircraft, the German pilot reversed course to evade. Despite the Tempests' considerable low altitude speed, the Royal Air Force fighters {{were not able to}} catch up or <b>even</b> <b>get</b> into firing position.|$|E

25|$|When the Spyker F1 {{team was}} bought out by Vijay Mallya {{towards the end}} of 2007, Karthikeyan had been linked with a drive with the new Force India Formula One team in 2008. However, Karthikeyan did not <b>even</b> <b>get</b> to test for the team. Karthikeyan was also linked to a drive with the Super Aguri team in January 2008, as one of the terms of an Indian {{consortium}} investing in the team. The deal was not agreed and he continued to drive for A1 Team India. Karthikeyan was India's only Formula One driver until the 2010 season, when Karun Chandhok signed to drive for the Hispania Racing F1 Team.|$|E

Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited out on the sidewalks {{in front of the}} Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to <b>even</b> <b>get</b> to their luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|E
25|$|Pratt's {{first-class}} career then tailed {{off in the}} 1963 and 1964 seasons: in 1963, he was {{a regular}} in the team {{until the end of}} June, but then reappeared in only the last two games; and in 1964, he made only eight first-class appearances. In both seasons, he played in Leicestershire's single matches in the Gillette Cup one-day competition. He scored 25 and took the first three wickets, albeit expensively, in the first-ever English List A match in 1963; Leicestershire were so comprehensively thumped in 1964 that he did not <b>even</b> <b>get</b> on to bowl. At the end of the 1964 season, he left the Leicestershire staff.|$|E
25|$|The Nottingham Ice Stadium {{opened on}} 10 April 1939 and hosted its {{first game of}} ice hockey two days later when the Harringay Racers {{defeated}} the Harringay Greyhounds 10-6 in a challenge game. The souvenir brochure published to mark the Stadium's opening included details of a new professional ice hockey team called the Nottingham Panthers to begin play in the English National League that autumn. A team was assembled in Canada and brought to the United Kingdom but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Some of the players from this team didn't <b>even</b> <b>get</b> {{the chance to see}} the Ice Stadium.|$|E

25|$|The rest of {{the squad}} were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith {{averaged}} over 30, and that was flattered by his big century at Antigua. He was in terrible form {{for the vast majority}} of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests – a poor return for a man of his talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all – Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't <b>even</b> <b>get</b> that chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.|$|E
25|$|Realising {{that they}} had less than four months before the rainy season, the Burmese command {{initially}} launched a few assaults on the city walls. But the place proved too strong and too well defended. Because of the numerous stockades outside the city, the Burmese could not <b>even</b> <b>get</b> near the wall, and those that got near were cut down by musket fire from atop. The Burmese now drew a line of entrenchments round the city, and prepared to reduce it by famine. As time passed and no signs of surrender appeared, {{the approach of the}} dreaded rainy season caused alarm among the Burmese command. Several senior commanders advised calling off the invasion. However, Maha Nawrahta decided to continue the invasion, and his colleague Thihapate supported him. The Burmese command now made preparations to meet the rise of the river by collecting boats and building embankments on the bits of high ground.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Virgin, the Wallflowers {{went back}} to playing Los Angeles clubs in hopes of getting signed with another label. The band found it {{difficult}} to <b>even</b> <b>get</b> label representatives to come to their shows. In the year it took to get another record deal the Wallflowers gained and lost several band members. Bass player Barrie Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons in early 1993. The Wallflowers continued playing shows with replacement bass player Jimmie Snider until May 1993 when the band hired Greg Richling. Dylan and Richling went to high school together. The Wallflowers continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through early 1994 when drummer Peter Yanowitz left the band to join his girlfriend Natalie Merchant's band. Interestingly, Yanowitz brought in Barrie Maguire to help record Merchant's debut solo album, Tigerlily. Around the time of Yanowitz's departure the Wallflowers caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine and Tom Whalley of Interscope Records, who then signed the band to their label in 1994.|$|E
