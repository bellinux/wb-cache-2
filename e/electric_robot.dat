40|$|Abstract: Nuclear reactor {{pressure}} vessels are often required regular {{inspection and maintenance}} {{in order to ensure}} the safety of the reactors. Failing to carry out proper maintenance could cause severe casualty. The usual way of carrying out inspection in these hazardous environments is using long reach fixed base manipulators. However, these manipulators suffer from low payload capacity and relatively large end point deflections. Also, the installation and the storage of these long manipulators could be costly. An alternative solution is to use walking-climbing robots, which overcome the problems encountered by the long reach manipulators. In this paper, two robots, NERO (Nuclear <b>Electric</b> <b>Robot</b> Operator) and SADIE (Sizewell A Duct Inspection Equipment) which have been applied successfully to inspect two Magnox reactors in the UK are described. The deployment and operational experience of these robots are also explained. Finally the applications and the usefulness of these robots for improving safety inspection of nuclear reactors in general are discussed in this paper...|$|E

It is proposed to form (by using the methodology {{of the theory of}} digital filtering) specifically the structure of the input range of the controller, which is determined by the selected control law, in our case this is the proportional integral differential law. Based on the desired dynamics of the process, the article is justified choice of the mathematical model of etalon, described neural network training using back propagation algorithm. To provide the required dynamic of the control process it was proposed the modification of the input circuits of neurocontroller (the separation of inputs). In this case, instead of the traditional difference between the object output signal and the etalon input signal each of these signals fed to a separate input of the neurocontroller and output signals convergence of the object and the etalon was better. To investigate the stability of the system with proposed neurocontroller its structure was reformatted into an equivalent closed system covered by negative feedback. Simulation in the Simulink environment confirmed the stability of this control system. ? ???????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ??????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????. ? ?????????, ????????????? ???? ??????, ?????????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ??????????? ???? ? ??? ???? ?? ????? ????????. ?? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?e??o???? ????? ????????? ????????? ????? ????????????. ????????? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ????????????, ?????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ???? ???????????, ??????? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ??????????, ? ????? ?????? ? ???????????????-???????????-????????????????. ? ??????, ?????? ?? ???????? ???????? ????????, ????????? ????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ????????? ???? ? ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????????. ??? ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ???? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ? ?????????? ??????. ? ???? ?????? ?? ???? ??????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ???????? ????????? ?? ???? ????????? ???? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ????????? ??????. ??? ???????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ?????????????????, ??? ????????? ????????????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ???????, ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ??????. ???????????? ????????????? ? ?????

However, commercial lithium-ion batteries still do not offer enough energy density for these high power consumption devices although extensive {{research has been conducted}} to increase charge-storage capability [1 – 4]. The energy storage of lithium-based batteries can be remarkably enhanced by a new approach, lithium-air [Li/air] batteries [5 – 8]. A Li/air battery consists of a Li metal anode and an air electrode containing a catalyst. Oxygen accessed from the environment is reduced catalytically on the air electrode surface to form anions, which then react with lithium cations supplied by the anode on the air electrode surface during the discharge process [9, 10]. Owing to light and unlimited cathode active material (oxygen), Li/air batteries have a much larger theoretical specific energy (11, 400 Wh·kg- 1 excluding oxygen) than any other rechargeable battery system including lithium-ion batteries. In this work, carbon nanotubes [CNTs] and nanosized Co 3 O 4 were successfully composited to catalyze the anion formation in the air electrode of Li/air batteries. The CNT serves to support the catalyst and provides a surface for the redox reaction to occur. Co 3 O 4 has generated extensive interest as a promising catalyst in various fields [11, 12]. Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles composited with CNT are expected to show excellent catalytic activity owing to their nanoscale size and large surface area.|$|R

A solar drying installation for waste-water sludge in Füssen, Germany, designed by Thermo-System ® and the University of Hohenheim, has been used to collect data for the establishment of a drying-rate function. In this solar dryer, wet sludge is uniformly spread over a concrete floor under a greenhouse-like transparent cover. The sludge is intermittently mixed by means of a autonomous <b>robot</b> (<b>electric</b> mole®), while the air under the cover is ventilated (horizontally) and mixed (vertically) by electric fans.

Evaporation rate via sludge sampling and via vapour balance across the structure compared favourably, justifying the use of the hourly vapour-balance data to develop linear regression and non-linear neural network (NN) models to predict the evaporation rate. The most important predictors of evaporation turn out to be (1) outdoor solar radiation (2) outdoor air temperature, and (3) the ventilation flux.

40|$|Harmonics in the {{electromagnetic}} torque {{are a source}} of concern in permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives. The harmonics are created by non-idealities in {{the electromagnetic}} fields produced by the magnets and the stator excitation. They lead to vibration that can cause premature wear of the drivetrain components as well as acoustic noise that may be bothersome to users. In this research, current- and voltage-based control schemes have been developed to mitigate the harmonics in a class of PMSMs in which the magnets are placed interior to the rotor iron. Interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) have recently gained popularity for applications including hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicles and <b>robot</b> joint control. ^ In the current-based control, a low-cost piezoelectric sensor is used to measure torque harmonics. A conjugate gradient algorithm is then applied to search for harmonics in the stator current that produce a commanded average torque while eliminating the measured torque harmonics. The algorithm is based upon analytical closed-form expressions for the average and harmonic components of torque that have been derived for IPMSMS with arbitrary back-emf waveforms. In the voltage-based control, a time-domain model of the machine is used to map the outputs of the conjugate gradient algorithm to commanded stator voltages. Since both utilize feedback, the controls are insensitive to changes in machine parameters that result from magnetic saturation, temperature, or parameter drift. In addition, the user has flexibility to select the harmonic(s) of torque to be eliminated. ...|$|R

It describes the advantages of the proposed research, which eliminates the need for any external sensors and solely depends on the precise torque control of electric motors. The aim of the research is thus the development of a software based control system and then a proposal for possible inclusion of this control philosophy in existing range of automated manufacturing techniques. The primary aim of the research is to introduce force controlled behaviour in the electric actuators when the robot interacts with the environment, by measuring and controlling the contact forces between them. A software control system is developed and implemented on a robot gantry manipulator to follow two dimensional contours without the explicit geometrical knowledge of those contours. The torque signatures from the electric actuators are monitored and maintained within a desired force band. The secondary aim is the optimal design of the software controller structure. Experiments are performed and the mathematical model is validated against conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control.

40|$|For certain applications, such as space servicing, undersea operations, and {{hazardous}} material handling tasks in nuclear reactors, the environments can be uncertain, complex, {{and hazardous}}. Lives {{may be in}} danger if humans were to work under these conditions. As a result, a man-machine system [...] a teleoperator system [...] has been developed to work in these types of environments. In a typical teleoperator system, the actual system operates at a remote site; the operator located away from this system usually receives visual information from a video image and/or graphical animation on the computer screen. Additional feedback, such as aural and force information, can significantly enhance performance of the system. Force reflection {{is a type of}} feedback in which forces experienced by the remote manipulator are fed back to the manual controller. Various control methods have been proposed for implementation on a teleoperator system. In order to examine different control schemes, a one Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) Force-Reflecting Manual Controller (FRMC) is constructed and integrated into a PC. The system parameters are identified and constructed as a mathematical model. The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic controllers are developed and tested experimentally. Numerical simulation results obtained from the mathematical model are compared with those of experimental data for both types of controllers. In addition, the concept of a telesensation system is introduced. A telesensation system is an advanced teleoperator system that attempts to provide the operator with sensory feedback. In this context, a telesensation system integrates the use of a Virtual Reality (VR) unit, FRMC, and Graphical User Interface (GUI). The VR unit is used to provide the operator with a 3 -D visual effect. Various commercial VR units are reviewed and features compared for use in a telesensation system. As for the FRMC, the conceptual design of a 3 -DOF FRMC is developed {{in an effort to make}} the system portable, compact, and lightweight. A variety of design alternatives are presented and evaluated. Finally, a GUI software package is developed to interface with several teleoperation unit components. These components include an industrial <b>robot,</b> <b>electric</b> motor, encoder, force/torque sensor, and CCD camera. The software includes features such as position scaling, force scaling, and rereferencing and is intended to provide a sound basis for the development of a multi-DOF FRMC system in the future...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{in most of}} the {{industrial}} automation process an ever increasing degree of automation has been observed. This increasing is motivated by the higher requirement of systems with great performance in terms of quality of products/services generated, productivity, efficiency and low costs in the design, realization and maintenance. This trend in the growth of complex automation systems is rapidly spreading over automated manufacturing systems (AMS), where the integration of the mechanical and electronic technology, typical of the Mechatronics, is merging with other technologies such as Informatics and the communication networks. An AMS is a very complex system that can be thought constituted by a set of flexible working stations, one or more transportation systems. To understand how this machine are important in our society let considerate that every day most of us use bottles of water or soda, buy product in box like food or cigarets and so on. Another important consideration from its complexity derive {{from the fact that the}} the consortium of machine producers has estimated around 350 types of manufacturing machine. A large number of manufacturing machine industry are presented in Italy and notably packaging machine industry,in particular a great concentration of this kind of industry is located in Bologna area; for this reason the Bologna area is called “packaging valley”. Usually, the various parts of the AMS interact among them in a concurrent and asynchronous way, and coordinate the parts of the machine to obtain a desiderated overall behaviour is an hard task. Often, this is the case in large scale systems, organized in a modular and distributed manner. Even if the success of a modern AMS from a functional and behavioural point of view is still to attribute to the design choices operated in the definition of the mechanical structure and electrical electronic architecture, the system that governs the control of the plant is becoming crucial, because of the large number of duties associated to it. Apart from the activity inherent to the automation of themachine cycles, the supervisory system is called to perform other main functions such as: emulating the behaviour of traditional mechanical members thus allowing a drastic constructive simplification of the machine and a crucial functional flexibility; dynamically adapting the control strategies according to the different productive needs and to the different operational scenarios; obtaining a high quality of the final product through the verification of the correctness of the processing; addressing the operator devoted to themachine to promptly and carefully take the actions devoted to establish or restore the optimal operating conditions; managing in real time information on diagnostics, as a support of the maintenance operations of the machine. The kind of facilities that designers can directly find on themarket, in terms of software component libraries provides in fact an adequate support as regard the implementation of either top-level or bottom-level functionalities, typically pertaining to the domains of user-friendly HMIs, closed-loop regulation and motion control, fieldbus-based interconnection of remote smart devices. What is still lacking is a reference framework comprising a comprehensive set of highly reusable logic control components that, focussing on the cross-cutting functionalities characterizing the automation domain, may help the designers in the process of modelling and structuring their applications according to the specific needs. Historically, the design and verification process for complex automated industrial systems is performed in empirical way, without a clear distinction between functional and technological-implementation concepts and without a systematic method to organically deal with the complete system. Traditionally, in the field of analog and digital control design and verification through formal and simulation tools have been adopted since a long time ago, at least for multivariable and/or nonlinear controllers for complex time-driven dynamics as in the fields of vehicles, aircrafts, <b>robots,</b> <b>electric</b> drives and complex power electronics equipments. Moving to the field of logic control, typical for industrial manufacturing automation, the design and verification process is approached in a completely different way, usually very “unstructured”. No clear distinction between functions and implementations, between functional architectures and technological architectures and platforms is considered. Probably this difference is due to the different “dynamical framework”of logic control with respect to analog/digital control. As a matter of facts, in logic control discrete-events dynamics replace time-driven dynamics; hence most of the formal and mathematical tools of analog/digital control cannot be directly migrated to logic control to enlighten the distinction between functions and implementations. In addition, in the common view of application technicians, logic control design is strictly connected to the adopted implementation technology (relays in the past, software nowadays), leading again to a deep confusion among functional view and technological view. In Industrial automation software engineering, concepts as modularity, encapsulation, composability and reusability are strongly emphasized and profitably realized in the so-calledobject-oriented methodologies. Industrial automation is receiving lately this approach, as testified by some IEC standards IEC 611313, IEC 61499 which have been considered in commercial products only recently. On the other hand, in the scientific and technical literature many contributions have been already proposed to establish a suitable modelling framework for industrial automation. During last years it was possible to note a considerable growth in the exploitation of innovative concepts and technologies from ICT world in industrial automation systems. For what concerns the logic control design, Model Based Design (MBD) is being imported in industrial automation from software engineering field. Another key-point in industrial automated systems is the growth of requirements in terms of availability, reliability and safety for technological systems. In other words, the control system should not only deal with the nominal behaviour, but should also deal with other important duties, such as diagnosis and faults isolations, recovery and safety management. Indeed, together with high performance, in complex systems fault occurrences increase. This is a consequence of the fact that, as it typically occurs in reliable mechatronic systems, in complex systems such as AMS, together with reliable mechanical elements, an increasing number of electronic devices are also present, that are more vulnerable by their own nature. The diagnosis problem and the faults isolation in a generic dynamical system consists in the design of an elaboration unit that, appropriately processing the inputs and outputs of the dynamical system, is also capable of detecting incipient faults on the plant devices, reconfiguring the control system so as to guarantee satisfactory performance. The designer should be able to formally verify the product, certifying that, in its final implementation, it will perform itsrequired function guarantying the desired level of reliability and safety; the next step is that of preventing faults and eventually reconfiguring the control system so that faults are tolerated. On this topic an important improvement to formal verification of logic control, fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control results derive from Discrete Event Systems theory. The aimof this work is to define a design pattern and a control architecture to help the designer of control logic in industrial automated systems. The work starts with a brief discussion on main characteristics and description of industrial automated systems on Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 a survey on the state of the software engineering paradigm applied to industrial automation is discussed. Chapter 3 presentes a architecture for industrial automated systems based on the new concept of Generalized Actuator showing its benefits, while in Chapter 4 this architecture is refined using a novel entity, the Generalized Device in order to have a better reusability and modularity of the control logic. In Chapter 5 a new approach will be present based on Discrete Event Systems for the problemof software formal verification and an active fault tolerant control architecture using online diagnostic. Finally conclusive remarks and some ideas on new directions to explore are given. In Appendix A are briefly reported some concepts and results about Discrete Event Systems which should help the reader in understanding some crucial points in chapter 5; while in Appendix B an overview on the experimental testbed of the Laboratory of Automation of University of Bologna, is reported to validated the approach presented in chapter 3, chapter 4 and chapter 5. In Appendix C some components model used in chapter 5 for formal verification are reported. ...|$|R
