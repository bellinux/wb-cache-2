50|$|The belt {{grinding}} process is variable by adjusting certain parameters such as belt speed, grinding pressure, feed speed, durometer of the contact drum, {{size of the}} contact drum and the abrasive belt that is used. The machines {{can be made for}} wet or dry operation. Furthermore, a wide {{belt grinding}} machine can be constructed with single or multiple heads. The first head is used for coarse grinding and the next heads gradually make a finer <b>finish.</b> Wide <b>belt</b> grinding is also used as a high stock removal method for special metals (e.g. stainless steel, titanium, and nickel alloys).|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Of {{this paper}} is the {{investigation}} of surface integrity generated in hard turning and subsequent finishabrasive machining. The primary reason for undertaking this problem was insufficient magnitude of compressiveresidual stresses after hard turning which determines the fatigue resistance of highly loaded transmission parts. Design/methodology/approach: Employed uses 2 D and 3 D description of the surface roughness/surfacemicrostreometry and the X-ray diffraction method for measurements of residual stresses. The main scopeof this research program is to record the relevant changes of surface layer features resulting from the applicationof finish abrasive passes. Findings: Can be distinguished into two groups. First, <b>finish</b> <b>belt</b> grinding produces the residual stresses with themaximum value of– 1000 MPa, which is satisfactory for improving fatigue life. Second, the bearing propertiesimprove due to displaying negative values of the skew. Research limitations/implications: Deal with the identification range of 3 D roughness parameters and thelack of modern equipment for robust measurements of residual stresses: Future research should be focused onthe stronger correlation between technological and exploitation properties of the surfaces produced by hard andabrasive technologies. However, it needs more detailed inputs from automotive industry. Practical implications: Are related to the automotive industry, especially to manufactures of such transmissionelements as synchronizing cones/planes on gear wheels. The sequences of new hybrid machining processesare partly verified in terms of industry needs (machining conditions, machine tools, special equipment,cutting and abrasive tools). Originality/value: Of this industry–oriented contribution {{is based on the}} aggregating hard cutting and abrasivemachining processes. The practical value of the paper is that it proposes a very beneficial machining processfor highly loaded hardened parts...|$|R

50|$|Following Rose's departure, Mike Pratt, an {{assistant}} under Rose at Charlotte, {{was named the}} head coach for the 1978-1979 season. In his first and only head coaching job, Pratt could not maintain {{the success of the}} program under Rose, compiling a 56-52 record over four seasons with no postseason appearances. The best year under Pratt was the 1978-1979 season in which the 49ers earned a 16-11 record and a second place Sun <b>Belt</b> <b>finish.</b> Pratt was dismissed following the 1981-1982 season.|$|R
50|$|The {{present day}} design was adopted in 1950. The Pouch <b>Belt's</b> <b>finish</b> of fine {{smoothness}} {{was changed to}} coarse leather. This was {{due to lack of}} seal skins in India. And also to revive the original material worn by the Napier's who had followed the original belt presented to their Commanding Officer at the Battle of Meeanee by the Scinde Horse. The four principal Battle Honours in Kirkee, Meeanee, Alewal and Bushire were engraved upon it and only the Bugle without crossed swords was present.|$|R

The rise up the tables was gradual, by 1985–86, they had a third-place <b>finish</b> under their <b>belts,</b> but better was yet to come. The 1986–87 season was the landmark in Napoli's history; they won the double, securing the Serie A title by three points and then beating Atalanta 4–0 to lift the Coppa Italia.|$|R

Shelton Martis then put Doncaster in the lead, while two minutes into the second-half, Dean Shiels made it 3-1. Reading brought on Noel Hunt and Simon Church, and Hunt made an {{immediate}} impact by crossing in for Jem Karacan to head past Neil Sullivan. Then Harte whipped a superb free-kick into the top corner and to <b>finish</b> off, Church <b>belted</b> in substitute Antonio's squareball.|$|R
5|$|After 1976, gaps in {{the belt}} route were present from 2100 North near the airport to SR-201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay. The first step in {{completing}} the gap was taken in June 1979, when construction of the interstate from State Street to 700 East began. This {{was followed by the}} Cottonwood Inc. lawsuit being awarded in favor of UDOT in November 1979. In July 1985, the route from 280 East to Union Park Avenue was completed. At the time, this portion of road was the most expensive in the state in terms of cost per mile, due to the road being depressed below surrounding neighborhoods. The next section to open was from 2100 North south to I-80 in 1987. This was followed by a section between Union Park Avenue and 2000 East, opened in November 1987, which was also built as a sunken freeway. The western quadrant of the freeway was completed in October 1988, closing the gap between SR-201 and I-80 (however, the California Avenue interchange wasn't opened until mid-1989). In August 1989, the road from 2000 East to 6200 South was <b>finished,</b> and the <b>belt</b> route was completed with the opening of freeway between 4500 South and 6200 South in October 1989.|$|R

The club won their second Coppa Italia trophy in 1975-76, knocking out Milan and Fiorentina en route, before beating rivals Hellas Verona 4-0 in the final. In terms of the Italian league, Napoli were {{still very much a}} consistent top six side for much of the late 1970s. Even into the earliest two seasons of the 1980s, the club were performing respectably with a third-place finish in 1980-81, however by 1983 they had slipped dramatically and were involved in relegation battles.Napoli broke the world transfer record fee, turning to Diego Maradona with a €12 million deal from Barcelona on 30 June 1984.

50|$|By 1973, {{construction}} was progressing {{on the western}} quadrant between I-15 in Murray and SR-201 (at the time US-40A/US-50A). Land acquisition was also taking place {{for the rest of}} the southeastern quadrant between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay. However, a citizens' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right-of-way acquirements due to the lack of an environmental impact statement (EIS). Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East. By mid-1975, an EIS was released with four main alternatives: a no-build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast quadrant, building the road along the modern-day path (at about 6400 South), moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South, or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South. Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS. Meanwhile, I-215 from SR-201 in the western quadrant to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976.After 1976, gaps in the belt route were present from 2100 North near the airport to SR-201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay.
