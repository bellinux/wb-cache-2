My {{standard}} comment is, If you don't want your kids to be like Bart Simpson, don't act like Homer Simpson. —Matt Groening, in a 1998 interview when asked, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to critics who consider Bart Simpson a dreadful role model for children?" [...] Bart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children. Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that [...] "Bart outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear our children will become." [...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as [...] "egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited." [...] In response to the criticism, James L. Brooks said, [...] "I'm very wary of television where everybody {{is supposed to be}} a role model, you don't run across that many role models in real life.

Wes demands money from Kyle in return for providing security for the event. Kyle is stunned and Milligan told Inside Soap {{that he does not}} know how to react. The actor explained [...] "Holland makes it clear that if Kyle doesn't pay up, big trouble will come his way - and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to that?" [...] Kyle is shaken up by the confrontation with Wes and he turns to Kate, who advises him to speak to Mark. Kyle is reluctant because of his history with the detective. However, when Kyle returns to the car yard to remove the sale signs, he gets another visit from Wes. The officer gets physical with Kyle and threatens to destroy his stock. Kyle then decides to go to Mark for help. Kyle explains the situation to Mark, but the story is not very believable. Milligan said [...] "At first it isn't easy for them to work together because it's hard for Kyle to seek help off someone he's already had problems with, and he knows how Brennan feels about him - plus it's another cop, so he isn't convinced that Brennan will believe him." [...] Mark is under the impression Wes is a trusted colleague, so he decides to get proof before he believes Kyle. Mark finds the evidence he needs and he and Kyle confront Wes. When asked if the situation would be a turning point for Kyle and Mark, Milligan said that it was. He added while they would not become best friends, they would not be enemies either.|$|E

I know youre getting tired of hearing me say that. But I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans voting me on the All-Century Team.

Why do we want to believe everything he says?Gray: You signed a paper acknowledging the ban.

Why not, at this point, take a different approach?Rose: Well, when you say it hadnt worked, what do you exactly mean?Gray: Youre not allowed in baseball. Youre not allowed to earn a living in the game you love. And youre not allowed to be in the Hall of Fame.Rose: Well, I took that approach and that was to apply for reinstatement. I hope Bud Selig considers that and gives me an opportunity. I wont need a third chance. All I need is a second chance.Gray: Pete, those who will hear this tonight will say you have been your own worst enemy and continue to be.

How accurate is the chemical imbalance explanation for depression? How widely do laypersons agree with the explanation, and how do they interpret the explanation? We discuss the origins, accuracy, and transmittal (e. g., via direct-to-consumer advertising) of the chemical imbalance explanation for depression. We next present results from a group case study examining lay endorsement and interpretation of the explanation. Finally, we discuss clinical implications and present a short script for educating clients concerning “chemical imbalances ” in depression...|$|E

This study is qualitative in nature. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 35 volunteer teachers from primary and high schools located in different parts of Ankara. The subjects taught by the participating teachers varied. Each participant was asked the following questions: 1 -Based on your experiences, what are the psychological difficulties most often faced by your students? 2 - How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to their presenting psychological difficulties? and, 3 - Do you think that your responses are effective?

PROFESSOR GOLDSTEIN: If this is the effect, it is certainly contrary to everything we propose.

Second, we urge that every effort be made to maintain the continuity of ties with the family from whom the child has been removed. It is—or at least it should be—a function of foster parents to keep alive these ties and bonds because the primary goal of temporary placement is to restore a child as quickly as possible to the family from which she came...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this work was to gain insight on teachers??? {{perceptions}} and knowledge on bullying among students within their schools {{as well as how}} teachers manage bullying behaviors from their students. Additionally, this work was performed to discover whether teachers have been properly trained in handling student bullying and to examine whether teachers' witness more bullying behavior among female or male students at their school. The proposed research questions will involve the researcher asking the participants personal demographic questions, likert rating scale questions, and free response questions related specifically to their perceptions of bullying actions and its relation to their specific school environment. The primary research questions posed to teachers in the study included: What are the ways in which <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to bullying among students in your school?

While Tateishi relies on both pathos and ethos to appeal to his reader, can you recognize appeals to reason and logic as well? Consider Tateishi’s command of language.

Though Tateishi’s response is brief, he delves deeply into the content and meaning(s) of the advertisement. What is the difference between summary and analysis? Locate moments where the writer shifts between these two modes to give a fully developed response. For example, the statement, “Color is a major contributor to the ad’s devious message,” is an analytic claim. Overall, how does Tateishi organize the essay? Lastly, notice the conclusion, especially the last line.

40|$|Improve {{response}} {{by teachers and}} schools for children with life threatening crisis prone medical conditions. An action research project was undertaken to identify the extent of these conditions and this problem in schools and to make recommendations for teachers and schools about responding for children with life threatening crisis prone medical conditions. Three focus groups were conducted with Brisbane Catholic Education Consultants (Inclusive Education) from seven primary schools and four secondary schools - metropolitan, some rural and one semi rural. A survey was conducted by telephone and email with Principals of 18 schools, to seek exemplars of effective practice in schools to respond to crises for children with crisis prone medical conditions. Data includes how Principals identified these students and what their practices were in dealing with them both at enrolment and when a crisis occurred. Examples of questions that were asked in the focus groups: What crisis prone medical conditions do your students have? What do you understand about these crisis prone medical conditions? Who responds and How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>respond</b> to crises for these students? The data from the focus groups was of mixed usefulness, {{as some of the}} respondents had varying ideas of what constituted a crisis, and of some of these were not life threatening. From the focus groups we were able to determine that the main life threatening crises were Asthma, Diabetes Mellitus, Epilepsy, Anaphylaxis. Several schools identified exemplar responses to the crisis that they were undertaking. From this point we consulted with the Principals about identifying these at risk students at enrolment, and how they identify them and how the school follows up on them. All of this was compiled and analysed and it seemed that mostly the Principals did not have a full picture of the numbers of at risk students. Where they thought they were collecting data on these students at enrolment via forms, the questions being asked on the forms were of an open ended nature. Parents were reporting to these questions using a variety of terminology, and the data collected by the schools was entered into a database verbatim, for example ‘severe asthma’ or ‘allergy to nuts’, but the schools were not able to categorise the responses in a meaningful way, meaning that searches for a particular life threatening crisis on the database would not return reliable numbers and or names of students with this condition. A key recommendation arising from this research was to change how this data was collected at enrolment and to have options on the forms for clear categories like Asthma, Diabetes, Epilepsy and Anaphylaxis. As well, exemplars for practice were recommended and information factsheets were supplied to schools for inclusion in their teacher education...|$|E
