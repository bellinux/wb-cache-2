To minimize this problem each copper tap has a bypass switch (relays), which closes in a power down situation (as shown in the picture), to bring the link back up. Also this solution will not detect that the link is down for a minimum of three seconds. These three seconds are a result of the autonegotiation behavior.

30|$|PL (B) {{are more}} {{sensitive}} to <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> at the AlAs/In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As interfaces; however, the <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> {{is closely related to}} interface roughness [10]. These phenomena could be explained by considering AlAs/In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As interface problems, such as well-size fluctuations in the atomic layer scale, rather than impurity effects since a low-energy peak is not observed in samples with an <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> of 40 s. (2) As reported in a previous work [11], with increasing <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> at interfaces, sufficient time allows cation to migrate and smooth the interfaces, whereas with increasing <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> beyond 60 s, we found that peak A reemerges in the PL spectra. Therefore, we believe that interface smoothness of a long interruption is commonly better than that of a short interruption. However, this is not the best choice for strained AlAs/In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As/InAs RTDs. Then, there must be another significant contribution to the degradation of interface smoothness for a longer <b>interruption</b> <b>time.</b> Normally, after the InAs sub-well was grown, we increased the substrate temperature for the growth preparation of the top In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As well layer. The lattice mismatch between In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As and InAs is 3.1 %, which is considerably large. So with a too long <b>interruption</b> <b>time,</b> which means an in situ anneal, a strain-induced roughness in a highly strained In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As layer might play an important role on interface smoothness. In addition, according to the observation of an RHEED pattern, when the <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> exceeded 60 s, streak pattern of the In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As layer was weaker than before. Therefore, strain-induced roughness is probably viewed as the main cause of abnormal PL spectra.|$|E

30|$|The {{unencumbered}} call <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> {{is defined}} as the period of time from the instant a secondary call establish a radio link with a cell until the time it would be interrupted due to the arrival of a PU assuming that the network has unlimited resources and the service time is of infinite duration. Physically, this time represents the period of time that a secondary call last before it would be abruptly terminated due to a primary call arrival under the assumption that both the cell dwell time and the unencumbered service time are of infinite duration. The call <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> is said to be “unencumbered” because the interruption of a secondary call in progress by a primary user arrival can or cannot occur, depending on the values of the CDT and the UST. Thus, a particular secondary call is interrupted in the current cell if and only if its potential call <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> is smaller than both the unencumbered service time and residual cell dwell time (or both the unencumbered residual service time and cell dwell time). Therefore, notice that this call <b>interruption</b> <b>time</b> is not a measurable physical quantity.

Moreover, exposure of Ga 0. 47 In 0. 53 As to phosphine for 2 s results in the formation of approximately 2 monolayers of Ga 0. 48 In 0. 52 As 0. 21 P 0. 79 quaternary under biaxial tensile strain at the Ga 0. 47 In 0. 53 As/InP interface.
