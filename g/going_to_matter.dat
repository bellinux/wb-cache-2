2500|$|On 16 October, Catalogue was {{published}} by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, {{as well as the}} design of albums, videos, tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: [...] "In the beginning we made a decision – and it was in our EMI contract – that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> hugely as well; and that we were never going to give up on that." [...] Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of Catalogue, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's National Portrait Gallery, on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.|$|E

60|$|Apart {{from these}} {{patriotic}} solicitudes, M. Blériot has set quite another {{train of thought}} going in my mind. The age of natural democracy is surely at an end through these machines. There {{comes a time when}} men will be sorted out into those who will have the knowledge, nerve, and courage to do these splendid, dangerous things, and those who will prefer the humbler level. I do not think numbers are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> so much in the warfare of the future, and that when organised intelligence differs from the majority, the majority will have no adequate power of retort. The common man with a pike, being only sufficiently indignant and abundant, could chase the eighteenth century gentleman as he chose, but I fail to see what he can do in the way of mischief to an elusive chevalier with wings. But that opens too wide a discussion for me to enter upon now.|$|E
6000|$|He {{pointed a}} finger at me. He had struck {{to the heart of}} my shame. I made the only {{possible}} reply by a rush at him. [...] "Hello!" [...] he cried, at my blackavised attack. He dropped back into an attitude that had some style in it, parried my blow, got back at my cheek, and laughed with surprise and relief at his own success. Whereupon I became a thing of murderous rage. He could box as well or better than I--he had yet to realise I knew anything of that at all--but I had fought once or twice to a finish with bare fists. I was used to inflicting and enduring savage hurting, and I doubt if he had ever fought. I hadn't fought ten seconds before I felt this softness in him, realised all that quality of modern upper-class England that never goes to the quick, that hedges about rules and those petty points of honour that are the ultimate comminution of honour, that claims credit for things demonstrably half done. He seemed to think that first hit of his and one or two others were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter,</b> that I ought to give in when presently my lip bled and dripped blood upon my clothes. So before we had been at it a minute he had ceased to be aggressive except in momentary spurts, and I was knocking him about almost as I wanted to do; and demanding breathlessly and fiercely, after our school manner, whether he had had enough, not knowing that by his high code and his soft training it was equally impossible for him to either buck-up and beat me, or give in.|$|E

Turner {{attended}} secondary school at St Mac Dara's Community College in Templeogue before leaving to join his older brother at Firhouse Community College. Turner has stated: “I probably wasn’t a great student. I had a car when I was 17, so I used to just run out of school when I could, jump {{in the car and}} go play pool in Tallaght. I don’t know how I knew, but I convinced myself that my exam results were never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> to me.” ...|$|E
50|$|As {{part of this}} discussion, Francione {{identifies}} what {{he calls}} our “moral schizophrenia” {{when it comes to}} nonhumans. On the one hand, we say that we take animal interests seriously. Francione points to {{the fact that many of}} us even live with nonhuman companions whom we regard as members of our families and whose personhood—their status as beings with intrinsic moral value—we do not doubt for a second. On the other hand, because animals are property, they remain things that have no value other than what we choose to accord them and whose interests we protect only when it provides a benefit—usually economic—to do so. According to Francione, if animals are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> morally and not be things, we cannot treat them as property. Francione debated the sentience of plants with Michael Marder in a debate organized by Columbia University Press.|$|E

5000|$|The {{important}} part {{is what we}} do with this information. We want to move from crisis management to lasting solutions. Other cities have done that successfully.

That's where our focus is; that's what matters. ... We don't know exactly what's going to work here in New York, but we know what's worked in other cities.

5000|$|Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio gave a mixed {{review of}} Obama's speech, saying, [...] "While I was {{encouraged}} by the President's support for an earmark ban and will work with him towards that goal, his call for a mere budget freeze does {{not go far enough}} in tackling our record debt. At the very least, we should freeze non-defense and non-veterans discretionary spending to what it was before Washington began its unprecedented, record-setting spending binge two years ago. But most importantly, we need to finally begin fundamentally reforming the way our government spends the American people's money." [...] Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, also of Florida, praised Obama for [...] "bringing us out of recession with jobs, helping small business, helping seniors with retirement security, getting government spending under control. Then he talked about civility. How do we treat each other? That’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> a lot." [...] Florida Governor Rick Scott strongly criticized Obama's speech while New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand praised his economic agenda.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2010, {{actor and}} {{musician}} Miles Fisher {{was the first}} to be cast in the film as Peter Friedkin. Fisher had appeared in numerous short films and in a small role in the comedy film Superhero Movie. Fisher said during an interview that [...] "I've done a little bit of television {{and a little bit of}} film, but 3-D is almost an entirely different sport." [...] Three days after Fisher's casting, Arlen Escarpeta was cast in the film as Nathan. Escarpeta explained that [...] "I think what they're going to do really, really well this time around, they're going to go back - the story, the plot, a lot of stuff is really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter,</b> I think the last movie it was just death. It was death, death, death, which is fine because that's what people want to see. But this time we're going to give them a little bit of everything - good story, great director - it's going to be good." [...] He appeared in the films American Gun and Friday the 13th. In late August 2010 Nicholas D'Agosto and Ellen Wroe were cast. One day later, Tony Todd, who portrayed William Bludworth from the first two installments joined the film.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2013, Tao {{released}} an album, Gordon Getty: Piano Pieces, on the PENTATONE label. Tao's debut full-length solo album, on EMI Classics, Voyages, featuring Tao's compositions together with pieces by Meredith Monk, Rachmaninoff and Ravel, {{was released on}} June 11, 2013. The album reached No. 8 on the Billboard Classical Albums chart. Allmusic rates the album four stars out of five. Davidson wrote: [...] "The playing induces shivers. The Rachmaninoff C minor prelude (Op. 23, No. 7) gushes out in quiet cataracts, lyrical and shimmering, {{a tour de force}} of delicacy and power." [...] Despite Tao's skepticism about a classical music establishment that is [...] "grossly normative, capitalistic, and steeped in established, unchallenged practices", commented one reviewer, Voyages is [...] "perfect in all the conventional ways: masterfully performed and composed ... cleanly produced, and impeccably sequenced. ... It's an absolute joy to hear him fly through each of these pieces, the essences of which are not overwhelmed but rather recontextualized, given new life ... Tao has the creative mind to think of them in new ways." [...] Fanfare magazine also gave the album a very warm review, and the producers of the album were nominated for a Grammy Award. A reviewer for NPR wrote: [...] Tao proves himself to be a musician of deep intellectual and emotional means. ... Tao is a prodigiously talented pianist ... but he also emerges as a thoughtful and mature composer, as his four-movement Vestiges for solo piano demonstrates. ... What's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> ... to listeners is what he makes them feel - and on Voyages, the pianist journeys along varied and alluring pathways, from the dreamy contemplation of the Ravel [...] "Ondine (Wave)" [...] movement to the jaggedly darting [...] "upon being" [...] section from his Vestiges. His playing is strong and sure, and the effect is transcendent and beautiful.|$|E
5000|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{gave the}} series a B- overall, stating [...] "As is, {{the series is}} nowhere near as bad as its premise {{suggested}} it could have been, and comes off a little better in the end than the initial impression it gives, but its appeal is still not going to extend much beyond the normal crowd of fan service and graphic action aficionados." [...] The writing quality and character development was critiqued as varied, though praise was directed at the visuals. Freezing ranked 14th {{on a list of}} [...] "36 Titillating Ecchi Anime That Won't Let You Down" [...] by anime website GoBoiano. Martin earlier gave Freezing a score of 3.5 out of 5 in his preview of 2011 winter anime, finding the artwork and animation to be very good at times though sometimes inconsistent; however, he opined that [...] "any of the series’ other potential weaknesses aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> if you have a sweet spot for the fan service/violence combo, though, as on that front it scores big-time." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also of Anime News Network, complained that the mixture of the [...] "serious" [...] premise and storyline coupled with the gratuitous fanservice was [...] "uncomfortable at best; disturbing at worst", and attacked the [...] "creative bankruptcy, interminable explication, lazy characterization" [...] of the series. Ultimately, a score of 1.5 was given. Carlo Santos too gave Freezing a score of 1.5, finding it to feel [...] "like the brainchild of that one person you knew in high school wrote a Big Epic Space Adventure that no publisher would be dumb enough to accept because it was too unwieldy and confusing ... Except that in Japan, someone actually did accept that Big Epic Space Adventure. And made an unwieldy, confusing anime out of it." ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to give a {{qualitative}} assessment of the impact of " 1992 " on a region of centre-east of Italy, Marche, under the new interesting theory of economic geography. Two basic approaches were used: that of EC that identifies 40 sensitive sectors to 1992, coupled with the presence of highly skilled labour, and the economic geography approach that looks at location, at the migration of people into the area and at the enodowment of infrastucture. The social and economic indicators suggest that the so-called sensitive sectors of the region (like textiles, clothing and footwear) are not likely to be that sensitive to 1992 : trade policy is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> more. Skill-intensive sectors (like mechanical engineering) will face a more critical time. The low capital formation of the region and the low endowment of potential human capital for these sectors support this argument. However, the positive migration to the region over the past few years reflects the optimistic expectations about the future growth of the economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to understand the definition, conceptualization, and assessing the impact of organizational culture on organizational performance and also {{to examine the relationship between}} culture and performance. The study adopted the interpretive pattern and used questionnaire in collecting the data. A total of 109 copies of questionnaire were distributed to various company officers. Since the data were based on nominal scale, simple percentage and Chi-square methods were used to compute and analyze the stated hypotheses. The findings showed that there is a significant relationship between culture and organizational performance. The findings also showed that exogenous variables such as the nature of the economy and polity have more impact on organizational performance than endogenous variables such as size, organizational culture, organizational structure and technology. The results of the analysis of the cultural variables showed a high level of commitment to work, low level of labour turnover and absenteeism, positive beliefs about work, positive work values, attitudes, and norms. And that culture is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> in performance unless managers understands it and know how to translate this connection into action. Based on the research conclusions made in this study, some recommendations were offered for possible consideration by TANESCO. ...|$|E
40|$|Consider n {{points in}} Euclidean three-space. Fixing {{attention}} {{on one of}} these points, the others gives rise to n − 1 points on its sphere of vision. Thinking of this as the Riemann sphere gives a polynomial of degree n− 1, having as its zeroes these n− 1 points. This polynomial is only defined up to scale but this is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> for the simplest conjecture: just choose any scale and regard its coefficients as a complex n-vector. Repeating this exercise for each of the n points gives n such vectors and hence an n ×n matrix. In [1, 2], Atiyah conjectured that a matrix constructed in this way cannot be singular. In [3], Atiyah and Sutcliffe amass a great deal of numerical evidence for this conjecture and formulate a series of further conjectures based on the geometry that their numerical studies apparently reveal. In spite of overwhelming evidence in its favour, the basic conjecture, as stated above, remains surprisingly resistant. The case n = 3 is not too hard: a geometric argument is given in [1] and an algebraic one in [2]. In this article we establish the case n = 4. 1. Normalisation In describing Atiyah’s conjecture above we were satisfied with the directions defined by pairs of points amongst the n points. Now we take the scale into account.
