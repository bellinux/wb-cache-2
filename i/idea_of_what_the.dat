5|$|Meshuggah's {{music is}} written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with {{assistance}} from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea {{to the other}} members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member has an <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively {{in terms of a}} particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had an <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) {{for the relationship between}} Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give some <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Pine Creek Gorge was like {{before it was}} clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. Many animal species that are now vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks {{that they had to}} sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E

5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have a clear <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> enemy {{was supposed to do}} (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E

The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no, so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this. The Ministry logically turned to Kanō, who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe. Kanō agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee, and, after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, [...] "a fairly good <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Games were." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{models are}} {{developed}} as defining either {{the current state}} of the process, in which case the final product is called the [...] "as-is" [...] snapshot model, or a collection <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> process should contain, resulting in a [...] "what-can-be" [...] model.

Analysis can be used to fundamentally reshape the way your business or organization conducts its operations.|$|R

500|$|The {{first act}} of the new rulers of Syria was to {{establish}} the twenty-man National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), composed of twelve Ba'athists and eight Nasserists and independents.

Later, six civilians were given membership in NCRC, three Ba'athists (Aflaq, al-Bitar and Mansur al-Atrash) and three Nasserists. However, this did not change the balance of power, and the officers still controlled the country. From the beginning, the military committee members formed state policies behind the backs of other NCRC members – when the civilian leadership found out, [...] al-Atrash said: [...] "Why do not these gentlemen speak?

[...] "Houses in Motion" [...] incorporates lengthy brass performances from Jon Hassell, while [...] "Listening Wind" [...] features Arabic music elements. The final track on the album, [...] "The Overload," [...] was TalkingHeads' attempt to emulate the sound of British post-punk band Joy Division. The song was made despite no band member having heard the music of Joy Division; rather, it was based on an <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> British quartet might sound like based on descriptions in the music press.
