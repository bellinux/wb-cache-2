40|$|The rural {{population}} from Romania is dealing even {{today with the}} absence of access to a sure drinking water source. Therefore in 2002 only 65 % of the Romanian population had access to drinking water, distributed in 90 % from the urban environment and 33 % from the rural one (www. recensamant 2002. ro). This work presents a case study referring to a 3 month (April-May-June 2011) monitoring of weekly samples {{of the quality of}} well water (10 samples) from Tureni village, Cluj County. A portable multiparameter model WTW 720 Germany was used to measure the pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, oxidation-reduction potential and salinity of the collected water samples (these tests were done on site). In laboratory, using the photometric method (RQ <b>Flex</b> <b>instrument,</b> Merck) we determined : Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, SO 42 -, Cl- and NO 3 - (C. Nertan et C. Rosu, 2008). The analyzed well water samples have values over the legally admitted limits by the Romanian legislation for the drinking waters (L 458 / 2002) in the calcium cation, the nitrate and sulfate anion, but also in the global parameters: salinity and TDS...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{released}} a staff working paper on commodity dependence and poverty {{in developing countries}} in August 2003. From its analysis {{it is apparent that}} the problem of agricultural commodity dependency is primarily a problem which afflicts ACP countries. For two commodities - coffee and cotton - dependent African countries are all LDCs with a low human development index. Similarly for cocoa the main dependent countries are LDCs or low-income countries. The paper acknowledges that 'lower export prices mean reduced farm incomes, lower agricultural wages or even unemployment', which then feeds into a cycle of low investment and stagnant productivity. 'Lower export incomes also have an effect on government revenues' which 'means reduced budgetary resources for poverty -reducing activities such as health and education'. It notes that falls in export earnings also affect the balance of payments, putting pressure on debt servicing. The paper reviews the challenges faced and outlines 'a set of actions that could be taken by these countries at the national and international level, to address these issues in the longer term'. The key challenges identified include: 'long term declining price trends; short term volatility; international market concentration and integration; market reforms in producing countries and the over-dependence on traditional primary commodities, such as coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas and sugar'. In response to long-term declining prices the paper recommends that steps be taken to increase competitiveness, profit margins and the share of consumer prices that goes to producers. It does not favour the revival of international commodity agreements, maintaining that the 'conditions are not in place that would allow such schemes to be successful'. On market concentration it calls for more reflection on 'how to balance the economic powers of large multinational and small producers in developing countries, whilst retaining incentive to improve flows of FDI', but makes no proposals. On domestic market reforms it argues for close collaboration between government and producer organisations including a 'more active role for governments' so as to create an enabling environment for the domestic private sector. The paper notes the challenge of diversification and highlights 'the lack of trade-related capacity in many developing countries' as a major hurdle. It emphasises the importance of developing production for local and regional markets as an important vehicle for diversification. Overall the paper argues that 'commodity-dependent countries need to analyse their own situation and devise more proactive strategies to address the crises facing their key economic sectors. An important component of this, it is argued, is to analyse the 'potential international constraints to the development of their commodity sectors' and to argue their case for change in appropriate fora. Comment: Singularly absent from the Commission paper were any proposals for the re-establishment of a coherent EU response to the consequences of commodity price declines. This is a remarkable oversight given the singular failure of the new <b>FLEX</b> <b>instrument,</b> which replaced the old STABEX scheme. While reference is made to stabilisation funds which sought to stabilise prices by means of buffer-stock intervention, little reference is made to the role that STABEX transfers played in financing these mechanisms in certain ACP countries. Significantly, while the commodities looked at include sugar and cotton, in analysing declining price trends little reference is made to the impact of EU sugar-sector policies since 1970 on declining world market prices, or the impact of US cotton-sector policies on declining cotton prices. Indeed, the only reference to cotton, sugar and rice is when the paper observes somewhat obscurely that 'most large international actors could intensify their efforts to promote policy coherence'. Given the concentration of market {{power in the hands of}} the coffee roasters, where four coffee roasters dominate the global market, the EU could use its existing competition legislation to ascertain the extent to which these four companies abuse their dominant market position in relation to coffee growers. This could act as a useful basis for promoting the objective of ensuring that coffee producers get an increased proportion of the final sale value of the finished product. Ironically, diversification in some countries (Zambia, Mozambique, Ethiopia) is compounding the problems of existing producers (e. g. in the sugar sector). In addition some areas of diversification to serve regional markets (e. g. Ugandan production of wheat) run into the problem of market distortions generated by agricultural support programmes of OECD countries. What is more, efforts to diversify (e. g. citrus production in Swaziland) can be undermined by the harmonisation of EU sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which increase non-tariff obstacles to trade and the risks associated with exporting to the EU market. The Commission paper observes that 'a key condition for success is that the market targeted by diversification must be a growing and dynamic one'. However if it is a growing and dynamic market it is likely to be targeted by established OECD producers and other commodity-dependent developing countries who are seeking to diversify, leading to over supply and declining prices (e. g. the emerging trend in the cut-flower sector). Regarding the question of moving up the value chain, the paper notes that 'smaller commodity-producing countries are at a comparative disadvantage to enter into processing', since increasingly strict and sophisticated market requirements are faced which require large scale investment and high volumes of throughput. The refusal to consider a revival of international commodity agreements on the grounds that the 'conditions are not in place that would allow such schemes to be successful' assumes that the conditions cannot be created. This is challenged in a new book jointly published by the CTA and Zed Press, Stolen Fruit, by Peter Robbins, who argues that on the contrary there are provisions within the WTO itself, currently being followed up under the leadership of Kenya, that would allow price interventions in cases like coffee which have seen a fall in real prices to a seventh of their 1980 value.

40|$|Robot {{assistance}} {{can enhance}} minimally invasive image-guided surgery, but flexion of the thin surgical instrument shaft impairs accurate control by creating {{errors in the}} kinematic model. Two controller enhancements that can mitigate these errors are improved kinematic models that account for flexing and direct measurement of the instrument tip's position. This paper presents an experiment quantifying the benefits of these enhancements {{in an effort to}} inform development of an image-guided robot control system accurate in the presence of quasi-static instrument flexion. The study measured a controller's ability to guide a <b>flexing</b> <b>instrument</b> along user-commanded motions while preventing incursions into a forbidden region virtual fixture. Compared with the controller using neither enhancement, improved kinematics and reduced maximum incursion depth into the forbidden region by 28 %, tip tracking by 67 %, and both enhancements together by 83 %.

40|$|FLEX (FLuorescence EXperiment) is a {{candidate}} mission for the European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Explorer program. The main objective of the mission is the measurement the chlorophyll fluorescence signal emitted by vegetation at the red and far-red spectral regions (roughly 630 - 770 nm). The current FLEX mission design includes different instruments intended to provide the appropriate characterization of those atmospheric and surface parameters necessary for the retrieval and interpretation of the fluorescence signal. The complete processing chain for the derivation of fluorescence and reflectance products from the radiance data acquired by the different instruments included in the FLEX payload is described in this paper. Six processing modules have been implemented: cloud screening, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieval, automatic spectral characterisation, columnar water vapor (CWV) retrieval, fluorescence retrieval and reflectance retrieval. The processing chain has been tested against a scene-based simulated data set which reproduces <b>FLEX</b> <b>instruments</b> and realistic atmospheric conditions. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to isolate target bacteria in high background microbiota food matrices. This is certainly the case for isolating Shigellae from foods such as apple juice, potato salad, bagged peeled carrots, whole romaine lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and green onions. A comparison of current methods was performed using USFDA Bacterial Analytical Method (BAM), USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment, Pathatrix IMS, and KingFisher Flex. Using {{the results from the}} comparisons, a novel streamlined method named Pathatrix-KingFisher was created for detecting and isolating Shigellae in green onions. The Immunomagnetic Separation (IMS) technology used by Pathatrix Auto and KingFisher <b>Flex</b> <b>instruments</b> aided in screening and recovery of Shigellae. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment with my novel Pathatrix-KingFisher method on green onions was performed. Food samples were artificially inoculated with < 30 CFU/ 25 g of a previously - 80 ??C frozen Shigella flexneri 2457 M culture, and compared with no-spike controls and no-matrix controls. All methods were evaluated at 5 h and/or 24 h post-incubation for their detection and isolation efficacy. Presumptive positive isolates were confirmed to be Shigellae using TSI slants and/or qPCR with primers to the Shigellae specific ipaH gene. The USFDA BAM method was able to detect and recover Shigellae on processed foods (for example, apple juice, potato salad, bagged peeled carrots, whole romaine lettuce), but not for food with high background microbiota (for example, alfalfa sprouts and green onions). The USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment method was inconsistent at detecting and isolating Shigellae from all foods. The Pathatrix IMS method was effective at detecting Shigellae in foods, but was ineffective at isolating Shigellae. Both the Pathatrix IMS and KingFisher Flex were able to detect Shigellae using qPCR consistently after 5 h of incubation. The recoveries at 5 h incubation, even with the help of IMS from the two instruments, were inconsistent. Shigellae were detected and isolated regularly after 24 h of incubation using the KingFisher Flex. When compared to the USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment method, both the IMS methods were more consistent in detecting and isolating Shigellae in green onions. By using both instruments, my novel method, Pathatrix-KingFisher, takes advantage of the sensitivity of Pathatrix Auto sample size and the automation of the KingFisher Flex???s 96 - well format to generate consistent high-throughput results. Two automated platforms using immunomagnetic separation technology were compared for detecting and recovering Escherichia coli O 157 in ground beef and sprouts and Shigella flexneri in green onions. The foods were inoculated with < 20 CFU/ 25 g and tested at 5 and 24 h post-incubation. Immunomagnetic beads were mixed with food enrichments, processed through the Pathatrix Auto or KingFisher Flex, and tested by realtime PCR (qPCR) and recovery on selective agars. At 5 h, the Pathatrix Auto detected E. coli O 157 in 90...|$|R
