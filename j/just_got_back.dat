500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E

2500|$|The new styling was {{the work}} of {{designer}} Richard A. Teague, who would go on to design the 1968 Javelin and AMX. Many viewed the newly designed station wagon as the best looking of any American wagon, with its new trim lines, with ample passenger, and cargo room. Led by the top-line 440-series convertible, they were arguably the 1964's most attractive Detroit compacts. Car Life magazine titled its road test of the 1964 Rambler American: [...] "The Original Plain Jane Compact Car <b>Just</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Back</b> From the Beauty Parlor".|$|E

This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E

Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers.

2500|$|With James Ross {{in command}} of the ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, three-mast barques, Abernethy set off on a {{scientific}} expedition to Antarctica in 1839, supported by the Royal Society. Joseph Hooker, later Sir Joseph but then a young naturalist, took part but because it was a naval expedition he had to be appointed as assistant surgeon. Throughout the expedition a major aim was to take magnetic readings at various ports of call starting with Madeira, Tenerife, Cape Verde, Trinidad, St Helena, Cape Town, and the Crozet and Kerguelen islands. In a storm the boatswain was swept off Erebus so two boats were launched to rescue him, unsuccessfully.
