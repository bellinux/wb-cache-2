40|$|Palmprint {{is a novel}} {{biometric}} method to identify a person. Generally, {{there are two types}} of features in palmprint, i. e. structural features and statistical features. Structural features, such as lines, can characterize a palm exactly, but are difficult to be extracted and represented. Contrarily, statistical features can be extracted and represented easily, but are unable to reflect the structural information of a palmprint. The fact that the principal features of both Chinese character and palmprint are lines motivates us to try some methods of Chinese character recognition to identify palmprint. In this paper, we use the idea of an efficient Chinese character recognition method, <b>directional</b> <b>element</b> feature (DEF), to define a novel palmprint feature, named fuzzy <b>directional</b> <b>element</b> energy feature (FDEEF) which is a statistical feature containing some line structural information about palmprints. It can be extracted and represented easily and, at the same time, has a strong ability to distinguish palms. Two other low-dimensional features: global fuzzy <b>directional</b> <b>element</b> energy feature (GFDEEF) and block edge energy feature (BEEF) are also derived from FDEEF in this paper.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for designing frequency invariant (FI) uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs) with <b>directional</b> <b>elements</b> is proposed, and their applications to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and adaptive beamforming are studied. By treating the sensors along the radial {{direction of the}} UCCA as linear subarrays and using appropriately designed beamformers, each subarray is transformed to a virtual element with appropriate directivity. Consequently, the whole UCCA {{can be viewed as}} a virtual uniform circular array (UCA) with desired element directivity for broadband processing. By extending the approach for designing FI-UCAs, the frequency dependency of the phase modes of the virtual UCA is compensated to facilitate broadband DOA and adaptive beamforming. Both the linear array beamformers (LABFs) and compensation filters can be designed separately using second- order cone programming (SOCP). Moreover, a new method to tackle the possible noise amplification problem in such large arrays by imposing additional norm constraints on the design of the compensation filters is proposed. The advantages of this decoupled approach are 1) the complicated design problem of large UCCAs can be decoupled into simpler problems of designing the LABFs and compensation filters, and 2) <b>directional</b> <b>elements,</b> which are frequently encountered, can be treated readily under the proposed framework.
