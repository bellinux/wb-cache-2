Full first-order decompositions constitute a large class of <b>database</b> constraints that can provide assistance to the <b>database</b> designer in identifying a suitable <b>database</b> schema. We establish a finite axiomatisation of full first-order decompositions that reflects best <b>database</b> design practice: an inference engine derives all potential candidates of a <b>database</b> schema, but the final choice remains with the <b>database</b> designer...|$|R

Each sequence is given a stable and unique identifier (UPI), making it possible to identify the same protein from different source <b>databases.</b> UniParc contains only protein sequences, with no annotation. Database cross-references in UniParc entries allow further information about the protein to be retrieved from the source <b>databases.</b> When sequences in the source <b>databases</b> change, these changes are tracked by UniParc and history of all changes is archived.|$|E
