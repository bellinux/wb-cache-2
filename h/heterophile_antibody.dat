40|$|Markedly {{elevated}} levels of serum IL- 4 were reported previously in 50 % {{of a small group}} of type 1 diabetes nonprogessors.

Interestingly, relatives without type 1 diabetes were significantly more likely to have this phenotype than were patients with the disease (P = 0. 003). In addition, the trait appears to have clustered within certain families and was associated with the protective MHC allele DQB 1 * 0602 (P = 0. 008).

40|$|Abstract. Human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (hCG), a heterodimeric hormone {{consisting of}} an alpha (a) and a beta (β) subunit, {{is used as}} a marker for the diagnosis of pregnancy, congenital defects, and choriocarcinoma. After excluding the common causes of elevated serum hCG, laboratory identification of false-positive or true results assists in guiding clinical management. Options include testing urine for hCG, serum for <b>heterophile</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and serum hCG by different immunoassays. We report the case of a non-pregnant patient with chronic renal failure who had a positive urine hCG test, an elevated serum hCG level by two different assays but normal by a third assay, and persistently elevated serum hCG levels after ruling out the likelihood of <b>heterophile</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The discrepancies were explained by the patient’s impaired renal clearance and the molecular forms of hCG that were measured by each assay.

50|$|In medical tests, {{including}} rapid diagnostic tests, cross-reactivity can {{be either}} confounding or helpful, depending on the instance. An example of confounding that yields a false positive error is in a latex fixation test when agglutination occurs with another antigen rather than the antigen of interest. An example of helpful cross-reactivity is in <b>heterophile</b> <b>antibody</b> tests, which detect Epstein-Barr virus using antibodies that grew for other antigens. Cross-reactivity is also a commonly evaluated parameter for the validation of immune and protein binding based assays such as ELISA and RIA. In this case it is normally quantified by comparing the assays response {{to a range of}} similar analytes and expressed as a percentage. In practice, calibration curves are produced using fixed concentration ranges for a selection of related compounds and the midpoints (IC50) of the calibration curves are calculated and compared. The figure then provides an estimate of the response of the assay to possible interfering compounds relative to the target analyte.|$|E
