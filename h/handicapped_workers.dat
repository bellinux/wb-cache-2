50|$|The Cleveland {{area was}} chosen as the sample for this survey {{due to the fact that}} it {{provided}} a booming industrial community that was majorly affected by two historical events. The first event was the early implementations of Workmen’s Compensation and Employer’s Liability Act. <b>Handicapped</b> <b>workers</b> during this time period often faced discrimination by employers that often feared that hiring handicapped laborers would increase their insurance rates and increase their own liability for providing workers compensation benefits. The next historical event was the early spread of Poliomyelitis or the Polio Virus, which in densely populated cities such as Cleveland was rapidly infecting numerous laborers children, thus creating adding to the number of handicapped individuals. Wounded Veterans returning from World War I also added to these newly classified handicapped individuals.

The marble used was thinner than previously attempted in cladding a building; this quickly {{proved to be a}} mistake. On December 25, 1973, during construction a 350-pound marble slab detached from the façade and penetrated the roof of the nearby Prudential Center. [...] In 1985, inspection found numerous cracks and bowing in the marble cladding of the building. To alleviate the problem, stainless steel straps were added to hold the marble in place. [...] Later, from 1990 to 1992, the entire building was refaced with Mount Airy white granite at an estimated cost of over $80 million. (Amoco was reluctant to divulge the actual amount, but it was well over half the original price of the building, without adjustment for inflation.) Two-thirds of the discarded marble was crushed and used as landscaping decoration at Amoco's refinery in Whiting, Indiana, one-sixth was donated to Governors State University, in University Park, Illinois, and one-sixth donated to Regalo, a division of Lashcon Inc. Under a grant from the Illinois Department of Rehabilitative Services, Regalo's 25 <b>handicapped</b> <b>workers</b> carved the discarded marble into a variety of specialty items such as corporate gifts and mementos including desk clocks and pen holders.

30|$|While major {{programme}} features have remained unchanged {{during the last}} decades, several details have been modified. In particular, previous variants of the scheme have been merged and other variants have been newly introduced over time (and merged again). In the following we describe major developments. We do not discuss an important, but quantitatively less prominent variant for disabled people. From 1998 to 2003, three major variants of hiring subsidies were in place. The first was characterized by {{a low level of}} targeting, compensating for special training requirements, while the second was aimed at unemployed persons with severe employment impediments (like long-term unemployment). A third variant could be granted to unemployed persons aged 50 and older. The Hartz III reform in 2004 merged these variants into one subsidy (that is still in place today and is described above) for people with placement difficulties. Employers can obtain such subsidies when hiring unemployed persons receiving UB I, UB II or without benefit receipt. Extensions can be granted for <b>handicapped</b> or older <b>workers.</b> During the years 2007 and 2008, four additional variants were introduced that targeted older and younger workers. In April 2012, however, three of them were abolished again (only one additional variant targeted at older workers remains).|$|R

This mission enables L’ETAPE to work with these companies to develop protocols of experiment and feedback in ecological situation with regards to their innovative solutions. For this purpose, L’ETAPE has created a collaborative platform on the model of the living labs enabling it to mobilize upon request its partners network (user associations, SSIAD, medico-social institutions, etc.) to bring their expertises in process innovation and evaluation collaborative in ecological situation of technical or technological solutions for autonomy. Since 2014, 3 projects are underway, including one project with a start-up incubated by the Montpellier BIC to evaluate at home a device of remote vigilance of people with cognitive disorders based on a network of non-intrusive sensors, and two projects with a group of companies, one on the design of a prototype of a universal remote control for healthcare beds, other on benchmarking at home of transfer and standing devices for bedridden.

40|$|L'étude subséquente a surtout pour but d'analyser le contenu des {{recommandations}} arbitrales de juin 1950 à juin 1952. Comme les conflits sur la sécurité syndicale sont difficilement compréhensibles sans une connaissance de l'arrière-plan historique des problèmes syndicaux, l'auteur résume les principaux événements expliquant l'importance que les unions attachent à la sécurité syndicale. Il porte ensuite son attention sur les clauses les plus controversées parmi les clauses non-monétaires. L'analyse des clauses monétaires est surtout faite par voie de comparaisons avec les clauses moyennes des conventions collectives; l'auteur souligne cependant les limitations inévitables de ces comparaisons. Union officials, {{employers and}} politicians are all vitally interested in arbitration {{because of the}} part it frequently plays in industrial conflicts. Most of them, no doubt, {{are familiar with the}} legal procedure. In order to have knowledge of the actual results of arbitration over a certain period of time, it is necessary to make factual studies of the contents of the Boards' reports. It would appear that such a study has a useful objective. It takes account of the changes which Boards of Arbitration propose in collective agreements. It draws the attention to the main problems which necessitate conciliation and arbitration. The attitude of the parties is explained and particularly the position of the decisive influence of the chairman of the Board, who is usually appointed by the Minister of Labour. Union leaders will find certain general results, while statesmen should be able to see better the real meaning of arbitration in actual cases and the limitations in its structure and operation. This undertaking is, however, limited in extent. The study of arbitration awards without also analyzing the collective agreements and their contents, cannot give a clear idea of labour-management relations in the province of Quebec, as it is only in cases where a collective agreement cannot be reached that arbitration is needed. This study is also limited because of lack of standards of comparison. No extensive study of the subject has been made in other provinces; the Department of Labour in Ontario does not even publish the reports. The result is rather unsatisfactory because of the difference in negotiations and arbitration; the only standard of comparison remains studies of collective agreements. Both grievances and the negotiation of collective agreements form the subjects of the disputes submitted to the Boards. Only six Boards have had to deal with grievances. The majority of the arbitrations have been rendered necessary because the parties have been unable to negotiate agreements. Non-monetary clause, with the exception of union security, seems to cause fewer conflicts. Wages take first place: 147 cases out of 156. Other matters related to wages also come up often: cost-of-living bonus, off-shift premiums, over-time. Paid vacations, statutory holidays, retroactivity and hours of work are dealt with in about half the cases brought to arbitration. The other subjects of controversy are welfare clauses, conditions of work, seniority and the duration of the agreement. In spite of these factors, however, it may be clearly seen, from this brief statistical analysis that the general tendency in the granting of union security clauses is different in Quebec from what it is in the country as a whole. Certain forms of union security such as the check-off, the closed shop, the union shop, the compulsory check-off and the Rand formula are obviously taboo for most Quebec Boards of Arbitration, that is for the Chairman and the employers representatives. In the historical context of industrial relations in the Province of Quebec, the importance of the attention given to union security is easy to understand. Union security is not, of course, the only means of integrating unionism in society; when unionism is accepted and becomes an institution, it will no longer pay attention to union security. In the period of union growth, union security takes on real importance, particularly if it meets with powerful opposition. This is the situation in Quebec where employer opposition finds allies in government policy and the weakness of working-class solidarity. The existence of certain industries where conditions are really below average and where the high cost of living is a serious <b>handicap</b> to the <b>workers,</b> may be clearly seen from the data presented. There is quite a spread between the conditions of work and the wages in these industries and in industry in general. A careful analysis of the causes of this under-productivity would make possible the finding and applying of solutions. A slight but firm increase of union pressure, by improving organization and inter-union cooperation, might perhaps force these industries to increase their productivity. Generally, arbitration in the province of Quebec does not permit the unions to secure better conditions than those prevailing in manufacturing in general. It only makes possible adjustments to the general conditions in the industry concerned or in industry as a whole. However, some arbitrations in big firms can make a step forward for all industry. The main question can now be considered: what is the principal object of arbitration? Is it to prevent all conflicts in industry at any cost, or is it to make possible proper improvements in the workers' conditions by submitting the questions involved to an impartial tribunal? In its constitution and its results, it would seem that arbitration has been set up to avoid strikes, even at the expenses of union weakness. Even if arbitration did not become an instrument of social justice, as the workers desire, it could play the part of a buffer which the law gives it and still keep the confidence of the workers if every trace of politics was kept away from it. However, a number of recommendations have recognized the justice of the workers' claims and have proposed improvements which have served as a basis for post-arbitration negotiations. If the Boards were more soundly constituted and gave their decisions more promptly, they could make a better contribution to labour relations in Quebec...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} {{problems}} involved in maintaining safety for {{different kinds of}} <b>handicapped</b> <b>workers.</b> One {{of the biggest problems}} is how these persons can commute to their workplace safely. One possible solution to this problem is using a teleworking system. This system is also good for saving money and the environment because it does not require commuting. The teleworking system has many other merits including enhanced safety and can be applied to many other aspects of life. For example, it can be used for the care of solitary elderly persons, watching small children in a two-income family, and working or providing medical treatment in remote and underpopulated areas. However, these applications are not yet common, and few reports have dealt with such merits. The case studies of disabled workers using teleworking reported here demonstrate the safety, financial and environmental benefits of teleworking. Key words...|$|E

Less positive attitudes were expressed toward hiring the learning dis-abled. Only one-half of the employers stated that they would hire workers with learn-ing disabilities. These negative attitudes {{did not seem to be}} related to lack of knowledge about learning disabilities, but rather seemed to relate to prejudice against workers with learning disabilities or lack of experience in supervising such workers. Employer attitudes have been de-termined for the handicapped as a group (Mithaug, 1979) and for var-ious types of severely handicapped persons (Fugua, Rathbun, & Gade, 1984; Hill & Wehman, 1979). How-ever, there has been little attention directed to the mildly handicapped, specifically learning disabled (LD) workers.

As such, the research proposes a method for evaluating the {{employment opportunities}} for handicapped people when working on woodworking machines and this has become the main contribution of the thesis. The originality of the method consists in creating a questionnaire focused on the activity under examination which has been chronologically broken into individual sub‑operations for which we have determined the degree of mastery and load rate for each worker. In case of failing to carry out a sub‑operation, we have proposed possible measures to remove the barrier to enable the person to carry out the operation.

40|$|Excerpt] On May 25, 2007, the President {{signed into}} law changes {{in the minimum wage}} under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) : P. L. 110 - 28. Although the wage issue may now have been {{momentary}} settled, the act includes other provisions that have been subject to legislation through the years and may again become the focus of legislative consideration. Examples include the following issues. * A youth sub-minimum wage, instituted in 1996, {{was not included in the}} 2007 amendments, and is $ 4. 25 per hour. * The cash wage employers of ‘tipped employees’ must pay, last updated in 1996, is $ 2. 13 per hour. * In 1989, the ‘small business exemption’ was restructured to exempt from minimum wage requirements qualifying firms with an income of under $ 500, 000; but, as administered, exemptions have only been available for employees not involved in interstate commerce. * In 2001, the Clinton Administration proposed restructuring of the ‘companionship exemption’ under the FLSA; in 2002, the measure was withdrawn. The issue has recently been the subject of a Supreme Court ruling (2007) and of proposed legislation (H. R. 3582 and S. 2061). * Through nearly a century, some economists (and, later, some Members of Congress) have proposed, in various formats, indexation of the federal minimum wage — an issue that still sometimes arises. * In 1986, Section 14 (c) of the act was amended to remove any specific minimum wage floor for <b>handicapped</b> <b>workers,</b> replacing it with a negotiated wage ‘commensurate’ with the worker’s productivity. It has been contested through the years. * In 2003, a proposal was issued dealing with overtime pay for persons classified as ‘executive, administrative, or professional’ employees under Section 13 (a) (1) of the act. At that time, the issue was extremely contentious. How has it worked out in practice? * Industry has threatened to leave American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands were the full FLSA to be made applicable there, as it would be under P. L. 110 - 28. What will be the impact upon those islands? * Increasingly, the states (now 34 in number) have moved to provide minimum wage rates higher than the federal rate. What implications can be expected, both in economic and political terms? This report will be updated as the need may arise...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} {{have identified a}} number of social behaviors considered important for job success. Important social skills for entry-level employees include following instructions, clarifying instructions, providing assistance, and providing job-related information to co-workers (Buehler, 1969; Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Mithaug, 1978; Rusch, Schutz, 2 ̆ 6 Agran, 1982; Salzberg, Agran, 2 ̆ 6 Lignugaris/Kraft, in press). Researchers have also recognized that these behaviors must be examined in the context in which they occur in the workplace (Berkson 2 ̆ 6 Romer, 1980; Brody 2 ̆ 6 Stoneman, 1977). The context of a social interaction might be described in terms of the job setting in which the interaction occurs (e. g., restaurant, production line), the general activity within which the interaction occurs (e. g., during lunch, break, or during work), the number and kinds of people participating in the interaction, and its length. Hersen, Eisler, and Miller (1974), referring to the limited generalization effects found in the assertiveness literature, suggested that adequate social performance requires response skills as well as knowledge about the context in which these responses are appropriate. That is, appropriate social interactions are those that conform to social norms and conventions that are dependent on context (Morrison 2 ̆ 6 Bellack, 1981). Work trainers and vocational counselors could use information about the context of social interactions in the workplace when designing social skills training programs. Information that would be of interest includes (a) how much social interaction occurs during breaks and work, (b) how much social interaction occurs in pairs compared to larger groups, and (c) what are the durations of social interactions during breaks and work. The purpose of this research was to examine social interactions and their social context during work and breaks in sheltered and nonsheltered work settings. A few studies have addressed social interactions either during breaks or during work (Berkson 2 ̆ 6 Romer, 1980; Levy 2 ̆ 6 Gloscoe, 1984; Lignugaris/Kraft, Rule, Salzberg, 2 ̆ 6 Stowitschek, 1986). Berkson and his colleagues observed social interaction patterns of developmentally disabled workers exclusively during lunch and breaks in four sheltered workshops. The workers observed interacted with co-workers most of the time. Their interactions were largely in pairs and occurred with a number of different co-workers. In addition, the types and amounts of social interaction among employees were stable across sheltered work settings during lunch and break times. In another study, Levy and Gloscoe (1984) observed <b>handicapped</b> <b>workers</b> in two sheltered workshops and nonhandicapped workers in a large factory exclusively during work times. High rates of conversation were recorded for both groups while workers performed assembly tasks or worked on production lines. Social interaction patterns during both breaks and work were not examined in either of these studies. Thus, there is limited knowledge of how the social interaction patterns during break and work times might be similar or different. Further, it is not currently known if similar amounts and types of social interaction occur in sheltered and nonsheltered work settings. An optimal data base to prepare developmentally disabled individuals for work should include information about social interactions in work situations with nonhandicapped as well as handicapped individuals (Levy 2 ̆ 6 Gloscoe, 1984; Lingnugaris/Kraft et al., 1986; Rusch, 1979; Schutz 2 ̆ 6 Rusch, 1982). In this study we examined social interactions during breaks and work in sheltered and nonsheltered work settings. In the first study, social interactions of developmentally disabled workers were examined during breaks and work in two sheltered workshops. In the second study, the social interactions of both handicapped and nonhandicapped employees were studied in the same nonsheltered work setting...|$|E
