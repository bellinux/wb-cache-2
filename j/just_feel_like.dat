In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just {{a lot of things going}} on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> he lost touch with his demographic."

500|$|Connor’s {{characterization}} {{and main}} storyline {{with his father}} in season three and four received mixed reviews. Ben from thescifichristian.com was not fond of the initial episodes with baby Connor because Angel wasted time “baby-talking,” but he loved the development with teenage Connor, “The [...] season ends with a great storyline as Connor returns [...] and betrays Angel.” Jes Battis praised the father/son dynamics and described as “highly dramatic and (engagingly perverse)”. Journalist Sarah D. Bunting called Connor [...] "a frustrating character" [...] and wrote that while she [...] "gets where he is coming from" [...] and his ”twitchy, PTSD-ish interactions ring true", they become old too quick {{due to lack of}} real development of character and the relationship with Angel for most of season four. Kartheiser himself expressed this development concern, but he said that [...] "Towards {{the end of the season}} I was really happy about the chances I was getting." [...] This last statement is echoed in Jamie Pool's review, who called the “ending” to Connor [...] "emotionally satisfying", despite noting him to not have been particularly endearing through most of the remaining season. S.Wiebe of eclipsemagazine.com, described Connor’s overall characterization [...] "sharp" [...] with [...] "really intriguing sub-textual material" [...] and among the saving graces of the season. Strega of Television Without Pity, also praised the character's psychology, [...] "The thing I like most is that they've not only created a teenager who doesn't <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> he's the most alienated person in the world -- he actually is," [...] and [...] "I love how unloved Connor [...] is…” Jean Lorrah described the Darla-Angel-Connor-Jasmine arc as [...] "surely one of the most ambitious story arcs any television show has ever attempted“ Stacey Abbott of PopMatters called the Darla-Angel-Connor storyline [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "pure family melodrama".

5000|$|Michael Hann of The Guardian {{felt that}} the album was {{compressed}} with its songs' production lacking energy, concluding that [...] "they're not actually noisy per se, merely uninterested in restraint, which is a rather different thing."

[...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D.

We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire.

[...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing.
