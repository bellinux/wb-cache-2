By means of both qualitative and quantitative characterisation, a simulation of the beneficiation process applied to these iron ores is performed.

Various methods have been used to remove organic contaminants from soil, such as: biological, thermal, chemical and physical. Methods based on Mineral Processing principles have also been used (cyclone separation, <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separation,</b> attritioning and washing). This paper studies the possibility to remove a rich-in-contaminant soil fraction by applying flotation. The contaminated soil was artificially prepared by mixing soil with diesel fuel. Sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and a tertiary amine (TA) were used as collectors. The effect of collector quantity added and conditioning time was studied.

40|$|Les argiles d'un sable de gisement, concentrées dans la {{fraction}} de diamètre Phi Oil, gas and geothermal reservoirs all contain clayey fractions {{no matter}} how small they may be. This has been blamed whenever operating or producing problems arise. It may be revealed by phenomena of mechanical resistance, permeability or interfacial properties (ion exchange, adsorption, etc.). Tests to understand such phenomena then go via the quantitative mineralogical analysis of the clays present. This analysis must also be looked at in terms of methods. It is subjected to constraints of cost, instrumentation, competence or deadlines. This article proposes:(a) A so-called conventional route (Dejou et al, 1977) based on chemical and weighted analyses. (b) An overall assessment method of the clay phase by difference (determination of two nonclay species). (c) A method based on the statistical processing of microanalytic data obtained by an electronic microprobe. The material examined was a quartzose arenite made up mainly of quartz, jarosite, orthoclase, plagioclases, calcite, dolomite, muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, interstratified illite-montmorillionite, iron oxyhydroxides and accessory minerals such as rutile, zircon, garnet, tourmaline and hydroxylapatite. The arenite was subjected to an ultrasonic treatment (Letelier, 1986) to recover pellicular or weakly cemented clays. After this treatment, all the free clays were found in the < 40 m fraction which were used for the measurements. The so-called conventionalmethod is based on the associating of multiple techniques that are normally used for analyzing clays. They include X-ray diffraction, TDA, TGA, selective dissolution, CEC, adsorption of various reagents and <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separations.</b> They have been reviewed by Dejou et al (1977). The results they give depend on the grain size, chrystallochemistry, presence of amorphous elements and especially the typical chemical compositions assigned to the minerals present. The clay content of arenite obtained by this method was 2. 53 %. A second method consisted in determining the overall proportion of clays by deducing the quartz and jarosite contents, which alone can be quantitatively retained. Jarosite was determined from the sulfur content. Quartz was determined by X rays according to the generalized addition method of Alegre and Debray (1966), which consists in measuring the intensities of the phase to be determined and the same pure phase. The clay content of arenite thus obtained was 2. 08 %. The third method was based on the statistical processing of microprobe data. Mineralogical and principal-components analyses were used to define the actual mineralogical phases or the ones assumed to exist. Calculating was based on the electroneutrality of the minerals and of the completion of the material balances. The associating of statistical analysis (CPA) with the calculation of standards then enables these phases to be determined from microanalytic data. The clay content of arenite found here was 2. 04 %. Thus the results obtained by conventional methods were greatly overestimated. The errors were due mainly to the approximations made for the crystallochemical data of clays. These data make use of the statistical processing of analysis performed by the microprobe and have the advantage of quantifying the relative proportions of each of the clay phases. Lastly, the method of determining by difference, because of speed and simplicity of implementation, lends itself very well to analyzing series of samples...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Establish {{and compare}} {{the content of the}} total lipids in the liver, {{skeletal}} muscle, gill and brain pond carp active life condition and under artificial hibernation carbon. Methodology. The experiments were conducted on the Ukrainian scaly carp breed (Cyprinus caprio L.) weighing 250 – 270 g. To conduct research to form two groups (control — 5 copies of the fish and an experimental — each point hypobiosis exposure to 5 copies of the fish). Introduction of fish hypobiotically state conducted for the use of a patented model artificial hibernation.

40|$|Numerous {{sites in}} the United States {{and around the world}} are {{contaminated}} with depleted uranium (DU) in various forms. A prevalent form is fragmented DU originating from various scientific tests involving high explosives and DU during weapon-development programs, at firing practice ranges, or in war theaters where DU was used in armor-piercing projectiles. The contamination at these sites is typically very heterogeneous, with discrete, visually identifiable DU fragments mixed with native soil. The bulk-averaged DU activity is quite low, whereas DU fragments, which are distinct from the soil matrix, have much higher specific activity. DU is best known as a dark metal that is nearly twice as dense as lead, but DU in the environment readily weathers (oxidizes) to a distinctive bright yellow color that is quite visible. While the specific activity (amount of radioactivity per mass of soil) of DU is relatively low and presents only a minor radiological hazard, the fact that DU is radioactive and visually identifiable makes it desirable to remove the DU ''contamination'' from the environment. The typical approach to conducting this DU remediation is to use radiation-detection instruments to identify the contaminant and then to separate it from the adjacent soil, packaging it for disposal as radioactive waste. This process can be performed manually or by specialized, automated equipment. Alternatively, a more cost-effective approach might be simple mechanical or <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separation</b> of the DU fragments from the host soil matrix.

Within this dissertation research, multi-functional composites were synthesized based on organic and inorganic materials. The functionally of these composites was experimentally tested and a semi-empirical model describing the sedimentation behavior of these particles was developed. This first objective involved the fabrication of microcomposites consisting of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles confined within porous, microgels of a thermo-responsive polymer {{for use in the}} photocatalytic treatment of wastewater. TiO 2 {{has been shown to be}} an excellent photocatalyst with potential applications in advanced oxidative processes such as wastewater remediation. Upon UV irradiation, short-lived electron-hole pairs are generated, which produce oxidative species that degrade simple organic contaminants. The rapid sedimentation of these microcomposites provided an easy <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separation</b> after remediation. Methyl orange was used as a model organic contaminant to investigate the kinetics of photodegradation under a range of concentrations and pH conditions. Although after prolonged periods of UV irradiation (~ 8 - 13 hrs), the titania-microgels also degrade, regeneration of the microcomposites was straightforward via the addition of polymer microgels with no loss in photocatalytic activity of the reformed microcomposites. The second objective within this dissertation involved the systematic development of abrasive microcomposite particles containing well dispersed nanoparticles of ceria in an organic/inorganic hybrid polymeric particle for use in chemical mechanical polishing/planarization (CMP). A challenge in IC fabrication involves the defect-free planarization of silicon oxide films for successful multi-layer deposition. Planarization studies conducted with the microcomposites prepared in this research, yield very smooth, planar surfaces with removal rates that rival those of inorganic oxides slurries typically used in industry.

40|$|International audienceThe Pontgibaud lead-silver mining district, {{which was}} one of the largest in Europe, has been mined {{extensively}} since ancient times but especially during the second half of 19 th century, in three mines that were legally abandoned in 1939. The mines were located on quartz veins mineralized in silver-bearing galena and hosted by gneissic rocks (They produced 50, 000 tons of lead metal and 100 tons of silver). Almost 60 open accesses, hazardous shafts and galleries remain a century after the mines were closed. These sites were inventoried in 2005 as part of post-mining activity so that suitable safety measures that would not harm protected fauna could be proposed. In addition, four ore beneficiation plants were associated with these sites and fed the large Pontgibaud foundry with 90 % lead enriched concentrates. Tailings were also produced by the beneficiation plants. These beneficiation plants also generated as much tailings disposals through the following operations: milling-grinding, washing, <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separation</b> and decantation of fines. The total volume was about 300, 000 m 3. Tailings disposals impact the surface water owing to high concentrations of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc. Absence of organic substances, high slopes of disposals and residual contaminants hampered vegetation from re-growing for more than a century. Now the deposits are highly eroded from run-off, gully erosion and wind. This greatly impacts waterways (the Sioule River) and surrounding land. All these sites are located in Auvergne, a very touristic region with a remarkable faunistic interest. As a consequence, an environmental impact assessment had to be performed in order to integrate recommendations into the site safety engineering rehabilitation program. The work consisted essentially in backfilling 20 unsafe shafts and closing the entry of almost 40 remaining adits or crosscuts with concrete plugs allowing bats to pass. Regarding tailings disposals, safety work was designed to limit the impact on water and soil with:- Tailings heaps reshaping;- Grass-seeded earth covering in view of stabilizing the new facility while respecting the local landscape; - managing surface water with a peripheral drain to limit transport during heavy rains. The first disposal site has been rehabilitated in 2014; remodeling work on the other sites has been planned for 2015 - 2016.

Sasol plants gasify {{more than}} 30 million {{tons per annum}} of coal via the Fischer- Tropsch process {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} synthesis gas and a condensate stream. After <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separation</b> of the tar products, the solvent extraction of phenolics and the steam stripping of ammonia from the condensate stream, a complex effluent referred to as stripped gas liquor (SGL) is generated. SGL {{has the potential to be}} used as process cooling water. Micro-organisms, scale deposit and corrosion are three major problems associated with the operation of cooling water systems. Parameters that have an influence on the fouling, scaling and corrosion of industrial cooling towers include cycles of concentration (COC), flow velocity (FV) and pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water. Stripped gas liquor contains hydrocarbons which can interfere with PLFA analysis. There was, therefore, a need to optimise the selective extraction of hydrocarbons so as to eliminate their interference with PLFA analysis. The method used for the extraction of hydrocarbons before silicic acid fractionation succeeded in removing the hydrocarbons and their interference and was, therefore, determined to be appropriate method to use in subsequent analyses. Even though the two lab-scale cooling towers were of identical design their similarity or dissimilarity needed investigation. Physico-chemical analysis results confirmed that the two cooling towers were operated under identical operational conditions. The two cooling towers were found to be similar in terms of the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates as well as microbial community structure. The two cooling towers could be operated in parallel using different operational conditions with any differences in results being a reflection of the effects of operational conditions. The effects of pH, FV and COC on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as microbial community dynamics were evaluated with the aid of a 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design. Cycles of concentration was found to have the most profound effect on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates followed by pH. Cycles of concentration and pH were found to have the most profound effect on microbial community dynamics. The use of the 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design also allowed the determination of optimal conditions for the operation of,the cooling towers using SGE as feed water. These conditions were found to be 5 COC, a pH of 7. 5 and a FV of 0. 6 m/s. In conclusion, the use of a 2 ³ factorial experimental design, physico-chemical, PLFA and DGGE analyses were instrumental in the successful determination of the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in the cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water.

40|$|Oil-in-water {{emulsions}} are {{an important}} basis of many pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and food products such as mayonnaise, dressings, coffee creamers, chocolate, infant formulae, parenteral emulsions and enteral medical beverages. The effects of protein adsorption, addition of other food components (i. e. polysaccharides, carbohydrates and minerals), processing conditions (i. e. high pressure, heat and shear) and environmental conditions (i. e. pH, ionic strength and solvent quality) on the physicochemical properties of protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions (i. e. heat stability, creaming stability, viscosity and flow behavior) have been covered in past studies. In addition, there is increasing information on the heat stability and the viscosity of emulsions containing high concentrations of protein. However, there is very limited understanding of the inter-particle interactions in high solids emulsion systems containing high amounts of protein, oil or carbohydrate. A lack of studies that have investigated the types of interfacial proteins and non-adsorbed proteins, the aggregation state of the proteins, the particle size distributions of protein particles and oil droplets {{and the presence of}} a third component, especially under high temperature heating (i. e. 120 - 140 °C) conditions, has limited the understanding of how processing and ingredients influence the properties of proteins and, in turn, the physical stability and the rheological properties of protein-stabilized emulsions. To address this issue, the research described here was aimed at determining the importance of the mechanisms of instability, such as depletion flocculation, bridging flocculation, aggregation, creaming and coalescence, in high solids emulsion systems and at understanding the colloidal forces that drive specific material/rheological properties and the storage stability of complex high solids systems. Five main techniques were used to characterize the structure-material properties of protein-stabilized emulsions: light scattering particle sizing, Turbiscan, rheology, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and confocal microscopy. The behaviors of interfacial proteins, non-adsorbed proteins and protein-coated oil droplets before and after heat treatment, {{in the presence of a}} third food ingredient (polysaccharides or sugars) and with pre-homogenization protein preheat treatment were investigated. As a prelude to addressing the mechanisms of instability of emulsions containing high concentrations of protein, before and after heat treatment (120 °C for 10 min), a stability map approach was developed. The model emulsions were successfully categorized into four model systems based on droplet-protein, protein-protein and droplet-droplet interactions with respect to the roles of the types of adsorbed and non-adsorbed proteins. Emulsions stabilized by whey proteins or containing high whey protein concentrations were shown to be highly sensitive to calcium content and heat treatment. Non-adsorbed whey proteins were involved not only in the heat-induced destabilization of whey-protein-stabilized emulsions but also when the interfacial layer was replaced by sodium caseinate (NaCas). In this case, NaCas-stabilized droplets were incorporated in the gel network, probably through heat-exchanged interfacial interaction. Gels were formed after heat treatment when NaCas was added to whey protein emulsions; this gel formation was dependent on the casein to whey protein ratio. Replacement of the continuous phase intact whey proteins with hydrolyzed whey proteins improved the heat stability of the emulsions. With one notable exception, surface-active fractions from hydrolyzed whey proteins were seen to promote droplet coalescence in Tween- 20 -stabilized emulsions at high heating temperatures. Model emulsions containing relatively high concentrations of micellar or non-micellar caseins were found to be heat stable. However, rapid enhanced creaming, which was associated with the depletion flocculation, occurred in these emulsions. The non-adsorbed protein concentration, the aggregation state and the polydispersity of the protein determined the extent of depletion flocculation. Other studies on the effect of the depletion interaction potential and the continuous phase viscosity on the creaming stability of weakly flocculated NaCas-stabilized emulsions showed that an increase in the non-adsorbed protein concentration promoted a stronger depletion interaction potential, which could change emulsion destabilization to restabilization because of the formation of a space-filling droplet network. At higher NaCas concentrations (= 6 % w/w), there was a significant delay in the formation of the space-filling droplet network, which was attributed to the particularly small diffusive motion of flocculated droplet clusters and their inability to redisperse under a strong depletion interaction potential. Although the addition of maltodextrin or xanthan gum influenced the creaming behavior, neither additive could be considered to be an inert thickening agent. The reduced network formation caused by the addition of maltodextrin was not an effect of viscosity, but rather a breakdown of the caseinate nano-particles that induced the formation of the network. Once the maltodextrin concentration exceeded 15 % w/w, the droplets were entirely non-interacting and would presumably cream at a rate predicted by modified Stokes’ law for concentrated emulsion (Ø > 0. 2) (Tadros, 2004). Adding xanthan gum to the NaCas-stabilized emulsions resulted in local domains that were rich in either xanthan gum or NaCas and emulsion. The effect of these local domains was that the droplets experienced a stronger depletion interaction potential and the high viscosity of the combined xanthan gum and emulsion phases resulted in uniform phase separation across the emulsion rather than <b>gravimetric</b> <b>separation.</b> Depending on the heating duration, heat treatment (120 °C) of NaCas-stabilized emulsions (2 - 8 % w/w, protein) resulted in a weakened depletion interaction potential and a more rapid formation of the space-filling droplet network. Heat treatment of NaCas-stabilized oil droplets had relatively limited influence on the phase separation kinetics. Heat-induced degradation of non-adsorbed NaCas molecules was the dominant factor determining the creaming stability of NaCas-stabilized emulsions. The particle size, viscosity and molecular weight of continuous phase NaCas decreased as the heating time increased. A deviation of the size of the NaCas nano-particles from the optimum value (~ 20 nm in diameter) resulted in changes in the strength of the depletion interaction potential and the range of attraction. A decrease in the continuous phase viscosity also contributed to rapid formation of the droplet network at higher NaCas concentrations (> 6 % w/w). The droplet break-up and the heat stability of milk protein concentrate (MPC) -stabilized emulsions were determined to understand the impact of carbohydrate type and concentration during emulsification and subsequent heat treatment. The addition of different carbohydrates (up to 30 % w/w) slightly increased the droplet diameter to similar extents. However, the addition of 30 % w/w maltodextrin significantly decreased the droplet diameter, which was attributed to the marked decrease in the dispersed/continuous phase viscosity ratio. Generally, added carbohydrates reduced the heat stability maximum in heat coagulation time-pH profiles of MPC-stabilized emulsions. The pH at the heat stability maximum was shifted towards more acidic values by an increased concentration of glucose, maltose, sucrose or trehalose but towards more alkaline values by an increased concentration of maltodextrin. The extent of destabilization also varied between carbohydrates, with trehalose being particularly effective in retaining the original heat stability of the MPC-stabilized emulsion. Reducing carbohydrates (glucose, maltose and maltodextrin) decreased the heat stability maximum more considerably than non-reducing carbohydrates (sucrose and trehalose). Studies on the effect of pre-homogenization heat treatment on the physicochemical, microstructural and rheological properties of protein-stabilized emulsions showed that preheating the MPC and the whey protein concentrate denatured the whey proteins, leading to a reduction in subsequent heat-induced interactions between adsorbed proteins, between non-adsorbed proteins and between adsorbed and non-adsorbed proteins. This was attributed to fewer reactive groups being available for secondary heat-induced interactions after pre-homogenization heating. Extensive heat-induced aggregation during post-homogenization heat treatment resulted in delayed creaming because of the high viscosity at low shear rates. The presence of non-micellar caseins, the homogenization pressure and the order of heat treatment of the proteins were shown to significantly influence the physical stability and the rheological properties of protein-stabilized emulsions. Overall, the results of this research have advanced our understanding of how the protein concentration, the aggregation state of caseins, the heat-induced physicochemical changes of proteins and the attractive force impact on the physical stability, rheological properties and microstructures of model protein-stabilized emulsions. This information may have important implications for developing tailor-made milk protein ingredients that allow controlled functionalities in the processing and storage of dairy emulsions and for making strategic plans to control/manipulate the properties of high solids colloid systems...|$|E
