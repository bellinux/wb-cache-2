Objectives: To analyze the proportional increase of each treatment method, Hemodialysis (HD), Peritoneal Dialysis (DP) and Functional Renal Transplantation, {{and to establish}} the relationship among them and with the nephrologists rate pmp. Methods: Prevalence increase percentages were determined in each country and regions divided according to: a) the SLANH (geographical criteria); b) Global Burden of Disease study (GBD-WHO) (<b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria).</b> Results: Percentage growth rate showed wide variability among the three methods, DP being the larger.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} the methodology {{used in the}} process of setting health priorities for community intervention in a community of older adults. METHODS Based on the results of a health diagnosis related to active aging, a prioritization process was conceived to select the priority intervention problem. The process comprised four successive phases of problem analysis and classification: (1) grouping by level of similarity, (2) classification according to <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria,</b> (3) ordering by experts, and (4) application of the Hanlon method. These stages combined, in an integrated manner, the views of health team professionals, community nursing and gerontology experts, and the actual community. RESULTS The first stage grouped the identified problems by level of similarity, comprising a body of 19 issues for analysis. In the second stage these problems were classified by the health team members by <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria</b> (size, vulnerability, and transcendence). The nine most relevant problems resulting from the second stage of the process were submitted to expert analysis and the five most pertinent problems were selected. The last step identified the priority issue for intervention in this specific community with the participation of formal and informal community leaders: Low Social Interaction in Community Participation. CONCLUSIONS The prioritization process is a key step in health planning, enabling the identification of priority problems to intervene in a given community at a given time. There are no default formulas for selecting priority issues. It is up to each community intervention team to define its own process with different methods/techniques that allow the identification of and intervention in needs classified as priority by the community...|$|R

40|$|Where direct {{experimental}} research into a causal hypothesis {{of a disease}} is impossible due to ethical and practical considerations, epidemiological inference is the accepted route to establishing cause. Therefore, to examine the autism as mercury poisoning hypothesis, this paper reviews the existing scientific literature {{within the context of}} established <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria</b> and finds that the evidence for a causal relationship is compelling. Exposure to mercury (via vaccines and maternal dental amalgam) in utero and during infant years is confirmed; mercury poisoning is known to cause symptoms consistent with autism; animal modeling supports the link and, critically, mercury levels are higher in both the urine and blood of autistic children than in non-autistic peers. Analogous to epidemiological evidence of the smoking–lung cancer relationship, a mercury–autism relationship is confirmed. The precautionary principle demands that health professionals not take an action if there is suspicion that the action may cause severe or lifelong health effects: it does not require certainty. Therefore, given the severity, devastating lifelong impact and extremely high prevalence of autism, it would be negligent to continue to expose pregnant and nursing mothers and infant children to any amount of avoidable mercury...|$|R

However, we have noted that information on 3 generations (nuclear families with a pointer to the sibship) is of major importance for detecting major gene(s). Besides, the discrepancy in the results obtained in separate analyses of the family subsamples defined by the place of residence of the probands is discussed in terms of possible genetic and/or environmental differences. Referring to experimental data and previous studies, we suggest that the gene for susceptibility to leprosy per se and that for susceptibility to nonlepromatous leprosy might be different, acting at successive stages of the immune response to infection with Mycobacterium leprae...|$|R
