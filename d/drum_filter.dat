The implementation of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) amendments of 1990 have affected every source of air pollution in the U. S. including cotton gins. The goal of this project was to develop guidelines, that will help cotton ginners comply with FCAA amendments at reasonable cost. Several alternate abatement strategies were proposed for removing particulate from cotton gin exhausts. Emission factors from these abatement strategies were estimated. The cost of investing in these strategies was estimated. The reduction in emissions, achieved by installing a better abatement strategy were calculated. The costs per tonne of reduction in emissions when changing from one abatement strategy to a more efficient strategy were estimated. Gins with a ginning capacity from less than 10 bales per hour to greater than 35 bales per hour were analyzed. These figures help in defining the "economic reasonableness" of investing in a particular strategy. The performance of rotary <b>drum</b> <b>filters</b> was evaluated using a small scale model at different inlet loadings of fine dust only and fine dust and trash combinations. Their performance was compared with cyclones and preseparator cyclone systems.

5000|$|The {{rotary vacuum}} <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> designs {{available}} vary in physical aspects and their characteristics. The filtration area ranges from 0.5 m2 to 125 m2. Disregarding {{the size of}} the design, filter cloth washing is a priority as it ensures efficiency of cake washing and acting vacuum. However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger rotary vacuum drum filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around rotary vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller rotary drum vacuum filters, ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that precoat can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of precoat more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the rotary vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the process. Methods have been performed to ensure a minimal amount of cake moisture while undergoing good cake washing with large cake dewatering angle. An even thickness of filter cake besides having a complete cake discharge is also possible. 611 ...|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{the main}} {{process in a}} rotary vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> is {{continuous}} filtration whereby solids are separated from liquids through a filter medium by a vacuum. The filter cloth {{is one of the}} most important components on a filter and is typically made of weaving polymer yarns. The best selection of cloth can increase the performance of filtration. Initially, slurry is pumped into the trough and as the drum rotates, it is partially submerged in the slurry. The vacuum draws liquid and air through the filter media and out the shaft hence forming a layer of cake. An agitator is used to regulate the slurry if the texture is coarse and it is settling rapidly. Solids that are trapped on the surface of the drum are washed and dried after 2/3 of revolution, removing all the free moisture 6.|$|E

50|$|Rotary vacuum <b>filter</b> <b>drum</b> {{consists}} of a drum rotating in a tub of liquid to be filtered.|$|R
50|$|During {{the washing}} stage, the wash liquid {{can either be}} poured onto the drum or sprayed on the cake. Cake {{pressing}} is optional but its advantages are preventing cake cracking and removing more moisture. Cake discharge is when all the solids are removed {{from the surface of}} the cake by a scraper blade, leaving a clean surface as drum re-enters the slurry 6. There are a few types of discharge which are scraper, roller, string, endless belt and pre coat.5 The filtrate and air flow through internal pipes, valve and into the vacuum receiver where the separation of liquid and gas occurs producing a clear filtrate 7. Pre coat filtration is an ideal method to produce a high clarity of filtrate. Basically, the drum surface is pre coated with a filter aid such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or perlite to improve filtration and increase cake permeability. It then undergoes the same process cycle as the conventional rotary vacuum <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> however, pre coat filtration uses a higher precision blade to scrape off the cake 6.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to treating the liquid waste excreted by fish {{the solid waste}} must also be treated, this is done by concentrating and flushing the solids out of the system. Removing solids reduces bacteria growth, oxygen demand, {{and the proliferation of}} disease. The simplest method for removing solids is the creation of settling basin where the relative velocity of the water is slow and particles can settle {{at the bottom of the}} tank where they are either flushed out or vacuumed out manually using a siphon. However, this method is not viable for RAS operations where a small footprint is desired. Typical RAS solids removal involves a sand filter or particle filter where solids become lodged and can be periodically backflushed out of the filter. Another common method is the use of a mechanical <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> where water is run over a rotating drum screen that is periodically cleaned by pressurized spray nozzles, and the resulting slurry is treated or sent down the drain. In order to remove extremely fine particles or colloidal solids a protein fractionator may be used with or without the addition of ozone (O3).|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} methods for measuring and describing particle size distribution from three different spots in Tilapia recirculating system at University of Life Ccience in Ås, Norway. For this purpose serial filtration over different mesh size and parallel filtration over different mesh size methods were compared. Water samples were taken from before <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> after <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> and after bio-filter (MBBR) and filtrated through eight different mesh size classes and calculated in mg suspended solids per liter (mgSS/l). Serial method is telling about suspended solids between two filter sizes, while parallel method tells about suspended solids bigger of a given filter size. Each filtering method was done three times in three different days. Results of serial filtration showed large difference in mgSS/l between days, especially between 0, 45 – 10 µm. Small particles (< 30 µm) are dominating in both methods. Water before <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> contains a lot of large particles which are reduced after treatment in the <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> First and third days of serial filtration were more effective for the total suspended solids (TSS) after <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> unlike the second day which showed no decrease of TSS after drum filter: 9, 71 mgSS/l before <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> and 10 mgSS/l after <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> In the first day TSS before <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> was 23, 58 mgSS/l and after <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> it was reduced to 8, 8 mgSS/l. In the third day experiment showed 27, 73 mgSS/l before <b>drum</b> <b>filter,</b> and 14, 37 mgSS/l after <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> Water after Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) resulted in increase of TSS {{in the first two}} days, whilst the third day showed reduction of TSS value. Parallel filtration method can be calculated as comparing samples, same as serial filtration method. This way of calculations of parallel filtration gave negative values for some of the particle size groups which bring into question the accuracy of the method. More further developing of methods are needed in order to get accurate results...|$|E

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1996 at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory Radioactive Waste Management Complex, an {{epidemic}} of corroded CH-TRU waste drums was encountered. The observed corrosion was {{in the form of}} rusty brown streaks that emanated from pinholes in about the upper one-third of the 55 gal drums. Wet streaks were tested as highly acidic by litmus paper. The liquid that emanated from the pinholes was found to be hydrochloric (HCl) acid. An investigation concluded that the pinholes were localized pitting corrosion caused by HCl acid formed in the drum headspace from reactions involving chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the waste and the unlined steel of the internal drum wall. The pinholes occurred in the upper parts of the drums because this corresponds to the internal headspace region above the rigid liner. Affected drums had a few to hundreds of pinholes with no detectable release of radioactivity. This was due to the internal packaging of waste in heavy polyethylene and/or polyvinyl chloride waste bags inside a rigid high-density polyethylene liner. The corrective action taken was to overpack pinhole corrosion drums into polyethylene-lined 83 -gal drums and to test hundreds of <b>drums</b> with <b>drum</b> <b>filters,</b> but without pinhole corrosion, for the presence of HCl acid in the headspace gas with colorimetric tubes fitted to the <b>drum</b> <b>filters.</b> These colorimetric tubes contain a substance that changes color in reaction to HCl acid when headspace gas is drawn by a hand pump. Only drums that had a significant probability for the presence of HCl acid in the headspace were segregated in storage to allow ready inspection and efficient handling, if needed. It is recommended that any facility involved in the long-term storage of waste or other contents, that include chlorinated VOCs in unlined steel containers, be wary for the possible development of pinhole corrosion...|$|R
40|$|Water {{quality in}} marine {{hatcheries}} {{is a critical}} aspect {{in the production of}} spat. Different filtering methods have been used to treat the intake seawater in the hatcheries. The Scalpro AS hatchery uses two different types of filters to treat seawater, an active filter media and <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} establish a better knowledge on the effect of different filtering methods on marine water quality in the production of great scallop (Pecten maximus). The two filters were compared in relation to chemical and microbial properties, microbial communities and microalgal cell numbers. Egg development to day 3 larvae was performed by using water from both treatments. A larval activity experiment was conducted by exposing 8 days old larvae to different water treatments and concentrations. There was no significant difference between treatments in dissolved oxygen (% and mg l- 1) while temperature at the skimmer after active filter media was significantly higher than other sampling points. Both treatments reduced the total, dissolved and particulate organic carbons concentrations from the intake water. The skimmer significantly reduced the total bacterial numbers from the <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> in March. In March, April and May, no Vibrios spp. was found in other sampling points except the <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> in March. The numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria in April were increased at the skimmer after active filter media from the intake water and reduced at the skimmer after <b>drum</b> <b>filter.</b> In May, both skimmers reduced the bacterial colonies from the intake water. Close similarities of microbial community were observed between the intake water and each treatment. From the denaturing gradient gels profiles it seemed that alpha proteobacteria dominated in March and gamma proteobacteria (opportunistic) dominated in April and May. Both treatments proved to be suitable for the egg development to larval stages. No significant differences were observed in larval activity between treatments in undiluted and 100 -fold diluted water. In May, significant highest larval activity was found in the 10 -fold diluted water from Bergen High Technology Centre and the lowest in the control (sterile seawater). From the microalgal growth experiment, the skimmer after <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> had the highest number of microalgal cells than the skimmer after active filter media and water from Bergen High Technology Centre.

40|$|AbstractSolids removal {{across two}} {{settling}} devices, i. e., a swirl separator and a radial-flow settler, and across a microscreen <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> was evaluated in a fully recirculating system containing a single 150 m 3 ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain tank during {{the production of}} food-size Arctic char and rainbow trout. The flow through the culture tank was 4500 – 4800 L/min. Approximately 92 – 93 % of the system flow exited through the Cornell-type sidewall drain. The remaining 7 – 8 % of the flow, approximately 340 L/min, exited through a bottom–center drain and an external standpipe {{and then to the}} settling tank. The surface-loading rate applied to both settling tank designs was 0. 0031 m 3 /s per square meter (4. 6 gpm/ft 2) of settling area. The swirl separator and the radial-flow settler were evaluated over a range of feeding rates to evaluate the relationship between inlet TSS concentration and TSS removal efficiency. There was a highly significant difference (P< 0. 001) in mean TSS removal efficiency of the swirl separator and radial-flow settler, (±S. E.) 37. 1 ± 3. 3 % and 77. 9 ± 1. 6 %, respectively. Also, TSS removal efficiency of the radial-flow settler was less variable than removal efficiency of the swirl separator. The trend in TSS removal efficiency was consistent over a broad range of inlet TSS concentrations to the separator. A mass balance indicates that the swirl separator only removed approximately 23 % of the total mass of TSS removed from this recirculating system. However, when the radial-flow settler was operated in the same recirculating system, it accounted for approximately 48 % of the mass of TSS removed from the system daily. The mass balance calculations also indicate that the microscreen <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> accounted for approximately 40 – 45 % of the mass of TSS removed daily from the recirculating system when using either settling device. In either case, these results indicate that <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> treatment of the entire recirculating flow {{played an important role in}} preventing elevated TSS concentrations from accumulating within a recirculating system...|$|E

The IBF produced the cleanest discharge and highest treatment efficiencies, likely reflecting the rapid efficiency with which solids are separated from wastewater.

40|$|Integrated {{aquaculture}} systems (IAS) are {{a type of}} recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) {{where the}} wastewater is treated {{and returned to the}} fish tanks. The important difference between the two is that in an IAS, wastes from the aquaculture component are recovered as fertilizer to produce an agricultural product whereas in an RAS, waste organics, nutrients and solids are treated and discharged. A pilot marine IAS at Mote Aquaculture Research Park in Sarasota, FL was studied for this project. Water quality monitoring, measurements of fish health and growth rates of fish and plants were performed over a two-year period to determine the effectiveness of the system in producing fish and plant products and removing pollutants. The goal of this portion of the project was to develop, calibrate and evaluate a model of the system, to understand the nitrogen transformations within the Mote IAS and to investigate other potential configurations of the Mote IAS. The model was divided into the various compartments to simulate each stage of the system, which included fish tanks, a <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> for solids removal, and moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) for nitrification and disinfection. A solids tank after the <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> was used to store the <b>drum</b> <b>filter</b> effluent slurry, which was then divided between three treatment processes: a geotube, a sand filter followed by a plant bed, and a plant bed alone. Nitrogen species modeled were particulate organic nitrogen (PON), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), ammonium and nitrate. Of the physical components of the IAS, models of the MBBR and the two plant raceways included physical, chemical and biological nitrogen transformation processes. The sand filter, solids tank and geotube models were simple mass balances, incorporating factional removals of each species based on the observed data. Other variables modeled included temperature, dissolved oxygen, volatile suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand concentrations. The model was built in a computer program, STELLATM, to simulate the Mote IAS. The model calibration involved experimental, literature and calibrated parameters. Parameters were adjusted until the model 2 ̆ 7 s output was a best fit to the observed data by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals. During the sensitivity analysis, two model parameters caused large variations in the model output. The denitrifier constant caused the most variation to the model 2 ̆ 7 s output followed by the denitrifier fraction of volatile suspended solids. Of the removal processes, denitrification was the largest nitrogen removal mechanism from the model, accounting for 59...|$|E
