40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{pertains to}} {{the inability of the}} traditional historical <b>cost</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of not-for-profit hospitals to reflect adequately the effects of changing prices. The possibility that this perceived deficiency might be alleviated is investigated by application of the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33 (FAS 33) supplementary changing prices information requirements (minimum disclosures required of large profit-seeking enterprises or optional comprehensive financial statements) to the conventional historical <b>cost</b> hospital <b>financial</b> <b>statements.</b> ^ The major research questions pursued are: (1) How would the conventional historical <b>cost</b> <b>financial</b> data of one specific hospital be changed by application of FAS 33 current cost and constant dollar models? and (2) What is the perceived impact of FAS 33 current cost and constant dollar data on the financial decisions of selected users of the financial statements of the hospital studied?^ The fiscal year 1980 conventional historical <b>cost</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of a medium sized general hospital were converted, using indexation procedures, to financial statements reflecting three restated bases: (1) constant dollar, (2) current cost, and (3) current cost/constant dollar under the criteria of FAS 33. Several sets of data ranging from the FAS 33 minimum disclosure requirements under each model to full sets of comprehensive financial statements are presented and analyzed. In addition, the results of an interview with executives of the case study hospital are presented regarding their views of the perceived impact of FAS 33 data on their financial decisions. ^ This dissertation research study demonstrates that the FAS 33 minimum disclosure requirements and the optional comprehensive financial statement procedures can be feasibly applied to the conventional historical <b>cost</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of not-for-profit hospitals. ...|$|R

A measure to stop fraud from occurring in the first place is termed as fraud prevention.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{precision}} of auditing standards under a negligence liability system for auditors. Auditing standards such as, e. g., GAAS in the US and GoA in Germany provide rules for judging the auditors' due care and are supposed to serve both descriptive and normative purposes. In order to fulfill these functions, it is usually hypothesized that the standards must be made as precise as possible. This paper argues, however, that vague standards need not be detrimental. In fact, it is shown that for each precise standard there exists a vague standard that outperforms the precise standard equilibrium in terms of auditing efforts, quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>statements,</b> <b>costs</b> of using the legal system, and direct as well as total auditing costs. ...|$|R

Pro forma disclosure has been supported by several theories such as: efficient market theory, catering theory, agency theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory. However, there are problems in reporting pro forma figures. There is no standard to it. Therefore, information on pro forma disclosure might also mislead less sophisticated investor...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To compare {{economic}} {{impacts of}} anti-thromboembolism prophylaxis with two medications - new pentasaccharide fondaparinux versus {{low molecular weight}} heparin (LMWH) - in major orthopaedic surgery, such as hip and knee replacement and hip fracture repair, in Switzerland. In order to meet this objective, three parameters were determined for an observation period of 5 years. (1) Outcomes: Frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and their complications. (2) Cost burden of disease: Determination {{of the costs of}} DVT, PE and complications not prevented despite prophylaxis. (3) Total costs of prophylaxis: Costs were calculated {{from the perspective of the}} health insurance scheme. Methods: In order to determine outcomes and cost burden of disease, a model was applied which generates the post-surgery course of thromboembolic events (TE) and their complications for individual cohorts of patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery and hip fracture repair. These findings were allocated to the Swiss standard diagnostic and therapeutic measures (resource consumption), which enabled subsequent calculation of the costs of TE, including complications not prevented in spite of prophylaxis (cost burden of disease) based on standard Swiss tariffs. Additionally, total costs of prophylaxis, including costs of medications and monitoring, were determined. Results: In Switzerland, the following outcomes (expressed as percentage of the number of patients undergoing surgery) can be expected for TE prophylaxis with LMWH and with fondaparinux: DVT 3. 4 vs. 2. 3 %, PE 1. 4 vs. 0. 7 %, recurrent DVT 0. 2 vs. 0. 1 %, post-thrombotic syndrome 4. 8 vs. 3. 5 %. The costs of non-prevented TE and their complications add up to CHF 437 vs. CHF 306 per patient undergoing major orthopaedic surgery; the total cost burden for Switzerland amounts to CHF 13. 4 million vs. CHF 9. 4 million (30 % less). Thus, despite higher medication costs, the use of fondaparinux instead of LMWH saves a total of CHF 105 per operated patient from the perspective of the health insurer. Conclusion: Fondaparinux is superior to LMWH in regards to both clinical efficacy and <b>financial</b> <b>costs.</b> This <b>statement</b> is confirmed by sensitivity analysis with different parameters over a broad range...|$|R
