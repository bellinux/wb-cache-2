First; the optical imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was processed to delineate {{the extent of}} the 2010 flood along Indus River; Pakistan. Moreover; the all-weather all-time capability of higher resolution imagery from the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) is used to monitor flooding in the lower Indus river basin. Then a proxy for river discharge from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite and rainfall estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) are used to study streamflow time series and precipitation patterns. The AMSR-E detected water surface signal was cross-validated with ground-based river discharge observations at multiple streamflow stations along the main Indus River. A high correlation was found; as indicated by a Pearson correlation coefficient of above 0. 8 for the <b>discharge</b> <b>gauge</b> stations located in the southwest of Indus River basin.

The gauge Neu Darchau is the most downstream <b>discharge</b> <b>gauge</b> of the Elbe River before it becomes an estuary. We follow the questions, whether the discharge characteristics of the Elbe River have changed over the last decades and how much common flood quantiles (i. e. 100 -year flood) are affected by the latest extreme events in 2002, 2006, 2011, and 2013. Hence, we conduct (i)  trend and seasonality analysis and (ii)  an assessment of time-dependencies of flood quantiles by using quasi non-stationary extreme value statistics with both block maxima and peak-over-threshold approaches. The (iii)  significance of the changes found in flood quantiles are assessed by using a stochastic approach based on autoregressive models and Monte Carlo simulations. The results of the trend analyses do show no clear evidences for any significant trends in daily mean discharges and increasing flood frequencies. With respect to the extreme events in 2002, 2006, 2011, and 2013 our results reveal, that those events do not lead to extraordinary changes in the 100 -year floods. Nevertheless, in the majority an increase in the 100 -year floods over the recent decades can be stated.

In order to inform and warn populations, the French flood forecasting service (SCHAPI, Service Central d'Hydrométéorologie et d'Appui à la Prévision des Inondations) initiated the BVNE (Bassin Versant Numérique Expérimental, or Experimental Digital Basin) project {{in an effort}} to enhance flash flood predictability. The target area for this study is the Gardon d'Anduze basin, located {{in the heart of the}} Cévennes range. In this Mediterranean mountainous setting, rainfall intensity can be very high, resulting in flash flooding. Discharge and rainfall gauges are often exposed to extreme weather conditions, which undermines measurement accuracy and continuity. Moreover, the processes governing rainfall-discharge relations are not well understood for these steeply-sloped and heterogeneous basins. In this context of inadequate information on both the forcing variables and process knowledge, neural networks are investigated due to their universal approximation and parsimony properties. We demonstrate herein that thanks to a rigorous variable and complexity selection, efficient forecasting of up to two-hour durations, without requiring rainfall forecasting as input, can be derived using the measured discharges available from a feedforward model. In the case of <b>discharge</b> <b>gauge</b> malfunction, in degraded mode, forecasting may result using a recurrent neural network model. We also observe that neural network models exhibit low sensitivity to uncertainty in rainfall measurements since producing ensemble forecasting does not significantly affect forecasting quality.

Moreover, the interest in the uncertainty associated with spatially-distributed hydrologic model predictions has increased as well, because the value of such predicted values are limited, if a reasonable estimation of the epistemic (systemic) uncertainty is not provided. Herein, we have applied the NOAA National Weather Service Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) over the Durango River basin in Colorado and assess the model prediction uncertainty arising from parameter estimation. The Multi-Objective Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (MOSCEM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameter estimation uncertainty, {{in conjunction with a}} variety of variables such as snow water equivalent, snow cover, and two different <b>discharge</b> <b>gauge</b> observations - one gauge is at the outlet of the basin while the other is internal. In addition, we evaluate the appropriateness of the a priori parameter estimation procedure of Koren et al. (2006) using a variety of traditional criteria or error functions. In particular, given the distributed nature of the model and the availability of remotely sensed distributed observations, we introduce a novel approach for the use of two shape matching or similarity functions: the Hausdorff distance and the Earth Movers distance. We find a high degree of usefulness for this type of error functions.

40|$|The tidal {{branch of}} the Sea Scheldt between the lock of Gentbrugge and Melle - part of the complex Ringvaart system around Ghent - has not {{received}} any upstream discharge since 1981. Consequently, ebb velocities were reduced, while flood velocities were left unaffected, causing sedimentation in the branch. At some locations along the branch, odour nuisance was regularly reported. In order to address the problem, Division Sea Scheldt of the Flemish Government proposed to dredge the associated muddy material. Flanders Hydraulics Research (FHR) was asked to conduct a study about the necessary upstream discharge at the lock of Gentbrugge needed to ensure the river branch’s self-erosiveness. To answer this question, monitored data were combined with modelling know-how. A 2 D numerical morphological model was constructed, for which hydrological and sedimentological parameters, such as <b>discharge,</b> <b>gauge</b> height and sediment concentration, were used as input and for validation. All of these data were provided by FHR. After numerous numerical scenarios, {{it was concluded that}} the discharge required, lies between 20 and 25 m 3 /s. However, as a mean discharge of about 70 m 3 /s is discharged into the entire water system around Ghent, and as other waterways within this system require sufficient discharges (of which the Canal Ghent-Terneuzen has been determined in a Belgian-Dutch treaty) this discharge is not available in normal circumstances in the tidal branch.

The general aim is to test the hypothesis of scaling invariance of river flow and the shape invariance of the hydrographs, in order to investigate the link between scaling properties and flow dynamics. In particular, the coherence between different approaches widely used in the literature to describe these characteristics is evaluated through the estimation of parameters defining the range of time-scales on which the scaling properties are valid.

40|$|Focus of {{this study}} is the {{analysis}} of a local hydrogeological system in the subhumid outer tropics in the western African country of Benin.

This study simulated the impact of climate change on the runoff generation and streamflow of Chu River Basin (CRB), a glacierized basin in Central Asia using the enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The model was calibrated and validated using the measured monthly streamflow data from three <b>discharge</b> <b>gauge</b> stations in CRB for the period 1961 - 1985 and was subsequently driven by downscaled future climate projections of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) under three radiative forcing scenarios (RCP 2. 6, RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5). In this study, the period 1966 - 1995 {{was used as the}} baseline period, while 2016 - 2045 and 2066 - 2095 as the near-future and far-future period, respectively. As projected, the climate would become warmer and drier under all scenarios in the future, and the future climate would be characterized by larger seasonal and annual variations under higher RCP. A general decreasing trend was identified in the average annual runoff in glacier (- 26. 6 % to - 1. 0 %), snow (- 21. 4 % to + 1. 1 %) and streamflow (- 27. 7 % to - 6. 6 %) for most of the future scenario periods. The projected maximum streamflow in each of the two future scenarios occurred one month earlier than that in the baseline period because of the reduced streamflow in summer months. Results of this study are expected to arouse the serious concern about water resource availability in the headwater region of CRB under the continuously warming climate.

40|$|ModClark and Clark’s Unit Hydrograph (Clark’s UH) within HEC-HMS {{software}} {{are distributed}} and lumped models, respectively. Clark’s UH simulates the transformation and attenuation of excess precipitation, and requires {{time of concentration}} (Tc) and Storage Coefficient (R) parameters. ModClark transformation accounts for variations in travel time to catchment outlet from all regions of a catchment, and it additionally requires gridded representation of a catchment and Gridded cell-based input files. Four cases (three from observed rain, and one from radar reflectivity) of three chosen events were specifically chosen and examined for the comparison of simulation results with the same estimated initial parameters apart from different rainfall inputs. The Upper Waimakariri River Catchment was divided into ten subcatchments, and the HEC-HMS basin model parameters were estimated by using the physical/hydrological characteristics. However, ModClark transformation was unavailable because of an output error from converting ASCII to gridded Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN) format by the conversion tool – ai 2 dssgrid. exe. Therefore, Mean Aerial Precipitation (MAP) for each subcatchment was calculated by Thiessen polygon method combined with an overlay analysis for grid-cell-based rainfall estimation from radar with geographic information system (GIS) tools. The automated calibration/optimisation procedure included in HEC-HMS package {{was applied to the}} cases which showed a deviation between simulation and observed flows. The purpose is to ‘optimise’ the initial estimates of parameters only in a mathematical-fit manner based on the observed flows from the only <b>discharge</b> <b>gauge</b> at Old Highway Bridge (OHB). The TC values calculated from the five equations vary in a relatively narrow range apart from the one from Bransby-Williams equation.

Since Sargent (1981, 1982 a), the technique has not been applied widely, mainly as a result of practical difficulties. We hypothesize that modern image processing techniques can greatly improve the rising bubble technique. We applied the technique in both a laboratory setup and a field study, after calibrating the bubble rising velocity for our nozzles in the specific case. During our measurements, we captured digital photographs of the bubble envelope at the water surface, each picture being a single measurement of the discharge. The photographs were corrected for lens distortion and reprojected so that accurate distances on water surface level could be obtained. This easy digital procedure resulted in accurate discharge measurements, even when turbulence was involved and the averages of multiple image analyses yielded good results.

40|$|Reliable {{estimation}} of freshwater inflow {{to the ocean}} from large tidal rivers is vital for water resources management and climate analyses. <b>Discharge</b> <b>gauging</b> stations are typically located beyond the tidal intrusion reach, such that inputs and losses occurring closer to the ocean are not included. Here, we develop a method of estimating river <b>discharge</b> using multiple <b>gauges</b> and time-dependent tidal statistics determined via wavelet analysis. The Multiple-gauge Tidal Discharge Estimate (MTDE) method is developed {{using data from the}} Columbia River and Fraser River estuaries and calibrated against river discharge. Next, we evaluate the general applicability of MTDE by testing an idealized two-dimensional numerical model, with a convergent cross-sectional profile, for eighty-one cases in which nondimensional numbers for friction, river flow, and convergence length scale are varied. The simulations suggest that MTDE is applicable to a variety of tidal systems. Model results and data analyses together suggest that MTDE works best with at least three gauges: a reference station near the river mouth, and two upstream gauges that respond strongly to distinct portions of the observed range of flow. The balance between tidal damping and amplifying factors determines the favorable location of the gauges. Compared to previous studies, the MTDE method improves the time resolution of estimates (from 2. 5 to 3 ̆c 1 week) and is applicable to systems with mixed diurnal/semidiurnal tides. However, model results suggest that tide-induced residual flows such as the Stokes drift may still affect the accuracy of MTDE at seaward locations during periods of low river discharge...|$|R

The Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is employed to update the grid-based distributed states of such an hourly spatially distributed version of the HBV- 96 model. By using a physically based model for the routing, the time delay and attenuation are modelled more realistically. The discharge and states at a given time step are assumed to be dependent on the previous time step only (Markov property). Synthetic and real world experiments are carried out for the Upper Ourthe (1600 km 2 ), a relatively quickly responding catchment in the Belgian Ardennes. We assess the impact on the forecasted discharge of (1) various sets of the spatially distributed <b>discharge</b> <b>gauges</b> and (2) the filtering frequency. The results show that the hydrological forecast at the catchment outlet is improved by assimilating interior gauges. This augmentation of the observation vector improves the forecast more than increasing the updating frequency.

40|$|River <b>discharges</b> {{are usually}} <b>gauged</b> at sites farther {{upstream}} than estuarine tidal reaches. As a result, global estimates of river water and nutrient fluxes {{to the ocean}} are likely underestimated as they often neglect groundwater discharge occurring in estuaries downstream of river gauging stations. We used radon and radium isotopes as tracers of groundwater discharge into the Sebastian River Estuary, a gaining stream in Florida, USA. We developed a spatially-distributed mass balance model that accounts for radon sources and sinks in waters {{above and below the}} estuarine pycnocline. Radium isotopes (224 Ra, 223 Ra, and 226 Ra) were not enriched in groundwater relative to surface water and thus had limited usefulness as tracers at this specific site. The detection of fresh groundwater just beneath the sediment:water interface overlain by brackish bottom water implies that fresh groundwater dominates over saline groundwater in this salt wedge estuary. Lateral groundwater inputs from sandy banks into waters above the estuarine pycnocline were about 6 -fold higher than inputs into waters below the pycnocline. Groundwater discharge rates into the surface layer of the estuary estimated from a radon mass balance ranged from 5 to 18 m 3 /s (or 18 to 62 cm/day if uniformly distributed throughout the entire estuary area). The fluxes into the bottom layer ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 1 m 3 /s (or 2. 8 to 3. 9 cm/day). These groundwater inputs augmented river <b>discharges</b> <b>gauged</b> upstream of the estuary tidal reaches by about 260 % during the dry period and 135 % during the wet period.

40|$|Rainfall-runoff {{models are}} common tools for river {{discharge}} estimation {{in the field}} of hydrology. In ungauged basins, the dependence on observed river discharge data for calibration restricts applications of rainfall-runoff models. The strong correlation between quantities of river cross-sectional water surface width obtained from remote sensing and corresponding in situ <b>gauged</b> river <b>discharge</b> has been verified by many researchers. In this study, a calibration scheme of rainfall-runoff models based on satellite observations of river width at basin outlet is illustrated. One distinct advantage is that this calibration is independent of river discharge information. The at-a-station hydraulic geometry is implemented to facilitate shifting calibration objective from river discharge to river width. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology is applied to model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibration scheme is demonstrated through a case study for simulating river discharge at Pakse in the Mekong Basin. The effectiveness of calibration scheme and uncertainties associated with utilization of river width observations from space are examined from model input-state-output behaviour, capability of reproducing river discharge, and posterior parameter distribution. The results indicate that the satellite observation of river width is a competent surrogate of observed discharge for the calibration of rainfall-runoff model at Pakse and the proposed method has the potential for improving reliability of river discharge estimation in basins without any <b>discharge</b> <b>gauging...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2012 Redd counts ??? {{total number}} of {{distinct}} redds observed during a spawning season - are often used {{as an indicator of}} the abundance of salmonids spawning in streams and have recently been adopted for statewide assessment of status and trends in abundance of Pacific salmon in California???s Coastal Salmonid Monitoring Plan (CMP). Methods currently used to generate an estimate of spawner abundance from redd counts make no attempt to account for redd loss between successive survey occasions. Stochastic periods of high stream discharge between survey occasions may scour or obscure newly constructed redds, so that the {{total number of}} distinct observable redds at the time of surveys may be substantially less than the total number of redds actually constructed. Therefore, even if field observers have perfect detection probability for those new redds that are present at the time of surveys, redd counts may have substantial negative bias as an estimator of total redd construction. I developed a Monte Carlo simulation model that allows assessment of the potential influence of stochastic variations in stream discharge on loss of constructed redds {{over the course of a}} spawning season. Submodels used in simulations were based on empirical redd survey data collected in Freshwater Creek, a small northern California stream, following CMP survey protocols. A six-year time series of daily <b>discharge</b> <b>gauged</b> in Freshwater Creek, and a longer 55 -year surrogate time series of <b>discharge</b> <b>gauged</b> in a nearby stream (Little River), were used to simulate the interannual variation in redd loss that might result from interannual variation in pattern of stream discharge. In each simulated survey year, a realistic temporal pattern of recruitment of constructed redds was superimposed upon a randomly selected hydrograph. Time between successive redd count surveys was set at a minimum of 10 days, but simulated inter-survey interval exceeded 10 days whenever simulated depth of visibility was predicted insufficient to allow successful observation of redds. Loss of newly constructed redds was a function of the temporal discharge regime from date of redd construction to the first survey occasion. Based on the selected hydrograph, a simulated temporal pattern of redd construction, and a simulated survey schedule, the expected number of distinct redds that would be observable at the time of surveys was compared to the actual total number of redds constructed, for low, moderate and high abundance (numbers of redds constructed) scenarios and for dry, moderate and wet water year types. Simulation results suggest that the proportion of observable redds varies by abundance and by water year type. Degree of negative bias and interannual variability in the proportion of observable redds was greatest in wet water years and at low abundance. Simulation results suggest that redd counts unadjusted for redd loss will have substantial negative bias and low reliability, especially in wet water years, even if perfect detection is assumed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. To {{understand}} {{and respond to}} changes in the world’s northern regions, we need a coordinated system of long-term Arctic observations. River networks naturally integrate across landscapes and link the terrestrial and ocean domains. Changes in river discharge reflect changes in the terrestrial water balance, whereas changes in water chemistry are linked to changes in biogeochemical processes and water flow paths. Sustained measurements of river water discharge and water chemistry are therefore essential components of an Arctic observing network. As we strive to establish and sustain long-term observations in the Arctic, these two measurements must be coupled. Although river discharge and chemistry measurements are already coupled to some extent within national boundaries, this is not done in a consistent and coordinated fashion across the pan-Arctic domain. As a consequence, data quality and availability vary widely among regions. International coordination of river discharge and chemistry measurements in the Arctic would be greatly facilitated by formal commitments to maintain a set of core sites and associated measurements that are mutually agreed upon among pan-Arctic nations. Involvement of the agencies currently operating river <b>discharge</b> <b>gauges</b> around the Arctic and establishment of an overarching coordination entity to implement shared protocols, track data quality, and manage data streams would be essential in this endeavor. Focused studies addressing scale-dependent relationships between watershed characteristics and water chemistry, in-stream processes, and estuarine and coastal dynamics are also needed to support interpretation and application of Arctic river observing data as they relate to land and ocean change.

This can result in losses caused by both floods and droughts. The procedures for flood frequency analysis are clear and well established while droughts cannot be defined and analysed without consideration of conditions in given regions. It is therefore necessary to analyse time series in order to define both meteorological and hydrological droughts as well as their coincidence in statistical manner.

40|$|Alteration of {{the spatial}} {{variability}} of natural flow regimes {{has been less}} studied {{than that of the}} temporal variability, despite its ecological importance for river ecosystems. Here, we aimed to quantify the spatial patterns of flow regime alterations along a river network in the Sagami River, Japan, by estimating river discharge under natural and altered flow conditions. We used a distributed hydrological model, which simulates hydrological processes spatiotemporally, to estimate 20 -year daily river discharge along the river network. Then, 33 hydrologic indices (i. e., Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) were calculated from the simulated discharge to estimate the spatial patterns of their alterations. Some hydrologic indices were relatively well estimated such as the magnitude and timing of maximum flows, monthly median flows, and the frequency of low and high flow pulses. The accuracy was evaluated with correlation analysis (r > 0. 4) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (α = 0. 05) by comparing these indices calculated from both observed and simulated discharge. The spatial patterns of the flow regime alterations varied depending on the hydrologic indices. For example, both the median flow in August and the frequency of high flow pulses were reduced by the maximum of approximately 70 %, but these strongest alterations were detected at different locations (i. e., on the mainstream and the tributary, respectively). These results are likely caused by different operational purposes of multiple water control facilities. The results imply that the evaluation only at <b>discharge</b> <b>gauges</b> is insufficient to capture the alteration of the flow regime. Our findings clearly emphasize the importance of evaluating the spatial pattern of flow regime alteration on a river network where its discharge is affected by multiple water control facilities...|$|R

Many analysis methods are used: principal component analysis, to divide the study area into homogenous portions; trend analysis, considering the Mann–Kendall, Student-t and Craddock tests, autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses, and seasonal, annual and moving-average variables, applying the spatial analysis to each variable with a geographical information system approach. A widespread decreasing trend of annual rainfall is observed over 97 % of the whole area. The decreasing trend of rainfall worsens or decreases as mean annual rainfall increases; the spatial mean of trend ranges from 20. 8 mm/a in Apulia to 22. 9 mm/a in Calabria. The decrease in rainfall is notable after 1980 : the recent droughts of 1988 – 1992 and 1999 – 2001 appear to be exceptional. On a seasonal basis, the decreasing trend is concentrated in winter; a slight positive trend is observed in summer, the arid season in which the increase is useless as it is transformed into actual evapotranspiration. The temperature trend is not significant and homogeneous everywhere if the temperature increase seems to prevail, especially from about 1980. Net rainfall, calculated {{as a function of}} monthly rainfall and temperature, shows a huge and generalized negative trend. The trend of groundwater availability is so negative everywhere that the situation can be termed dramatic for water users, due not only to the natural drop in recharge but also to the increase of discharge by wells to compensate the non-availability of surface water tapped by dams, as a direct effect of droughts...|$|R
40|$|Regional flood {{quantile}} {{estimates are}} affected by intersite correlation between flood sequences observed at different <b>discharge</b> <b>gauges.</b> This study analyses the intersite dependence of nested catchment structures and investigates the possibility of improving the accuracy of regional flood quantiles, by modelling cross-correlations for pairs of nested and unnested catchments separately. Probabilistic Regional Envelope Curves are utilised to derive regional flood quantiles for 89 catchments belonging to Saxony, in the Southeast of Germany. The study area has a nested structure and a definitely stronger intersite correlation for nested pairs of catchments than for unnested ones. Probabilistic Regional Envelope Curves are constructed {{on the basis of}} flood flows observed within pooling groups of sites (regions). Their recurrence intervals are {{based on the number of}} effective sample-years of data (i. e., equivalent number of uncorrelated data). The evaluation of the effective sample-years of data required the modelling of intersite dependence, which we performed globally, using a cross-correlation formula identified for the whole study area, and by using two different cross-correlation formulas, one for nested pairs and another for unnested pairs. These two modelling approaches returned significantly different effective sample-years of data estimates, and therefore also recurrence intervals, in the majority of the cases. The differences result from various assumptions of the size and homogeneity degree of the pooling group. The reduction of the recurrence interval, when using two different cross-correlation functions, is larger for higher recurrence intervals and for a higher fraction of nested catchment within the pooling group. A separation into nested and unnested pairs of catchments gives a more realistic representation of the characteristic river network structure and improves the accuracy of the estimation of regional information content. Hence, applying two different cross-correlation functions is recommended...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Records of <b>discharge</b> from <b>gauges</b> on rivers {{draining}} from glacierised basins in the Swiss Alps for {{the period}} 1922 - 1983 were analyzed together with climatic data in order to describe climatic variation and to determine the impact on total annual flows. Mean May-September air temperature and annual discharge show considerable yet markedly parallel year-to-year variations at all stations. Generally warmer summers in the late 1920 s, mid- 1930 s, 1940 s and late 1950 s are reflected in higher discharges, with a maximum in 1947. Cooler temperatures and reduced flows characterised the 1960 s and 1970 s before slight recovery in the 1980 s. A fall in ten-year mean temperature of 1 °C produced a reduction of about 25 % in ten-year mean discharge. Five-year running means of annual totals of precipitation increased from the 1940 s to the 1970 s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Legal {{and illegal}} gold mining in the Madre de Dios area cause several {{environmental}} concerns linked with mercury pollution and deforestation, which make hydrological and sediment transport processes central for any assessment of ongoing and future environmental impacts. This thesis addresses {{the problem of}} estimating flow and transport processes in the virtually ungauged Madre de Dios basin (Peru) to provide a first basis on which transport of mercury adsorbed on the sediment may be evaluated. The thesis first applies a recent method to derive the probability distribution of liquid and solid <b>discharges</b> to <b>gauged</b> basins in the Tropical Zone (Puerto Rico). This application allows {{the evaluation of the}} uncertainty associated with estimates of flow and transport pdf's. Once the iuncertainty is quantified, the same tool is applied to provide the first evaluation of the frequency distributions of discharge and sediment fluxes in the Madre de Dios area. Thesi...|$|R

Results indicate a better accuracy of some monthly models to reproduce inter-annual mean, variability and trends. Using <b>gauged</b> <b>discharge</b> filled with monthly WBM and extrapolating {{to the whole}} drainage basins, freshwater discharge to the Mediterranean Sea (excluding the Nile) significantly decreased in 1960 - 2009 (- 22 %, p< 0. 05), while decrease was not significant for the Black Sea...|$|R
30|$|It is {{concluded}} {{from the}} above study that by acquiring the rainfall, run-off data and SCS-CN curve number method, the future run-off {{of the river and}} the future hydro power potential of that <b>gauge</b> <b>discharge</b> station can be obtained. If a hydro power plant already exists in the area, then in future how much power or energy will be obtained or how much power will decrease can be decided with this method. Future run-off of the river can also be attained by observing the different landuse/land cover of this catchment area so that hydropower potential situated at that site may be optimised.|$|R

For more than 500, 000 river reaches the theoretical hydropower potential was computed from channel slope and mean annual discharge simulated by a water balance model. The model was calibrated with observed <b>discharge</b> at 410 <b>gauges,</b> using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data as inputs. Possible changes in future discharge were assessed by driving the water balance model with climate projections of 15 Regional Climate Models for two emission scenarios of the CORDEX-Africa ensemble...|$|R
40|$|The Seta River is {{the only}} one natural outlet river of Lake Biwa. This paper {{examines}} the relationship between water level of Lake Biwa and discharge of the Seta River in historical years. Since there are no <b>gauged</b> <b>discharge</b> data in historical years, water level data are transformed into differences of outflow from inflow (Qout - Qin) using the relationship between water level and storage volume (H-V relation) of Lake Biwa. The results indicate that flow capacity of the Seta River was expanded after the dregging in Tempo years (1831 - 1833), and that there were no notable changes in flow capacity during Meiji Period (1874 - 1899) ...|$|R

The recurrence interval of floods as represented by short‐term <b>gauged</b> <b>discharge</b> records (post‐ 1948) can then {{be placed in a}} longer term context. A range of historical sources is consulted and four chronologies recording dates of major flood occurrences in each sub‐catchment are produced. Individual floods are ranked in relation to other known events on the same river and, where possible, estimates of recurrence intervals provided. The seasonality and associated hydro‐meteorological conditions, which generated the floods, are also assessed...|$|R
