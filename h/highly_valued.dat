5|$|Macadamia (Macadamia spp.) are {{primarily}} produced in Hawaii and Australia. Both species are native to Australia. They are a <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> edible nut. Waste nuts {{are commonly used}} to extract an edible oil.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia {{produces}} a dark amber-coloured honey of middling quality and therefore low commercial value. Despite this, {{the species is}} <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> by beekeepers because it produces large amounts of pollen and nectar during autumn and winter, thus helping support hives {{at a time when}} little else is flowering.|$|E
5|$|Common names include Jersey cow mushroom, bovine bolete, and euro cow bolete. One {{proposed}} origin for {{the scientific}} name is that medieval knights—who revered Tricholoma equestre—considered this mushroom fit only for cattle-drovers as it was not <b>highly</b> <b>valued.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Highly</b> <b>valued</b> by Australia's horticultural and {{cut flower}} industries, B.brownii is widely {{cultivated}} in areas {{not exposed to}} dieback. It prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with some moisture over summer.|$|E
5|$|Soybean oil: Chinese records dating {{prior to}} 2000 B.C. mention {{the use of}} {{cultivated}} soybeans to produce edible soy oil.

5|$|This slow-moving but {{aggressive}} fish dominates feeding frenzies, and is {{a danger}} to shipwreck or air crash survivors. Recent studies show steeply declining populations because its large fins are <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> as the chief ingredient of shark fin soup, and as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
50|$|In California, land {{managers}} do not <b>highly</b> <b>value</b> bigleaf maple, {{and it is}} often intentionally knocked over and left un-harvested during harvest of Douglas fir and redwood stands.|$|R
40|$|I {{propose to}} examine {{students}} who <b>highly</b> <b>value</b> both religious and materialistic beliefs {{and if they}} will experience lowered meaning in life {{as a result of}} the potential incompatibility between these value-systems. In many religions, the idea of pursuing personal wealth is potentially incompatible with values associated with religion. This study is among the first to examine how conflicting values influences meaning in life. Based upon empirical evidence, I predict that those who <b>highly</b> <b>value</b> both religious and materialistic beliefs will experience lower meaning in life compared to religious individuals who do not value materialism...|$|R

The larger-than-normal rural two-story frame depot is <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> by rail fans and rail preservationists.|$|E
5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were <b>highly</b> <b>valued.</b> Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave a portion of their heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling {{families}} in China. The pet Pugs were <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs {{were kept in}} luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later spread {{to other parts of}} Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.|$|E

5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were <b>highly</b> <b>valued,</b> often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{inherited}} {{not only}} the status afforded his family, but also had skills praised in his grandfather Andaigweos. Noted for his abilities in hunting and battle, Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people because of his speaking and oratorical skills, which were <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> in his culture. By the time the Ojibwa of Wisconsin and Minnesota started treaty negotiations with the US Government, Buffalo was {{recognized as one of}} the primary spokesmen for all the bands, not just for the Ojibwa from La Pointe.|$|E

50|$|Some weaverbirds, e.g. the black-throated weaver (Ploceus benghalensis) and the {{streaked}} weaver (P. manyar), <b>highly</b> <b>value</b> Lantana flowers for decorating their nests.

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray fights strongly on hook-and-line {{and is thus}} {{popular with}} recreational anglers, who usually release it alive. This species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean, using bottom trawls, gillnets and tangle nets, beach seines, and longlines. In particular, it is caught in substantial numbers by an Indonesian trawl fishery targeting wedgefishes in the Arafura Sea. The meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized, though this species is not a <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> food fish. It also has applications in Chinese medicine, and its tail may be sold as a curio.|$|E
5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon heavily {{to support the}} British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start of}} the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is <b>highly</b> <b>valued</b> by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
