40|$|Modeling of {{supercritical}} CO 2 {{extraction of}} <b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.</b> seed oil was studied at 15 to 30 MPa and 30 to 45 °C. Four mean <b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.</b> particle sizes raging from 0. 4 to 1. 0 mm were tested. CO 2 flow rate ranged between 0. 05 and 0. 2 m 3 h - 1. A new method {{that can be}} used for the simulation of SCFE process was presented. The model was based on differential mass balances along the extraction bed. The equilibrium between the solid and the fluid phase appeared to be the controlling step during the extraction fast period. By a series of transforms and derivatives, the explicit expression of the oil yield, q(z,t), was obtained. It can be used for the SCFE process simulation. In this model, only one adjustable parameter was used: the equilibrium constant between the solvent and the free solute phase, K. A fairly good fitting of the experimental data was obtained by setting K = 10.

For the extraction process of <b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.</b> seed oil, the optimum conditions were as follows: extraction pressure of 20 - 30 MPa, extraction temperature of 35 - 40 degrees C, supercritical CO 2 flow rate of 0. 15 - 0. 3 m(3) /h, and extraction time of 4 - 5 h.

40|$|Sea Buckthorn (<b>Hippophae</b> <b>Rhamnoides</b> <b>L.)</b> as {{a source}} of biochemically active {{substances}} ABSTRACT This work is primarily focused on summarizing of existing data in the literature about the chemical composition of sea buckthorn (<b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.)</b> fruits, in particular of its oil. It was found that the content of individual chemical components substantially varies in different cultivars and is also very dependent on the conditions in which the plant is grown. Various sea buckthorn products can be rich sources of antioxidants, such as the vitamin C (in amounts up to 2500 mg/ 100 g of fresh fruit) and tocopherols (up to 481 mg/ 100 g of fresh fruit), flavonoids (up to 1100 mg/ 100 g of fresh fruit) and carotenoids (up to 2139 mg/ 100 g of oil). The fatty acids of this plant are mostly unsaturated (up to 89 % of all fatty acids), in dominant amounts linolenic and linoleic acid can be found in seed oil and palmitooleic and saturated palmitic acid in pulp oil. Content and effects of significant flavonoids in the plant are also summarized. Among the most important biological effects of sea buckthorn, its antioxidant activity can be included as well as effects on the function of cardiovascular system, hepatoprotective and anticancer effects proven for some of the substances.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} effects of a hexanoic extract obtained from fresh fruit of <b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.,</b> (HRe- 1) melatonin and omeprazole on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer and on the levels of gastric tissue glutathione (GSH). Methods: Fifty albino Wistar male rats were used. Gastric lesion was produced by ethanol. GSH levels of gastric tissue were determined according to Griffith method. Results: Mean number of ulcer foci was 12. 3 + 0. 8 in ethanol group, 3. 1 + 0. 5 in HRe- 1 and 4. 3 + 0. 67 melatonin groups. Mean ulcer area was 5. 4 + 0. 86 mm 2 in HRe- 1, 20. 5 + 0. 72 mm 2 in omeprazole, 7. 0 + 0. 93 mm 2 in melatonin and 29. 3 + 1. 32 mm 2 in ethanol groups (p< 0. 001 : ethanol group vs other groups). Gastric tissue GSH levels of HRe- 1 and melatonin groups were fairly close to the normal values. Additionally, this level was significantly reduced in omeprazole and ethanol groups. While {{there was no difference in}} terms of mean ulcer area and number of ulcer foci, between melatonin and HRe- 1 groups, gastric tissue GSH levels were found significantly higher in HRe- 1 than in melatonin groups.

40|$|Abstract: Seabuckthorn (<b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.)</b> is a {{branched}} deciduous shrub {{native to}} Europe and Asia. The plant {{has been used}} extensively in oriental traditional system of medicine for treatment of different diseases. Seabuckthorn is found to have significant antioxidative, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, cytoprotective, hepatoprtective and tissue regenerative properties. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antidiabetic and antioxidant effect of seabuckthorn (<b>Hippophae</b> <b>rhamnoides</b> <b>L.)</b> in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type- 2 diabetic rats. Experimental diabetes was induced by a single intraperitonial injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg), 15 minutes after the i. p. administration of 120 mg/kg nicotinamide. Seabuckthorn was administered orally to streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats. Blood glucose, tissue glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in pancreas were estimated following the established procedures. Biochemical observations were supplemented with histological examination of pancreatic tissue. The increase of blood glucose, TBARS level with reduction in GSH content were the salient features observed in STZ- diabetic rats. Sea buckthorn produced a significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in blood glucose levels and TBARS levels in the STZ- diabetic rats. GSH, reduced significantly (p< 0. 05) in diabetic rats, was brought back to near normal levels by co-administration of sea buckthorn. Degenerative changes of pancreatic beta cells in STZ- diabetic rats were minimized to near normal morphology by administration of sea buckthorn as evident by histopathological examination.
