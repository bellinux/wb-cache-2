25|$|Hydroxylamine is an <b>inorganic</b> <b>compound</b> {{with the}} formula NH2OH. The pure {{material}} is a white, unstable crystalline, hygroscopic compound. However, hydroxylamine {{is almost always}} provided and used as an aqueous solution. It is used to prepare oximes, an important functional group. It is also an intermediate in biological nitrification. In biological nitrification, the oxidation of NH3 to hydroxylamine is mediated by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) further oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite.|$|E

25|$|Sodium amide, {{commonly}} called sodamide, is the <b>inorganic</b> <b>compound</b> with the formula NaNH2. This solid, which is dangerously reactive toward water, is white, but commercial samples are typically gray {{due to the}} presence of small quantities of metallic iron from the manufacturing process. Such impurities do not usually affect the utility of the reagent. NaNH2 conducts electricity in the fused state, its conductance being similar to that of NaOH in a similar state. NaNH2 has been widely employed as a strong base in organic synthesis.|$|E
