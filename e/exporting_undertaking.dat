40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the determinants of}} whether a firm <b>exports,</b> <b>undertakes</b> R&D and/or innovates, and, in particular, the contemporaneous links between these variables using three waves of the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS). Where appropriate, an instrumental variables procedure is employed to overcome problems of endogeneity. The results show that in both manufacturing and services, being involved in exporting increased the probability that an establishment was engaged in spending on R&D. Spending on R&D in manufacturing had a much larger impact on the probability of exporting which implies that spending on R&D was not simply to boost the probability of producing new goods and services, but also to improve the establishment’s knowledge assets which would in turn help it break down barriers to international markets. In non-manufacturing, spending on R&D increased the probability of innovating but had no significant impact on whether the establishment exported; rather, innovating increased the probability of exporting. Exporting had no direct impact on whether innovation occurred in either sector. Given the key role of R&D, innovation and exporting in determining productivity, {{it is important that}} government understands these complex interactions between R&D, innovation and exporting and takes advantage of them when devising and implementing productivity-enhancing policies at the micro-level...|$|R

We found that multinational firms emerged from being exporters/importers.

It is shown that multilateral trade liberalisation may lead firms to switch from <b>exporting</b> to <b>undertaking</b> export-platform FDI when the interregional transport cost is high. Also, when the inter-regional transport cost is high, the switch to FDI leads to an increase in the volume of world trade in this industry.

In so doing, we build a three-country model, in which firms serve foreign markets either by <b>exporting</b> or <b>undertaking</b> FDI, and consider a coalition formation game with the Coalition Proof Nash Equilibrium as an equilibrium concept. We find that the equilibrium coalition structure varies upon firms characterization {{before and after the}} formation of a trading bloc. As in the literature, when all firms are exporters in the pre- and post-formation, bilateralism can be an equilibrium outcome. However, when trade barriers are not so high as to be trade-prohibitive and the environment is favorable to multinational activities in the pre- or post-formation, only global free trade will prevail as an equilibrium coalition structure. trading blocs, FTA, multinational corporations, FDI, coalition formation game,...|$|R

40|$|The {{analyses}} {{concerned with}} the relationship between FDI – host country focus on {{its impact on the}} entire economy or only on trade in general, as well as on their subcomponents. Our approach focuses on the link between FDI – host country's exports, as a result of Romania's current situation, in which exports are clearly and strongly influenced by FDI. To confirm our results we used various econometric models from the statistical apparatus, applying and adapting the good practice recommended by OECD. The studies that highlight how foreign capital is involved in export activity gradually discovered a link between these two factors. The low level of FDI in the early 1990 s and the original orientation of many MNCs towards domestic demand contributed to the gradual disclosure, in the scientific literature, of the effects of FDI on <b>exports.</b> The <b>undertaken</b> regression analysis cemented and, in the same time, diversified previous results, coming with more information about the effects exerted by FDI.

To understand why these economies have increasingly applied anti-dumping laws, we build a simple theoretical model of vertical intra-industry trade and investigate the strategic incentives of <b>exporting</b> firms to <b>undertake</b> dumping. We show that the definition of dumping matters. Based on a comparison of low-quality and high-quality prices, only unilateral dumping by the low-quality firm obtains. By contrast, the standard WTO definition leads to either reciprocal or unilateral dumping by the high-quality firm, depending on cross-country differences in incomes, the height of tariff protection and on exchange rate changes.

40|$|The recent sharp {{appreciation}} of the Canadian dollar vs. the US dollar poses difficulties for the Canadian economy and reignites the debate as to whether Canada should fix the Canadian dollar to the US dollar by implementing a unilateral peg or forming a monetary union. We compare the welfare of different combinations of monetary and currency policies in an open-economy macroeconomic model that incorporates two unique features of the Canadian economy: {{the high level of}} vertical trade with the US and the prevalent use of the US dollar as the invoicing currency for both imports and exports. This comparison generates two insights about the exchange rate regime of Canada. First, the vertical trade makes it more difficult for a flexible exchange rate to balance the Canadian economy by adjusting relative prices. The higher degree of economic integration resulting from the vertical production and trade favors a fixed exchange rate regime or a single currency. Second, because Canadian firms often use the US dollar as the invoicing currency for both imports and <b>exports,</b> they <b>undertake</b> most of the currency risk. Relative to other countries with a flexible exchange rate regime, in particular the US, Canada is more exposed to currency fluctuations, which leads to a higher cost of a flexible exchange rate regime in Canada...|$|R

Secondly, innovators {{will have to pay}} a higher relational distance cost for <b>undertaking</b> <b>export</b> activities, and they will therefore prefer to avoid (or reduce) these costs by choosing a FDI strategy instead. We test the empirical relevance of this idea on a new survey dataset for a representative sample of firms in all business service sectors in Norway. The results show that firms are more likely to choose FDI rather than export the greater their productivity level and the higher the relational distance costs they face. ...|$|R

This study analyzes the effects of these two policies on prices, quantities, and welfare, and compares these effects to those of export quota.

Using direct interviews with the CEOs of 145 export firms operating in Spain's food industry, the results show that a proactive environmental strategy is positively related to a company's export performance.

40|$|This study investigates FDI versus export {{decisions}} under oligopoly in {{the trade}} liberalization, and examines how trade liberalization affects welfares in the Hotelling model of differentiated Bertrand duopoly. It uses a four-firm two-country Cournot oligopoly model to resolve {{the conflict between the}} theory, which predicts that a reduction in trade costs discourages FDI, and the empirical evidence, which is that trade liberalisation has led to an increase in FDI, and shows that both FDI and exporting can co-exist in the same market, in line with recent trends. In the static game, a reduction in trade costs causes a decrease in FDI, and the outcomes are often a prisoners’ dilemma where the firms are worse off when they all undertake FDI than when all firms from both markets choose to export. To avoid it, firms can tacitly collude over their FDI versus export decisions when the game is infinitely-repeated. Then a reduction in trade costs may lead firms to switch from <b>exporting</b> to <b>undertaking</b> FDI when trade costs are sufficiently high. The robustness of the analysis is checked by using the constant elasticity demand function. A two-country Hotelling model of spartial duopoly is developed to consider the welfare effects of trade liberalisation. It is shown that gains from trade occur when products are highly differentiated, and losses from trade occur when products are close substitutes, as the positive effect of more product choices overweighs the negative effect of the decreased home sales caused by trade liberalization when products are highly differentiated. This contrasts to Fujiwara (2009) who prove that there are always losses from trade in the Hotelling model. The reason behind is that the kinked demand market structure is often ignored, and by considering the full features of the Hotelling model, welfare effects depend on product differentiation and trade costs...|$|R
