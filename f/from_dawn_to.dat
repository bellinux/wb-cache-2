5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding <b>from</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically {{to rest and}} chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, <b>from</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and <b>from</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

25|$|Denmark's {{most famous}} {{composer}} {{of classical music}} is Carl Nielsen who is best known outside of Denmark for his six symphonies, but whose melodies for popular songs are cherished among Danes. Other well-known pieces of his are the incidental music for Adam Oehlenschläger's drama Aladdin (Nielsen), the operas Saul og David and Maskarade, the concertos for flute, violin, and clarinet, the Wind Quintet, and the Helios Overture, which depicts {{the passage of the}} sun in the sky <b>from</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> nightfall. The Royal Danish Ballet specializes in the work of Danish choreographer August Bournonville (1805–79). Hans Abrahamsen, Per Nørgård and Poul Ruders are successful composers of contemporary classical music. Danish interest in classical music is exemplified by the prestigious Opera House completed in 2000. Strategically set on Copenhagen's waterfront, it has presented operas and musicals to full houses ever since its opening.|$|E

25|$|His caution {{confirmed}} by this experience, Carrington intensified training for his soldiers and officers, forming them into six companies. He doubled {{the number of}} guards for the wood trains and kept the 50 serviceable horses the fort still possessed – having lost many in Indian raids – saddled and ready to sally <b>from</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dark. On December 19, the Indians attacked another wood train. Carrington sent his most cautious officer, Captain Powell, out of the fort to relieve the wood train with a cavalry company and mounted infantry. He gave explicit orders not to pursue the Indians beyond Lodge Trail Ridge, two miles north of Fort Kearny. Powell returned safely, having followed orders and accomplished his mission. Carrington reemphasized to his soldiers his policy of caution until reinforcements and additional horses and supplies arrived from Fort Laramie. On December 20, Carrington turned down Fetterman's and Captain Brown's proposal that they lead 50 civilian employees in a raid on the Lakota village on the Tongue River, about 50 miles distant.|$|E
25|$|Kyaiktiyo Pagoda or Golden Rock {{has become}} a popular pilgrimage and also tourist attraction. At {{the peak of the}} pilgrimage season, during November to March, an {{atmosphere}} of devotion is witnessed at Kyaikhtiyo pagoda. As the golden rock gleams in different shades <b>from</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dusk (the sight at dawn and at sunset are unique), pilgrims' chants reverberate in the precincts of the shrine. Lighting of candles, meditation and offerings to the Buddha continues throughout the night. Men cross over a bridge across an abyss to affix golden leaves (square in shape) {{on the face of the}} Golden Rock, in deep veneration. However, women are not allowed to touch the rock so cannot cross the bridge. Pilgrims visit the pagoda, from all regions of Myanmar; a few foreign tourists also visit the pagoda. Even disabled persons who are staunch devotees of Buddha visit the pagoda, walking up the track on crutches. Old people, who can not climb, are carried on stretchers by porters to the Pagoda to offer prayers to Buddha. The Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, is a special occasion for pilgrims who visit the shrine. On this day, the platform of the pagoda is lighted with ninety thousand candles as reverential offering to the Lord Buddha. The devotees visiting the pagoda also offer fruits, food and incense to the Buddha.|$|E
