40|$|Insurance firms {{invest a}} {{substantial}} amount of assets in the bond market. In this paper, we study how background risk from insurance operation affects the risk-taking behavior of <b>insurers</b> in their corporate bond investments. We find that <b>insurers</b> with greater background risk tend to have less risky bond portfolios. In addition, for <b>insurers</b> with poor operating performance, background risk and bond portfolio risk are positively correlated, consistent with a gambling incentive induced by poor operating performance. Finally, the effect of background risk is stronger for <b>insurers</b> with tighter financing constraints, such as standalone <b>insurers</b> and <b>insurers</b> with mutual ownership...|$|R

The two seemly contradictory results may be complementary because the outputs and inputs of the two approaches are different.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} pricing {{behaviour}} of nonprofit health <b>insurers</b> in the Dutch social health insurance market. Since for-profit <b>insurers</b> were not allowed in this market, potential spillover effects from the presence of for-profit <b>insurers</b> on the behaviour of nonprofit <b>insurers</b> were absent. Using a panel data set for all health <b>insurers</b> operating in the Dutch social health insurance market over the period 1996 - 2004, we estimate a premium model to determine which factors explain the price setting behaviour of nonprofit health <b>insurers.</b> We find that financial stability rather than profit maximisation offers the best explanation for health plan pricing behaviour. In the presence of weak price competition, health <b>insurers</b> did not set premiums to maximize profits.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of credit default swaps (CDS) {{users in the}} {{insurance}} industry for the sample period from 2001 to 2007, we systematically investigate {{the extent to which}} and why U.

We find that <b>insurers</b> participate in the CDS market as both sellers and buyers, with large banks as their primary counterparties. Their overall CDS transactions have increased in number and in value, but as a share of total transactions, sell positions have declined in recent years, likely due to ―learning effects. ‖ In line with asset-liability management, life <b>insurers</b> tend to write more CDS contracts and hold the contracts for a longer period, compared to property-casualty (PC) <b>insurers.</b> Stock <b>insurers</b> engage in more CDS transactions than mutual <b>insurers</b> do, supporting the managerial risk aversion hypothesis.

Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Green Atlas Shipping and its <b>insurer,</b> Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association, {{sued the}} United States for US$96million, {{claiming}} negligence {{on the part}} of the Coast Guard due to faulty nautical charts. They also alleged failure {{on the part of}} the local bar pilots to advise the ship's crew not to anchor in the area, and that dredging by the United States Army Corps of Engineers had exacerbated the problems with the anchor. The U.S. countersued for US$7million in damages. In 2004, the two sides reached an agreement in which Green Atlas would pay the U.S. US$10.5million to assist with cleanup costs, and the U.S. paid Green Atlas US$4million in settlement of the faulty charts claim. The net result of the settlement was payment of US$6.5million to the U.S. Although this was far less than the damages claimed by the U.S. for environmental cleanup and restoration costs, government officials still saw the settlement as a victory since the shipping company was forced to pay for part of the damage. Some Coos County officials were dissatisfied with the settlement, however, stating that it should have instead been paid to local business owners who were negatively impacted by the closure of the beach.|$|E

Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and for overhead costs. So long as an <b>insurer</b> maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's profit.|$|E
