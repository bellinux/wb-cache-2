40|$|Abstract—The {{degradation}} of electrical insulation in trans-formers {{is more often}} due to thermal stress. In this paper, authors have attempted {{to work out a}} method of assessing the magnitude of temperature and the hottest region in the body of a large transformer with a reasonable degree of accuracy. A theoretical model has been developed based on boundary value problem of heat conduction in transformer winding using finite integral transform techniques. The model requires, in addition to electrical parameters of the transformer, information on the actual design data. The authors believe that this model predicts HST with precision and also indicates a possibility of online data acquisition.

50|$|The <b>bottom</b> product <b>oil</b> {{from the}} main {{fractionator}} contains residual catalyst particles which were not completely removed by the cyclones {{in the top of}} the reactor. For that reason, the <b>bottom</b> product <b>oil</b> is referred to as a slurry oil. Part of that slurry oil is recycled back into the main fractionator above the entry point of the hot reaction product vapors so as to cool and partially condense the reaction product vapors as they enter the main fractionator. The remainder of the slurry oil is pumped through a slurry settler. The <b>bottom</b> <b>oil</b> from the slurry settler contains most of the slurry oil catalyst particles and is recycled back into the catalyst riser by combining it with the FCC feedstock oil. The clarified slurry oil or decant oil is withdrawn from the top of slurry settler for use elsewhere in the refinery, as a heavy fuel oil blending component, or as carbon black feedstock.|$|R

30|$|MGI is a {{single-phase}} {{scheme and}} therefore affected by high gas mobility. The schemes {{have been implemented}} in reservoirs with lower permeability contrast to limit channelling effects. To ensure miscibility, very large depths are required during MGI. From Table  10, it can be observed that the average depth is 3093  m. MGI is also limited by {{the thickness of the}} formations. In very thick formations, gravity override effects may lead to the gas missing some of the <b>bottom</b> <b>oil</b> leading to poor sweep efficiencies. Therefore, the conditions required for MGI schemes are more limited as compared to WAG. This justifies the trends of the shift from MGI towards WAG schemes.|$|R

40|$|An optimal {{strategy}} of Crude Petroleum Distillation Unit (CDU) {{was developed to}} carry out process optimization for maximizing oil production and net profit for the plant.

The input operating variables of the CDU were properties of the crude oil obtained from Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) and manipulated variables such as the flow rates, reflux ratio, temperature and pressure. The objective function of the optimization was to maximize the net profit of the desired products using the SQP method. Variation of <b>Bottom</b> <b>Oil</b> flow rate and Reflux Ratio on Net Profit calculated in Naira per year on a molar flow rate and reflux ratio reflects the expected results which should increase the profit.

30|$|Generally, {{the matrix}} of the FCC {{catalysts}} is everything except active zeolites, including the binder, the clay and functional components. However, during the hydrothermal conditions of commercial FCC unit, {{about half of}} the starting zeolite is destroyed and becomes part of the matrix [13]. The overall matrix composition during use is formed by the solid-state reactions of all the non-zeolitic components. Besides the mechanical properties in fluidized state, the matrix added must to a certain extent improve <b>bottom</b> <b>oil</b> cracking, impart metals resistance or provide specialized functions such as lowering sulfur content in gasoline. Commercially, active components based on specialty aluminas are incorporated into most fluid cracking catalysts for increasing the matrix surface area and matrix acidity necessary to precrack the larger molecules into smaller ones that can then enter the pores of the zeolite. The active components also increase the pore volume of the catalyst and allow faster diffusion of resid molecules. The surface area, pore volume and thermal stability of the alumina are important for coke selectivity, bottoms cracking and metal tolerance, as well as to passivate the nickel and vanadium [14, 15]. In addition, clay may be incorporated as matrix or balance of the formulated catalysts and has certain similar functions such as precracking and mechanical strength.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{experimental}} {{data on the}} mixing time of the continuous phase and power consumption of gas-liquid-liquid dispersions in a mechanically agitated baffled tank are presented. The electrical conductivity method is taken for the measurement of mixing time and the shaft-torque method for power consumption measurement. Tap water is used as the continuous phase, and kerosene and air as the dispersed ones. The effects of probe/tracer injection position, agitation speed, type of impeller, clearance of impeller off tank <b>bottom,</b> <b>oil</b> volume fraction, gas holdup and physical properties of the dispersed liquids on the macro-mixing of the gas-liquid-liquid system have been investigated. The phenomenon of gas-liquid-liquid macro-mixing in a stirred tank is largely {{similar to that of}} liquid-liquid and gas-liquid stirred tanks. Our experiments indicate that the gas-liquid-liquid macro-mixing can be enhanced at higher gas holdups while damped at low gas holdups. Contrary to gas effect, the dispersed oil phase at low holdups increases the macro-mixing intensity but at higher holdups decreases the macro-mixing intensity of the continuous phase. The experimental results show that axial impellers are more energy efficient for gas-liquid-liquid macro-mixing than radial impellers. A simple correlation is developed for predicting the mixing time in gas-liquid-liquid three-phase systems and satisfactory agreement with {{experimental data}} is observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Corrosion is a {{degradation}} of material properties and strength due to {{interactions with the}} environment. This dissertation details the analyses of corrosion effects on two failure modes: ductile fracture and bending strength of membranes, plates and shells. Furthermore, corrosion induced stress or strain concentration effects are incorporated in reliability studies. Annular elastic membrane deformation is studied analytically. Large out-of-plane ship hull deformation in ship grounding or collision is often analyzed by using membrane theory. It {{has been found that}} older ships with corrosion are more susceptible to fracture in grounding or collision. Therefore, corrosion effects on ductile fracture initiation are studied next. Corrosion effects inducing strain localization are revealed by a 3 D model based on the finite element method. The relationship between local and overall strain and model size effects are examined for a rectangular plate under uniaxial and biaxial tension. The ductile fracture of corroded plates is also studied under different pit intensities, distributions and loading conditions. Corrosion also degrades the bending capacity of pipelines. Previous research focused mainly on burst capacity of corroded pipelines. Key points of finite element analyses of corroded pipelines in bending are addressed in detail. An experimental testing program is fully reported and validates the finite element analysis results. Bending strength reduction because of corrosion has been revealed. Secondary effects in the experimental testing are also discussed. Finally, corrosion induced high local stress and strain levels are evaluated by means of stress and strain concentrations. Both analytical and numerical analyses are performed including the use of Neuber’s stress concentration theory. Such studies are further incorporated into the reliability analyses of corroded plates. Structural failure probability and partial safety factors are calculated by considering the randomness of corrosion geometry and of the applied nominal strain.
