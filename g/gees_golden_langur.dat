50|$|Gee's <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus geei), {{or simply}} the <b>golden</b> <b>langur,</b> is an Old World monkey {{found in a}} small region of western Assam, India and in the {{neighboring}} foothills of the Black Mountains of Bhutan. It {{is one of the}} most endangered primate species of India. Long considered sacred by many Himalayan people, the <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> was first brought to the attention of the western world by the naturalist E. P. Gee in the 1950s. In a part of Bhutan, it has hybridised with the capped langur T. pileatus.|$|R

40|$|Gee's <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus geei) is an {{endangered}} colobine primate, endemic to the semi-evergreen and mixed-deciduous forests of Indo-Bhutan border. During {{the last few}} decades, extensive fragmentation has caused severe population decline and local extinction of <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> from several fragments. However, no studies {{are available on the}} impact of habitat fragmentation and the genetic diversity of <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> in the fragmented habitats. The present study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity in the Indian population of <b>golden</b> <b>langur.</b> We sequenced and analyzed around 500 bases of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region-I from 59 fecal samples of wild langur collected from nine forest fragments. Overall, genetic diversity was high (h = 0. 934, π = 0. 0244) and comparable with other colobines. Populations in smaller fragments showed lower nucleotide diversity compared to the larger forest fragments. The median-joining network of haplotypes revealed a genetic structure that corresponded with the geographical distribution. The Aie and Champabati Rivers were found to be a barrier to gene flow between <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> populations. In addition, it also established that T. geei is monophyletic but revealed possible hybridization with capped langur, T. pileatus, in the wild. It is hoped that these findings would result in a more scientific approach towards managing the fragmented populations of this enigmatic species...|$|R
50|$|In August 1954, Gee {{reported}} {{his findings}} to {{an expert at}} the Zoological Society of London, who advised that the <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> might be a new species. In January 1955, Gee also reported his results to the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and, after showing his movies of the <b>golden</b> <b>langurs,</b> suggested that Jamduar {{be included in the}} then-upcoming ZSI-survey of that region. The suggestion received the support of Dr. Sunder Lal Hora, then Director of ZSI, and later that year six specimens of the <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> were collected by the survey party. The following year, Dr. H. Khajuria, a taxonomist who studied the specimens, described the new species naming it Presbystis geei in honour of Gee.|$|R

40|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus geei) is an {{endangered}} endemic species of primate in Bhutan. Conservation {{of this species}} is addressed here through phylogeographic and habitat management tools. I hypothesize that rivers and mountains in Bhutan isolated a population of capped langurs (Trachypithecus pileatus) and that this population later speciated into the morphologically distinct <b>golden</b> <b>langur.</b> Trachypithecus, the genus to which both capped and <b>golden</b> <b>langurs</b> belong, spread north from a paleo-refuge in south China and Semnopithecus (grey langurs) spread east and northward from a refuge in south India. My results show that these two genera both arrived in Bhutan but could not mix since the Sunkosh River and Pelela range form a biogeographic barrier. Likewise, a population of capped langurs isolated from parental populations by rivers speciated into the distinct <b>golden</b> <b>langur.</b> I conducted field surveys covering {{the entire range of}} langurs in Bhutan, confirming the distribution and isolating barriers among the three langurs. Grey <b>langurs</b> and <b>golden</b> <b>langurs</b> are isolated from each other by the Sunkosh River and Black Mountain range in west Bhutan. In the east, the Manas river system (Manas-Mangde-Chamkhar) served as a barrier between <b>golden</b> and capped <b>langurs.</b> However, this barrier has been broken in the last 30 years due to the construction of bridges over the Chamkhar river. A hybrid zone was found and the implications are discussed. A cyt b phylogeny showed the grey langur of Bhutan grouping into a distinct clade with other congenerics of Semnopithecus. The south-Indian clade of grey langurs is more ancient, with the Bhutan and Nepal grey langurs having diverged later. The <b>golden</b> and capped <b>langur</b> from Bhutan grouped with Trachypithecus from South East Asia. Finally, I explore conservation of <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> habitat in Bhutan and estimate available habitat at 3, 089 km 2 and an estimated population of about 6, 000 individuals. I also find that the most viable strategy for conservation of langur habitat is to give ownership of the forests to local people, with monitoring by the Department of Forestry...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> is in Pemberton's 1838 paper which states that [...] "Griffith observed these monkeys near Tongso in Central Bhutan."

However, neither a photograph nor a live or dead specimen was presented at that time. The first reference to the <b>golden</b> <b>langur</b> in print, as an animal of unidentified taxonomic status, was in a 1919 publication that stated: [...] "Pithecus sp?
