5|$|East of Westminster, {{the next}} section of the District's line ran in the new Victoria <b>Embankment</b> built by the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames. The line opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with {{stations}} at Charing Cross (now <b>Embankment),</b> The Temple (now Temple) and Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Embankment</b> is a London Underground {{station in}} the City of Westminster, known by various names during its history. It is served by the Circle, District, Northern and Bakerloo lines. On the Northern and Bakerloo lines, the station is between Waterloo and Charing Cross stations; on the Circle and District lines, it is between Westminster and Temple and is in Travelcard Zone 1. The station has two entrances, one on Victoria <b>Embankment</b> {{and the other on}} Villiers Street. The station is {{adjacent}} to Victoria <b>Embankment</b> Gardens and is close to Charing Cross station, <b>Embankment</b> Pier, Hungerford Bridge, Cleopatra's Needle, the Royal Air Force Memorial, the Savoy Chapel and Savoy Hotel and the Playhouse and New Players Theatres.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1974, {{the station}} was once again renamed Charing Cross <b>Embankment.</b> Then, on 12 September 1976, it became <b>Embankment,</b> so that the merged Strand and Trafalgar Square {{stations}} could be named Charing Cross.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{protection}} against flooding is not only determined by {{the height of the}} <b>embankments,</b> but merely by the strength of the <b>embankments.</b> Most of the weak spots in the <b>embankments</b> collapse {{because of a lack of}} strength with regard to stability or internal erosion rather than be flooded. The key to a better utilization of the existing <b>embankments</b> and thereby reduction of the flood risks is to find ways to determine the very processes which undermine the strength of <b>embankments</b> with a high degree of certainty. The system must ultimately be able to sense weaknesses in tens of thousands of kilometers of <b>embankments.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{authorised}} in 1864, work on {{the bridge}} was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea <b>Embankment,</b> since the bridge's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north {{bank of the river}} had been agreed. While plans for the Chelsea <b>Embankment</b> were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Charing Cross {{railway station}} (also known as London Charing Cross) {{is a central}} London railway {{terminus}} between the Strand and Hungerford Bridge in the City of Westminster. It is the terminus of the South Eastern main line to Dover via Ashford. All trains are operated by Southeastern, which provides the majority of commuter and regional services to south-east London and Kent. It is connected to Charing Cross tube station on the London Underground, and is near to <b>Embankment</b> tube station and <b>Embankment</b> Pier.|$|E
50|$|The Kosi barrage with earth dams across river, afflux bunds and <b>embankments</b> {{above and}} below the river {{confines}} the river to flow within <b>embankments.</b> <b>Embankments</b> on both sides downstream of the barrage with a length of 246 km was constructed to check the westward movement of the river. The <b>embankments</b> have been kept far apart, about 12 to 16 km, to serve as a silt trap.|$|R

5|$|The 48th Battalion {{returned}} to its former positions on the railway <b>embankment</b> {{on the night of}} 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway <b>embankment,</b> and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the <b>embankment.</b> He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway <b>embankment,</b> rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the <b>embankment</b> must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The Victoria <b>Embankment</b> is a {{road and}} river-walk {{on the north}} bank of the River Thames, formed from land {{reclaimed}} during the construction of Joseph Bazalgette's sewerage system in the late 19th century. From 1864 a sequence of public gardens called the Victoria <b>Embankment</b> Gardens was created from this land. Running from north-east to south-west these are called Temple Gardens, the Main Garden, the Whitehall Garden and finally the Ministry of Defence section; the last of these was laid out in 1939–1959. All four gardens contain works of commemorative sculpture and further memorials are located on the river-walk or road itself, making the <b>Embankment</b> {{one of the main}} sites for commemoration in London. Some of these memorials lie outside the borough's boundaries, in the City of London.|$|E
40|$|In {{western part}} of Sweden 80 km of a new {{motorway}} and a new high speed railway will be constructed on soft, high-plastic clay. In {{order to reduce the}} settlements and improve the stability conditions of the <b>embankments,</b> lime-cement columns will be used extensively, i. e. some 9 million linear metres of columns will be installed. Already during the feasibility studies, in year 2000, a large amount of test-columns were installed in order to study their geo mechanical properties (strength, stiffness, permeability). Furthermore 3 full-scale test <b>embankments,</b> founded on lime-cement columns not reaching firm bottom were constructed in year 2001. The test <b>embankments</b> were considered necessary due to lack of reliable design methods for estimating consolidation settlements of <b>embankments</b> founded on floating columns. The <b>embankments</b> were heavily instrumented in order to study the settlements of the <b>embankments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pollinating insect populations, {{essential}} for maintaining wild plant diversity and agricultural productivity, rely on (semi) natural habitats. An increasing human population is encroaching upon and deteriorating pollinator habitats. Thus the population persistence of pollinating insects and their associated ecosystem services may depend upon on man-made novel habitats; however, their importance for ecosystem services is barely understood. We tested if man-made infrastructure (railway <b>embankments)</b> in an agricultural landscape establishes novel habitats that support large populations of pollinators (bees, butterflies, hoverflies) {{when compared to}} typical habitats for these insects, i. e., semi-natural grasslands. We also identified key environmental factors affecting the species richness and abundance of pollinators on <b>embankments.</b> Species richness and abundance of bees and butterflies were higher for railway <b>embankments</b> than for grasslands. The occurrence of bare (non-vegetated) ground on <b>embankments</b> positively affected bee species richness and abundance, but negatively affected butterfly populations. Species richness and abundance of butterflies positively depended on species richness of native plants on <b>embankments,</b> whereas bee species richness was positively affected by species richness of non-native flowering plants. The density of shrubs on <b>embankments</b> negatively affected the number of bee species and their abundance. Bee and hoverfly species richness were positively related to wood cover in a landscape surrounding <b>embankments.</b> This is the first study showing that railway <b>embankments</b> constitute valuable habitat {{for the conservation of}} pollinators in farmland. Specific conservation strategies involving <b>embankments</b> should focus on preventing habitat deterioration due to encroachment of dense shrubs and maintaining grassland vegetation with patches of bare ground...|$|R
5|$|In 1915 a Farman {{aeroplane}} crash-landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction. The {{pilot was}} able to jump from the plane before it crashed, and ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway <b>embankment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began {{over most}} of the area above the platforms. The new buildings were named <b>Embankment</b> Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the <b>Embankment</b> Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1906, the BS (now the Bakerloo line) {{opened with}} its deep-level {{platforms}} beneath and at ninety {{degrees to the}} platforms of the DR. Although an interchange was provided between the two separate railways, the BS named its station differently as <b>Embankment.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1954, {{when the}} Bihar flood policy was first introduced, Bihar had {{approximately}} 160 km of <b>embankments.</b> At this time, the flood-prone {{area in the}} state {{was estimated to be}} 2.5 million hectares. Upon the completion of the system of <b>embankments,</b> 3,465 km of <b>embankments</b> had been constructed and were administered by the Water Resources Department (WRD). However, the amount of flood-prone land increased to 6.89 million hectares by 2004.|$|R

5|$|The halt was {{approached}} {{from the road}} by a path leading up the <b>embankment</b> on which the railway ran. To the west, a bridge carried the line over Northrepps Road from where it proceeded on another <b>embankment</b> before reaching Cromer Tunnel which was built by the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway to take the line under the Great Eastern's Cromer High to Norwich route. Although only 61 yards long, the tunnel is notable as being {{one of only two}} standard gauge tunnels anywhere in Norfolk, the other being Barsham Tunnel on the Wells-on-Sea branch. However, as Barsham Tunnel was opened out before 1912, Cromer Tunnel is actually the only tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The main German {{attack was}} {{to be made by}} the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, a Prussian {{division}} that had been involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the Allies at Albert and Dernancourt, and its morale was still high. The right prong of the attack would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the 9th Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 2nd Tyneside Pioneers. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III/230 RIR would assault the <b>embankment.</b> After the capture of the <b>embankment,</b> the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II/230 RIR was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the plan could only succeed if the <b>embankment</b> was weakly held, and made representations to their brigade commander, but to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{elements}} of a barrage are caissons, <b>embankments,</b> sluices, turbines, and ship locks. Sluices, turbines, and ship locks are housed in caissons (very large concrete blocks). <b>Embankments</b> seal a basin where it is not sealed by caissons.|$|R
40|$|Thick {{deposits}} of soft ground such as soft marine and estuarine clay are widespread {{throughout the world}} especially along deltas and coastal regions. Such soils possess poor geotechnical properties such as high natural moisture content (close to liquid limit), high compressibility & low shear strength. <b>Embankments</b> on such soft ground commonly adopted {{for the construction of}} highways, rai l- ways and airport runways are often affected by edge stability and long term settlement. The earliest meth od or technique employed for stable construction of <b>embankments</b> on soft ground was the use of ve r- tical drains combined with stage construction. However, with growing demand for rapid construction and associated difficulty in meeting the project deadline, column - supported <b>embankments</b> have emerged as an appropriate technical solution. In addition, geosynthetics in the form of basal reinforcement are exte n- sively being used at present for <b>embankments</b> on soft ground, to improve the bearing capacity, reduce di f- ferential settlement and prevent slope instability. A broad over - view of <b>embankments</b> on soft ground is presented in the present paper. The review is complemented by six well documented case histories of <b>embankments</b> constructed over soft ground using diff erent geotechnical techniques. The case histories presented could help the geotechnical community to understand and evaluate the benefits of the tec h- niques for their adoption for the construction of <b>embankments</b> over soft ground...|$|R
