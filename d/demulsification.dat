50|$|Electrohydrodynamic droplet {{deformation}} is {{a phenomenon}} that occurs when liquid droplets suspended in a second immiscible liquid are exposed to an oscillating electric field. Under these conditions, the droplet will periodically deform between prolate and oblate ellipsoidal shapes. The characteristic frequency and magnitude of the deformation is determined by a balance of electrodynamic, hydrodynamic, and capillary stresses acting on the droplet interface. This phenomenon has been studied extensively both mathematically and experimentally because of the complex fluid dynamics that occur. Characterization and modulation of electrodynamic droplet deformation {{is of particular interest}} for engineering applications because of the growing need to improve the performance of complex industrial processes(e.g. two-phase cooling, crude oil <b>demulsification).</b> The primary advantage of using oscillatory droplet deformation to improve these engineering processes is that the phenomenon does not require sophisticated machinery or the introduction of heat sources. This effectively means that improving performance via oscillatory droplet deformation is simple and in no way diminishes the effectiveness of the existing engineering system.|$|E

The model oil is a mixture n-heptane/toluene (70 / 30 % wt.) with 1 % wt. of Span® 83 as a surfactant.

The superior <b>demulsification</b> performances of Aliquat® 336 with respect to [Omim][PF 6] were related to the greater molecular weight and more hydrophobic character of its cation, likely able to induce a faster desorption of the surfactant at the w/o interface and consequently promoting water droplet coalescence. Moreover, the kinetic <b>demulsification</b> data were successfully interpreted by an empirical pseudo-first order model.

The SDS-PAGE profile of the polypeptides in the cream layer showed that the subunits of beta-conglycinin and glycinin were fully degraded after 2 h of extraction. Only small residual polypeptides remained but these were still sufficient to form a multilayer interface capable of providing stability to the cream.
