The {{purpose of the study was}} the development of methods for nondestructive testing of semiconductor wafers based on the determination of electrophysical properties of the silicon-silicon dioxide interface and their spatial distribution over wafer’s surface using non-contact probe <b>electrometry</b> methods. Traditional C-V curve analysis and scanning Kelvin probe method were used to characterize silicon- silicon dioxide interface. The samples under testing were silicon wafers of KEF 4. 5 and KDB 12 type (orientation , diameter 100 mm). Probe <b>electrometry</b> results revealed uniform spatial distribution of wafer’s surface potential after its preliminary rapid thermal treatment. Silicon-silicon dioxide electric potential values were also higher after treatment than before it. This potential growth correlates with the drop in interface charge density. At the same time local changes in surface potential indicate changes in surface layer structure. Probe <b>electrometry</b> results qualitatively reflect changes of interface charge density in silicon-silicon dioxide structure during its technological treatment. Inhomogeneities of surface potential distribution reflect inhomogeneity of damaged layer thickness and can be used as a means for localization of interface treatment defects. </p...|$|E

Control of surface defects of aluminum and its alloys was performed with a scanning Kelvin probe technique. The results of scanning were plotted in a form of contact potential difference (CPD) distribution map. Additionally, a histogram of CPD values distribution and statistical characteristics including the expectation of CPD mean value and histogram half-width were calculated either for the whole distribution or for each individual mode in a case of multimodal distribution. The spatial CPD distribution of A 99 aluminum and AMG- 2 alloy surfaces after electrochemical polishing and diamond finishing was studied. An additional study was held for AMG- 2 surface after the formation of 30 microns thick specific nanostructured alumina oxide surface layer. Higher quality surfaces have characterized as more homogeneous distribution of the physical properties (at half-width distribution histogram). Surfaces with higher mechanical strength and overall better mechanical properties found to have lower CPD values that correspond to higher electron work function and surface energy. The presence of the second mode in the CPD distribution histogram indicates the significant proportion of defect areas on the sample surface. Analysis of visualized CPD distribution maps using defined criteria allows detecting and characterizing such defects as residual stress areas, areas with reduced microhardness, surface contamination spots, corrosion defects. This provides the possibility of rapid nondestructive testing and diagnostic of precision metal surfaces, in particular the starting substrates for sensitive elements and sensory devices manufacture.  </p...|$|E

An {{analysis of the}} results obtained electrometrically shows that this electrogenic phase is observed only after even-numbered flashes. The sensitivity of this phase to o-phenanthroline, the flash-number dependence of its amplitude and the decrease of its rise-time with decreasing pH indicate that it {{is due to the}} dismutation of Q−A and Q−B and to subsequent protonation of a doubly reduced ubiquinone QB molecule. The phase of the carotenoid bandshift with τ∼ 0. 1 ms (the so-called phase II) was shown to be sensitive to o-phenanthroline, with its rise-time decreasing with decreasing pH.
