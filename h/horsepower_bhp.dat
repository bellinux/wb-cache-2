2500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, the Italian Line lost many {{of their}} fleet {{including}} their two super liners, SS Rex and SS Conte di Savoia, so they planned to build two 27,000 GRT ocean liners for post war service to replace them. Giulio Cesare and Augustus were impression of power and beauty with fat and round bows, curved superstructures, modern masts, enormous funnel, and graceful sterns. Her external beauty restrained to the most canvassing standards with pleasingly sculptured bridge wings, an evocative nape at the aft funnel base, and even a trademark ventilator aft of the funnel that earned nicknamed the [...] "robot" [...] for its extraordinary shape. These two ships {{were one of the}} Italian post war ships. The ship had twin 12-cylinder Fiat diesel engines, generating 24,000 base <b>horsepower</b> (<b>bhp)</b> that drove her twin screws at a service speed of 21 knots. Both ships were designed to sail on the Italy-South America route, run with three classes. Both ships' interior were designed to have full air conditioning and swimming pools for each of three classes to make the ships looked like a luxurious hotel and to be the symbol of modern technology.|$|E

The modified V12 was 4 in longer than the 250TR's 3-litre Colombo engines, necessitating the new frame to suit the engine and {{to comply with the}} new regulations. The frame was 6.3 cm longer to the 250TR's for better balance, strengthened to accommodate the increased power and torque and accommodated the TRI/61's independent coil-spring suspension system.|$|R

50|$|The bike offers four {{engine power}} modes, Sport, Touring, Urban and Enduro. Riders can change power modes with the {{motorcycle}} underway {{by using the}} turn-signal cancel button. Sport and Touring modes provide the full 150 bhp with the Touring mode providing a softer throttle response. Urban and Enduro reduce <b>horsepower</b> to 100 <b>bhp</b> and provide different levels of ABS and traction control accordingly.

5000|$|In Europe, the DIN {{standard}} {{tested the}} engine fitted with all ancillaries and exhaust system {{as used in}} the car. The older American standard (SAE gross horsepower, referred to as bhp) used an engine without alternator, water pump, and other auxiliary components such as power steering pump, muffled exhaust system, etc., so the figures were higher than the European figures for the same engine. The newer American standard (referred to as SAE net <b>horsepower,</b> not as <b>bhp)</b> tests an engine with all the auxiliary components (see [...] "Engine power test standards" [...] below).|$|R
50|$|Indicated {{horsepower}} was {{a better}} measure of engine power than nominal horsepower (nhp) because it took account of steam pressure. But unlike later measures such as shaft horsepower (shp) and brake <b>horsepower</b> (<b>bhp),</b> {{it did not take}} into account power losses due to the machinery internal frictional losses, such as a piston sliding within the cylinder, plus bearing friction, transmission and gear box friction, etc.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1972 model year, American {{automakers}} rated and advertised their {{engines in}} brake <b>horsepower,</b> <b>bhp,</b> {{which was a}} version of brake horsepower called SAE gross horsepower because it was measured according to SAE standards (J245 and J1995) that call for a stock test engine without accessories (such as dynamo/alternator, radiator fan, water pump), and sometimes fitted with long tube test headers {{in lieu of the}} OEM exhaust manifolds. The atmospheric correction standards for barometric pressure, humidity and temperature for testing were relatively idealistic.|$|E
50|$|A popular {{modification}} saw {{owners of}} the first GK model removing the air-filter resonator box. The resonator box was located {{directly in front of}} the front left hand side wheel, behind the fender. This allowed for a greater airflow to the air filter, gaining a minimal increase of brake <b>horsepower</b> (<b>bhp).</b> Hyundai, seeking cost cuts, adopted this modification for 2004+ models. Hyundai also released a new color for their 2006 Tiburon called Regatta blue, between Tidal Wave blue and Midnight blue, which is Metallic. This color is also available for the 2007 Elantra and Tiburon.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to install a production-ready, {{state-of-the-art}} engine control system on the Mack E 7 G natural gas engine to improve efficiency and lower exhaust emissions. In addition, the power rating was increased from 300 brake <b>horsepower</b> (<b>bhp)</b> to 325 bhp. The emissions targets were oxides of nitrogen plus nonmethane hydrocarbons of less than 2. 5 g/bhp-hr and particulate matter of less than 0. 05 g/bhp-hr on 99 % methane. Vehicle durability and field testing were also conducted. Further development of this engine should include efficiency improvements and oxides of nitrogen reductions...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{standard}} {{practice in the}} field of industrial refrigeration to design and operate systems with little regard toward part-load performance. This approach is understandable, whether viewed {{from the standpoint of the}} design engineer, plant manager or chief operator. As long a space temperature and production rates are maintained during peak periods, the refrigeration system is viewed as operating "correctly". The truth is, most refrigeration systems spend some, if not most operating hours at reduced capacity. Screw compressors back off slide valves, evaporator coils utilize back-pressure regulators (BPRs) or liquid solenoids, and condensers cycle fans. Unfortunately, these control methods do not provide the maximum attainable reduction in brake <b>horsepower</b> (<b>BHP)</b> as refrigeration capacity is reduced. This paper will discuss the application of variable speed drive (VSD, also called "variable frequency drive", "adjustable speed drive", "inverter", or simply "freq. drive") technology to capacity control of screw compressors, evaporator fans, and condenser fans. As shown through theory and case study, speed control of these components provides maximum flexibility, control and energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This study offers {{comprehensive}} {{details on}} the use of bio-fuel as a viable and alternative source of energy. The bio-fuel was prepared from vegetable oil, i. e., mustard oil and tested in a diesel engine in both pure form and as a diesel blend. The mustard oil blend proportions were 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % and named as bio-diesel blends B 20, B 30, B 40 and B 50. A fuel-testing laboratory determined the properties of the pure mustard oil fuel and its blends, i. e., density, viscosity, dynamic viscosity, carbon residue, flash point, fire point and calorific value. An assessment of engine performance, i. e., brake <b>horsepower</b> (<b>bhp),</b> brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc), brake thermal efficiency (bte) and brake mean effective pressure (bmep) etc., was carried out for pure diesel, pure mustard and the blends, both in laboratory conditions and under British Standard (BS) conditions. Finally, an analysis and comparison was made {{of the effects of the}} various fuels on the different engine properties...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, An Ultra High Injection Pressure (UHIP) fueling {{method has}} been {{demonstrated}} by Caterpillar Fuel Systems - Product Development, demonstrating ability to deliver U. S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 Final diesel engine emission performance with greatly reduced emissions handling components on the engine, such as without NOx reduction after-treatment and with only a through-flow 50 % effective diesel particulate trap (DPT). They have shown this capability using multiple multi-cylinder engine tests of an Ultra High Pressure Common Rail (UHPCR) fuel system with higher than traditional levels of CEGR and an advanced injector nozzle design. The system delivered better atomization of the fuel, for more complete burn, to greatly reduce diesel particulates, while CEGR or high efficiency NOx reduction after-treatment handles the NOx. With the reduced back pressure of a traditional DPT, and with the more complete fuel burn, the system reduced levels of fuel consumption by 2. 4 % for similar delivery of torque and horsepower over the best Tier 4 Interim levels of fuel consumption in the diesel power industry. The challenge is to manufacture the components in high-volume production that can withstand the required higher pressure injection. Production processes must be developed to increase the toughness of the injector steel to withstand the UHIP pulsations and generate near perfect form and finish in the sub-millimeter size geometries within the injector. This project resulted in two developments in 2011. The first development was a process and a machine specification by which a high target of compressive residual stress (CRS) can be consistently imparted to key surfaces of the fuel system to increase the toughness of the steel, and {{a demonstration of the}} feasibility of further refinement of the process for use in volume production. The second development was the demonstration of the feasibility of a process for imparting near perfect, durable geometry to these same feature surfaces to withstand the pulsating UHIP diesel injection without fatigue failure, through the expected life of the fuel system's components (10, 000 hours for the pump and common rail, 5000 hours for the injector). The potential to Caterpillar of this fueling approach and the overall emissions reduction system is the cost savings of the fuel, the cost savings of not requiring a full emissions module and other emissions hardware, and the enabling of the use of biodiesel fuel due to the reduced dependency on after-treatment. A proprietary production CRS generating process was developed to treat the interior of the sac-type injector nozzle tip region (particularly for the sac region). Ninety-five tips passed ultra high pulsed pressure fatigue testing with no failures assignable to treated surfaces or materials. It was determined that the CRS impartation method does not weaken the tip internal seat area. Caterpillar Fuel Systems - Product Development accepts that the CRS method initial production technical readiness level has been established. A method to gage CRS levels in production was not yet accomplished, but it is believed that monitoring process parameters call be used to guarantee quality. A precision profiling process for injector seat and sac regions {{has been shown to be}} promising but not yet fully confirmed. It was demonstrated that this precision profiling process can achieve form and geometry to well under an aggressively small micron peak-to-valley and that there are no surface flaws that approach an even tighter micron peak-to-valley tolerance. It is planned to purchase machines to further develop and move the process towards production. The system is targeted towards the high-power diesel electric power generators and high-power diesel marine power generators, with displacement from 20 liters to 80 liters and with power from 800 brake <b>horsepower</b> (<b>BHP)</b> to 3200 BHP (0. 6 megawatts to 2. 4 megawatts). However, with market adoption, this system has the potential to meet EPA exhaust standards for all diesel engines nine liters and up, or 300 BHP to 3200 BHP (0. 2 megawatts to 2. 4 megawatts). Expected energy savings from improved fuel economy alone in Caterpillar engines using this approach is above 250 trillion British Thermal Units per year (BTU/yr) by 2020. Further fuel savings will be realized due to the reduced weight of the reduced emissions hardware on Caterpillar engines and machines. Enabling the use of biodiesel and other renewable fuels will accelerate the utilization of such fuels, to reduce US dependence on foreign oil and to create above 50, 000 new US jobs by 2020, pushing estimated use to two to three billion gallons by that time frame. Biodiesel has been shown to actually REDUCE CO 2 in the air by United States Department of Energy (USDOE) Reports, so this thrust will make major impact toward US contribution to reduction of green house gas emissions world-wide...|$|E
