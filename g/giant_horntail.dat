50|$|The <b>giant</b> {{woodwasp}} or <b>horntail,</b> Urocerus gigas, {{has a long}} ovipositor, which {{with its}} black and yellow colouration make it a good mimic of a hornet. Despite the alarming appearance, the insect cannot sting. The eggs are laid in the wood of conifers such as Douglas fir, pine, spruce, and larch. The larvae eat tunnels in the wood, causing economic damage.|$|R
