Abstract. – Fracture mechanical properties of hard cellular solids (porous materials) with the Young modulus E larger than 3000 MPa {{have been well}} understood; scaling relations between fracture mechanical quantities and porosity are established, which {{can be explained by}} a theory based on the geometrical parameters of a cellular solid. In this study, we obtain experimentally the fracture energy of a very soft polyethylene foam with E around 1 MPa. We find scaling laws different from those for hard foams, which can be understood by considerations independent of the structural parameters of foams. Introduction. – Cellular solid structures are widely found in nature (cork, balsa, coral, etc.) and in everyday life (bread, potato chips, industrial materials such as <b>styrene</b> <b>foam,</b> and so on). Accordingly, the mechanical properties of cellular solids or porous materials have been widely studied.

Two types of core configurations, with identical areal density, were subjected to the shock wave loading.

The method to calculate the incident and reflected energies of the shock wave, as well as the deformation energy of the specimen, were proposed based on the shock wave pressure profiles and the high speed deflection images that were obtained. The experimental results showed that configuration 1 outperformed configuration 2 in regards to their blast resistance. Significant core material compression was observed in configuration 1, while in configuration 2 the core layers disintegrated and the front skin (blast side) fractured into two pieces along the midsection. The estimated energies were then calculated for both configurations. The total energy difference between the incident and reflected energies was almost identical, even though the deformation energy for configuration 2 was larger...|$|R

Water quality in such closed watef area is changed by outside disturbances (wind, solar heat, etc.).

Such closed water area, on one hand, has ecosystem diversity. Especially in warm climate areas, various water plants grow by the shore of the closed water area. But it is considered that the water plants which cut a part of wind {{play an important role in}} the turbulent structures. Hence the experiments to clarify the relationship between the water plants and the turbulent structures were performed. In the experiments, the water plants imitated by a <b>styrene</b> <b>foam</b> were set afloat in a laboratory wind-wave tank. And it was divided four types by the covered rate of the imitated water plants to compare.

A research program has been started to develop efficient passive condensers to harvest dew {{and use it as}} a supplementary source of drinking water which is scarce in the area. A passive condenser is a device that cools itself at night by radiative exchange with clear sky. Under favorable conditions condenser may become colder than the dew point of surrounding humid air and attract condensation. Condensers need to be inexpensive, compact and high yielding.

This alga, possessing chlorophyll d as the major photosynthetic pigment, is an important organism for elucidating various biological questions such as the mechanism of chlorophyll diversity {{and the evolution of}} photosynthesis. However, the proportion of photosynthetic pigments changes on serial subcultures on maintenance under a fluorescent lamp, a light condition that differs from that of the original habitat. Cryopreservation has the capacity to ensure the maintenance of the physiological and genetic stability of A. marina.

3000|$|Foaming is the {{creation}} of tiny bubbles into a polymer structure using gas penetration and solution as the physical blowing agent into the polymer matrix, and it is also {{the creation}} of a thermodynamic instability by reducing pressure and increasing temperature. Microcellular foams are defined as foams with a cell diameter lower than 10  μm and cell density more than 1010  cells/cm 3 (Jacobs et al. 2008). The cell radius of microcellular foams is less than the natural critical crack of a polymer; therefore, polymer weight can be reduced without having a negative effect on mechanical properties compared to traditional foams. Martini and Suh at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1981 introduced microcellular foams as a means {{to reduce the amount of}} plastic materials without sacrificing their functionality (Martini 1981). Batch microcellular foaming contains a saturated sample under non-reaction gas pressure in reservoir pressure until equilibrium gas concentration is achieved. Then the pressure is discharged, and samples are immersed in hot oil with temperatures approaching the transition temperature of the polymer. There is no doubt that foam expansion continues until polymer viscosity increases or all available supercritical fluid is used. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen (N 2) are the most common supercritical fluids in the microcellular foaming process used as physical blowing agents. They are eco-friendly, non-toxic, cheap, and abundant. However, the permeability and solubility of CO 2 in the polymers are higher than those of N 2, and the supercritical parameters of CO 2 are easily available (Tc[*]=[*] 31.1  °C, [...] Pc[*]=[*] 73.8  bar) (James et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2007). Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is an amorphous [...] [...] [...] co-polymer wherein acrylonitrile brings chemical resistance and heat stability, butadiene brings toughness, and styrene provides good processing characteristics. The foamed polymers’ structure including nanoparticles as nanofillers has been improved with reduced flammability properties, reduced gas permeability, increased strength-to-weight ratio, increased impact resistance, long fatigue life, and better thermal and electrical insulation properties compared to unfoamed polymers. Nanofillers can be used as a nucleation agent in the gas foaming process, but they are also known to promote the heterogeneous nucleation of extra cells during foaming; hence, polymer/clay nanocomposite foams are usually characterized by a small cell size and high cell density (James et al. 2005). Okamoto et al. used organically modified layered silicates as nucleating agents to produce polypropylene (pp)/clay composites (Okamoto et al. 2001). Yeh et al. studied the effect of dispersion capability of organoclay on cellular structure and physical properties of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA)/clay nanocomposite foams and demonstrated that the well-dispersed clay particles in the polymer matrix cause an increase in cell density, a decrease in cell size, and also an increase in mechanical strength of PMMA/clay nanocomposite foams (Yeh et al. 2009). Mamaghani Shishavan et al. studied the mechanical properties and composition capability of ABS/PMMA/clay nanocomposites and showed that ABS and clay nanoparticles with PMMA could be compounded and their mechanical properties are stronger than those of the pure ABS (Mamaghani Shishavan et al. 2014). Urbanczyk et al. studied the batch <b>foaming</b> of <b>Styrene</b> Acrylonitrile/clay nanocomposites with CO 2 gas and illustrated that adding nanoparticles significantly increases the cell density, from 8.5 [*]×[*] 1011  cells/cm 3 for pure SAN foam, to 3.6 [*]×[*] 1012  cells/cm 3 for the intercalated nanocomposite and 7.6 [*]×[*] 1013  cells/cm 3 for SAN containing the exfoliated clay. Therefore, the nanoclay clearly acts as an effective heterogeneous nucleating agent (Urbanczyk et al. 2010). Papers were also found on ABS foams which were produced by supercritical fluid CO 2. An article by Murray et al. has examined batch foaming conditions of ABS with CO 2 (Murray et al. 2000). Kamran et al. studied the mechanical and microstructural properties of microcellular foams of ABS composites with CO 2 (Beydokhti et al. 2006).|$|R
