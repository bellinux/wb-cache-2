5|$|A Balloon Site, Coventry (1942) – shows a team {{of women}} {{hoisting}} a barrage balloon <b>into</b> <b>position</b> with the chimneys of industrial Coventry in the background surrounding the spire of Coventry Cathedral. WAAC commissioned the work as a propaganda tool to recruit women for Balloon Command, and Knight's composition succeeds in making the work appear both heroic and glamorous.|$|E
5|$|Lee did not issue {{orders for}} the attack until 11:00a.m. About noon, General Anderson's {{advancing}} troops were discovered by General Sickles' outpost guard and the Third Corps–upon which Longstreet's First Corps was to form–did not get <b>into</b> <b>position</b> until 1:00p.m.|$|E

50|$|One of Asterix's most {{recognizable}} features is his winged helmet, its wings often falling <b>into</b> <b>positions</b> that match his expressions. It closely resembles the winged helmet featured on packets of Gauloises cigarettes.|$|R
5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|The modular {{construction}} principle even {{extended to the}} restrooms of the tower: they arrived on the building site as completely enclosed modules, ready to be fixed <b>into</b> <b>position</b> on each floor and have external services connected.|$|E
5|$|The three {{sections}} of decking were assembled {{on the broad}} central reservation of Princess Road, and were craned <b>into</b> <b>position</b> over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The decking was temporarily supported by trestles until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before being lifted <b>into</b> <b>position</b> during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven over the bridge in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|E

5|$|To the Allies, the Belgian {{failure to}} hold onto its eastern frontiers (they {{were thought to be}} capable of holding out for two weeks), was a disappointment. The Allied Chiefs of Staff had sought to avoid an {{encounter}} mobile battle without any strong fixed defences to fall back on and hoped Belgian resistance would last long enough for a defensive line to be established. Nevertheless, a brief lull fell on the Dyle front on 11 May which enabled the Allied armies to get <b>into</b> <b>position</b> by the time the first major assault was launched the following day. Allied cavalry had moved <b>into</b> <b>position</b> and infantry and artillery were reaching the front more slowly, by rail. Although unaware of it, the First Allied army Group and the Belgian Army outnumbered and outgunned Walther von Reichenau's German 6th Army.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get <b>into</b> <b>position</b> {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E

5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target.

5|$|On 20 July 1913, {{while making}} an {{intermediate}} stop in Hoboken, New Jersey, Breslau was being warped <b>into</b> <b>position</b> when an electrical {{fire broke out}} at the pier where she was docking. Breslau made an emergency departure into the Hudson River, during which time the blaze was extinguished. The ship was not damaged {{and none of the}} 1,500 passengers aboard were injured in the incident. The ship left for Philadelphia on schedule the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1975, CINCPAC {{placed the}} 31st Marine Amphibious Unit on 96-hour alert {{to move the}} {{evacuation}} fleet <b>into</b> <b>position</b> off Kampong Som (previously Sihanoukville) in the Gulf of Thailand {{for the implementation of}} Operation Eagle Pull. On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf of Thailand.|$|E
50|$|During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians {{refer to}} this state as the Byzantine Empire.

50|$|The {{decline of}} the Lombard state had been swift and the changes wrought in Italy by the Frankish conquest were great.

5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the Free State force, {{who remained in}} cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to little effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers moved a Krupp gun <b>into</b> <b>position</b> which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} with {{upgrading}} the Wakefield branch was {{the dimensions of}} George Leather's cast iron aqueduct over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. Structural analysis showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete aqueduct was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a little further upstream. The complete structure was then pushed <b>into</b> <b>position</b> by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} railroad {{bridge was}} replaced by a swing bridge in 1879 that, along with the Glasgow Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River, was one of the United States' first all steel railroad bridges. This bridge was constructed from Bessemer steel, which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898. The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated <b>into</b> <b>position,</b> allowing the old structure to be removed and the new one put in place in 27½ hours on March 13 and March 14, 1898.|$|E

5|$|Three {{infantry}} {{divisions of}} the XXI Corps began moving their units <b>into</b> <b>position</b> on the coastal plain on 7 December. The 75th Division {{was on the right}} with the 54th (East Anglian) Division in the centre and the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the coast. Infantry from the 162nd (East Midland) Brigade, relieved the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in the front line on 11 December and the mounted riflemen, who had been heavily involved in the earlier attempt to capture the Nahr el Auja, moved back to bivouac near Ayun Kara.|$|E
5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang <b>into</b> <b>position</b> after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E
5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines <b>into</b> <b>position,</b> or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its outside was then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel, and then hot coal tar coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was lowered <b>into</b> <b>position,</b> taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to lift them. The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E
50|$|Henry, besides {{promoting}} his Norman allies <b>into</b> <b>positions</b> {{of power in}} the north, was also careful to install some local lords into secondary roles. For example, two Anglo-Saxon northerners, probably from Yorkshire, were Æthelwold, who became the first Bishop of Carlisle, and Forn of Greystoke. Waltheof of Allerdale was a Northumbrian.|$|R
