2500|$|From 1902 the Universal Military Saddle was {{manufactured}} with a fixed tree, broad {{panels to}} spread the load, and initially a <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> in three sizes. [...] The advantage of this saddle was its lightness, ease of repair and comfort for horse and rider. From 1912 the saddle was built on an adjustable tree and consequently only one size was needed. [...] Its advantage over the fixed tree 1902 pattern was its ability to maintain a better fit on the horse’s back as the horse gained or lost weight. [...] This saddle was made using traditional methods and featured a seat blocked from sole leather, which maintained its shape well. [...] Military saddles were fitted with metal staples and dees to carry a sword, spare horse shoes and other equipment.|$|E

50|$|Gullet: The {{space between}} {{the bars of the}} saddle which {{provides}} clearance for the horse's spine so the saddle does not place pressure on it. The gullet width of the saddle is dictated by the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> of the tree. In some models, the angle (and thus the width) of the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> can be adjusted on an individual saddle by use of interchangeable elements. Though imprecise terminology, the gap between the stuffed panels is colloquially referred to as the gullet.|$|E

Bulkeley, proprietor of the Penmon quarries, the hall is modelled on the Temple of Castor and Pollux in Rome. Some limestone was used in its construction and fossils {{of plants and animals}} are visible. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the <b>front</b> <b>arches</b> were glazed to create an entrance foyer.|$|R
5000|$|Typical {{features}} {{of the more important}} buildings included massive round piers and smaller engaged columns.9th century Abbasid architecture had foliate decorations on arches, pendant vaults, muqarnas vaults and polychrome interlaced spandrels that became identified as typical of [...] "Islamic" [...] architecture, although these forms may have their origins in Sassanian architecture. Thus the <b>fronting</b> <b>arch</b> of the Arch of Ctesiphon was once decorated with a lobed molding, a form copied in the palace of al-Ukhaidar.|$|R

Some are fixed through the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> of the tree for greater strength.|$|E
50|$|Louisiana Public Library is a {{historic}} Carnegie library building located at Louisiana, Pike County, Missouri. It was designed by the noted architectural form Mauran, Russell, and Garden and built in 1905. It is a one-story, Late Gothic Revival style rock-faced, cut limestone building on a partially exposed basement. It measures approximately 50 feet by 40 feet and features a <b>front</b> <b>arched</b> doorway with batten doors, eyebrow windows, and stepped parapet. It was constructed with a $10,000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation.|$|R

50|$|On 9 June 2005 workers began {{demolishing}} the Egyptian-styled façades. Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills {{started the}} demolition by tearing down the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> with a front-end loader. The land {{has since been}} entirely cleared of all Nuwaubian structures and the property was sold to a developer, who has since built a log style hunting lodge on the property. The property is owned by White Oak Plantation as of 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The {{points of}} the saddle tree at the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> should give a full three-fingers width of {{clearance}} behind the shoulder blade when the horse is standing straight, or a hand's width with the foreleg fully extended. This {{can be done by}} having someone on the ground pull each of the horse's forelegs as far forward as possible, holding the leg at the knee, while another person checks the shoulder blade.|$|E
5000|$|A saddle must be {{measured}} for width, length, and <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> height (clearance over the withers). In ideal circumstances, the saddle is tried {{on the horse}} prior to purchase, or is purchased with a return option {{if it does not}} fit. When saddle shopping, or if having a saddle custom-made, one method of sizing the horse is known as a [...] "wither tracing." [...] To create this, an artist's flexicurve or a piece of coat hanger wire is placed up over the withers about two inches behind the horse's shoulder blade, then shaped to fit across the withers. The shape is then traced onto heavy paper or cardboard. An average horse can be fitted with just this measurement by comparing the angle of the wither tracing to the angle of the piping at the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> of the saddle. However, horses with an unusual shape are measured in three locations, the second measurement approximately two inches behind the first one, and the last measurement nine inches behind the withers. Often for accurate measurements, a professional saddle fitter may need to be consulted.|$|E
50|$|The iron-framed building, {{built by}} Aaron T. Demarest, is four stories high and {{originally}} had a stone-clad base. The exterior brick is buff-colored and has terra cotta medallions and panels that accent the façade. The three-story arched openings {{are separated by}} brick pilasters {{on the front of}} the building. The architects designed these arches with windows so the interior's showrooms were illuminated with plenty of light. The original two-story windows were cast metal bays built within the building's <b>front</b> <b>arches.</b> This Beaux-Arts architecture style building with large arches is said to resemble Carnegie Hall.|$|R

5000|$|The crown itself {{departed}} from the standard style of British crowns, and was more akin to European royal crowns. It was less upright than the norm in British crowns, and more squat in design, with an unprecedented eight half-arches. Its <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> joined a jewelled cross into which was set the Koh-i-Noor diamond. As with the later Crown of Queen Mary and Crown of Queen Elizabeth, the arches were detachable, allowing the crown to be worn as a circlet.|$|E
50|$|In some country parishes {{in large}} sparsely-inhabited districts, it was {{expedient}} to build hearse-houses against the churches {{for the convenience}} of keeping a hearse {{for the use of the}} parishioners; one was built against the shady north side of the chancel of Elsdon's church. The rectory house is an old tower with a circular staircase at one corner. Its lowest story is spanned with one large arch. On its <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> are the arms of the Hunfranvilles, with an inscription beneath.|$|E
50|$|The almshouses were {{originally}} built on Richmond Hill. By the 19th century {{they had become}} dilapidated. They were rebuilt in 1851 in The Vineyard, Richmond next to Queen Elizabeth's Almshouses and the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> and gateway from the previous site {{are believed to have}} been incorporated in the rebuilding. The new site was provided by James Ewing, owner of the neighbouring Downe House, Richmond Hill. He also paid for their rebuilding, in white brick to a Jacobean design by Thomas Little, receiving the old almshouse site in exchange.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{structure}} of Lee High School is notable for its beige bricks and top floor off-white stucco. It is handsomely framed by four gabled transepts, {{which in turn}} are framed by ground-to-roof stacks of alternating small and large cornerstones. The top floor stucco of the four transepts feature a coat of arms, in which a central figure reaches for a star on the left, while a tree occupies the right side. Also unique are the two <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> doorways, which sport an impressive amount of [...] "radiating" [...] stonework.|$|E
50|$|The {{front is}} {{characterized}} by a large chrome grille with lobes at the top. The lighting is placed at the ends of the <b>front</b> <b>arch.</b> Bumpers are characterized by the presence of a coating applied to the fascia. Above the air intakes are the fog lights (in versions of the tip). A prominent rib runs along the sides. The glazing frames are chrome plated versions of the tip. The tail has vertically-oriented headlamps that culminate in the bumper and are integrated into the fenders. The rear tailgate has a small size that limits visibility, embellished by chromed fascia above the license plate.|$|E
5000|$|The Castle {{is built}} from pre-cast black copper-slag blocks from Reeve's foundry at Crew's Hole. Designed in Gothic Revival style, the {{building}} is symmetrical in plan with crenellated circular towers at each corner that link two-storey blocks to form a square courtyard. The front and back blocks have larger crenellated entrance towers with moulded archways through. Above the <b>front</b> <b>arch</b> is a blank panel with ogee head and a two-centre arch on the second storey with perpendicular tracery. The ranges to {{each side of the}} entrance have two windows with Y-tracery below a white string course and white carved inset panels. At the top of the ranges are light-coloured battlements with sunken panels.|$|E

5000|$|In 1994 Peugeot {{introduced}} the Rallye to the UK market, it {{was available in}} two colours (500 white, 250 yellow) and was essentially a re-badged XT. It came equipped with black cloth seats embroidered with the Peugeot-Talbot Sport logo, the Peugeot-Talbot sports colours behind the <b>front</b> <b>arches</b> and over the back arches, {{as well as the}} same markings on the grill and tailgate of its European brother. It was powered by an iron-blocked 1360 cc TU3.2 engine with the same twin-choke solex carburettor found on the earlier XS engine. It produced [...] and achieved 107 mi/h km/h with a 0-60 mph of 11.7 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Its current front {{building}} {{opened in}} 1916. It {{was designed by}} Lescher & Kibbey, Phoenix architects who [...] "dominated the design of educational buildings in Arizona". The Neoclassical Revival structure incorporates elements of the Spanish Revival style popular in the region. A one-story design was chosen, as many students would have traveled several miles on foot or on horseback. The building's orientation helped to keep temperature in the rooms, cooling {{in the summer and}} heating in the winter. In addition, the area under the <b>front</b> <b>arches</b> once featured windows and doors that opened at the front and back of the auditorium, creating a cooling cross breeze.|$|R
