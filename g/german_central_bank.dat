Khan reprised {{his role in the}} 2006 film, Don. In this film, unlike the first, he plays only one part. Khan exercised extensively for the role and performed almost all the stunts by himself. Don 2 marked Khan's return to playing villains after earlier films such as Darr and Baazigar. It is the first sequel in Khan's two-decade-long career. Roma, Now an INTERPOL operative, Roma continues chasing Don to avenge the deaths of her brother Ramesh and his fiancée Kamini at his hands. Chopra learned martial arts, trained for over two months and wanted to perform her own stunts. The chief antagonist, Vardhaan was an underground criminal who disguised himself as a police officer named D'Silva. He is framed by Don, and arrested in the first film. In Don2, he works with Don on the robbery but secretly seeks revenge. Irani lost 12 kg for the role and grew a beard to make his character look [...] "cold, cunning and deceitful"; he felt that playing a villain was [...] "a big stretch" [...] for him as an actor. Don's trusted companion, she helps him in his plans to rob the <b>German</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank.</b> Dutta was cast after Koppikar, who played the role in Don, dropped out of the film. She was recommended to Akhtar by Khan, who had worked with her on Billu in 2009. In an interview with The Hindustan Times Dutta said it was exciting to play a new character, since there would be no predecessor to live up to. A computer hacker hired by Don for his bank robbery. It was reported that Kapoor was cast as a replacement for Arjun Rampal, who played Jasjeet in Don; however, the producers and Kapoor denied the reports.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the proposition {{whether or not}} EMS membership is {{a necessary condition for}} real interest parity to hold, taking Germany as a reference country. Empirical results indicate that EMS membership is not a necessary condition for convergence on German real interest rates, since the relationship seems to hold best for Switzerland followed by the U. K. Moreover, results obtained from time-varying parameter regressions reveal that Swiss real interest rates have progressively converged on those of Germany since the early 1980 s. It is concluded that the important underlying factor is a similarity between the <b>German</b> and Swiss <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> rather than institutional arrangements like the EMS. ...|$|R
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the BIS Board of Directors – on which the main European <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> were represented – decided that the Bank should remain open, but that, for the duration of hostilities, no meetings of the Board of Directors were to take place and that the Bank should maintain a neutral stance in the conduct of its business. However, as the war dragged on evidence mounted that the BIS conducted operations that were helpful to the Germans. Also, throughout the war, the BIS accepted gold from the Reichsbank in payment for prewar obligations linked to the Young Plan. This in spite of repeated Allied warnings not to accept gold or other assets from Nazi Germany. It later transpired that much of this gold had been looted (and subsequently remelted) by the <b>Germans</b> from the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in occupied territories. [...] Some of this remelted gold included gold rings and other items from labor and prison camp victims. [...] Operations conducted by the BIS were viewed with increasing suspicion from London and Washington. The fact that top level German industrialists and advisors sat on the BIS board seemed to provide ample evidence of how the BIS might be used by Hitler throughout the war, with the help of American, British and French banks. Between 1933 and 1945 the BIS board of directors included Walther Funk, a prominent Nazi official, and Emil Puhl, as well as Hermann Schmitz, the director of IG Farben and Baron von Schroeder, the owner of the J.H. Stein Bank.|$|R

The gold in the U.S. was earned by West Germany through trade surpluses in the 1950s and 1960s and was never moved out of the United States due to fear of invasion by the Soviet Union.
