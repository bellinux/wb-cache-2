There is a further chemical change in the elastic fibers which may be expressed by the term "elacin. " Degenerated and, especially, calcified elastic tissue—even more than calcification in general—seems to possess an affinity for iron salts. The iron incrustations occur principally in congested or hemorrhagic tissues. The etiological agent in this case is obscure. The only other example of this lesion in the spleen was in a case of Banti's disease. Many features of this case suggest a primary splenomegaly, but the evidence in its favor is not conclusive. Calcified elastic fibers, without the iron and <b>elacin</b> reactions, were also present in the liver, which was the seat of a recent, apparently biliary or infectious, cirrhosis. The elastic tissue of other organs showed nothing remarkable except in the skin, where the fibers were undergoing the usual senile changes...|$|E
