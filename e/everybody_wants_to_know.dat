5000|$|There was {{too much}} gore in the first season, and it was for shock's sake. There was no humor. <b>Everybody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about the Millennium Group.

5000|$|In {{front of}} a crowd of 8,026, Crawford {{retained}} his world titles after a dominating performance, which forced Diaz's trainer, Joel Diaz to stop the fight after round 10. Towards the end, Diaz did close to nothing, leaning against the ropes. This was mostly due to his vision, as his right eye was nearly closed and his left eye, badly swollen. Crawford used his jab {{for most of the}} fight, and used to to control the pace and helped him move around the ring in his southpaw stance. Joel Diaz said in the post fight, he pulled Diaz out, because he was taking too much punishment. Also in the post-fight, Crawford said, [...] "It's not up to me. But <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who's the next guy that Terence Crawford wants to fight. I'll fight anybody. It doesn't matter who it is."

Promoter Bob Arum mentioned Crawford would likely fight again in the summer, against Julius Indongo, where the winner would be crowned the undisputed world champion.|$|E
5000|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album. She {{believed that the}} most important thing missing from contemporary pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it."I just feel like this record is really different- you've got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. ... The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. ...

40|$|As is true {{about many}} sciences, {{knowledge}} in medicine {{used to be}} kept under the utmost secrecy, private only to those few persons that devoted their lives to healing. Today, however, {{in the era of}} information, everybody knows and, more importantly, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about medicine. It is then when the existence of scientists willing and able to divulge technical knowledge for all people becomes crucial. For this purpose there was none other like Oliver Sacks.

You see, he had so long feared Shadow that he was still afraid of him even though he was so helpless. But little by little Happy Jack grew bolder and came very close. And then he began doing something not at all nice. He began calling Shadow names and making fun of him, and telling him how he wasn't afraid of him.

40|$|Training for {{internal}} medicine I read with amusement {{the proposal to}} increase by one year the training {{for internal}} medicine specialists. 1 Does <b>everybody</b> today <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be <b>known</b> as having a “special skill”? I submit that if residents who com-plete four years of training in internal medicine find themselves lacking skills, it is the training that is deficient, not the time spent training. Four years is {{a substantial amount of}} time and clearly should suffice for becoming a general internist — of which, inciden-tally, we have too few. Most residents subspecialize and then, over time, lose the skills necessary to view the patient as a whole. Increasing training by one year will do very little to address a deficient pro-gram or the shortage of general internists. It merely keeps students in school for one more unnecessary year...|$|R

[...] As part of his competition on the popular television show the producers, and media have noted his unique dress appearance and style. Scott Borchetta, a record executive and on-air contestant coach stated [...] "Quentin has this really cool New Orleans vibe about him. He has these great piercing eyes.

Where?'" [...] In Bustle, entertainment writer Jessica Molinari noted he [...] "performed the song {{as if he was}} actually casting a spell on the audience, and that’s what made it so amazing. From his outfit (did you see that fur coat?!), to his hair, to his crazy-intense eye contact, Alexander fully immersed himself in his performance and played a character — and that’s what sets him apart as an artist." [...] Show judge Keith Urban stated, when asked [...] "What is it about him that viewers are responding to?", [...] "He's a conceptual artist, with his sense of arrangement, his interpretation, the way he looks."
