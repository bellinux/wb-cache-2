5|$|As Jennings {{was also}} {{achieving}} success in country {{music in the}} early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called outlaw country, since it did not conform to Nashville standards. The album Wanted! The Outlaws in 1976 with Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser cemented the pair's outlaw image and became country music's first platinum album. Later that year Nelson released The Sound <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mind</b> (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001) and his first gospel album Troublemaker (certified gold in 1986).|$|E
25|$|The private {{language}} {{argument is}} of central importance to {{debates about the}} nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in my head are distinct from the concepts in your head. But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.|$|E

Without the violence or obvious bravado of Reservoir Dogs, these performers still create strong and fascinatingly ambiguous characters." [...] The Independent praised the film's ending: [...] "The film's coup de grace is as elegant as it is unexpected. The whole movie plays back <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> in perfect clarity—and {{turns out to be}} a completely different movie to the one you've been watching (rather better, in fact)." ...|$|E

500|$|During development, Mahito Yokota, who was {{in charge}} of the musical direction, {{originally}} wanted Super Mario Galaxy to have a Latin American style of music; and even had composed 28 tracks in that style. Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous Super Mario instalments, such as steelpans, bongo drums, and congas. For Super Mario Galaxys theme, Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films. The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi, the game's director and designer, but when Yokota presented it to the game's sound supervisor, Koji Kondo, he stated that it was [...] "no good". When asked why his music was rejected, Kondo responded: [...] "if somewhere <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> you have an image that Mario is cute, please get rid of it". Incensed by the rejection, Yokota almost resigned from his job, but Kondo implied that Mario's character was [...] "cool" [...] and instructed him to try again.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, Janáček {{founded and}} was {{appointed}} {{director of the}} organ school, and held this post until 1919, when the school became the Brno Conservatory. In the mid-1880s Janáček began composing more systematically. Among other works, he created the Four male-voice choruses (1886), dedicated to Antonín Dvořák, and his first opera, Šárka (1887–88). During this period he began to collect and study folk music, songs and dances. In {{the early months of}} 1887 he sharply criticized the comic opera The Bridegrooms, by Czech composer Karel Kovařovic, in a Hudební listy journal review: [...] "Which melody stuck <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> Which motif? Is this dramatic opera? No, I would write on the poster: 'Comedy performed together with music', since the music and the libretto aren't connected to each other". Janáček's review apparently led to mutual dislike and later professional difficulties when Kovařovic, as director of the National Theatre in Prague, refused to stage Janáček's opera Jenůfa.|$|E

And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him."

The album has been compared to the music which was used to soundtrack Sons of Anarchy. Manson called himself [...] "a man of few words" [...] , opting to allow melody to be its primary focus, instead of using characters or extended metaphors to compose lyrics. Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the [...] "guttural, visceral element of music.

500|$|Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning Education in {{response}} to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's [...] "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, [...] "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." [...] This education [...] "will not so perfectly suit the education of daughters; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" [...] (Locke's emphasis). This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that [...] "since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [...]" [...] Martin Simons states that Locke [...] "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes." [...] Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and [...] "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate." [...] Like his contemporary Mary Astell, Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.|$|E

500|$|Novelist Brian Lynch, {{writing for}} the Irish Independent found [...] "The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a {{realistic}} fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults", stating [...] "At its best Pure shimmers". The novel received two reviews from The Daily Telegraph. Freya Johnston found that [...] "Miller lingers up close on details: sour breath, decaying objects, pretty clothes, flames, smells, eyelashes. He is a close observer of cats" [...] and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, [...] "Miller intimately imagines how it might have felt to witness it." [...] Holly Kyte found Pure to be [...] "irresistibly compelling" [...] and [...] "Exquisite inside and out". She stated that [...] "Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind" [...] and that she found that [...] "Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities." [...] Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated [...] "Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work" [...] and also noted that [...] "Miller's portraits {{of women and the}} poor are thoughtful and subtle." [...] Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be [...] "very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times" [...] and stated that [...] "Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy." [...] Reviewing for the Daily Mail Clare Colvin stated that the novel [...] "draws you in with hallucinatory power" [...] and that she found that [...] "Miller evokes the underside of Parisian society with assured, vivid detail so that images remain <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> long after you reach the last page. This is historical fiction with imaginative style." ...|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
