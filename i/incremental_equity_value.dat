40|$|Data from 1, 374 firms across four broad {{industrial}} groupings {{are used}} to assess the contribution that real (adaptation) options make to overall <b>equity</b> <b>values.</b> The analysis indicates that real (adaptation) options make a significant contribution to the <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> of firms with a market to book ratio (of equity) of around unity or less. As the market to book ratio grows beyond this level, however, the contribution made by real (adaptation) options decays quickly away and <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> are mainly comprised of the present value of the dividends that firms are expected to pay. This means that for around one in every five of the firms in our sample real (adaptation) options make a significant contribution to overall <b>equity</b> <b>value.</b> Thus, while linear equity valuation models would seem to be appropriate for the substantial majority of firms on which our sample is based, there is a sizeable minority of firms where real (adaptation) options {{have a significant impact on}} <b>equity</b> <b>values.</b> For this latter group of firms there will be a non-linear relationship between <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> and its determining variables.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine the impact of investment growth towards the relationship between <b>equity</b> <b>value,</b> earnings, and <b>equity</b> book <b>value</b> in Indonesia. Furthermore, the researcher adds two variables on this relation: profitability and firm size.

The research data collected from companies financial statement and the closing share price at the end offiscal year from Yahoo! Finance. with purposive sampling method, the researcher obtained 316 observations. From the regression analysis, the result shows several conclusions. First, on profitability region, it shows that the effect becomes bigger on the higher profitability region. These findings are consistent to Abbas, et al (2013). But, both on growth and firm size, the results reveal that a higher (smaller) firm has a stronger relationship between <b>equity</b> <b>value,</b> earnings, and <b>equity</b> book <b>value.</b> It shows that investment growth proxy used in this study might not good enough to explain the market share price of a firm.

We find that (1) growth increases the slope in the value-earnings relation for high-profitability firms (consistent with growth having positive NPV), but has an insignificant or {{negative effect on the}} slope for lower-profitability firms (consistent with growth having non-positive NPV); (2) given earnings, growth increases the (positive) slope of the relation between <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> and <b>equity</b> book <b>value</b> for low-profitability firms, but reduces this slope and causes <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> to decrease with book value for high-profitability firms; and (3) given profitability (ROE), <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> uniformly increases with book value, and growth increases the slope of this relation. We also examine the valuation impact of past investment activities that arises from accounting conservatism.

40|$|It is {{twenty-one years}} since South Africa’s {{democracy}} {{and the majority of}} South African households can still be classified as poor, despite the various interventions by Government to reduce poverty and inequality. The measurement used to determine the financial status of a household at a given point in time is its net equity in accordance with its Statement of Financial Position, calculated as its assets owned less liabilities owed. This study aimed to identify the selected significant factors that affect a South African household’s net <b>equity</b> <b>value.</b> In order to achieve the aim of this study, a heuristic model consisting of two components was developed. The first component considered which assets and liabilities should be included in determining a household’s net equity and how these assets and liabilities should be valued. The second component identified the selected factors that influence a household’s net equity. The heuristic model was applied to the empirical data using three phases. Firstly, the net <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> was calculated for each household. This was followed by an analysis of the selected factors that significantly influence household net equity. The last phase was performed to determine the effect of the identified selected factors in explaining the difference between households that have above average net <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> and those having below average values. The results of the study indicated that 11 selected factors significantly influence the net <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> in the South African household’s Statement of Financial Position. Seven of those factors significantly explain between 28, 3 percent and 38, 1 percent of the differences in the net <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> of a household when comparing the households with above average net <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> with those with below average values.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 72 firms that adopted fresh start {{reporting}} upon their emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, I test whether management estimates of fresh start <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> are misstated and whether such misstatements are related to characteristics of the individual firms' bankruptcy process. I predict that the reported fresh start value reflects a tension between managerial incentives to promote {{the acceptance of the}} plan of reorganization, and incentives to enhance future reported performance. I test whether the tendency to overstate the fresh start <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> is increasing in factors affecting the acceptance of the reorganization plan (i. e., bankruptcy claimants' relative bargaining power) and decreasing in factors affecting postbankruptcy reported performance (i. e., the probability of future losses). I find that, relative to the market <b>value</b> of <b>equity</b> immediately after emergence from Chapter 11, the fresh start <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> is, on average, understated by about 4 %. The difference between the fresh start <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> and market value also exhibits significant crosssectional variation (an average absolute error of 11 %). Consistent with my first prediction, the misstatement is increasing in the relative bargaining power of junior claimants. In contrast to my second prediction, the misstatement is also increasing in the likelihood of future reported losses. This result suggests that firms that are more likely to experience postbankruptcy financial distress are more concerned with obtaining acceptance for their plan than with the effects of the fresh start <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> on postbankruptcy performance. Finally, I document that the misstatement in the fresh start <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> is negatively related to whether firms have undergone prepackaged bankruptcies, and positively r [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the value relevance of earnings and book value in security prices from 1982 to 2001 in Korean stock market. The study examines whether the accounting earnings and book value ha ve a nonlinear relationship to <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> by using an option-style model of equity. The study use s an option-style model of <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> to test the hypothesis that earnings and book value have a nonlinear relationship to <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> by examining firms listed in the Korean stock market (7, 928 firm-year observations). To this end, the paper perform s analyses for all samples and across subsamples divided into loss firms and profit firms, and observes changes in relationships over the past twenty years. This paper reports three sets of findings. First, the value-relevance of accounting earnings differs between loss firms and profit firms. Second, Korean firms differently acknowledge accounting earnings and book <b>value</b> for <b>equity</b> valuation.

40|$|Prior {{studies show}} that <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> has convex {{relations}} with earnings and book <b>value</b> of <b>equity,</b> respectively, due to growth and adaptation options (Burgstahler and Dichev 1997 a; Zhang 2000). These studies, however, do not consider the role of institutions in affecting firms 2 ̆ 7 ability to exercise growth and adaptation options. In this study, we investigate whether these convex relations vary with the degree of a country 2 ̆ 7 s economic freedom, which may influence the frictions and costs of exercising these options. We develop four hypotheses: In countries with greater economic freedom, (1) a firm 2 ̆ 7 s capital investment in response to profitability is greater; (2) the relation between <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> and earnings, given <b>equity</b> book <b>value,</b> is more convex; (3) the relation between <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> and <b>equity</b> book <b>value,</b> given earnings, is more convex; and (4) the relation between stock return and profitability change is more convex. Using the index of economic freedom from the Fraser Institute, we test our hypotheses with data from 30 countries during the 2000 - 2010 period. The empirical {{results are consistent with}} these hypotheses. The effect of economic freedom that we document is distinct from the effects of GDP level and growth, legal origin, law enforcement, investor protection, and quality of accounting standards.

When <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> rise, we find virtually no immediate offset to director compensation.
