These film-formers were then {{incorporated into a}} formulation as supplied by St. Gobain Vetrotex which is used in industry to produce a working glass fibre size. Initial studies were undertaken to determine {{the location of the}} constituent species present in the size to produce an image of its structure. The <b>film-former</b> formulation was then altered to produce a range of physical properties. The performance of sizes produced from these film-formers were then investigated in the areas of clarity, film formation, wetting ability and strength. Alterations to the size formulation was then undertaken to determine whether this produced any effect in the performance of the size over some of the same areas of investigation. The conclusions drawn are listed below:• The coupling agent species present in the size formulation migrates to the glass interface of the size during drying. • A minor amount of lubricant migrates to the air interface of the size during drying. • Migration of species in the size only occurs during drying when the size is in its liquid state. • The molecular weight and particle size of a <b>film-former</b> {{is directly related to the}} initiator and first stage monomer concentrations respectively. • The molecular weight of a <b>film-former</b> does not alter the size's ability to form a continuous film if dried under suitable conditions. Film-formers with large particle sizes produce inhomogeneous films due to incomplete diffusion occurring during film formation. • The inhomogeneity of films with larger particle sizes present produces an increasingly optically active film with an increased wet-out rate. • The molecular weight and particle size of a <b>film-former</b> do not alter the corresponding sizes ability to wet a bare glass fibre due to the large amount of water present in the size formulation. • A size can be redistributed following successive re-wetting and drying under certain conditions. •The stiffness of a size is directly related to the molecular weight of the sizes <b>film-former.</b> • An inhomogeneous, discontinuous size will be formed with excessive deviation from the size formulation. • An excess of coupling agent is present in the standard size formulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, an organic/inorganic {{molybdenum}} series Cr-free coating {{was formed}} on galvanized steel by simple immersion and its corrosion behavior {{was compared to}} that of a typical chromate coating. Molybdate and 1 -Hydroxy-ethylidene- 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid (HEDP) were used as corrosion inhibitor, as well as acrylic resin and silane were used as <b>film-former</b> and coupling agents, respectively. The corrosion behavior of the coatings was evaluated by Neutral salt spray (NSS), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization. The surface topography of the samples was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that the corroded area of the Mo-HEDP treatment was only corroded 2 % after 72 h spraying, while the corrosion behaviour of Mo-HEDP was closed to that of Cr pretreatment due to the synergistic reaction of molybdate and HEDP. Compared with the film of Cr treatment, Mo-HEDP passivating coating was more environmentally friendly...|$|E
40|$|Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), {{which is}} {{available}} in different degrees of substitution and viscosity designations, {{is one of the}} most commonly used cellulosic polymers in aqueous film coating. It is relatively easy to process due to its non-tacky nature and has been known to produce smooth and clear films. For aqueous film coating, it is cost effective to use a coating formulation containing a high concentration of polymer without affecting the viscosity or spray rate and compromising on the quality of the film coat. Hence, it is ideal to use a polymer of low viscosity grade. The rheological properties of HPMC with various viscosity grades were determined. It was found that HPMC Methocel E 3 had the lowest viscosity and was the least affected by the increase in polymer concentration. Additives can modify the film properties, including the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer. Glass transition temperature influences the viscosity of the coating solution and the mechanical properties, adhesion and permeability of the film coat. Various concentrations of different additives were incorporated in HPMC formulations to study the effect on these properties. Some long-chain fatty acids were included in the study to investigate if their hydrophobic carbon chains could retard moisture permeation of HPMC films. It was observed that HPMC films containing water-soluble additives produce films with clarity similar to those without additives, whereas those with hydrophobic additives tend to be patchy or hazy in appearance. A vinyl pyrrolidone / vinyl acetate copolymer (S 630) was investigated for its influence on HPMC films, comparing the results with a commonly used plasticizer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and another copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Intrinsic properties of the solutions, such as viscosity and glass transition temperature, were evaluated. The effect of S 630 on the film properties, such as physical appearance, surface roughness, moisture permeation and mechanical properties, as well as its ability to promote better adhesion of the film coat to the core surface, were compared. S 630 was found to be effective both as a <b>film-former</b> and plasticizer, reducing the glass transition temperature and viscosity, but enhancing the tensile strength, elongation and work of failure of the cast film. The water vapour permeability was slightly increased but not to the same extent as with polyethylene glycol PEG). A 10 % concentration of this copolymer increased the adhesive strength and toughness of the HPMC film coat. Aqueous film coating was carried out in the ultra-coater, using HPMC coating formulations containing 8 % w/w of solids, without or with 10 % concentration (based on dry weight of total solids) of the additives, PEG, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and S 630, for coating the tablets. Capsule-shaped lactose tablet cores of specific surface area, hardness, weight, friability and disintegration time were used to study the process variables. Process variables, including air flow rate, temperature and humidity, coating application rate or pump flow rate, atomising air pressure and speed of the rotating disk, were investigated in order to obtain the optimum operating conditions for these solutions. It was found that the process parameters were similar for all the coating formulations containing 8 % solid. The additives used in the coating formulations had little influence on the coating process. The ultra-coater was an effective unit for the aqueous film coating of tablets with a batch size of not less than 5 kg...|$|E

PorÃÂm, estudos recentes sugerem que estes apresentam problemas de estabilidade, podendo levar a um comprometimento da seguranÃÂa e eficÃÂcia dos produtos fotoprotetores. Nesse sentido, a hidroxiapatita (HAP) tem sido investigada como alternativa ÃÂ formulaÃÂÃÂo de fotoprotetores, agindo como filtro inorgÃÂnico. Visualizando a necessidade do desenvolvimento de protetores solares com baixo risco biolÃÂgico e alto fator de proteÃÂÃÂo solar (FPS) ÃÂ base de filtros inorgÃÂnicos, o presente trabalho visou {{investigar}} mecanismos de otimizaÃÂÃÂo dos parÃÂmetros de formulaÃÂÃÂo de fotoprotetor ÃÂ base de filtros inorgÃÂnicos. Dessa forma, avaliou-se a influÃÂncia do revestimento e tamanho de partÃÂcula na atividade fotocatalÃÂtica do ZnO, TiO 2 e HAP, frente ÃÂs radiaÃÂÃÂes UVA, UVB e UVA/UVB por meio de anÃÂlise da taxa de degradaÃÂÃÂo do substrato orgÃÂnico azul de metileno. Empregando-se microscopia ÃÂptica, foram investigadas possÃÂveis incompatibilidades entre os filtros inorgÃÂnicos e diferentes alfa hidroxiÃÂcidos comumente empregados em produtos contendo FPS. Foram desenvolvidos fotoprotetores ÃÂ base de ZnO micronizado; TiO 2 alumina; ZnO micronizado+TiO 2 alumina e HAP, contendo 15 % de filtro inorgÃÂnico. Os cremes base foram preparados na forma de emulsÃÂo ÃÂleo em ÃÂgua (O/A) variando a concentraÃÂÃÂo e natureza dos agentes emolientes, co-emulsionante nÃÂo-iÃÂnico e formador de filme. A influÃÂncia do mÃÂtodo de preparo nas propriedades fÃÂsico-quÃÂmicas dos fotoprotetores foi avaliada utilizando-se dois processos distintos: incorporaÃÂÃÂo dos filtros solares ao veÃÂculo por meio de uma prÃÂ-dispersÃÂo e pelo mÃÂtodo convencional. Com o intuito de avaliar o comportamento de componentes que podem interferir em aspectos da formulaÃÂÃÂo, foram desenvolvidas prÃÂ-dispersÃÂes acrescidas de manteiga de karitÃÂ. As formulaÃÂÃÂes desenvolvidas foram caracterizadas fÃÂsico-quimicamente e submetidas a ensaios de estabilidade. O potencial zeta e o tamanho mÃÂdio das partÃÂculas foram determinados utilizando um Zetasizer 3000 HSa. Em um espectrofotÃÂmetro fotoacÃÂstico, foram realizadas anÃÂlises para avaliar a capacidade de absorÃÂÃÂo de luz UV dos protetores solares desenvolvidos. O estudo de fotocatÃÂlise sugeriu que o revestimento de filtros inorgÃÂnicos representa a melhor alternativa para inibir a atividade fotocatalÃÂtica destas partÃÂculas. Os ÃÂcidos glicÃÂlico e lÃÂtico apresentaram incompatibilidades apenas com o ZnO. Na anÃÂlise fotoacÃÂstica, verificou-se que os produtos apresentaram efetiva absorÃÂÃÂo UV, conforme caracterÃÂsticas dos filtros inorgÃÂnicos. As anÃÂlises das caracterizaÃÂÃÂes fÃÂsico-quÃÂmicas e estabilidade propÃÂem que o mÃÂtodo de formulaÃÂÃÂo a partir de uma prÃÂ-dispersÃÂo ÃÂ o mais adequado para obtenÃÂÃÂo de um produto estÃÂvel e seguro. As formulaÃÂÃÂes ÃÂ base de HAP, porÃÂm, representaram uma exceÃÂÃÂo, pois estas apresentaram-se estÃÂveis independente do mÃÂtodo de incorporaÃÂÃÂo ao creme base. Os resultados apontam que, para a obtenÃÂÃÂo de um protetor solar seguro e eficaz, ÃÂ de fundamental importÃÂncia atentarmos para os critÃÂrios de formulaÃÂÃÂo, como a seleÃÂÃÂo adequada dos excipientes e tÃÂcnica de preparo. The inorganic sunscreens represented {{mainly by}} titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO), {{were classified as}} inert particles, therefore, they are pointed out {{as the best way}} to protect the skin against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation (UV). However, recent studies suggest that these particles have several stability problems that may lead to a compromise of safety and efficacy of photoprotective products. In this sense, the hydroxyapatite (HAP) has been investigated as an alternative to sunscreen formulation, playing the role of inorganic filter. Viewing the need for the development of sunscreens with low biological risk and high sun protection factor (SPF) based on inorganic filters, the present work aimed to investigate optimization mechanisms of the sunscreen based inorganic filters formulation. Thus, were evaluated the influence of coating and particle size on the photocatalytic activity of ZnO, TiO 2 and HAP in the presence to UVA, UVB and UVA/UVB radiation by analysis of the rate of degradation of the organic substrate methylene blue. Employing optical microscopy, were investigated possible incompatibilities between the inorganic filters and different alpha hydroxyacids commonly used in products containing SPF. Were developed sunscreens based on micronized ZnO, TiO 2 alumina, ZnO + micronized TiO 2 alumina and HAP containing 15 % of inorganic filter. Were prepared oil-in-water (O/W) creams from the variation of the concentration and nature of emollient agents, nonionic co-emulsifier and <b>film-former.</b> The influence of preparation method on the physicochemical properties of sunscreens was evaluated using two different methods: incorporation of inorganic filters to the vehicle by means of a pre-dispersion and the conventional method. In order to evaluate the behavior of components that can interfere with the SPF and stability aspects of the formulation, were developed pre-dispersions added of Shea Butter. All formulations developed were physicochemically characterized and subjected to stability tests. The zeta potential and average particle size was measured using a Zetasizer 3000 HSA. Using a photoacoustic spectrophotometer, were analyzed the ability of UV light absorption of the sunscreens developed. The photocatalytic study suggested that the coating inorganic filters represents the best alternative to inhibit the photocatalytic activity of these particles. Glycolic and lactic acids showed incompatibilities only with ZnO. In photoacoustic analysis, {{it was found that the}} products have an effective UV absorption, as inorganic filter characteristics The physicochemical characterization and stability analysis propose that the formulation method from a pre-dispersion is most suitable for obtaining a stable and secure sunscreen product. The HAP-based formulations, however, represented an exception, because they were stable regardless of the method of incorporation into the cream base. In summary, the results indicate that, to obtain a safe and effective sunscreen, is extremely important we focus on the formulation criteria, such as ideal choice of components and technical preparation...|$|E
