50|$|In recent years, {{the role}} of the CFO has evolved significantly. Traditionally being viewed as a {{financial}} gatekeeper, {{the role of}} the CFO has expanded and evolved to a strategic partner and advisor to the CEO. In fact, in a report released by McKinsey, 88 percent of 164 CFOs surveyed reported that CEOs expect them to be more active participants in shaping the strategy of their organizations. Half of them also indicated that CEOs counted on them to challenge the company’s strategy. However a 2016 survey of CFOs suggests that their new role has been overhyped with 52% of CFOs still finding themselves bogged down in the basics of traditional accounting practices such as transaction reporting and unable to make time for business partnering. The rise of digital technologies and a focus on data analytics to support decision making impacting almost every industry and organisation will only add more pressure for CFOs to address this tension on finding the time to make the time to meet the expectations of their C-Suite colleagues. Many organisations have embarked on the journey to help achieve this by creating a <b>finance</b> <b>function</b> based on 4 distinct pillars - An Accounting organisation structured as a shared service, an FP&A organisation responsible to drive financial planning processes as well as driving increased insight into financial and non financial KPIs that drive business performance, a Finance Business Partnering organisation that supports the leadership of divisions, regions, functions to drive performance improvement and, last but not least, expertise centres around the areas of Tax, Treasury, Internal Audit, M&A etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{examples}} of the current state of the Shared Services Concept as applied to the <b>finance</b> <b>function.</b> The paper arises out of the ongoing research after current developments in the <b>finance</b> <b>function</b> enabled by information and communication technology, at the University of Twente. The rapid developments in information and communication technology (leading to new ‘economics of information’) combined with developments in organisation theory, have far-reaching implications for the way activities are best organised (‘the new economics of organisation’). As a result, organisations are being restructured, and boundaries of organisations are shifting. These developments are captured by the powerful concept of the virtual organisation. As being argued by the authors, the Shared Service Concept could be understood as providing an answer to these new economics of organisation. As such, it is related to the more general concept underlying the virtual enterprise. The Shared Services Concept implies consolidating certain support services into a shared services centre. The relations of the shared services centre with business units is governed as much as possible by market conditions. After having explained the Shared Service Concept in general, the authors will focus on the way this concept is applied to the <b>finance</b> <b>function.</b> In the <b>finance</b> <b>function,</b> several examples exist of the Shared Services Concept. Such examples include accounting houses and in-house banks. For the next years, financial shared services can be expected to enjoy an increasing amount of attention...|$|E
