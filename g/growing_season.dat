40|$|Abstract: Ethiopia is an {{important}} center of genetic diversity for sorghum germplasm; however, photoperiodsensitivity limits the utilization of this genetic resource. The United States National Plant Germplasm System maintains 180 Ethiopian sorghum accessions that are less sensitive to photoperiod and these accessions were inoculated with Colletotrichum sublineolum and evaluated for disease resistance at the Tropical Agriculture Research Station in Isabela, Puerto Rico during the 2008 and 2009 <b>growing</b> <b>seasons.</b> Disease response was similar across <b>growing</b> <b>seasons,</b> with 35 accessions rated as resistant and 98 accessions showing a susceptible response to anthracnose. Variation for disease resistance across <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> and replications was observed for 47 accessions and these accessions also showed low mean infection severity. Eighteen accessions showed a highly susceptible response across <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> with plant death before maturity observed for nine accessions. Disease severity was also similar for the two <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> with a mean infection severity of 23. 4 % for the 136 accessions rated as susceptible in 2008 and 22. 6 % for the 140 accessions rated as susceptible in 2009. Although the frequency of anthracnose resistant accessions was low for this germplasm subset, the collection showed phenotypic diversity suggesting possible genetic variation for anthracnose resistance that would be beneficial for sorghum improvement.

5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County.

5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E

Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches.
