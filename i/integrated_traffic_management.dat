40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is {{a problem}} experienced daily by most of us. Among various <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> schemes, efficient utilisation of the existing roadside infrastructure combined with in-vehicle technologies offers a promising solution to address traffic congestion and related problems. This approach {{has resulted in the}} development of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHSs). An IVHS basically consists of roadside infrastructures interacting with automated intelligent vehicles (IVs) that are organised in a closely spaced groups called platoons. With platooning, more vehicles can be accommodated on the highway, thus increasing the traffic flow. In the present situation, most of the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> and control centers use conventional roadside-based control measures to improve the traffic performance. The objective of the thesis is to provide a framework and a systematic approach for <b>integrating</b> <b>traffic</b> control and <b>management</b> methods into the IVHS. The focus of the thesis is on combining the control capabilities offered by automated platoons with those of the roadside infrastructure.

The aim of ATCS is to enable the vehicle movement continuously and minimize the delay at an intersection. This research aims to determine the factors which are considered in the analysis by using Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (IHCM 1997) and field survey methods, to calculate the delay of each method, and then to compare both values. The implementation of manual traffic counts survey carried out for a day in the morning peak hour. It is sourced from traffic counting data from ATCS detector of Dishubkominfo Surakarta after converted in passenger cars unit. The obtained data from field observation for calculating field delay are: number of waiting vehicle every 15 second, stopped (in red and amber time) and not stopped vehicles (in green and amber time). Findings so far, the average delay calculated by IHCM 1997 method is 59. 29 sec/pcu, while the average field delay is 16. 91 sec/pcu.

Their purpose is to monitor and analyze the technical performance of individual modules of a transportation network, e. g. an airport. Actions recommended to optimize operations and to maintain operation during disruptions are ideally based on an understanding of the system-wide impact of the action and for the entire intermodal chain of the journey from door to door. With all the numerous possible parameters and indicators which can be monitored within a complex transportation network, not every indicator is necessarily a key indicator. We show which indicators can depict a situation consisting of a system status and a system forecast, which allow interstakeholder optimization and which serve as an enabler for a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concept. Examples of intermodal-oriented KPIs include the Amount of useable travel time, the Boarding Score and the Connectivity Matrix. Useable travel times are defined as the longest, continuous travel and waiting times which can be used for productivity or relaxation. The Boarding Score accounts for reaching a connection on time, e. g. catching the desired flight after travelling to the airport by train. The Connectivity Matrix dynamically expands the Minimum Connecting Time MCT (which is known from airports and is important for booking systems), allowing forecast values to be offered based on the demanded connecting journeys instead of on average spreadsheet values. With the deployment of the new key performance indicator set a tool is given to visualize situational awareness at an airport. This includes nowcasting as well as forecasting awareness which is required to assess different options of intervention.

Given the scale of the problem, the analysis and the proposal that follow only deal with road transport, more specifically with the construction of new roads. Road construction is, according to experts, a key part of any improvement measures since the quality of the current road network is not sufficient not only in cities but in all of the territory of the Czech Republic.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{established}} infrastructure to enable and safely manage {{the widespread use of}} low-altitude airspace and UAS flight operations. Given this, and understanding that the FAA faces a mandate to modernize the present air traffic management system through computer automation and significantly reduce the number of air traffic controllers by FY 2020, the FAA maintains that a comprehensive, yet fully automated UAS traffic management (UTM) system for low-altitude airspace is needed. The concept of UTM is to begin by leveraging concepts from the system of roads, lanes, stop signs, rules and lights that govern vehicles on the ground today. Building on its legacy of work in air traffic management (ATM), NASA is working with industry to develop prototype technologies for a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system that would evolve airspace integration procedures for enabling safe, efficient low-altitude flight operations that autonomously manage UAS operating in an approved low-altitude airspace environment. UTM is a cloud-based system that will autonomously manage all traffic at low altitudes to include UASs being operated beyond visual line of sight of an operator. UTM would thus enable safe and efficient flight operations by providing fully <b>integrated</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> services such as airspace design, corridors, dynamic geofencing, severe weather and wind avoidance, congestion management, terrain avoidance, route planning re-routing, separation management, sequencing spacing, and contingency management. UTM removes the need for human operators to continuously monitor aircraft operating in approved areas. NASA envisions concepts for two types of UTM systems. The first would be a small portable system, which could be moved between geographical areas in support of operations such as precision agriculture and public safety. The second would be a Persistent system, which would support low-altitude operations in an approved area by providing continuous automated coverage. Both would require persistent communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) coverage to track, ensure, and monitor conformance. UTM is creating an airspace management tool that allows the ATM system to accommodate the number of UAS that will operate in the low altitude airspace.

40|$|Since {{the second}} half of last century, traffic {{congestion}} on road network has become a predominant phenomenon due to the rapid increases in transport demand and number of vehicles. It starts to become clear until later that century traffic congestion cannot be solved single-handedly by expansions of road network. During peak hours, besides recurrent congestion caused by insatiable demand, non-recurrent congestion caused by incidents, adverse weather conditions and work zones, are becoming more problematic with their temporary disturbances causing traffic breakdowns. Developments and deployments of traffic control strategies come into effect to solve recurrent and non-recurrent congestions with a synthesis combining technologies, traffic theories, mathematics and kinematics. Although ITS control measures are relatively new, they transform into the backbones of a prevailing type of traffic management, Dynamic Traffic Management. When coordination and integration between DTM control measures is introduced as the advanced approach to restore the utilization of road network, great hope is placed on Coordinated Network Management to improve the effectiveness of traffic management. The Field Test <b>Integrated</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Management</b> Amsterdam aims at investigating the effect and the control concept of coordinated network wide traffic management for the implementation in 2013. The graduation project is to develop an assessment methodology framework for modelling and ex-ante evaluation of CNM.

Evaluations and validations of the above modelling are presented to show the effect of individual DTM and coordinated DTM, also known as CNM, under recurrent and non-recurrent congestions. A test solution towards advanced deployment strategies and methodologies based on an incident-induced empirical case is contrived later using Matlab. Simulation results are also presented in order to assess this test solution and the effect of CNM under its coordination strategies and methodologies. Finally, findings, conclusions, recommendations and future directions are drawn to bring the thesis project to completion. Hopefully, this thesis work could be referred to for the future implementation of CNM in the PPA project and it could be informative to other CNM related researches.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{contribution of}} incidents to freeway congestion has generated {{strong interest in}} the development of incident detection algorithms in the last two decades. According to Federal Highway Administration estimates (Lindley, 1986), incidents currently account for up to 60 % of the vehicle-hours lost to freeway congestion; projection for the year 2005 indicates a 70 % contribution of incidents to total delay. Fast and accurate detection of incidents can, therefore, substantially reduce the impact of incident congestion on freeway traffic. In particular, when an incident alarm is promptly signaled, traffic management plans can be adjusted in real time to produce the best control and guidance actions in freeway corridors. In addition, the incident management process (detection, response, and clearance) is initiated as emergency vehicles can be promptly dispatched to clear the incident. Existing techniques for the detection of freeway incidents do not provide the necessary reliability for freeway operations. Conventional automated techniques, based on computerized algorithms, are less effective than is desirable for operational use because they generate a high level of false alarms. Operator-assisted methods minimize the false alarm risk, but suffer from missed or delayed detections, are labor intensive, and restrict the potential benefits from advanced, <b>integrated</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> schemes. The initial phase of this research focused in assessing the performance limitations of conventional automatic incident detection systems. That research was directed towards two objectives, the performance evaluation of major existing algorithms and the development of an improved algorithm. This part of the research pointed out that the existing techniques for the automatic detection of freeway incidents are not reliable as they are seriously handicapped by excessive, operationally unacceptable false alarm rates. The new algorithm proposed by the authors was developed for identifying capacityreducing incidents in freeway traffic. That algorithm aims to minimize the number of false alarms that the existing algorithms generate when temporal random oscillations in the traffic measurements, frequently observed in congested flows, occur. The proposed structure involved preprocessing the traffic data with average, median, or exponential smoothers over data windows of approximately five minute length to eliminate or reduce the size of traffic fluctuations. Although the new algorithm showed an improved and satisfactory performance relative to the conventional algorithms, the initial stage of this research pointed out the need of more research in finding ways and methods for distinguishing between the incident and the non-incident alarms and highlighted the issues that had to be addressed by the second stage of this project.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{proposed}} demonstration of ICTM {{is to improve the}} efficiency of traffic movement throughout the 1 - 494 Corridor. This will be achieved by applying a combination of <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> strategies developed through inter-jurisdictional cooperation and coordination. These strategies will be applied to both the freeway and the adjacent arterial system. The success of this project, or any endeavor involving multiple jurisdictions, will be determined by the degree to which all affected agencies participate and benefit. There is a long history of cooperation among governmental agencies, the motoring public and the private sector in the planning of transportation improvements for the 1 - 494 corridor. This spirit of cooperation continues with a commitment made to the <b>integrated</b> corridor <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> concept by these agencies. Member representatives from each agency have actively participated throughout the project planning process. To promote further interaction and cooperation, Mn/DOT's Guidestar organizational structure will be used to oversee project administration and all participating agencies are represented on the ICTM Management Team. Technical support will be provided by the Center for Transportation Studies at the University of Minnesota.

40|$|Real time {{traffic flow}} {{forecasting}} {{is a necessary}} requirement for <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> {{in order to be}} able to evaluate the effects of different available strategies or policies. This paper focuses on short-term traffic flow forecasting by taking into consideration both spatial (road links) and temporal (lag or past traffic flow values) information. We propose a Layered Ensemble Model (LEM) which combines Artificial Neural Networks and Graded Possibilistic Clustering obtaining an accurate forecast of the traffic flow rates with outlier detection. Experimentation has been carried out on two different data sets. The former was obtained from real UK motorway and the later was obtained from simulated traffic flow on a street network in Genoa (Italy). The proposed LEM model for short-term traffic forecasting provides promising results and given the ability for outlier detection, accuracy, robustness of the proposed approach, it can be fruitful <b>integrated</b> in <b>traffic</b> flow <b>management</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates an <b>integrated</b> freeway <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> system, which {{coordinates}} both dynamic toll {{pricing and}} ramp control {{strategies for the}} purpose of dynamic freeway congestion management. The proposed integrated dynamic toll-ramp control methodology is built mainly on the principles of stochastic optimal control approaches, involving two developmental procedures. First, through detector configurations and system specification, a discrete-time nonlinear stochastic system is formulated to characterize the time-varying relationships of system states, control variables, and traffic data. Then, by employing the extended Kalman filtering technology, a stochastic optimal control based algorithm is proposed to execute the integrated dynamic toll and ramp control mechanism. With the aid of the Paramics microscopic traffic simulator, numerical studies under various simulated freeway congestion scenarios are conducted. Corresponding numerical results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology in response to diverse freeway traffic congestion phenomena, and its relative advantages in improving both the average travel time and hourly throughputs by 16. 4 % and 16. 5 %, respectively.
