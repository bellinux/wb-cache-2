500|$|The writing staff {{used their}} {{individual}} childhood experiences as inspirations {{to come up}} with much of the story lines for this episode.

[...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." ...|$|E

I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|On November 11, Ortega-Hernandez {{parked his}} vehicle on Constitution Avenue, [...] {{directly}} {{south of the}} White House. He aimed his semi-automatic rifle from the car's passenger seat and fired. Gunfire was reported around 9pm. One bullet hit an antique window on the White House's second floor near the first family's formal living room; however, it did not penetrate the bulletproof glass on the inside. One bullet lodged in a window frame, and others ricocheted off the roof, causing small pieces of wood and concrete to fall to the ground. At least seven bullets struck the second floor, causing $97,000 worth of damage. A woman in a taxi nearby witnessed the shooting and wrote on Twitter, [...] "Driver in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cab STOPPED and fired 5 gun shots at the White House. It took the police a while to respond." [...] President Obama, his wife Michelle, and their oldest daughter Malia were not home {{at the time of}} the shooting, although their younger daughter Sasha and Michelle's mother Marian Shields Robinson were. When the shooting occurred, Malia was coming home and was expected to arrive at any moment.|$|E

500|$|Patton's brigade {{was then}} moved to support U.S. I Corps in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive on September 26. He {{personally}} led a troop of tanks through thick fog as they advanced [...] into German lines. Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns {{near the town of}} Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton's absence. Patton {{wrote in a letter to}} his wife: [...] "The bullet went into the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> left leg and came out just at the crack of my bottom about two inches to the left of my rectum. It was fired at about 50m so made a hole about the size of a [...] dollar where it came out." ...|$|E
500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to see what is inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child. Creator Hillenburg said, [...] " [...] started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

2500|$|Boris Pasternak died of {{lung cancer}} in his dacha in Peredelkino on the evening of 30 May 1960.

2500|$|In old age, Iorga {{had also}} {{established}} {{his reputation as}} a memoirist: Orizonturile mele was described by Victor Iova as [...] "a masterpiece of Romanian literature". George Călinescu referred to this series as Iorga's [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "eminently subjective" [...] literature; [...] "dignified" [...] and dominated by [...] "explosions of sentiment", it echoes, according to Călinescu, the Renaissance model of Ion Neculce. Many of the volumes were quickly written as Iorga's attempt to rehabilitate himself after a failed premiership; Orizonturile comprises messages on the power and justness of his cause: [...] "And so I stand at age sixty-two, confident and strong, proud, upright in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> conscience and the judgment of time." [...] The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga's adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga's path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga's talents as a [...] "polemicist" [...] and [...] "portraitist"; according to Alexandru Zub, they also fall into place within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol's and Pârvan's.|$|E
