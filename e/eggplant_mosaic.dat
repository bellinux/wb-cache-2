40|$|The {{coat protein}} of {{belladonna}} mottle virus (a tymovirus) was cleaved by trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the peptides {{were separated by}} high performance liquid chromatography {{using a combination of}} gel permeation, reverse phase, and ion pair chromatography. The peptides were sequenced manually using the 4 -N, N-dimethylaminoazobenzene- 4 '-isothiocyanate/phenyl isothiocyanate double-coupling method. The chymotryptic peptides were aligned by overlapping sequences of tryptic peptides and by homology with another tymovirus, <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus. The belladonna mottle virus is more closely related to <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus than to turnip yellow mosaic virus, the type member of this group, as evident from the sequence homologies of 57 and 32 %, respectively. The accumulation of basic residues at the amino terminus implicated in RNA-protein interactions in many spherical plant viruses was absent in all the three sequences. Interestingly, the amino-terminal region is the least conserved among the tymoviruses. The longest stretch of conserved sequence between belladonna mottle virus and <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus was residues 34 - 44, whereas it was residues 96 - 102 in the case of belladonna mottle virus and turnip yellow mosaic virus. A tetrapeptide in the region (residues 154 - 157) was found to be common for all the three sequences. It is possible that these conserved regions (residues 34 - 44, 96 - 102, 154 - 157) are involved in either intersubunit or RNA-protein interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} compn. of {{belladonna}} mottle virus coat protein indicated a high proline content like in other tymoviruses. The N-terminus of the protein {{was blocked by}} an acetyl group and CNBr cleavage yielded 19 -, 15 -, 14 -, 5 -, and 4 -kilodalton (K) fragments. Of these, only 15 and 4 K fragments were due to the cleavage at methionine residues, whereas the other fragments were products of acid hydrolysis. The 4 K fragment was sequenced by manual dimethylaminoazobenzene isothiocyanate/phenyl isothiocyanate double coupling method. This sequence of 43 amino acids {{was similar to the}} C-terminal sequence of <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus coat protein. The residues 142 - 160 of <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus coat protein previously identified as a probable site of RNA-protein interactions showed 83 % homol. with the N-terminal sequence of the 4 K fragment of belladonna mottle virus coat protein...|$|E
40|$|On {{centrifugation}} in a CsCl {{density gradient}} the three tymoviruses, <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic,</b> wild cucumber mosaic, and okra mosaic, separate {{into a major}} bottom component and several less dense minor components. The RNA of the top component is composed of about 90 % tRNA and 10 % of an approximately 250 000 dalton messenger RNA. The latter induced the synthesis of coat protein when translated in wheat-germ and rabbit-reticulocyte cell-free systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Begomoviruses {{have emerged}} as serious problem for {{vegetable}} and fiber crops in the recent past, frequently in tropical and subtropical region of the world. The association of begomovirus with <b>eggplant</b> yellow <b>mosaic</b> disease is hitherto unknown apart from one report from Thailand. A survey in Nagpur, Central India, in 2009 - 2010 showed severe incidence of <b>eggplant</b> yellow <b>mosaic</b> disease. Here, we have identified and characterized a begomovirus responsible for the newly emerging yellow <b>mosaic</b> disease of <b>eggplant</b> in India. Results The complete DNA-A and DNA-B genomic components of the causative virus were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA-A showed that it shared highest 97. 6 % identity with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus -India[India:Udaipur:Okra: 2007] and lowest 87. 9 % identity with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus -India[India:NewDelhi:Papaya: 2005], while DNA-B showed highest 94. 1 % identity with ToLCNDV-IN[IN:UD:Ok: 07] and lowest 76. 2 % identity with ToLCNDV-India[India:Lucknow]. Thus, it appears that this begomovirus is a variant of ubiquitous ToLCNDV and hence, we suggest the name ToLCNDV-India[India:Nagpur:Eggplant: 2009] for this variant. The pathogenicity of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg: 09] isolate was confirmed by agroinfiltraion and dimeric clones of DNA-A and DNA-B induced characteristic yellow <b>mosaic</b> symptoms in <b>eggplants</b> and leaf curling in tomato plants. Conclusion This is the first report of a ToLCNDV variant moving to a new agriculturally important host, eggplant and causing yellow mosaic disease. This is also a first experimental demonstration of Koch's postulate for a begomovirus associated with <b>eggplant</b> yellow <b>mosaic</b> disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Complementary DNA was {{transcribed}} from turnip {{yellow mosaic}} virus RNA, {{using the method}} of Taylor et al. (1). The purified cDNA thus obtained sedimented between 2 and 4 S and was a mostly uniform transcript of template RNA. It hybridized with a sharp transition to homologous TYMV-RNA (Crt 1 / 2 = 2. 7 x 10 (- 2)), but showed {{a low level of}} hybridization (less than 5 %) to the RNAs of two other tymoviruses, namely Andean potato latent virus and <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of the first 59 nucleotides from the 3 '-OH terminus of high-molecular-weight <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus RNA has been determined by standard radio-chemical techniques. The fragment was identified among the products of partial T 1 RNase digestion by making use of the reverse migration, at pH 2. 5, of the 3 '-OH terminal oligonucleotide. No abnormal bases were found. A model of secondary structure may be constructed for this fragment, which is known to fix valine {{in the presence of}} valyl-tRNA synthetase. Its relation to the structures of genuine tRNAs and to the 3 '-OH termini of other viral RNAs that also accept amino acids is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The reverse {{transcriptase}} of avian myeloblastosis virus catalyzes {{the synthesis of}} complementary DNA {{in the presence of}} turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RNA template and oligo(dG) 6 primer. The transcription product (single-stranded cDNA) had an estimated molecular weight of 150, 000; it hybridized with TYMV-RNA, <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus RNA, and Andean potato latent virus RNA, which are all members of the tymovirus group, but not with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA. It is concluded that all three tymovirus RNA preparations have common nucleotide sequences not shared with TMV-RNA. Furthermore, it appears that reverse transcription of TYMV-RNA preparations occurs in the absence of poly(A) at the 3 ′-end of genome RNA, when primed with oligo(dG) 6. © 1977.

40|$|Two {{established}} antiviral agents, dihydroxypropyladenine (RS) -DHPA and bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVDU) {{were evaluated}} for their inhibitory effects on 4 plant viruses: Tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus X (PVX), <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus (EMV) and a potyvirus isolated from Solanum palinacanthum (Poty-Sp). Using the leaf disc incubation test, BVDU proved virtually inactive while (RS) -DHPA efficiently inhibited EMV and Poty-Sp when applied at concentrations {{as low as}} 5 mg/l. TMV was less susceptible to the chemical while PVX could be inhibited at drug concentrations of 100 mg/l. To achieve a similar inhibitory effect in the leaf spray test, concentrations up to 250 and 500 mg/l were required. Using these tests no phytotoxicity was observed with (RS) -DHPA {{at any of the}} concentrations used. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of {{the primary}} {{structures}} of <b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus (EMV) and turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) coat proteins shows that 32 ~ of their amino acids are conserved. Alignment of the two sequences requires only one deletion near the N terminus and two insertions at the C terminus of TYMV coat protein. Although the coat protein of EMV is on average less hydrophobic than that of TYMV, structural predictions yield fairly similar conformations for the two proteins, apart from the N terminus. Neither coat protein possesses an accumulation of basic residues able to form the strong ionic RN A-protein interactions observed in several other isometric viruses. The nature of the amino acid exchanges seems {{to be different from}} that seen in families of homologous proteins. The highly conserved regions encompass a (probably weak) potential RNA-prote in interaction site. Implications for the structure and stability of small isometric viruses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Three tRNA-associated {{properties}} of a representative set of tymoviral RNAs have been quantitatively assessed using higher plant (wheat germ) proteins: aminoacylation, EF- 1 alpha*GTP binding, and 3 '-adenylation of 3 '-CC {{forms of the}} RNAs by CTP, ATP:tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The RNAs fall into three classes differing in the extent of tRNA mimicry. Turnip yellow mosaic (TYMV) and kennedya yellow mosaic virus RNAs had activities in all three properties {{similar to those of}} a higher plant tRNAValtranscript, and thus are remarkable tRNA mimics. Although the isolated approximately 83 nt long tRNA-like structures showed high activity in these assays, in the case of TYMV, the 6318 nt long TYMV RNA was an even better substrate for valylation. <b>Eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus RNA, which has a differently constructed acceptor stem pseudoknot, differed from the above tymoviral RNAs in binding more weakly to EF- 1 alpha*GTP. Erysimum latent virus RNA, which lacks an identifiable anticodon domain, could not be valylated and had very low 3 '-adenylation activity. The range of tRNA mimicry within the tymovirus genus thus ranges from extremely highly developed to minimal. The implications {{on the role of the}} tRNA mimicry in viral biology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Quatro isolados do vírus do mosaico da berinjela (EMV - "eggplant mosaic virus" - grupo tymovírus) foram armazenados a partir de extratos foliares de hospedeiras com sintomas sistêmicos. Os virus EMV-Al (isolado de Abelia), EMV-Sc (isolado da Escócia), -ts (estirpe-padrão) e VNBT (vírus da necrose branca do tomateiro), que induzem sintomas em Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. murale, C. quinoa (Família Chenopodiaceae) Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum e Nicotiana glutinosa (Solanaceae), foram conservados em extratos destas plantas, à temperatura ambiente, em geladeira e em congelador. A infectividade dos vírus, em diferentes períodos de armazenamento, foi testada em plantas de datura e glutinosa, para se determinar a longevidade in vitro. Constatou-se que, quando guardados em baixas temperaturas,os extratos preservam por mais tempo a infectividade dos vírus. No caso de datura e glutinosa, por exemplo, resultados positivos foram obtidos até 413 e 282 dias de armazenamento, respectivamente, em congelador. Entretanto, com relação às espécies de Chenopodium testadas, mesmo alguns extratos recém-preparados conduziram a resultados negativos, confirmando a presença de inibidores de infecção viral nestas plantas. Das três espécies, é sugerida a utilização apenas de C. quinoa para o preparo de extratos visando preservar estes vírus e, assim mesmo, por um período relativamente curto (entre 53 e 80 dias). A avaliação geral dos resultados mostra que, para os tymovírus estudados neste trabalho, é possível conservar a infectividade através da técnica de armazenamento de extratos foliares de plantas sistemicamente infectadas. Four {{isolates}} of EMV (<b>eggplant</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus - tymovirus group) were {{preserved in}} crude extracts from systemically-infected plants. EMV-Al (Abelia strain), EMV-Sc (Scottish strain), EMV-ts (type-strain) and TWNV (tomato white necrosis virus) which induce symptoms in Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. murale, C. quinoa (Family Chenopodiaceae), Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum and Nicotiana glutinosa (family Solanaceae) plants were maintened in leaf extrats obtained from these species. The extracts were kept at room temperature, at about 5 +C and at about 20 +C. Sap containing viruses were periodically inoculated in test-plants (datura and glutinosa) {{in order to}} determine the longevity in vitro. It was verified that viruses remained infective for longer periods if extratcs were kept at low temperatures as compared with those maintained at room temperature. In the case of sap juice from datura and glutinosa plants, EMV isolates remained infective respectively up to 413 and 282 days at about - 20 +C. However, many negative results were obtained with Chenopodium species even when freshly prepared leaf juice were used. This fact may be understood by the presence of virus inhibitors in these plants. Only C. quinoa is a valuable host to be used to preserve four EMV isolates, although for a short period (more than 53 and less than 80 days). The present paper reports the successful use of keeping infected leaf juices for preserving the infectivity of some tymoviruses...|$|E
