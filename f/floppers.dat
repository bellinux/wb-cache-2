40|$|The {{experiments}} detailed {{within this}} thesis have measured the {{distortion of the}} superfluid energy gap in high magnetic field and the dissipation for an object in uniform linear motion through superfluid 3 He-B. The latter experiments led to an astonishing discovery of no discontinuity in the dissipation for an object in uniform linear motion at the Landau critical velocity. The experiments were performed in a “Lancaster style” nested experimental cell at ultra-low temperatures within the ballistic limit. In {{the first set of}} experiments we studied two almost identical quartz tuning fork resonators with different vibration directions with respect to the vertical magnetic field. One vibrated along the field direction and the other vibrated in the horizontal plane. Our measurements have shown that the critical velocity for the vertical fork decreases significantly with increasing field, dropping to almost 60 % of its original value as the highest field is approached. However, there is very little change of the critical velocity for the horizontal fork. Our data shows good agreement with theoretical predictions and previous experiments using vibrating wires. During measurements at high magnetic fields, 300 mT to 330 mT, we observed discontinuities in the velocity response for very small changes in driving force. This behaviour might be due to vortex generation around the vibrating object and a subsequent shielding effect, previously observed in the response of a large vibrating wire (with diameter of 100 µm, similar to a typical fork dimension). Intriguingly the detailed behaviour also appears to depend on the orientation of the tuning fork with respect to the magnetic field direction. The second set of experiments used a novel measurement tool referred to as the “flopper”. The idea behind the development of the <b>flopper</b> was to have a low frequency device with low Q-factor that could be moved in an arbitrary fashion. The <b>flopper</b> is a large 25 × 9 mm goalpost-shaped NbTi vibrating wire. With AC current the wire can be driven at its resonance frequency or by using a DC linear stroke it can be moved over a controlled distance within the cell. By adding a high frequency “probe” signal on top of the DC signal we calibrated the position of the <b>flopper</b> with respect to the cell. We performed DC strokes of the <b>flopper</b> over short distances within the cell at various velocities. This led to us discovering that the dissipation of uniform linear motion at velocities exceeding the Landau velocity did not show any discontinuity. Since the critical Landau velocity is so fundamental in the understanding of superfluidity, this was a considerable surprise. The comparisons between AC and DC motion {{led to the development of}} a model to describe the dissipation processes in 3 He-B...|$|R

5000|$|Fosbury {{continued}} to refine his technique, developing a curved, J-shaped approach run.

Fosbury made little-to-no use of his arms at takeoff, failing to [...] "pump" [...] them upwards, keeping them down, close to his body: {{the next generation of}} <b>floppers</b> would add an arm pump. Fosbury's key discovery was the need to adjust his point-of-takeoff as the bar was raised.

To increase [...] "flight time," [...] Fosbury moved his takeoff farther and farther away from the bar (and the pit). Jumpers have a natural tendency to be drawn in closer to the bar and it requires mental discipline to move out, rather than in. By way of comparison, classic Straddle jumpers plant their take-off foot in the same place every time, less than one foot away from a line parallel with the bar. Photographs of Fosbury attempting heights above 7 ft show him taking off nearly 4 ft out from the bar.|$|E

5000|$|American and Soviet jumpers {{were the}} most {{successful}} {{for the next four}} decades, and they pioneered the evolution of the straddle technique. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll, but rotated their (belly-down) torso around the bar, obtaining the most economical clearance up to that time.

Valeriy Brumel took over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped up his approach run, took the record up to , and won the Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident ended his career. American coaches, including two-time NCAA champion Frank Costello of the University of Maryland, flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches. However, it would be a solitary innovator at Oregon State University, Dick Fosbury, who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern Cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would likely have broken his neck in the old, sawdust landing pits. After he used this Fosbury flop to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread around the world, and soon <b>floppers</b> were dominating international high jump competitions.

40|$|The vehicle ingress and egress are {{important}} {{issues for the}} automotive industry, both for minimizing assembly work load and for maximizing end-users’ comfort. Digital human modeling tools are used for evaluating and visualizing these issues. The assembler and end-user {{are more or less}} performing the very same entering task if the vehicles have identical geometrical prerequisites. The major difference is the vehicle speed; an assembler is entering a vehicle slightly moving forward on the assembly line with a speed of 5 meter/minute whereas the end user’s vehicle is standing still. The human motion when entering a car is a complex biomechanical process, which affects many different body parts. Car ingress techniques, such as <b>flopper,</b> swiveler, and glider vary among humans; for which humans’ agility may be one affecting factor. Agility is affected by joint diseases, which is more frequent among older people.

40|$|Jack-up barges are {{commonly}} used for marine operations in the offshore oil and gas, and offshore wind industries. A critical phase within the marine operation activities is the positioning of the jack-up legs onto the seabed. During this process, large impact velocities and forces may arise from the barge’s heave, roll and pitch motions, and structural damage of the legs can occur. This paper numerically investigates {{the effect of a}} <b>flopper</b> stopper (FS) on the motion responses of a jack-up barge from the offshore wind industry. The FS is known as a passive roll compensation device. It is suspended {{from the side of the}} barge by means of wire ropes and cantilever beams. A simple geometry of an FS is proposed, and the working principle introduced. For the loading condition before the leg-soil impact occurs, global dynamic analyses of the coupled system are conducted. Characteristic values of impact velocities are used to establish the jack-up operational limits in terms of the significant wave height and peak period. By comparing the operational limits for the barge with and without FS, it is found that FS should be placed on the weather side. At beam seas, the current FS can lead to a maximum increase in the operational wave height limit of 35 %, whereas for the other wave headings, it may not be beneficial to use FS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of these experiments were to: a) Determine the procedure required to obtain synchronised motion and wave time series. b) Collect sufficient data for valid comparison with empirically and theoretically derived predictions of pitch heave and roll {{response of the}} chosen vessel. c) Identify {{the effect of the}} following on vessel response:. Wave direction (vessel heading). Tether height. Steadying sail. <b>Flopper</b> stopper d) Measure the transverse metacentric height of the vessel. e) Assess the value of calm water roll decay tests for roll motion characterisation. Two types of experiment were conducted [...] free roll decay tests and irregular wave tests. An inclining test was also conducted. The vessel used was a 10 m sailing yacht. Motions were recorded for the free roll decay tests with and without the mainsail hoisted, in very light winds. The irregular wave tests were conducted again in very light winds with the vessel anchored. Motions were recorded with and without the mainsail hoisted, and with sails down for a range of wave headings. Wave direction was altered by roping the vesssel across the waves. Measurements were also taken for one set of conditions with a flopperstopper deployed. The waves were measured both by remote, unsynchronised CMST wave recorders and a previously untried wave buoy deployed from the vessel generating data time-synchronised with the motions data. Analysis of the roll decay tests yielded damping ratios b of 0. 079 and 0. 025 for mainsail hoisted and mainsail stowed respectively. The roll period of 3. 8 sec did not change significantly with the hoisting of the mainsail, and was very similar to the peak roll response frequency in the irregular wave tests.

Ngilu then represented the Social Democratic Party of Kenya. She finished fifth.Later, she joined National Party of Kenya. In the December 2002 general election, her party {{was part of the}} National Rainbow Coalition (NARC). The coalition {{went on to win the}} elections, and President Mwai Kibaki appointed her as Minister of Health when he named his Cabinet on 3 January 2003. Ngilu was seen as a new school member in the government, as opposed to old school members like John Michuki and President Kibaki.She was also appointed NARC chairperson. However, she was left stranded after the Liberal Democratic Party left the coalition after the defeat of the Government-sponsored draft constitution, while most of the remaining NARC members founded the new Narc-Kenya party, though NARC is still officially the ruling party. She has been viewed as a flip <b>flopper</b> who could not decide whether she was in the government between 2003 and 2007 or against the government.On 31 July 2007, Ngilu took Ann Njogu, a protester, to a hospital after Njogu had allegedly been beaten by police. Ngilu was then accused of helping Njogu escape the police, and she was arrested on 2 August before being released on bail. She reported to the headquarters of the Criminal Investigations Department on 3 August as she was ordered, but would not leave her car, saying that she should either be charged or released. Later on the same day the Nairobi High Court ruled that Ngilu's arrest was illegal, and she was allowed to leave. According to Ngilu's lawyer, she was not aiding an escape and Njogu was returned to the police by the hospital a day after she was taken there.On 5 October 2007, Ngilu announced her support for the Orange Democratic Movement and its presidential candidate, Raila Odinga, in the December 2007 general election; she has compared Odinga to Nelson Mandela. She initially said that she was remaining in the government, despite backing Kibaki's main rival. However, her dismissal from the government by Kibaki was announced on 6 October.Ngilu was re-elected to her seat from Kitui Central in the December 2007 parliamentary election. Kibaki won the presidential election according to official results, but this was disputed by the ODM, and a violent crisis developed. The crisis was eventually resolved with a power-sharing agreement, and in the grand coalition Cabinet named on 13 April 2008 and sworn in on 17 April, Ngilu was appointed as Minister of Water and Irrigation.Ngilu showed support for Raila Odinga in running for Presidential bid in Kenyan elections 2013. But later changed her mind for launching her presidential bid on 2 September 2013 through her Narc Political Party.|$|R
