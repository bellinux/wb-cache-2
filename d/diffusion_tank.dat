40|$|Two bottom ashes, one air {{pollution}} control (APC) residue and one fly ash from three different Swedish {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) plants were characterised regarding the leaching of environmentally relevant components. Characterisation was performed using a <b>diffusion</b> <b>tank</b> leaching test. The impact of carbonation on the release of eight critical components, i. e., Cl(-), Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Se, SO(4) (2 -) and Zn, was assessed at a lab-scale and showed carbonation to have a more pronounced demobilising effect on critical components in bottom ashes than in APC residue and fly ash. From grate type incinerator bottom ash, the release of Cr decreased by 97 %, by 63 % for Cu and by 45 % for Sb. In the investigated APC residue, the releases of Cr, Se and Pb were defined as critical, although they either remained unaffected or increased after carbonation. Cl(-) and SO(4) (2 -) remained mobile after carbonation in all investigated residues...|$|E

40|$|A {{portable}} direct methanol {{fuel cell}} stack is characterised, together with a novel methanol-feeding concept. The amounts of water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} cathode and anode outlets respectively are measured and compared with calculated values based on parameters found in the literature. Due to methanol crossover, the stack temperature already increases rapidly at open circuit voltage, which also indicates substantial losses. The efficiency of the stack is found by two methods to be somewhat less than 25 % at 20 W. A passive methanol supply to the feed loop is achieved by placing a permeable tube in a concentrated methanol storage <b>tank.</b> <b>Diffusion</b> of methanol through the tube walls into the methanol-water flow assures an increase in concentration. Experimental investigations of such a tube are compared with simulations...|$|R

Using 93 # gasoline, diesel and water as working medium, the leakage <b>diffusion</b> characteristic of <b>tank</b> floor was researched based on a experimental system. The research results testify the reliability and sensitivity of the experimental system. Furtherly, the influencing rule of leak positions and leak volume (Q) on the leakage diffusion was studied by using 93 # gasoline. The results show that {{for the same amount}} of leakage, the leakage on the center of tank floor diffused quickly, was the most easily detected part; and that {{on the edge of the}} tank floor was the most difficult to be detected. For leakage occurred in same position, the volume fraction (φ) in pipeline increased with the increase of leakage. The result of research has a great significance for fastening localization of double bottom {{structure of}} oil storage tank...|$|R

According to the {{techniques}} of the mashing and the Gaussian plume modeling, combining all kinds of the factors variation, such as the tanks leak velocity, the leak height, the wind direction and speed, and the environmental stabilization grade, the concentration distributing rules of the toxic gas continuous <b>diffusion</b> in the <b>tank</b> farm are simulated. Firstly, focusing on the central of the tank farm in chemical industrial park, mashes the tank farm as the research units for quantitative analysis and superposition calculation. Secondly, constructs the diffusion concentration distributing model of the toxic gas leak based on the Gaussian plume theory. Finally, by {{the condition of the}} single-leak hazard installation and the multiple-leak major hazard installations, the toxic gas continuous diffusion algorithms are studied, viz. in accordance with any of the influence factors variation, carve up the time sections, and then basing on Matlab technique, integrating the concentration superposition effects, simulate the concentrated distribution process of the noxious substance during the influence fields. Taking ammonia gas tank farm leakage as example, the simulation results show that the method may provide technological support for major hazard prevention and control in chemical industry park...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that about 15 to 20 percent of the vehicle hydrocarbon (HC) emission were due to evaporation of fuel. Hence a need was felt to understand the extent of evaporative emission from gasoline fuel system. A polycarbonate fuel tank that is predominantly used in two wheeled vehicles is considered for study. Emission can surface to atmosphere in three modes; <b>diffusion</b> through fuel <b>tank</b> wall, escaping through vent in tank and when fuel tank cap is opened for refueling. The average temperature condition which prevails in south India {{which is in the}} range of 27 o C to 34 oC was considered. From which temperatures which were at proximity to peak high and low day time were chosen. The complete set up was placed in open atmosphere to replicate the working environment. The emission constituents and its levels were measured by conducting the test particularly for averaged out day time high and low temperature condition. Further diffusion test was conducted within a range of 34 oC to 36 oC, this temperature is considered to be range of maximum temperature which prevails in south India. From which a temperature was chosen and the test was conducted. This comparative study gives an indication of emission and its quantity from the fuel tank at the ambient temperature...|$|R

40|$|Contaminated sediments in Norway {{represent}} {{a significant problem}} for the public’s health {{as well as the}} environment, especially in urban coastal regions where former harbour areas are converted to residential zones requiring more strict environmental standards. As a result, environmentally motivated remediation efforts led by the Norwegian authorities and supported by the public and independent institutions have become increasingly important to solve the problem. The method of Solidification and Stabilization (S/S) of contaminated sediments is one of the alternatives proposed for mitigation in such situations. This thesis {{is part of a larger}} research project with respect to S/S of contaminated sediments, where the following participants are involved: Norcem, The Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Rambøll, Skanska Norway, and NOAH. The larger project is financed by the Research Council of Norway (NRC) and this thesis is worked under the supervision of the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI). Leaching test is one important aspect in the environmental assessment of the remedial measures of solidified and stabilized (S/S) contaminated sediments. Selection of an appropriate test or combination of tests is of vital importance for the proper judgment of results, as well as for predicting the long term release of S/S contaminants into the environment. The experimental program reported here consists of six different leaching tests carried out on the S/S Trondheim contaminated sediments to assess the leaching of four inorganic pollutants Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. The main objectives of this investigation were to study how the performance of different leaching tests affects the release of inorganic contaminants and to find the most suitable leaching test(s) for predicting contaminants release from the S/S materials. These leaching tests performed are as follows: • Static <b>diffusion</b> test (<b>tank</b> test), • Dynamic <b>diffusion</b> test (modified <b>tank</b> test), • Batch leaching test for crushed material, • Up-flow percolation test (column test), • Batch leaching test for monolithic samples, and • Leaching test of monoliths with magnetic agitation, The diffusion tests (static and dynamic) were performed in accordance with the norm EA NEN 7375 : 2004 protocol, for leaching of inorganic components. The difference between the two diffusion tests lied in the way the S/S samples are exposed to the leachant. In the dynamic diffusion test the leachant was constantly circulated in the cell throughout the course of the experiment using a peristaltic pump whereas in the static test, the leachant was kept stationary. In both tests the leachant was intermittently renewed at specific intervals determined by the norm designed to maintain a significant diffusive driving force. The batch leaching test for crushed material was performed in accordance to the European Standard EN 12457 - 2, 2002 at liquid solid (L/S) ratio of 10. The up-flow percolation test was performed in accordance to the European committee for standardization CEN/TS 14405, 2004. However, some modifications were made to the test setup given the low permeability and monolithic nature of the sample. The batch leaching test for monolithic samples was an experimental test designed specifically for the purpose of this thesis. It is a hybrid test made from the batch and diffusion tests. The objective was to assess the possibility of finding an alternative type of test that is more suitable for testing S/S materials than the batch test while is not as demanding as the diffusion test with respect to the test duration. An L/S ratio of 10 and test duration of 24 hours were used to perform this hybrid leaching test for monolithic samples. The experiments for this type of test were not successful since much of the monoliths were largely damaged during agitation in the end-over-end shaker. In such circumstance, interpretation of the data is a rather futile exercise since the tests were deemed not reproducible. As such, a new leaching test was designed with the same objective with the consideration that the monolithic structure is preserved (i. e. not disintegrated). This test was called leaching test of monoliths with magnetic agitation. The magnetic agitation test was performed at three different times: 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 96 hrs. Sea water was used as the leachant in all of the tests performed. This selection was made based on the fact that S/S contaminated sediments under study are considered to be exposed to this type of leachant in field conditions. The results indicated that the total composition of the studied metals (Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn) in the S/S contaminated sediments is mostly irrelevant for their leaching prediction. Further, different types of tests give different contaminants release estimations. Amongst the leaching tests performed, the diffusion test was considered to be the most suitable test for determining the long-term leaching behaviour of the S/S contaminated sediments...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An extensive study {{has been made of}} the factors affecting sample dispersion in flow injection analysis. This has included the effect of different manifold parameters on peak height and shape, and the use of various flow models to describe the physical processes involved. The factors investigated included sample flow-rate, tube length and diameter, sample volume, and the diffusion coefficient of the solute. The role of the detector has also been investigated, and was found to exert a strong influence on the observed dispersion behaviour of a flow injection manifold. In the light of this, a low volume flow cell was constructed which minimised the contribution of the detector to dispersion. Different modes of sample injection ("time" and "slug" injection) have been studied, and an automatic valve constructed in connection with the work. Both new and existing flow models have been evaluated in terms of their ease-of-use and ability to predict peak shape. Conditions for which the different models were valid were derived both experimentally and from consideration of the assumptions of the models. The applications of such models to the characterisation and design of flow manifolds has also been considered, and this approach compared to the purely theoretical and empirical approaches that have been described in the literature. The models examined in this thesis are the convection, <b>diffusion,</b> tanks-in-series, well-stirred <b>tank,</b> two-tanks in- parallel and two-tanks-in-series models. Finally, the practical implications of this work for the design of flow injection manifolds and the derivation of so-called "rules for dispersion" have been discussed, and suggestions made for further areas of research...|$|R
30|$|The other {{planning}} {{implications that}} {{can be drawn from}} the present study are that individuals learn from and trust their cohesive partners. This suggests that program planners or NGO workers might take advantage of satisfied tank owners to talk to individuals in close group meetings and workshops organized in a neighborhood. The success stories and personal opinion of existing tank adopters could be documented and distributed in brochures, newsletters, or video promotion for potential adopters to accelerate the social contagion of adoption. Potential adopters are affected by cohesive group partners under these groupings; religious, political, and cultural. These groups and organizations then should be involved in the dissemination process like promoting rainwater tanks during cultural and religious festivals and by direct communications with religious gurus and local leaders. Another strategy to convince potential tank adopters would have the satisfied tank adopters share their experiences adopting the innovation. Our results show that individuals share information among cohesive group partners. Therefore, if the tank owners are satisfied with the tank, penetration of the technology happens more smoothly. But, if the pioneers of tank adopters are not satisfied, their experience would restrict adoption within the same cohesive group. A cohesive group helps the diffusion process only within the group and it sometimes produces redundant information and restricts new information and knowledge from entering the group. It is the structural equivalent group members who facilitate the diffusion of innovative technology from one group to another (Burt 1987). Individuals generally do not share tank information among structural equivalent group members, and thus the <b>diffusion</b> of rainwater <b>tank</b> knowledge may be a challenge amongst the respective groups. One way to overcome this bottleneck is to use NGO workers to find the opinion leaders in the promotional program. Observation is a method of learning closely linked with geographical proximity and popularity. Therefore, more model tank demonstrations are needed at various public and popular places including schools, religious centers, clubs, and markets. Furthermore, additional information about the tank (such as cost, size, and purpose) should be provided for potential adopters as comprehensive information about the innovation cannot be deduced by merely observing the tank. Since the role of mass media was negligible in Morrelganj Municipality, local NGOs might test advertising through TV and newspapers to provide basic information about the tanks to potential adopters who have TVs and those with newspaper subscriptions. Moreover, door-to-door campaigns by NGO workers are recommended to accelerate the promotion of rainwater tank adoption.|$|R
