5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E
5|$|Sporadic privately {{operated}} ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills (Glenora) {{were initially}} a primitive affair. In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped {{out of the}} bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> the February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines.|$|E

5|$|The Grantham Canal is a canal {{that runs}} for 33 miles (53km) from Grantham, <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> 18 locks to West Bridgford where it joins the River Trent. It was built {{primarily}} {{to allow for}} the transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797, and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, after which it declined, and was finally closed in 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{assigned}} as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, {{only to have}} its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> the roof. General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, {{although much of the}} old altar and furnishings were not replaced.|$|E
5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E

5|$|By July 2000, {{the film}} was being written for New Line by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used {{the idea of a}} Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct, and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a {{completed}} script. In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release. Screenplay drafts were written by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and David Hayter, and pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. After two years of unsuccessful development, and the deal with Cassavetes <b>falling</b> <b>through,</b> New Line Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|Howard gets a {{call from}} her sister, who has {{recently}} found a tumor on her breast. The sister has just learned her husband has been having an affair. Although Howard is initially hesitant to confide in Felton, he eventually surprises her by offering genuine words of comfort. A drunken man dressed as Santa Claus (Cleve Wall) is arrested for threatening his wife and {{a crowd of people}} with a water pistol. Later, the detectives get a call that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> the ceiling and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal. Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case. As the new day dawns, Gee has the detectives assemble on the roof so he can spray them with a garden hose to cool them off.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> is the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E

Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.|$|E
25|$|Animal aerial {{locomotion}} can {{be divided}} into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using unpowered aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as their muscles are capable of doing so.|$|E

They captured equipment, broke up many of the Spanish siege guns, and inflicted casualties of nearly 400 men (most of whom were captured).|$|E
