50|$|The Church of St John the Baptist in Kościelec {{had been}} built {{probably}} in the 14th century in Gothic style and it was preserved as such until 1843/45 when {{a decision was made}} for a <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the church due to its rather poor shape. Among other interesting furnishings of the church is the 19th-century high altar and black Dębniki marble epitaphs of the former owners of Kościelec, which until the recent renovation used to be {{on the walls of the}} presbytery.

50|$|The Korean War {{left all}} of the {{electrification}} in Korea destroyed, and for several years the 15 electric locomotives in the North sat unused. The Korean State Railway had not abandoned its plans to electrify, however, and along with the <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> its severely damaged infrastructure, re-electrification of previously electrified lines and new electrification of other lines was begun, and in 1956, the electrification of the Yangdŏk-Ch'ŏnsŏng section of the P'yŏngra Line was restored. At the same time, the 15 Japanese-built electric locomotives were refurbished at the engine shops at Yangdŏk.|$|R
50|$|Some heavy rifts were {{detected}} {{in the construction of}} the church in the 19th century. This was a reason for <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the church made by architect Mocker. He tore down the old gothic platform in the west part and replaced it with a replica. In the windows of the nave he replaced old tracery for the new ones. Both northern portals were changed. The main portal was only fixed by Mocker but the other one smaller lancet arch is Mocker’s pseudogothic replacement for the original gothic portal.|$|R
40|$|Evidence from {{sedimentology}} {{is combined}} with that of palynology and macropalaeobotany {{to arrive at a}} <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the Early Eocene environment in Macquarie Harbour in western Tasmania and its major vegetation types. The environment is interpreted as estuarine with a range of subenvironments including estuarine mouth bar, fully subtidal sands, tidal flat with mangroves, and freshwater swamps. Supratidal freshwater swamp forest (sometimes conifer-dominated) was fringed with Nypa mangrove swamps in the high tidal regions. Non-vegetated tidal mud and sand flats occurred in regions with longer tidal submergence. The Macquaríe Harbour beds are given formation status and the Strahan Sand Member is defined...|$|R
40|$|The {{tails of}} extant {{crocodilians}} are anatomically the closest approximation of the tails of non-avian dinosaurs, {{and therefore a}} good starting point for any <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> non-avian dinosaur tail muscles. However, we here demonstrate some methodological problems using crocodile tails, firstly regarding the <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> tail mobility from osteology, secondly for the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> tail musculature for the quantification of muscle forces, especially the m. caudofemoralis longus, and thirdly with respect to the anatomical differences between crocodilians and non-avian dinosaurs, especially in relation to the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> m. caudofemoralis brevis. Our results show that, given the current limited knowledge of crocodilian tails, volumetric reconstructions should be created on the basis of more gross morphological data than is usually used, and that biomechanical studies should include sensitivity analysis with greater parameter ranges than often applied. preprin...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> a compactly {{supported}} function from its Fourier coefficients using compactly supported shearlet systems. We assume that only finitely many Fourier {{samples of the}} function are accessible and based on this finite collection of measurements an approximation is sought in a finite dimensional shearlet reconstruction space. We analyse this sampling and reconstruction process by a recently introduced method called generalized sampling. In particular by studying the stable sampling rate of generalized sampling we then show stable recovery of the signal is possible using an almost linear rate. Furthermore, we compare the result to the previously obtained rates for wavelets...|$|R
40|$|This article {{constructs}} time-varying labour value measures free of such {{restrictions and}} {{shows that they}} call for a radical re-evaluation of this century's debate on value. We exhibit a counter-example to the Okishio theorem in which labour-saving innovation leads to a continuously-falling profit rate, and a dynamic approach to the classical problem of transforming values into prices in which the sum of values {{is equal to the}} sum of prices while the sum of profits remains equal to the sum of surplus values. Elsewhere we have exhibited a computer simulation model using these values. A dynamic value measure is thus practical, necessary, and the basis for a <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> economics. ...|$|R
40|$|System R is an {{extension}} of system F that formalizes Reynolds' notion of relational parametricity. In system R, considerably more lambda-terms can be proved equal than in system F: for example, the encoded weak products of F are strong products in R. Also, many "theorems for free" à la Wadler can be proved formally in R. In this paper we describe a semantics for system R. As a first step, we give a precise and <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the per model of system F of Bainbridge et al., presenting it as a categorical model in the sense of Seely. Then we interpret system R in this model...|$|R

There was some commentary that the Observatory was being shut down or cut back, but in fact the Observatory staff welcomed the move. The old quarters in the castle were cramped and very poorly laid out for the Observatory's use. VORG research activities in Arizona continued unaffected.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, {{two years}} after the first {{revitalization}} of the facade, the building was assigned to the Vuk's Foundation for permanent use and management. The <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the building was done in 1997/98. This included work on the ceiling of the hall, stairs and railings which were successfully reconstructed, and a modern chandelier was added to light the main hall. In 2006 the front facade facing the street was repaired. The Cultural Heritage Protection Institute of the City of Belgrade published a monograph in 1996, written by art historian Milojko Gordić, about the building using its monumental name as the title - The Ministry of Education Building.|$|R
40|$|It {{comes to}} <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> {{obsolete}} main railroad tracks {{and development of}} railway corridors in Czech Republic. In relation to this, new railroad tunnels are built, or present ones are reconstructed. <b>Reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> old tunnel represents tunneling of new underground space. The cross section of singletrack tunnel is often enlarged to double-tracked one. New tunnel constructions are realized using New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) when blasting operations are one of driving technologies. Typical example of this reconstructed tunnel is tunnel in the mountain pass Jablunkov. Two single-track railroad old tunnels are situated in this location. The older tunnel (1871) operated {{at the present time}} as a provisional and the junger one (1917) reconstructed. Both of them are near one another. Experimental seismological measurement was realized in the reconstructed tunnel on the tunnel floor...|$|R

The bus station, which was located {{on the east side of}} the station (i.e. on the side of the city centre) is being split in two, with buses and trams arriving from the west of the city (among others the new suburb of Leidsche Rijn) terminating on the west side of the station to reduce traffic congestion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. By finding {{stress states}} which are {{consistent}} both with any existing experimental measurements and with elasticity theory, residual stress fields {{can often be}} reconstructed from incomplete measurement data. We discuss such methods <b>of</b> residual stress <b>reconstruction,</b> their implementation using finite element analysis, and the measurement strategies which enable them. In <b>general,</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> residual stress fields must be formulated as an inverse problem, which can usually be solved using stress basis functions. However, prior knowledge of {{the form of the}} residual stress field and/or underlying eigenstrain distribution often allows the problem to be reduced such that inverse methods become unnecessary, greatly simplifying the analysis. Two examples of when residual stress field reconstruction can be simplified in this way are given...|$|R
40|$|Although 3 D {{reconstruction}} from a monocular video {{has been}} an active area of research for a long time, and the resulting models offer great realism and accuracy, strong conditions must be typically met when capturing the video to make this possible.

We present a novel algorithm for modelling 3 D shapes from unstructured, unconstrained discontinuous footage. The technique is robust against dis-tractors in the scene, background clutter and even shot cuts. We show reconstructed models of objects, {{which could not be}} modelled by conventional Structure from Motion meth-ods without additional input. Finally, we present results <b>of</b> our <b>reconstruction</b> in the presence of shot cuts, show-ing the strength of our technique at modelling from existing footage. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop the}} general {{program of the}} {{unification}} of matter-dominated era with acceleration epoch for scalar-tensor theory or dark fluid. The <b>general</b> <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> single scalar-tensor theory is fulfilled. The explicit form of scalar potential for which the theory admits matter-dominated era, transition to acceleration and (asymptotically deSitter) acceleration epoch consistent with WMAP data is found. The interrelation of the epochs of deceleration-acceleration transition and matter dominance-dark energy transition for dark fluids with general EOS is investigated. We give several examples of such models with explicit EOS (using redshift parametrization) where matter-dark energy domination transition may precede the deceleration-acceleration transition. As some by-product, the reconstruction scheme is applied to scalar-tensor theory to define the scalar potentials which may produce the dark matter effect. The obtained modification of Newton potential may explain the rotation curves of galaxies. Comment: LaTeX 12 pages, 1 figure, extended version to appear in PR...|$|R

50|$|The {{church is}} a {{rectangular}} building, reconstructed in 1927, specific for its simple classical expression and a portal under the tower. The tower with a four-faced (functional) clock is terminated with a high roof. From three sides, {{the interior of the}} church is lined with a choir, resting on columns. The entrance area is adorned by an oil painting of Mošovce from the 19th century and the main nave hosts a painting depicting the last supper. The church's furnishings include an electrical organ, glass chandeliers and an altar with a pulpit. The rear part of the church contains 3 pronouncedly vertically elongated arch painted-glasswindows depicting biblical motives.
