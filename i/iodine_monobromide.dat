Halogen doping of the two nanocarbons has been examined using Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with electronic absorption spectroscopy and extensive theoretical calculations. The halogen molecules, being electron withdrawing in nature, induce distinct changes in the electronic states of both the SWNTs and graphene, which manifests with {{a change in the}} spectroscopic signatures. Stiffening of the Raman G-bands of the nanocarbons upon treatment with the different halogen molecules and the emergence of new bands in the electronic absorption spectra, both point {{to the fact that the}} halogen molecules are involved in molecular charge-transfer with the nanocarbons. The experimental findings have been explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest that the extent of charge-transfer depends on the electron affinities of the different halogens, which determines the overall spectroscopic properties. The magnitude of the molecular charge-transfer between the halogens and the nanocarbons generally varies in the order ICl > Br(2) > IBr > I(2), which is consistent with the expected order of electron affinities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} four distinct {{applications of}} ultrafast laser spectroscopy. Unimolecular photodissociation {{was one of}} the early applications of this technique and proved to be invaluable in furthering the understanding of unimolecular dissociation mechanisms. As such, the photodissociation of ketene represents one of the two systems where micro-canonical, state-to-state reaction rates, have been measured. Clocking of bimolecular reactions, while still in its infancy, provides a means of measuring the rate at which an elementary reaction actually occurs [...] isolated from other molecules. The rate at which the bimolecular reaction of bromine atoms with molecular iodine to form <b>iodine</b> <b>monobromide</b> has been measured at two collision energies. An area where ultrafast techniques are just now seeing application, is control of chemical reactions. This thesis illustrates an initial study, albeit limited, of how ultrashort light pulses can be used to "control" the outcome of a chemical reaction. The experiments here show how the natural wave-packet motion of the initially prepared B state iodine can be used to "control" whether or not xenon iodide is formed even when the necessary photons are available. Finally, cluster science is becoming a mature field within physical chemistry, but {{one of the goals of}} such work has been to make a connection between gas-phase studies and condensed-phase work. Small clusters, those not large enough to bridge this gap, have proven sufficiently interesting to monopolize the efforts of many groups. Again in a limited way, we have begun to study large clusters in the hope that these systems will truly show characteristics that are somehow intermediate to the gas-phase and condensed-phase characteristics. A dissociating iodine molecule surrounded by many argon atoms encounters an environment that significantly alters the time scales and overall mechanism for separation of the two iodine atoms.

I- 2 and 1. IBr respectively. Both complexes have been characterised crystallographically and contain a linear S-I-X (X = I or Br) moiety with the sulfur adopting a tetrahedral geometry taking into account the stereochemically active lone pairs. The S-I [2. 716 (3) ] and I-I [2. 808 (3) Angstrom] bond lengths in 1. I- 2 are similar to those reported for diiodine complexes of related thione donors. The adduct 1. IBr is the first crystallographically characterised thione-iodine monobromide charge-transfer complex. The S-I distance [2. 589 (2) Angstrom] is shorter than that in 1. I- 2, consistent with IBr being a stronger acceptor than I- 2. The I-Br distance [2. 7138 (11) Angstrom] is lengthened with respect to that in unco-ordinated IBr, but within bonding distance when compared to the sum of the van der Waals radii for iodine and bromine (3. 75 Angstrom).

O-Ethyl S-(2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D- thiogalactopyranosyl) dithiocarbonate (26) and O-isopropyl S-(2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosyl) dithiocarbonate (31) were prepared and found not to undergo methanolysis {{in the presence of}} iodine, or iodine in combination with DDQ. Methylthiomethyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-thio-galactopyranoside (53) and ethylthioalkyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosides 38 - 41 were prepared and found not to undergo iodine-mediated methanolysis. Of the mercaptoalkyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-thiogalactosides 52 - 55, mercaptopropyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (53) and mercaptobutyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (54) were found to glycoslate cyclohexanol, but with significant degradation observed by thin layer chromatography. Mercaptopropyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (64) and mercaptobutyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (65) were found to glycosylate cyclohexanol with no significant degradation. Carbohydrate acceptors methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzyl-α-D-mannopyranoside (72), methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzoyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (73), methyl 6 -O-benzoyl- 2, 3 -di-O-benzyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (74) and methyl 2, 4, 6 -tri-O-benzoyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (75) were prepared. Upon attempts at iodine-mediated glycosylation of these with 64, only the primary mannose acceptor 72 was glycosylated to a significant extent. An NMR study of the IH methylene resonances of ethylthiobutyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-acetyl-β-D- thiogalactopyranoside (40) showed that the remote sulfide group of this compound complexes significantly with iodine, whilst the anomeric sulfur does not.

Both the quantity and nucleophilicity of the glycosyl acceptors and the presence of potassium carbonate affected the speed of activation of the sulfoxides, and the anomeric stereocontrol in the products. It is proposed that reversible formation of the hypoiodites of the acceptors may be the reason for these observations...|$|E
40|$|Femtosecond time-resolved extreme-ultraviolet core-level {{absorption}} spectroscopy has {{developed into a}} powerful tool for investigating chemical dynamics due to its sensitivity for detecting changes in electronic structure. By probing the core-levels of atoms and molecules, dynamics may be monitored with elemental specificity, as well as localized sensitivity to the oxidation state around the atomic absorber. Previous experiments with this technique demonstrated the capability to quantitatively resolve strong-field ionization dynamics including the complete |j,m> quantum state distribution of Xe + and the dissociative ionization of CH 2 Br 2, both monitored in real-time with femtosecond resolution. In this thesis, the complete reconditioning of the experimental apparatus is described and its application to the study of vibrational wave packets created by strong-field ionization of Br 2 is discussed. Initially, the experimental apparatus was meant as a proof of principle demonstration for table-top extreme ultraviolet transient {{absorption spectroscopy}} based on a high-order harmonic generation source. To achieve the experiments discussed here, substantial changes were required to its construction concerning the high harmonic source and overall stability of the apparatus, which are discussed in terms of increasing the operation of the experiment to several days as opposed to a few hours, yielding an unprecedented spectral resolution after Fourier Transform of the signal versus pump-probe time delay for a table-top core-level spectrometer, better than 1. 5 cm - 1. The improvements to the apparatus are exploited in terms of examining the vibrational wave packet dynamics in Br 2 induced by optical strong-field ionization. First, extreme-ultraviolet transient absorption is established as a bond-length specific probe capable of resolving vibrational motion in Br 2 and due to a change in the transition amplitude and energy versus bond length of the 3 d 5 / 2, 3 / 2 core-level transitions to unoccupied molecular orbitals. Furthermore, the degree of coherence and beat composition of the 1 &Sigma + g ground state vibrational wave packet is established. Second, the preparation of vibrational wave packets by strong-field ionization of Br 2 is analyzed as a function of field intensity. At a field intensity near the threshold of ionization, selective depletion of the vibrational amplitude is observed near the inner turning point, corresponding to the minimum in the ionization energy for the unperturbed molecular potential energy curves. The observed superposition is determined to be primarily composed of the &nu 0 &nu 1 vibrational beat. As the field intensity is increased, perturbation of the potential curves results in preparation of the wave packet at longer internuclear separations, and the distortion of the potentials is directly observed by a shift in the core-level transition energy within the intense laser pulse. Moreover, the composition of the wave packet is found to involve higher vibrational levels, indicating the involvement of a Raman pumping mechanism in the preparation of the superposition. Third, several ongoing experiments utilize the unique instrumental capabilities including the elemental specificity and polarization dependence of the absorption. The elemental specificity and nuclear motion dependence of the core-level probe is utilized to investigate the correlated detection of vibrational wave packet dynamics in IBr on the iodine 4 d and bromine 3 d core-level absorptions simultaneously. Also, polarization dependent absorption of Xe 2 + looks to extend the quantitative measurements conducted for Xe + to determine the complete |j,m> state populations after sequential ionization. Lastly, polarization dependent measurements of the strong-field ionization of Br 2 suggest alignment between the molecular axis and the electric field of the ionizing pump at field intensities near the threshold for ionization, which is lost at higher field strengths. These studies expand the repertoire of capabilities for high-order harmonic generation beyond the proof of principle experiments and establish the technique as a practical tool for monitoring complex, ultrafast molecular dynamics by core-level probing. The capabilities of femtosecond transient absorption have since been expanded here to include the investigation of strong-field generated vibrational wave packets in molecular bromine. To this end, a theoretical model for determining the sensitivity of XUV absorption to valence vibrational motion generated by strong-field ionization was developed utilizing Restricted Excitation Window Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory coupled with internuclear separation, vibrational state sensitive Ammosov-Delone-Krainov tunnel ionization rates. This theoretical model, including details of traditional Ammosov-Delone-Krainov tunnel ionization rates, is presented in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the experimental changes incorporated into the apparatus for successful multi-day experiments for the determination of vibrational dynamics with ~ 1 cm- 1 spectral resolution. Demonstration of the sensitivity of XUV transient absorption to non-stationary ground state vibrational dynamics is then presented in Chapter 4, investigating the vibrational superposition generated in Br 2 after irradiation with a 1. 6 x 10 14 W/cm 2 driving pump pulse. Chapter 5 expounds upon the dependence on field intensity to the observed vibrational dynamics in Br 2 as well as Br 2 +. Chapter 6 discusses the currently ongoing experiments being conducted for ground state vibrational wave packet preparation in <b>iodine</b> <b>monobromide,</b> the determination of the complete |j,m> quantum state population of Xe 2 +, and the alignment of the molecular axis of Br 2 with the electric field of the ionizing 800 nm field following strong-field ionization. Chapter 6 also presents the conclusions of the experimental work presented here as well as the future outlook of XUV transient absorption spectroscopy in the broader perspective of investigating chemical reaction and dynamics...|$|E
