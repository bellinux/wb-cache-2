500|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer. She told MTV [...] "I wrote [...] about this guy that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song." [...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain. He gets up on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a tranny. I was like, 'Wait a minute, <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> barking up the wrong genre of tree?'" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E

500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> {{able to make}} this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't {{see myself as a}} number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|Religion, {{particularly}} Catholicism, appears both overtly and symbolically {{throughout the}} piece, {{and it is}} often made the brunt of a joke. Berger sings of looking for [...] "my Donna", giving it the double meaning of the woman he's searching for and the Madonna. During [...] "Sodomy", a hymn-like paean to all that is [...] "dirty" [...] about sex, the cast strikes evocative religious positions: the Piet√† and Christ on the cross. Before the song, Woof recites a modified rosary. [...] In Act II, when Berger gives imaginary pills to various famous figures, he offers [...] "a pill for the Pope". [...] In [...] "Going Down", after being kicked out of school, Berger compares himself to Lucifer: [...] "Just like the angel that fell / Banished forever to hell / Today <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> expelled / From high school heaven." [...] Claude becomes a classic Christ figure at various points in the script. [...] In Act I, Claude enters, saying, [...] "I am the Son of God. [...] I shall vanish and be forgotten," [...] then gives benediction to the tribe and the audience. [...] Claude suffers from indecision, and, in his Gethsemane {{at the end of}} Act I, he asks [...] "Where Do I Go?". [...] There are textual allusions to Claude being on a cross, and, in the end, he is chosen to give his life for the others. [...] Berger has been seen as a John the Baptist figure, preparing the way for Claude.|$|E

2500|$|A.K.Tolstoy {{entered the}} 1870s {{as a very}} sick man, {{suffering}} from asthma, angina pectoris, neuralgias and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking morphine. [...] "Now I'm feeling much better, at least the neuralgia's gone. But never before <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous," [...] he complained {{in a letter to}} poet Karolina Pavlova (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.|$|E

2500|$|Cherryh's works depict {{fictional worlds}} with great realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> so caught up in any tale as I have been in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E
2500|$|In 1853 Brahms went on {{a concert}} tour with Rem√©nyi. In late May the two visited the violinist and {{composer}} Joseph Joachim at Hanover. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played {{some of his own}} solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: [...] "Never {{in the course of my}} artist's life <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> more completely overwhelmed". This was the beginning of a friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim's wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883. Brahms also admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms's words) [...] "double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever". Bozarth notes that [...] "products of Brahms's study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included [...] "dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works." ...|$|E

She also presented her own three-part documentary called Jennie Bond's Royals on Channel 5 and in 2005, she presented the BBC's daytime coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show, alongside Charlie Dimmock. In the same year, Bond appeared in <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> <b>Been</b> Here Before? [...] More recently she appeared in Posh Swap on Five, where she {{was transformed into a}} Brummie woman. She had to convince two of her best friends she really was the Brummie lass. Bond was also the host for the first series of Great British Menu, in which different chefs have to compete by cooking meals; the winner of the first series had the chance to cook for the Queen on her 80th birthday. Bond has presented the BBC's Cash in the Attic. In 2006, she was a celebrity guest on Stars in Their Eyes where she sang as Debbie Harry. She presented the second series of Great British Menu during April and May 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956‚Äì1987) and Ross Porter (1977‚Äì2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one.
