5|$|About <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years ago, {{the newly}} {{captured}} star began {{to expand into}} a red giant (see stellar evolution).|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years. It will then expand more rapidly over about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E

5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|The CenturyLink Field Event Center {{connects to}} the stadium's west field plaza and {{consists}} of two exhibition halls, a conference room, and a concourse.

5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{established}} {{the first national}} monument, Devils Tower in Wyoming, on September 24, 1906. He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation.

King stated, [...] "I would find <b>half</b> of <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood’s budget.
