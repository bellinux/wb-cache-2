40|$|AbstractIn Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, {{the lower}} stay plate made of SS 316 LN in control plug has cut opening in three {{locations}} {{for the purpose}} of easiness of assembling the sampling tubes through the lower stay plate. These openings are then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> appropriate <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> bolted <b>with</b> the stay plate. The stay <b>plate</b> along <b>with</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> will be seeing thermal transients during reactor scrams. The thermal transient will cause the membrane stress due to global temperature increase in <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> and bending stress due to temperature gradient across the thickness. This paper aims the creep and fatigue damages estimation of the stay <b>plate</b> and <b>covers</b> <b>plate.</b> The material of stay <b>plate</b> and <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is SS 316 LN.

40|$|The high {{ballistic}} {{efficiency of}} non-oxide ceramics such as silicon carbide against kinetic energy (KE) threats is {{largely due to}} penetrator dwell (the erosion of the tip of the rod prior to ceramic target penetration). This paper considers the effect of target surface conditions on the dwell characteristics of silicon carbide. This has been investigated using a range of <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> (CP) designs impacted at normal incidence with a 5 mmdiameter tungsten rod of 20 : 1 aspect ratio, over the velocity range 1100 m/s to 1900 m/s. Significant behavioural transition regions have been identified. In the velocity range 1330 - 1630 m/s the use of coverplates increases the Em significantly. There is a significant stepwise decrement in Em for targets <b>with</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> when impact velocities exceed a velocity of 1600 m/s. At velocities in excess of 1700 m/s there is a gradual decrease in Em with increasing velocity compared to targets without coverplates {{to the point where the}} use of coverplates is positively detrimental...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an {{investigation}} into the performance of cold-formed C-channels stiffened <b>with</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> and subjected to pure bending and primarily shear condition tests. <b>Cover</b> <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> three different thicknesses (1. 6, 2 and 2. 4 mm) were installed at top flanges only as it would be the predicted location for local and distortional buckling. The local and distortional buckling capacities were evaluated via Direct Strength Method, DSM, in accordance with AISI 2007. The accuracy of the interaction equation between the required flexural strength, M, and the required shear strength, V, prescribed by AISI 2007 was also investigated in this paper. A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of maximum strength and buckling failure modes. The results explicitly showed that by attaching the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> on top flanges, the non-dimensional slenderness decreased resulted in improved buckling capacities, where the nominal flexural moment of sections, Mn, were close to the plastic moment, MP. Besides, it was concluded that the interaction equation between M and V predicted by AISI was conservative for sections with small non-dimensional slenderness values...|$|R

When the crack tip just reached the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end, the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> efficiency is only dependent on the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> dimensions regardless the location of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> or the crack length. In the case of crack front not reached the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end, the location of <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> {{near the edge of the}} main plate, i. e., near the crack mouth, is less efficient than that faraway.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThe {{study of}} {{three-dimensional}} open cavity flow <b>with</b> and without <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> {{at the edges}} of the cavity at freestream Mach number of 0. 85 was performed. Such open cavities find their application in landing gear wells, bomb bay of an airplane and sunroof or window of an automobile. The aerodynamic noise and the flow field together in the above mentioned cavities lead to self-sustaining flow oscillations. These self-sustaining flow oscillations results in the structural failure in the surrounding of the cavity due to resonance phenomenon in the aircrafts and lead to loud and unbearable noise both in aircrafts and automobiles. Understanding this aeroacoustic phenomenon helps us in reducing the noise, increase the component stability and passenger comfort. Therefore, this problem has become an important topic of research for several decades in aerospace and automobile fields. In this thesis an effort was made to investigate the fully developed turbulent flow over an open cavity and to evaluate the effect of <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> numerically using the detached eddy simulation (DES) formulation. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics approach was utilized on the M 219 cavity at Mach 0. 85 using DES with the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) turbulence model. Two cavity cases were modeled. The test case 1 is a three-dimensional open cavity without <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> and the test case 2 is a three-dimensional open cavity <b>with</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> {{at the edges of}} the cavity. Furthermore, three variants of DES were considered for the test case 2 cavity namely Spalart- Allmaras, k-ω-SST and realizable k-ε model, whereas for the test case 1 cavity only the DES S-A model was employed...|$|R

This thesis investigates {{the use of}} partial-length steel <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> about column mid-height to improve the weak-axis buckling resistance. The present research first reviews literature concerning the Euler buckling of members with partial-length reinforcement. Inelastic buckling is simulated by 3 -D finite element analysis accounting for <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> length, <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> area, bolt hole perforations, yield stresses, residual and locked-in dead load stresses, and initial out-of-straightness. The model is validated by a load test of a full-scale column with bolted reinforcement plates. A parametric sensitivity study shows that reinforced capacity {{is characterized by the}} transition between failure initiating either in the original column at the unreinforced end segments, or at column mid-height in the reinforced segment. An equation developed through multiple linear regression is proposed for a simplified procedure for preliminary design...|$|R

30|$|Before bonding a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> to 3 D molded substrate, holes were {{drilled in}} the inlet and outlet {{area of the}} 3 D channel. A solvent-assisted bonding {{technique}} developed by Brown et al. [27] for bonding of PMMA chips was used. A few drops of a solvent mixture (47.5 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 47.5 % water and 5 % methanol) were spread over the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> and then the 3 D molded substrate was placed in conformal contact <b>with</b> the <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> The assembly of 3 D molded substrate/cover plate was loaded in the NIL machine and brought to 92  °C and a 10  bar for 30  min, which led to complete bonding.

The <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> thickness greatly influenced {{the response of the}} sacrificial cladding. <b>Cover</b> <b>plates</b> that were 2 mm thick exhibited significant permanent deformations and variable percentage crush across the section, whereas the 4 mm thick <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> were more rigid causing the core to compress uniformly. Considerable fracture of the foam was observed after blast testing, particularly for the lower density foams. The effect of bonding the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> to the core was also examined. Numerical simulations of the experiments were performed using ABAQUS/Explicit to provide insight into the response mechanism.
