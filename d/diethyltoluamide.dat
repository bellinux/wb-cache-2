Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E

50|$|The most {{effective}} public health measure for Babesia is avoidance of tick exposure. This {{can be performed}} through personal prevention strategies such as avoiding tick-infested areas (especially during high tick season between May and September), remaining covered with light clothing, searching for ticks after being outdoors, and removing discovered ticks from the skin. Other preventive measures include applying <b>diethyltoluamide</b> (DEET), a common repellent that is effective against ticks and insects. (For people who react adversely to DEET, alternative insect repellents should be used.) On a state level, if health departments are particularly motivated, tick elimination is a possibility. In 1906, {{efforts were made to}} eradicate the tick vector of the bovine disease form of babesiosis in the United States. This eradication was recorded as being successfully completed four decades later. Complete eradication efforts would be a long-term project, which would significantly reduce the prevalence of both babesiosis and Lyme disease. However, as public health departments are often short on funding, preventive measures seem to be more recommended over vector control. Due to the relatively low prevalence of the disease and the presence of several reservoirs, babesiosis is currently not a candidate for vaccine-based prevention. In regions where ticks of domestic animals are routinely controlled with chemical acaricides to reduce incidence of infection with B. bovis and B. bigemina, the risk to humans from these parasites will be reduced.|$|E

However, trace concentrations of organic wastewater-associated contaminants may still pose a key environmental hazard impairing the ecological quality of surface waters. To identify key impact factors, we analyzed {{the effects of a}} wide range of anthropogenic and environmental variables on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community. We assessed ecological water quality at 26 sampling sites in four urban German lowland river systems with a 0 - 100 % load of state-of-the-art biological activated sludge treated wastewater. The chemical analysis suite comprised 12 organic contaminants (five phosphor organic flame retardants, two musk fragrances, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, octylphenol, <b>diethyltoluamide,</b> terbutryn), 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 12 heavy metals. Non-metric multidimensional scaling identified organic contaminants that are mainly wastewater-associated (i. e., phosphor organic flame retardants, musk fragrances, and <b>diethyltoluamide)</b> as a major impact variable on macroinvertebrate species composition. The structural degradation of streams was also identified as a significant factor. Multiple linear regression models revealed a significant impact of organic contaminants on invertebrate populations, in particular on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera species. Spearman rank correlation analyses confirmed wastewater-associated organic contaminants as the most significant variable negatively impacting the biodiversity of sensitive macroinvertebrate species. In addition to increased aquatic pollution with organic contaminants, a greater wastewater fraction was accompanied by a slight decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in salinity. This study highlights the importance of reducing the wastewater-associated impact on surface waters. For aquatic ecosystems in urban areas this would lead to: (i) improvement of the ecological integrity, (ii) reduction of biodiversity loss, and (iii) faster achievement of objectives of legislative requirements, e. g., the European Water Framework Directive...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} regarding the safety of <b>diethyltoluamide</b> (DEET), {{one of the most}} widely used and reliable insect repellents available. This paper summarizes the recent evidence and concludes that concerns over safety appear largely unfounded. Increasing tourism to tropical regions and the changing patterns of vector-borne disease have led to a reassessment of personal protection measures that can be taken against insects. Methods for avoiding bites, which include the use of insect repellents, are an important element of strategies for reducing infection with malaria, dengue, filariasis, and other insect-borne diseases. 1 Concerns have been raised over the safety of the most popular repellent, 2 diethytoluamide (DEET), and have resulted in travelers experimenting with natural plant repellents as an alternative.

40|$|Mosquitoes are {{prevalent}} {{and dangerous}} pests {{in many parts}} of Malaya. The endemic diseases carried by Malayan mosquitoes are malaria, dengue, filariasis and Japanese ence-phalitis, and it is possible that some of the yet-unidentified viruses isolated by the U. S. Army Medical Research Unit (Malaya) may prove to be causes of human disease. Mos-quitoes may be so common in the proximity of coastal dwellings that attack-rates of 350 per man per hour have been recorded. The variety of man-biting mosquitoes is equally impressive, and more than 170 different species have been collected within 40 km of Kuala Lumpur. There has therefore been urgent need for a repellent which offers adequate pro-tection against such an abundant and diversified mosquito fauna, particularly since a stan-dard World War II mosquito repellent, dimethylphthalate, was found to be effective for only about 1 / 2 hour in the mosquito-ridden nipah palm-mangrove swamps of Selangor, and the postwar U.

40|$|In a set {{of tests}} {{previously}} discussed in the present series of papers, it was shown that the skin-application repellent <b>diethyltoluamide</b> (deet) was extremely effective against the swarms of mosquitoes in the nipah palm-mangrove swamps of Malaya, but that the protection was limited solely to {{those parts of the}} body actually treated with repellent (1, 2). That is, the volunteers sustained mosquito-bites through their untreated clothing or on portions of the exposed skin which had not been covered with repellent. It was, there-fore, decided to perform another series of tests to compare the degree of protection offer-ed by a repellent impregnated into the clothing, with that obtained by using deet. The standard U. S. Army clothing impregnant, M- 19602, was chosen for this experiment, and the results, presented in this article, indicate that where mosquitoes are as abundant as they are in the nipah palm-mangrove swamps, it is insufficient to rely solely upon the use of either deet repellent or the wearing of M- 1960 -treated clothing. Simultaneous use of both methods, however, offered virtually solid protection, even when the untreated controls were being attacked by mosquitoes at the rate of 173 - 244 per man per hour.

The recent emergence of Zika virus in South America and the Pacific, together with ongoing outbreaks of dengue viruses in Southeast Asia, generated great community interest in the most effective strategies to avoid mosquito bites. Large-scale mosquito control programs are not common in Australia and are limited in New South Wales (NSW). The use of topical insect repellents is a key recommendation by health authorities to prevent mosquito-borne disease. All products sold in Australia purporting to repel mosquitoes must be registered with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Despite around 100 commercial products registered as repelling mosquitoes, there are relatively few active ingredients used across these formulations.

Current prevention and control measures {{are restricted to}} the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} cases. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention to prevent the transmission of Leishmania in the endemic focus of Tumaco, on the Pacific Coast of Colombia. Materials and methods. A group-randomized trial was conducted. Twenty villages were matched according to prevalence of Leishmania infection, number of inhabitants and level of community participation, and then randomly assigned to intervention or control. The intervention included deltamethrin-impregnated bednets, repellent (20 % <b>diethyltoluamide</b> and 0. 5 % permethrin), modification of sand fly resting sites, and health education. Villages were under surveillance for one year {{and the use of the}} intervention measures monitored. The incidence of American {{cutaneous leishmaniasis}} and Leishmania infection in the two groups were compared, adherence to the intervention and adverse events were monitored, and the results were adjusted for village intraclass correlation. Results. Ten cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis were confirmed in the intervention and 23 in the control group, OR = 3 D 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 14 - 1. 26. The intervention had a greater effect in children 1 %. Adverse events associated with the use of the bednets and the repellent were reported in 2 % of the participants and were always mild. Conclusion. Incident cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis were reduced by 58 % in the intervention group. However, the small number of cases renders the effect estimate imprecise and precludes us to claim a protective effect for the intervention.

40|$|Azadirachtin-containing neem seed extract is a {{powerful}} insect growth regulator, a feeding deterrent and repellent with low toxicity. Unfortunately, azadirachtin degrades rapidly in light, excessive heat or alkalinity. Evaluations of azadirachtin on ectoparasites on animals have been scarce. The purpose of this work was to describe the effects of normal and potentiated azadirachtin on Ctenocephalides felis in the dog or cat. Groups of kennelled greyhounds and domestic cats infested with C. felis were sprayed once with azadirachtin containing neem seed extract with or without <b>diethyltoluamide</b> (Deer) and/or citronella. Methanolic extracts with 200, 1000 or 2400 ppm azadirachtin reduced fleas in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with fleas counted on treated dogs just before treatment and untreated infested dogs, 1000 - 2400 ppm azadirachtin reduced fleas 93 - 53 % for 19 days. However, combined with 500 ppm Deet and 33 % w/v citronella, only 500 ppm azadirachtin reduced fleas 95 - 62 % for 20 days. On cats inoculated with 50 fleas 2 days before treatment, the combination reduced fleas and eggs 100 % to day 6 and 83 - 51 % from days 7 to 9. On petri dishes, the combination achieved 100 % egg mortality up to day 7 and 80 % to day 14 and 38 - 52 % to to days 21 - 28. Deet, with or without neem seed extract or citronella, and citronella, with or without neem, did not reduce fleas significantly. The results show that azadirachtin reduced fleas in a dose-dependent manner in flea-contaminated environments. In cats, the combination killed most fleas within 24 h, providing effective flea control for 7 days. The results suggest that Deet with citronella potentiated the effect of azadirachtin on C. felis.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of a wide variety}} of organic pollutants with different physico-chemical characteristics has been investigated in wastewater samples from a municipal solid waste treatment plant placed at Castellón, Spain. An advanced analytical strategy has been applied, consisting on the combined used of two powerful and complementary techniques, GC and LC, both hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole analyzers. The GC-MS/MS method was based on sample extraction using C 18 SPE cartridges and allowed the determination of around 60 compounds from different chemical families, such as PAHs, octyl/nonyl phenols, PCBs, organochlorine compounds, insecticides, herbicides and PBDEs. Most of compounds selected are included as priority contaminants in the European Union (EU) Water Directive. The UHPLC-MS/MS method, which provided high chromatographic resolution and sensitivity and short analysis time, used a sample extraction with OASIS HLB SPE cartridges and allowed the determination of 37 (more polar) pesticides. The methodology developed has been applied to the analysis of 41 water samples (20 non-treated, raw leachates, and 21 treated) collected between March 2007 and February 2009. Treated (reverse osmosis) water samples analyzed rarely exceeded 0. 5 μg/L for the contaminants investigated. As expected, in non-treated leachates the number of detections and the concentration levels found were notably higher than in treated waters. The most commonly detected pollutants were herbicides (simazine, terbuthylazine, terbutryn, terbumeton, terbacil and diuron), together with fungicides (thiabendazole and carbendazim) and 4 -t-octylphenol. In the light of data obtained, it has been proven that reverse osmosis process used for water treatment was efficient and notably reduced the levels of organic contaminants found in raw leachate samples. 2 In order to investigate the {{presence of}} other non-target contaminants, water samples were also analyzed by using GC-TOF MS and LC-QTOF MS. Several organic pollutants that did not form a part of the previous list of target contaminants were identified in the samples, thanks to the good sensitivity of TOF MS in full spectrum acquisition mode and the valuable accurate mass information provided by these instruments.

40|$|Ticks are {{the most}} common {{external}} parasites of economic importance in the livestock farming sector of Southern Africa. They are vectors of tick-borne diseases and are commonly controlled using conventional acaricides, which are expensive and not readily available to resource-limited farmers. As a result many resource-limited farmers resort to use of alternative materials to control ticks on their livestock. Tick resistance to acaricide is an increasing problem in Southern Africa and poses a real economic threat to livestock and veterinary pharmaceutical industries. The objective {{of this study was to}} document and validate the ethno-veterinary remedies used as alternative methods of controlling cattle ticks by resource-limited farmers. A questionnaire survey was conducted in May 2007, at Qolora by-Sea and Nontshinga in Centane district, to determine tick control methods used by resource limited farmers in the Amathole District Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments were done to validate the acaricidal properties of ethnoveterinary remedies used by resource-limited farmers. Ticks were reported to be a major problem, transmitting diseases like anaplasmosis (89. 8 %), babesiosis (55. 9 %) and ehrlichiosis (16. 9 %), they also cause wounds that predispose cattle to screwworm infestation, tick worry and teat damage. All farmers used acaricides and dipping tanks provided by the government to control ticks, as the main tick control method. However, the majority (94. 9 %) were of the opinion that the dip wash was not effective in controlling ticks. As a result, farmers complemented the government dipping service with use of own initiatives like spraying with conventional acaricides (22 %), household disinfectants such as Jeyes fluid (18. 6 %), used engine oil (10. 2 %), chickens feeding on ticks (5. 1 %), manual iv removal (5. 1 %), and pouricides (1. 7 %). In addition, some farmers also use plants (6. 8 %), mainly the leaf of Aloe ferox and the bark of Ptaeroxylon obliquum. The in vitro repellency models showed Jeyes fluid (76. 8 and 100 % concentrations) and P. obliquum (40 %) had repellent properties that lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes respectively while that of, Tabard (35 % <b>diethyltoluamide)</b> positive control, lasted for 4 hours when applied against nymphal stages of Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. In the contact bio-assay, undiluted used engine oil, T. minuta oil (50 %), Ektoban® (Cymiazol 17. 5 % and cypermethrin 2. 5 %) and Jeyes fluid (76. 8 %) caused higher tick mortality of more than 86 %. Other materials (A. ferox, Lantana camara and Tagetes minuta) had no repellence and acaricidal properties. In the in vivo study, Jeyes fluid at a concentration of 76. 8 % and used engine oil displayed efficacy of 71 and 76. 4 % respectively which was similar to that of the positive control Ektoban® at 97. 8 % tick load reduction. Among plant materials L. camara at 40 % concentrations had an efficacy of 57 % while A. ferox, P. obliquum and T. minuta were not effective at all. The remedies used by resource-limited farmers to control ticks vary in efficacy. Their ability to reduce tick load on cattle appears to be promising and a welcome development as their use could probably reduce tick burdens in cattle with less expenditure. However, further investigations need to be done before they are recommended for use. Despite being effective some of the materials have potential toxic effects in animals and also cause environmental contamination and I recommend used engine oil, Jeyes fluid and L. camara for further testing as they showed some efficacy compared to other remedies...|$|E
