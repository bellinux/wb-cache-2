5|$|Taurodontism is a {{condition}} where {{the body of the}} tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged, and is associated with <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome, Triple X syndrome, and XYY syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E

40|$|<b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{the most}} common cause of primary {{testicular}} failure, resulting in impairment of both spermatogenesis and testosterone production. It is a chromosomal disorder characterized by small, firm testes, azoospermia, gynecomastia, varying degrees of eunuchoidism and testosterone deficiency with elevated gonadotropin plasma levels. In <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> there is an increase of certain systemic diseases including venous thromboembolism. An increased thromboembolic risk in hypogonadic men has been explained with hypofibrinolysis due to androgen deficiency. Only two cases have been reported about the association between <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and well-known congenital or acquired thrombophilias. We report the case of a 39 -year-old patient with <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> who underwent severe deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, in the absence of any circumstantial triggering event. Further examinations also showed a double heterozygosis for G 20210 A prothrombin and factor V Leiden mutations. This case suggests that the increased thromboembolic risk, reported in <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> can be worsened by the co-existence of one or more well-known thrombophilic conditions, as shown by the relatively young age of the patient.

Dense calcification in the cerebrum and cerebellum was shown on brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|Abstract <b>Klinefelter’s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> {{is a form}} of male {{hypogonadism}} {{which may}} present with; either a congenital chromosome abnormality; or alternatively with a mixture of 47 XXY/ 46 XY mosaics or higher-grade sex chromosomal aneuploidy as well as structurally abnormal X chromosomes. Clinically, the syndrome is characterized by findings of small, firm testes and symptoms of androgen deficiency but they may also present with azoospermia, tall stature and bilateral painless gynecomastia. This article will describe the presentation, investigation and eventual diagnosis of identical twins with <b>Klinefelter’s</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Both presented with varying levels of morphological features indicative of <b>Klinefelter’s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and required further hormonal and genetic investigation. These two cases illustrate the difference in presentation of <b>Klinefelter’s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and the challenges experienced regularly by clinicians when attempting to treat patients diagnosed with sensitive Syndromes. This is made especially difficult when there are background issues of language barriers and compliance issues...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to hormonal mechanisms, specific genetic influences {{found on the}} X chromosome may {{also contribute to the}} development of SLE. Studies indicate that the X chromosome can determine the levels of sex hormones. A study has shown an association between <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>syndrome</b> and SLE. XXY males with SLE have an abnormal X–Y translocation resulting in the partial triplication of the PAR1 gene region.|$|E
25|$|In the {{minority}} of cases with bilaterally non-palpable testes, further testing {{to locate the}} testes, assess their function, and exclude additional problems is often useful. Pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging performed and interpreted by a radiologist can often, but not invariably, locate the testes while confirming absence of a uterus. A karyotype can confirm or exclude forms of dysgenetic primary hypogonadism, such as <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>syndrome</b> or mixed gonadal dysgenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of genes along the inactive X {{which are not}} silenced explains the defects in humans with abnormal numbers of the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome (X0) or <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>syndrome</b> (XXY). Theoretically, X-inactivation should eliminate the differences in gene dosage between affected individuals and individuals with a normal chromosome complement. In affected individuals, however, X-inactivation is incomplete and the dosage of these non-silenced genes will differ as they escape X-inactivation, similar to an autosomal aneuploidy.|$|E
40|$|An {{abnormality}} in platelet aggregability or fibrinolysis, namely elevated {{activity of}} plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), has been recently documented in patients suffering from <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with leg ulceration without underlying venous insufficiency. To determine whether increased PAI- 1 activity {{is a general}} feature of <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or more specifically associated with leg ulceration, we investigated PAI- 1 influencing parameters and PAI- 1 activity in two groups of patients: (i) Klinefelter patients suffering from leg ulceration (n = 7); and (ii) Klinefelter patients without leg ulceration (n = 6). On analysing PAI- 1 influencing parameters such as age, body mass index, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, testosterone, smoking behaviour, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and arterial hypertension, respectively, we found {{no statistically significant differences}} between the two groups. However, PAI- 1 activity in group 1 was highly significantly elevated compared with that in group two patients (P < 0. 005). We conclude that (i) PAI- 1 activity is not elevated in <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in general; (ii) elevation of PAI- 1 activity in patients suffering from <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> does not appear to be secondary to PAI- 1 influencing parameters; and (iii) elevation of PAI- 1 activity may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of leg ulceration in <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Therefore, a therapy for leg ulceration in <b>Klinefelter's</b> <b>syndrome</b> that aims to return the elevated PAI- 1 activity to normal should be explored...|$|R

25|$|Hypogonadal {{states can}} cause {{secondary}} osteoporosis. These include Turner syndrome, <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Kallmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia. In females, {{the effect of}} hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (<45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (>1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries) and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the testes).|$|E
25|$|Other {{numerical}} abnormalities discovered include {{sex chromosome}} abnormalities. A female {{with only one}} Xchromosome has Turner syndrome, whereas an additional Xchromosome in a male, resulting in 47 total chromosomes, has <b>Klinefelter</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Many other sex chromosome combinations are compatible with live birth including XXX, XYY, and XXXX. The ability for mammals to tolerate aneuploidies in the sex chromosomes arises from the ability to inactivate them, which is required in normal females to compensate for having two copies of the chromosome. Not all genes on the Xchromosome are inactivated, which is why there is a phenotypic effect seen in individuals with extra Xchromosomes.|$|E
