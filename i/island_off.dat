5|$|Set reports dated April 2012 {{recorded}} that scenes {{would be}} set on Hashima Island, an abandoned <b>island</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. In actuality, the scene was set on an unnamed <b>island</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Macau, though based on the real-life Hashima. Sam Mendes explained that the location was a hybrid of a set and computer-generated images. Production chose to include the Hashima model after Daniel Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad whilst shooting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short documentary on Hashima Island in 2002 entitled Hashima, recalled Craig taking extensive notes on the island {{at the time of}} the meeting, but was unaware of his interest in it until Skyfall was released.|$|E

5|$|Two {{different}} Dromaius {{species were}} present in Australia {{at the time of}} European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, D. baudinianus and D. n. minor, originally present on Kangaroo Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. D. n. diemenensis, a subspecies known as the Tasmanian emu, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland sub-species, D. n. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> Tasmania, and Kangaroo <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. While the Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s, more birds have since been introduced, and attempts are being made to breed a form similar to the Tasmanian emu. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.|$|E

5|$|Dutch {{bricks and}} {{brickwork}} were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Fort Zeelandia {{was built on}} a small <b>island</b> <b>off</b> Tainan in Formosa (Taiwan) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony. It was built using bricks from Batavia (Jakarta), where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters. After a siege in 1662, the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga, a Ming dynasty general. The fort was destroyed by an explosion in 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse. The masonry was later used for other purposes.
