6000|$|... "Not wise?" [...] said she, her countenance scornful. [...] "You {{mean that}} I may {{see more than}} was {{intended}} for me. What game <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> here, sir, that you tell me one thing and show me by your actions that you desire another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{considerably}} more than I bargained for," [...] growled Calvert. [...] "I feel guiltily like {{the man who brought}} the news to Edinburgh after Flodden. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> this confounded trick upon us for, John?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, don't you know," [...] said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, [...] "that when I {{have been}} there, I have been took {{up to the}} outside of her door, and the door has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don't say you don't know that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to <b>play.</b> What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> at, boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You used marked cards, just as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when <b>you</b> <b>played</b> {{with this}} young man. I {{think when you}} find yourselves {{in the hands of}} the police---- Hi! stop, don't be going in such a hurry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> at crambo with me?" [...] {{said the}} Duke. [...] "I {{would have you}} to know that the common parish fool should be whipt, were he to attempt to pass pun or quodlibet as a genuine jest, even amongst ticket-porters and hackney chairmen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now for {{the signal}} from the shore," [...] exclaimed Catherine; [...] "my bosom tells me we shall see this night two lights instead of one gleam from that garden of Eden--And then, Roland, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> your part manfully, and we will dance on the greensward like midnight fairies!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{intend to}} be afraid of him, nor of his friend Mr. Jack Morris neither," [...] says Harry, again {{fingering}} the delightful notes. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> at Aunt Bernstein's? Cribbage, all-fours, brag, whist, commerce, piquet, quadrille? I'm ready at any of 'em. What o'clock is that striking--sure 'tis seven!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One can't do everything," [...] he said lazily. [...] "I don't {{know that}} I've seen another {{beginner}} show {{quite as good}} form at billiards as <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I'll <b>play</b> <b>you</b> fifty with the same allowance as last time. It will be some time yet before dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] {{said the}} cosmopolitan, {{dropping}} the necromancer {{with the same}} facility with which he had assumed it. [...] "Yes," [...] he added, soberly picking up the gold pieces, and returning them with a chink to his pocket, [...] "yes, I am something of a funny man now and then; while for you, Charlie," [...] eying him in tenderness, [...] "what you say about your humoring the thing is true enough; never did man second a joke better than <b>you</b> <b>did</b> just now. <b>You</b> <b>played</b> your part better than I <b>did</b> mine; <b>you</b> <b>played</b> it, Charlie, to the life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now harkee, mate; {{you will}} not beg, {{you will not}} rob; so be it. But I {{will tell you what}} <b>you</b> WILL <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> will <b>play</b> decoy whilst I beg. Refuse, an' you think you may venture!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your father's {{estate is}} entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," [...] turning to Charlotte, [...] "I am glad of it; but {{otherwise}} I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> and sing, Miss Bennet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Till--till Don Frederic {{has taken}} Haarlem and these fat Hollanders, {{or those who}} are left of them, lick our boots for mercy," [...] and he ground his teeth, then added: [...] "Son, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> cards? Good, well let us have a game. Here are dice; {{it will serve to}} turn our thoughts. Now then, a hundred guilders on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thumb's eyes gladdened, but {{his face}} looked black and louring. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> such Munza tricks," [...] he said--"hiding from us in the night? How am I to know what small pieces {{you may not have}} been dashed into on this {{slippery}} Arakkaboa? What beasts may not have chosen Mulla-skeeto for supper?

6000|$|... "No, my dear, he {{was quite}} wrong, for he blamed the use of cards, not the abuse. And after all, what harm comes of it? I don't suppose Miss Ruff will {{actually}} kill her. I dare say if we were playing ourselves we shouldn't notice it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> cribbage? Shall {{we have a little}} cribbage?" [...] But Miss Baker did not play cribbage; or, at any rate, she said that she did not.|$|E
6000|$|But [...] "why then publish?"[708]--There are no rewards [...] Of fame or profit {{when the}} World grows weary. [...] I ask in turn,--Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> at cards?

You must stay, if my telling you hasn't made {{you feel that you}} want to catch the next train. You will save our lives--mine and Nutty's too. Oh, dear, you're hesitating! You're trying to think up some polite way of getting out of the place! You mustn't go, Mr Chalmers; you simply must stay. There aren't any mosquitoes, no jellyfish--nothing!

5000|$|I played Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. A {{lot of us}} did, actually, a lot {{of writers}} I know did. In the bars late at night at {{literary}} festivals, sometimes the conversation will get around to—with sort of a huddle {{of us in the}} corner, saying, ‘So, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> Dungeons & Dragons?’ And it’s amazing how many say yes. So Gary Gygax has a lot to answer for. There’s probably a PhD thesis out there, in the realms of possible PhD theses that someone could write somewhere, on Gary Gygax’s influence on the 20th century novel. Because it would not be negligible. David Mitchell ...|$|R

The Lord lead us all: if I can only get off the stage with clean hands, I shall sing Hosanna. 'Put' is described quite differently from your version in a book I have; what are your rules? The Port Admiral is using a game of put in a tale of his, the first copy of which was gloriously finished about a fortnight ago, and the revise gallantly begun: THE FINSBURY TONTINE it is named, and might fill two volumes, and is quite incredibly silly, and in parts (it seems to me) pretty humorous. - Love to all from ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{idea of it}} I {{had even}} then, {{watching}} her; and since I have come to read it word for word: [...] "But that woman--that woman that loves you, that you love. Ah, I know--why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> with me? She is rich. With her your life will be smooth. And the boy--it will be better far for him. Cannot you three wait a little longer? What more can I do? Cannot you see that I am surely dying--dying as quickly as I can--dying as that poor creature your friend once told us of; knowing {{it was the only}} thing she could do for those she loved. Be honest with me: I am no longer jealous. All that is past: a man is ever younger than a woman, and a man changes. I do not blame you. It is for the best. She and I have talked; it is far better so.

6000|$|... 'There's {{nothing else}} to do at Dunbude, that's why. I {{practise}} about half my lifetime. So I wrote to your brother Ronald, as I was telling you, from mamma's dictation; and when I heard you were really coming, I was quite delighted about it. Do you remember, I met you twice last year, once at the Dolburys', and once somewhere else; and I thought you'd be a very good sort of person for Dunbude, you know, and about as much use to Lynmouth as anybody could be, which isn't saying much, of course, for he's a dreadful pickle. I insisted on putting in my letter that he was a dreadful pickle (that's a good stroke off the red; just enough side on), though mamma didn't want me to; because I thought you ought to know about it beforehand. But you remember him at Marlborough, of course; he was only a little fellow then, but still a pickle. He always was and he always will be. He's out shooting, now, with papa; and you'll never get him to settle down to anything, as long as there's a snipe or a plover banging about on the moor anywhere. He's quite incorrigible. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> at all? Won't you take a cue till your lunch's ready?' ...|$|E

2500|$|When RCA {{had asked}} if there was {{anything}} special he wanted as a signing premium, Nilsson asked for his own office at RCA, being used to working out of one. In the weeks after the Apple press conference, Nilsson's office phone began ringing constantly, with offers and requests for interviews and inquiries about his performing schedule. Nilsson usually answered the calls himself, surprising the callers, and answered questions candidly. (He recalled years later the flow of a typical conversation: [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> last?" [...] "I didn't." [...] "Where have <b>you</b> <b>played</b> before?" [...] "I haven't." [...] "When will <b>you</b> be <b>playing</b> next?" [...] "I don't.") Nilsson acquired a manager, who steered him into a handful of TV guest appearances, and a brief run of stage performances in Europe set up by RCA. He disliked the experiences he had, though, and decided to stick to the recording studio. He later admitted this was a huge mistake on his part.|$|R
