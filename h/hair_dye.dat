40|$|Abstract: Hair {{coloring}} {{products are}} one of the most important cosmetics for modern people; there are three major types of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> including the temporary, semi-permanent and permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> The selected <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (such as ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate, resorcinol and lawsone) are the important components for hair coloring products. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of these compounds on melanogenesis in B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells. The results proved that <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> resorcinol and lawsone can reduce the production of melanin. The results also confirmed that resorcinol and lawsone inhibit mushroom and cellular tyrosinase activities in vitro. Resorcinol and lawsone can also downregulate the protein levels of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in B 16 -F 10 cells. Thus, we suggest that frequent use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> may have the risk of reducing natural melanin production in hair follicles. Moreover, resorcinol and lawsone may also be used as hypopigmenting agents to food, agricultural and cosmetic industry in the future...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{have been}} {{evaluated}} as possibly being mutagenic and carcinogenic in animals. Studies of the association between human cancer risk and use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> have yielded inconsistent results. The authors evaluated the risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with personal use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> The analysis included 2, 302 incident cases of lymphoid neoplasms and 2, 417 hospital- or population-based controls from the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain (1998 - 2003). Use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> was reported by 74 % of women and 7 % of men. Lymphoma risk among dye users was significantly increased by 19 % in comparison with never use (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 19, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 00, 1. 41) and by 26 % among persons who used <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> 12 or more times per year (OR = 1. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 00, 1. 60; p for linear trend = 0. 414). Lymphoma risk was significantly higher among persons who had started coloring their hair before 1980 (OR = 1. 37, 95 % CI: 1. 09, 1. 72) and persons who had used <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> only before 1980 (OR = 1. 62, 95 % CI: 1. 10, 2. 40). Personal use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{is associated with a}} moderate increase in lymphoma risk, particularly among women and persons who used dyes before 1980.

He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association. He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself unable to handle the strain of coaching. Richard reconciled with the Canadiens in 1981 and resumed his team ambassador role.|$|E

30|$|One {{application}} for laccase is hair coloring. Oxidation-based hair color, which {{has dominated the}} hair color market, consists of dye intermediates and an oxidizing agent (Saito et al., 2012). In a typical hair color product, the dye intermediates are p-diamines and p-aminophenols, and hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidant in the dyeing process. After mixing, they form chromatic indo dyes {{at the time of}} use. However, side reactions with hair proteins commonly occur simultaneously because of the severe reactions conditions, resulting in hair damage (Saito et al., 2012). The commercial hydrogen peroxide oxidative-type <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> formulations are mutagenic. Some <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> components become strongly mutagenic after oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (Ames et al., 1975). Laccase-based <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are less irritating and easier to handle than current <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> as laccases replaced hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizing agent in the dyeing formula (Couto and Herrera, 2006).|$|R

40|$|Hutchinson's {{melanotic}} freckle melanoma {{and the use}} of non-permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> Sir- We {{have reported}} an association between Hutchinson's melanotic freckle melanoma (HMF) and use of non-permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (Holman & Armstrong, 1983). The possibility has been raised with us that use of non-permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> is confounded with other causal variables. Any confounding with sex or age was controlled by the matched design of our study and the question of cigarette smoking was dealt with in our first report. Confounding with sun exposure and personal pigmentary characteristics, however, is a possibility. Both are related to risk of HMF (Holman & Armstrong, 1984 a, b) and both could conceivably be correlated with use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> To address this possibility we have undertaken a conditional logistic regression analysis of our data (Breslow & Day, 1980) with incorporation of the following independent variables in the regression model: Use of non-permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> whether or not born in Australia, mean annual hours of bright sunlight at all residential locations (Australian-born only), acute and chronic skin reaction to sunlight, and hair colour. The odds ratios for use of semipermanent and temporary <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> derived from this analysis were essentially unchanged from those previously reported. They were: Never used, 1. 00; used 1 - 9 times, 1. 5 (95 % confidence interval 0. 3 - 6. 8); used 10 + times, 3. 3 (1. 0 - 11. 5). The confidence intervals, however, were slightly wider than those previously reported and the P value for trend in the odds ratios increased from 0. 02 to 0. 05. These changes would be expected from inclusion of covariates in the regression analysis and are not indicative of confounding effects. Yours sincerely...|$|R

[...] In April 2015, Zhou Yongkang was formally charged with abuse of power, bribery, and intentionally leaking state secrets, and scheduled to face trial at the Tianjin First Intermediate People's Court. Overseas Chinese media was rife with speculation about the 'treatment' Zhou was to receive. [...] However, Zhou's trial unexpectedly took place behind closed doors. On June 11, state media made an announcement [...] without any apparent warning [...] that Zhou's verdict had already been reached. [...] The official report on Zhou's trial was brief, and stated that he had been convicted on all three charges. The legal sentence, according to the state, was life in prison for bribery, seven years for abuse of power, and four years for [...] "leaking state secrets." [...] The court decided that Zhou could serve prison terms concurrently and amalgamated the sentences into one 'combined' life sentence. [...] The total value of bribes taken by Zhou and his family was said to be 129.7 million yuan (~$18.87 million).
