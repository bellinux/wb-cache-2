Predictor variables measured at the hearing assessment included measures of self-efficacy, expectations and readiness to improve hearing. Outcome measures obtained at sixweek follow-up were the Glasgow <b>Hearing</b> <b>Aid</b> Benefit Profile and Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life. Study sample: A sample of 30 first-time adult <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users were recruited through a public-sector funded audiology clinic. Results: When measured prior to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> fitting, self-efficacy for <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> predicted satisfaction with <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> but was not related to other <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> outcomes.

Sociodemographic and audiometric information was collected. Study sample: Participants were 216 adult first-time hearing help-seekers (125 <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> adopters, 91 non-adopters). Results: Regression models assessed the impact of autonomous motivation and autonomy support on <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> adoption and <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> fitting outcomes. Sociodemographic and audiometric factors were also taken into account. Autonomous motivation, but not autonomy support, was associated with increased <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> adoption.

Methods: Participants engaged in a phone interview that was conducted to investigate factors affecting <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. The interview questions were related to the Health Belief Model and thus focused on perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived benefits and self-efficacy of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. Descriptive qualitative analysis was then applied to analyse themes from the interviews. Results: Ten barriers and nine facilitators to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use in New Zealand were found. Perceived severity and self-efficacy were also studied in relation to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. It was found that perceived severity did affect <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use, with those who perceive their hearing severity to be worse, wearing their <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> more than those who perceive no or little hearing difficulty.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: <b>Hearing</b> <b>aids</b> are {{prescribed}} to alleviate loss of audibility. It {{has been reported}} that about 31 % of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users reject their own <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> because of annoyance towards background noise. The reason for dissatisfaction can be located anywhere from the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> microphone till the integrity of neurons along the auditory pathway. Objectives: To measure spectra from the output of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> at the ear canal level and frequency following response recorded at the auditory brainstem from individuals with hearing impairment. Methods: A total of sixty participants having moderate sensorineural hearing impairment with age range from 15 to 65 years were involved. Each participant was classified as either Good or Poor <b>Hearing</b> <b>aid</b> Performers based on acceptable noise level measure. Stimuli /da/ and /si/ were presented through loudspeaker at 65 dB SPL. At the ear canal, the spectra were measured in the unaided and aided conditions. At auditory brainstem, frequency following response were recorded to the same stimuli from the participants. Results: Spectrum measured in each condition at ear canal was same in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. At brainstem level, better F 0 encoding; F 0 and F 1 energies were significantly higher in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers than in poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Though the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> spectra were almost same between good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers, subtle physiological variations exist at the auditory brainstem. Conclusion: The result of the present study suggests that neural encoding of speech sound at the brainstem level might be mediated distinctly in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers from that of poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Thus, it can be inferred that subtle physiological changes are evident at the auditory brainstem in a person who is willing to accept noise from those who are not willing to accept noise...|$|R

Using the ANOV procedure, statistically significant differences α=. 05) were found between the mean speech reception thresholds obtained under the three aided test conditions, but differences were not clinically significant. The mean speech reception thresholds a greed within 4. 0 dB. No significant difference was found between the mean speech discrimination scores obtained in quiet under the three aided test conditions.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionHearing {{aids are}} {{prescribed}} to alleviate loss of audibility. It {{has been reported}} that about 31 % of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users reject their own <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> because of annoyance towards background noise. The reason for dissatisfaction can be located anywhere from the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> microphone till the integrity of neurons along the auditory pathway. ObjectivesTo measure spectra from the output of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> at the ear canal level and frequency following response recorded at the auditory brainstem from individuals with hearing impairment. MethodsA total of sixty participants having moderate sensorineural hearing impairment with age range from 15 to 65 years were involved. Each participant was classified as either Good or Poor <b>Hearing</b> <b>aid</b> Performers based on acceptable noise level measure. Stimuli /da/ and /si/ were presented through loudspeaker at 65 dB SPL. At the ear canal, the spectra were measured in the unaided and aided conditions. At auditory brainstem, frequency following response were recorded to the same stimuli from the participants. ResultsSpectrum measured in each condition at ear canal was same in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. At brainstem level, better F 0 encoding; F 0 and F 1 energies were significantly higher in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers than in poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Though the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> spectra were almost same between good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers, subtle physiological variations exist at the auditory brainstem. ConclusionThe result of the present study suggests that neural encoding of speech sound at the brainstem level might be mediated distinctly in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers from that of poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Thus, it can be inferred that subtle physiological changes are evident at the auditory brainstem in a person who is willing to accept noise from those who are not willing to accept noise...|$|R
30|$|Different {{configurations}} {{are possible}} for a binaural beamforming system, for instance, both <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> could transmit their received microphone signals to a central device where the beamforming is performed, and the result could then be transmitted back to the <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Alternatively, the <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> could exchange their signals and beamforming may be performed on each <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b> In this paper, to analyze the effect of quantization errors on beamforming, {{without loss of generality}} we assume that each <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> has one microphone and that the right <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> quantizes and transmits its signal to the left <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> where the two signals are combined using a beamformer. This paper is an extension of our earlier work [11], incorporates the effect of head shadow and presents a more detailed experimental analysis.|$|R
