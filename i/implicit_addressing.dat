40|$|Associative {{computation}} {{is characterized}} by search by content and data parallel computation. Search by content paradigm is natural to scalable high performance heterogeneous computing since use of tagged data makes data independent of <b>implicit</b> <b>addressing</b> mechanisms. In this paper, we present an algebra for associative logic programming, an associative resolution scheme, and a generic framework of associative abstract instruction set. The model is based on integration of data alignment and use of two types of bags: data element bags and filter bags of boolean values to select and restrict computation on data elements. Use of filter bags integrated with data alignment reduces the computation and data transfer overhead; use of tagged data reduces overhead of preparing data before data transmission. The abstract instruction set has been illustrated by an example. Performance results for a simulation in a homogeneous address space are presented...|$|E
40|$|Spreadsheet {{languages}} for {{distributed computing}} are {{of great interest}} because they unite ease of use {{with the ability to}} express parallel computations. This paper discusses some issues that these languages raise, in the context of dataflow and intensional programming languages such as Lucid. First, proper design and implementation of spreadsheet languages (as we see it) places stress on both the eductive and data-driven dataflow models of computation. Second, spreadsheets feature both relative and what we have called <b>implicit</b> <b>addressing,</b> which are both forms of intension; we compare these to the intensionality found in Lucid. Third, since spreadsheets are often used by unsophisticated users, the abstract reasoning skills taken for granted by scientists cannot be assumed. This elevates syntax in importance. We therefore propose an extended multi-dimensional array notation which unites simplicity, intensionality, concreteness and historical usage. 1. Introduction Spreadsheet languages [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the private}} message service {{described}} in [4] we show efficiency improvements of that private message service in the computational setting. Regarding an attacker which may control {{all but one of}} the queried servers we describe a private message service with a total communication complexity of blinded read between client and private message service of n bit upstream and k bit downstream, where n denotes the number of cells in the database and k the size of one cell. Apart from a registration mechanism, the communication complexity between client and service is independent of the number of queried servers. Our improvement of the private message service is not only extremely efficient in terms of communication, but also in terms of computation. Further we describe how to use the message service in case of messages which are <b>addressed</b> using visible <b>implicit</b> <b>addresses.</b> After that we prove that at least parts of messages which are <b>addressed</b> using invisible <b>implicit</b> <b>addresses</b> must be broadcasted. We generalize the message service to operations in ZZN (N ≥ 2) and prove the security of blinded read. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{currently}} proposed anonymous routing mech-anisms for Mobile Ad hoc Networks enable network entities to anonymously and securely {{communicate with}} each other. However, protocols that provide {{a high level of}} anonymity generally have poor scalability due to delays and overhead introduced by cryptographic operations, while other approaches sacrifice anonymity to achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel anonymous routing protocol that provides improved anonymity and security while achieving similar or better performance, as compared to existing proposals. Our proposal achieves anonymity using a novel efficient solution for invisible <b>implicit</b> <b>addressing</b> based on keyed hash chain and security via a novel application of one-to-many Diffie-Hellman mechanism, used to exchange keys for symmetric encryption. The final contribution includes a mechanism to facilitate selection of a trusted route by verifying connections between intermediate nodes.

40|$|Runtime {{monitoring}} support {{serves as}} a foundation for the important tasks of providing security, performing debugging, and improving performance of applications. Often runtime monitoring requires the maintenance of information associated with each of the application’s original memory location, which is held in corresponding shadow memory locations. Unfortunately, existing robust shadow memory implementations are inefficient. In this paper, we present a shadow memory implementation that is both efficient and robust. A combination of architectural support (in the form of ISA support and augmentations to the cache coherency protocol) and operating system support (in the form of coupled allocation of memory pages used by the application and associated shadow memory pages) is proposed. By coupling the coherency of shadow memory with the coherency of the main memory, we ensure that the shadow memory instructions execute atomically with their corresponding original memory instructions. Our page allocation policy enables fast translation of original addresses into corresponding shadow memory addresses; thus allowing <b>implicit</b> <b>addressing</b> of shadow memory. This approach obviates the need for page table entries for shadow pages. Our experiments show that the overheads of runtime monitoring tasks are significantly reduced in comparison to previous software implementations...|$|E

In the field of commercial messages standardization, the ebXML framework offers the valid standard for message modeling. Due {{to the importance of}} standardization ebXML framework in E-commerce, creating more facilities, in the ebXML messaging is so important. Today, the exchange of messages within the ebXML framework uses explicit addressing, in which, the message ultimate recipient is determined based on message producer partner and the information existed in collaboration agreement. In case of explicit addressing Use, among the messages that are reached by the partners in the business process, only a few of them may be appropriate {{to the needs of the}} recipient and as a result the recipient is forced to discard some of them. Due to releasing a large number of relatively high-volume messaging in system, not only the bandwidth consumption will rise, but it also slows down the message precision regarding to the message received by the partner that is appropriate to its needs or not. The purpose of this paper is providing a method in order to convert an explicit addressing to the <b>implicit</b> <b>addressing</b> for ebXML messages.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{scalable}} and efficient destination-oriented multicast protocol for next-generation Internet. With DOM, each packet carries explicit destinations information, instead of an <b>implicit</b> group <b>address,</b> to facilitate the multicast data delivery; and each router leverages the unicast IP routing table to determine necessary multicast copies and next-hop interfaces. The fundamental issue {{is that we need}} to limit the bandwidth overhead for such explicit addressing, since it is impractical to attach all the destination addresses to each packet. We resort to the Bloom filter technique to encode the destination information carried by each packet for bandwidth efficiency, with elaborated design to accommodate the features of the practical Internet including longest-prefix matching, route aggregation, and asymmetric interdomain routing. Moreover, DOM enables a fast group joining approach to minimize the joining delay perceived by receivers. The scalability and efficiency of DOM are demonstrated with simulation results. ...|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{the science}} on the {{existence}} of implicit bias and its potential influence on behavior, the science on ways to mitigate implicit bias is relatively young and often does not address specific applied contexts such as judicial decision making. Yet, it is important for strategies to be concrete and applicable to an individual’s work to be effective; instructions to simply avoid biased outcomes or respond in an egalitarian manner are too vague to be helpful (Dasgupta, 2009). To address this gap in concrete strategies applicable to court audiences, the authors reviewed the science on general strategies to <b>address</b> <b>implicit</b> bias and considered their potential relevance for judges and court professionals. They also convened a small group discussion with judges and judicial educators (referred to as the Judicial Focus Group) to discuss potential strategies. This document summarizes the results of these efforts. Part 1 identifies and describes conditions that exacerbate the effects of implicit bias on decisions and actions. Part 2 identifies and describes seven general research-based strategies that may help attenuate implicit bias or mitigate the influence of implicit bias on decisions and actions. Part 2 provides a brief summary of empirical findings that support the seven strategies and offers concrete suggestions, both research-based and extrapolated from existing research, to implement each strategy. 1 Some of the suggestions in Part 2 focus on individual actions to minimize the influence of implicit bias, and others focus on organizational efforts to (a) eliminate situational or systemic factors that may engender implicit bias and (b) promote a more egalitarian court culture.
