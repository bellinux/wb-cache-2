40|$|For the {{distribution}} of the European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> anguilla), only Schmidt (1909) has conducted substantial investigations, yielding a qualitative description (Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe and Northern Africa). In this article, a meta-analysis of reported fishing yields is presented, showing a major concentration of glass eel yield in the Bay of Biscay (and possibly farther south) and of yellow and (or) silver eel yield in the western Mediterranean. Fisheries target the glass eel stage at highest stock density and shift to the silver eel stage at low density. Because there is no suitable habitat in the Sahara, the southern limit is, contrary to Schmidt's belief, primarily determined by continental conditions. From the centre of {{the distribution}} to the north, a long and slow decline in density occurs. The mismatch between northern temperatures and the species' preference, in combination with the very low abundance, indicates that the European eel is best seen as a warm-water species, like most other <b>eel</b> <b>species</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> spp.), showing a considerable northern diaspor...|$|R
40|$|Body growth parameters, age {{and total}} length at sex {{differentiation}} were compared in three European <b>eel</b> <b>Anguilla</b> anguilla populations from Mediterranean sites with different salinity. Whilst body growth was faster in brackish than in freshwater environments, the present analysis shows that body size at sex differentiation {{might be a}} physiological invariant. # 2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: Anguilla anguilla; body growth; European eel; sex differentiation. The European <b>eel</b> <b>Anguilla</b> anguilla (L.) is a secondary gonochoristic species (Devlin & Nagahama, 2002) characterized by delayed sex differentiation and metagamic sex determination. Gonad differentiation and development are probably triggered by reaching a certain body size rather than age (Bieniarz et al., 1981; Colombo et al., 1984). Sex determination in <b>Anguilla</b> <b>species</b> is not univocally determined by genes, but is presumably influenced by environ-mental and social factors, with high temperatures and high densities biasing sex ratio towards males (Beullens et al., 1997; Krueger & Oliveira, 1999; Oliveira & McCleave, 2002).

40|$|Between 1991 and 2008 a {{total of}} 71 fish species was {{recorded}} in the brackish and fresh water zone of the Schelde estuary (Zeeschelde). The results were obtained from fish surveys from the cooling water filter screens of the power plant at Doel (between 1991 and 2008) and fyke net surveys {{along the length of}} the estuary between 1995 and 2008. Species abundance in the different salinity zones was analysed using the fyke net data only. The ten most abundant species represent 90. 8 % of the total number of individuals caught. In decreasing order of abundance: flounder (Platichthys flesus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), herring (Clupea harengus), <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> anguilla), pike-perch (Sander lucioperca), sole (Solea solea), common goby (Pomatoschistus microps), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and white bream (Blicca bjoerkna). With fyke nets 33 species were caught in the tidal freshwater zone, 43 species in the oligohaline zone and 59 species in the mesohaline zone. Each salinity zone is characterised by a typical fish assemblage, lthough some species are shared between all three salinity zones: e. g. three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Prussian carp (Carrasius gibelio), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla).</b> Diadromous <b>species</b> occur in all zones and make up, on average up 22 % of the species richness. Freshwater species comprise about 70 % of the species in the tidal freshwater zone. In the oligohaline zone the contribution of the freshwater species to the species richness is less while marine migrants become more abundant. As expected, the contribution of marine migrants and estuarine species is higher in the mesohaline zone. The recent increase in species richness in the freshwater and oligohaline zone coincides with a remarkable increase in dissolved oxygen since 2007. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R

Moderately variable microsatellite markers may also be good candidates for species identification using multi-locus genotypes. We evaluated the degree of conservation of microsatellite flanking regions {{and the level of}} polymorphism in 4 commercially important <b>eel</b> <b>species</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> anguilla, A. rostrata, A. japonica and A, marmorata). Using multiplex polymerase chain reactions developed for the first 2 taxa, we assessed the discrimination power of an individual-based assignment method to differentiate all 4 species without initial species information. Detection and classification of each species was performed with high confidence (> 90 %), as was assignment of randomly sampled individuals to pre-defined species (> 95 %). Our results demonstrate the highly conserved nature of microsatellites and their level of polymorphism in <b>Anguilla</b> <b>species.</b> Although an inverse relationship was found between genetic diversity and differentiation estimates, likely due to homoplasy, assignment proved to be superior to multivariate and distance-based approaches for identifying the 4 species.
