5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Medal of Honor, {{one for each of}} the military departments of the Department of Defense: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version. Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red brass alloys with some <b>gold</b> <b>plating,</b> enamel, and bronze pieces. The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which would require the Medal of Honor to be made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known Congressional Gold Medal, but the measure was dropped.|$|E
5|$|The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, on the Ganges, {{is one of}} the 12 Jyotirlinga Shiva temples in Varanasi. The temple {{has been}} {{destroyed}} and rebuilt several times throughout its existence. The Gyanvapi Mosque, which is adjacent to the temple, is the original site of the temple. The temple, which is also known as the Golden Temple, was built in 1780 by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore. The two pinnacles of the temple are covered in gold and were donated in 1839 by Ranjit Singh, the ruler of Punjab. The dome is scheduled to receive <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> through a proposed initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs of Uttar Pradesh. Numerous rituals, prayers, and aartis are held daily at the temple between 02:30 and 23:00.|$|E

40|$|Micron-sized <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> were {{prepared}} by reducing chloroauric acid with lemongrass extract. Their two-photon luminescence (TPL) and {{second harmonic generation}} (SHG) were investigated. The {{results show that the}} TPL and SHG intensity of <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> is dependent on the wavelength and polarization of excitation laser. The TPL intensity of <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> decreases with the increase of the excitation wavelength except for a small peak around 820 – 840 nm, while SHG intensity increases with the excitation wavelength redshift. In addition, it is found that the TPL intensity of the <b>gold</b> <b>plate’s</b> edge is related with the angle between the edge orientation and the polarization direction of the excitation light. The TPL intensity increases with the angle increase from 0 ° to 90 °...|$|R

25|$|Layers of {{intermetallics}} {{can form}} between the solder and the soldered material. These layers may cause mechanical reliability weakening and brittleness, increased electrical resistance, or electromigration and formation of voids.

500|$|During script development, {{the crew}} spent {{four to five}} months {{scouting}} locations, creating a [...] "constant {{going back and forth}} between script and location". The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that [...] "it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe 's idea was to try to create a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment." [...] Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because [...] "nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.|$|E

2500|$|Most sousaphones are {{manufactured}} from sheet brass, usually yellow or silver, with silver, lacquer, and <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> options, much like many brass instruments. [...] However, the sousaphone (uniquely) is also commonly seen manufactured from fiberglass, {{due to its}} lower cost, greater durability, and significantly lighter weight.|$|E
2500|$|Other platings {{used are}} OSP (organic surface protectant), {{immersion}} silver (IAg), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating (ENIG), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold (ENEPIG) and direct <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> (over nickel). [...] Edge connectors, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then gold-plated. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into Tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, {{production}} of the Minox II began in 1948 at a new company, Minox GmbH, in Giessen/Heuchelheim near Wetzlar, West Germany. The new camera very much resembled the original, but was made with a plastic chassis covered by an aluminum shell. This greatly reduced its weight and, to an extent, cost. The camera continued {{to appeal to a}} luxury [...] "gadget" [...] market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s. It also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the Cold War. During this time, the Minox company continued to develop the camera, working with Gossen to develop a companion miniature exposure meter, as well as improved models such as the Minox B, which incorporated an even smaller Gossen-designed meter into the camera itself. The Minox B became the most popular and widely produced model of the line. Further developments included autoexposure, and the company developed an extensive line of accessories. These included flash guns, viewfinder attachments, tripod mounts, and copying stands, all increasing the camera utility in a variety of applications. One accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens (see illustration). Limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes, such as <b>gold</b> <b>plating.</b> Standard cameras were also available in an optional black anodized finish.|$|E
2500|$|Ray Lamphere {{was arrested}} on May 22, 1908, and tried for murder and arson. He denied the charges. His defense hinged on the {{assertion}} that the body was not Gunness'. Lamphere's lawyer, Wirt Worden, developed evidence that contradicted Norton's identification of the teeth and bridgework. A local jeweler testified that, though the gold in the bridgework had emerged from the fire almost undamaged, the fierce heat of the conflagration had melted the <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> on several watches and items of gold jewelry. Local doctors replicated {{the conditions of the}} fire by attaching a similar piece of dental bridgework to a human jawbone and placing it in a blacksmith’s forge. The real teeth crumbled and disintegrated; the porcelain teeth came out pocked and pitted, with the gold parts rather melted (both the artificial elements were damaged to a greater degree than those in the bridgework offered as evidence of Gunness' identity). The hired hand Joe Maxson and another man also testified that they’d seen [...] "Klondike" [...] Schultz take the bridgework {{out of his pocket and}} plant it just before it was [...] "discovered." [...] Lamphere was found guilty of arson, but acquitted of murder. On November 26, 1908, he was sentenced to 20 years in the State Prison (in Michigan City). He died of tuberculosis on December 30, 1909.|$|E
