Dr. Robert Weaver, who also served in Roosevelt's Black Cabinet, said of her, [...] "She {{had the most}} marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness." [...] When a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students with a rifle, Bethune worked to make an ally of him. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled, [...] "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> found him protecting the children and {{going so far as}} to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Mahone {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} character, and his past is revealed as the series progresses. According to series creator Paul Scheuring, the writers try to let all {{the characters in the}} show [...] "inhabit a gray area." [...] Scheuring says that although Mahone's pursuit in the second season is very noble, [...] "there are some things about <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will learn that are slightly less than noble." [...] Fichtner tries to play the character with a soft side, and believes that those characterizing him as [...] "a hard guy" [...] are [...] "missing what I'm trying to do." [...] Regarding the frequent intake of pills by Mahone, the series' executive producer and writer Matt Olmstead says: ...|$|E
500|$|Bradley {{develops}} {{a theory about}} Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between [...] "traditional" [...] and [...] "critical" [...] conscience: [...] "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly {{that he ought to}} avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> admire and love him". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of conscience. So has John Donne's commencement of his poem : [...] "Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;" ...|$|E

500|$|After Gilly {{eventually}} {{starts a}} relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him. Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s, {{developer}} Kristopher Kendrick began {{buying up}} {{properties in the}} Old City. [...] In a 1994 interview, Kendrick mentioned a conversation he had had with Coca-Cola bottler Patrick Roddy that would inspire the new name for the neighborhood. [...] "I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had bought property down there," [...] Kendrick recalled, [...] "and he said, 'Kris, that's the old city,' and I said, 'Pat, that's the perfect name.'" [...] By the late 1980s, several new businesses had opened in the Old City, including Annie's (whose proprietor, Annie Delisle, was novelist Cormac McCarthy's ex-wife), Old City Mercantile, Kerby's Antiques, and Hewgley's Music. [...] Sullivan's Saloon [...] "reopened" [...] as Patrick Sullivan's Steakhouse and Saloon on St. Patrick's Day in 1988.|$|E

"I {{answered}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had taken}} their fort and killed {{all the people in}} it," [...] wrote Menéndez to the King, [...] "because they had built it there without Your Majesty's permission, and were disseminating the Lutheran religion in these, Your Majesty's provinces. And that I, as Captain-General of these provinces, was waging a war of fire and blood against all who came to settle these parts and plant in them their evil Lutheran sect; for I was come at Your Majesty's command to plant the Gospel in these parts to enlighten the natives in those things which the Holy Mother Church of Rome teaches and believes, for the salvation of their souls. For this reason I would not grant them a safe passage, but would sooner follow them by sea and land until I {{had taken their}} lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: [...] "What {{we are interested}} in is Viaţa Românească, a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E
2500|$|... "Picasso's {{interest}} in stoneware was further {{stimulated by the}} examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome Oviri. Until 1987, when the Musée d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) {{it had never been}} recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the Demoiselles. Although just under 30 inches high , Oviri has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by Oviri. 50 years later he was delighted when [...] Cooper and I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism." ...|$|E

His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|The one {{sticking}} point {{out of the}} seven articles was a sixteen-week armistice to allow action against the Russians. At this point Stewart claims {{that one of the}} Danes turned to another and said in French that disagreement might lead to a renewal of hostilities. [...] "Renew hostilities!" [...] responded Nelson, and turning to his interpreter said [...] "Tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are ready in a moment; ready to bombard this very night!" [...] Hurried apologies followed (the British fleet now occupied positions that would allow the bombardment of Copenhagen) and agreement was reached and signed the next day. The armistice was reduced to fourteen weeks, but during it Armed Neutrality would be suspended and the British were to have free access to Copenhagen. Danish prisoners were also paroled. In the final hour of negotiations, the Danes found out (but not the British) that Tsar Paul had been assassinated. This made the end of the League of Armed Neutrality very likely and freed the Danes from the fear of Russian reprisals against them, allowing them to easily come to agreement. The final peace agreement was then signed on 23 October 1801.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{his start}} of {{secondary}} studies {{coincided with the}} beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that back in that time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper and smelling oil, at breakfast. These terrible conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking {{that he was about to}} be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: [...] "I have to recognize that it is thanks to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters".|$|E
