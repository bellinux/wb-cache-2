50|$|In February 2016, Jean Bernard Lévy, EDF Chief Executive, {{confirmed}} a 68% drop in net {{profits and}} cut in dividend, saying that a final investment decision on the project would follow 'when all this is fully organised'.

In March 2016, Thomas Piquemal, EDF's Chief Financial Officer resigned after 'saying the company should wait another three years before making the final investment decision on the project' where Jean Bernard Lévy disagreed 'saying he wanted it to happen as <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>next</b> month'. In March 2016, Jean Bernard Lévy wrote to EDF staff that he was in talks to 'obtain commitments from the state to help secure our financial position' and would 'not engage in the Point project before these conditions are met'. In March 2016, Emmanuel Macron, the French Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs said that a final investment decision would not be made until May 2016. On 25 April 2016, EDF announced plans to sell €4 billion of new shares to 'help it finance the building of the Hinkley Point nuclear plant' with the French government subscribing €3 billion of these shares 'as well as taking a scrip dividend option for 2016 and 2017'.|$|E
50|$|In July 2016, some Taiwanese legislators {{announced}} that they would introduce a same-sex marriage bill in Parliament {{by the end of}} 2016. On 25 October 2016, at least a dozen legislators announced they had submitted a new amendment to the Civil Code which would legalise same-sex marriage in Taiwan. The proposed amendment was made by mostly Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators (whose party has a majority in the Legislative Yuan) though was also supported by one legislator from the minority Kuomintang, (KMT) which is divided on the issue of same-sex marriage. A separate amendment legalising same-sex marriage was also announced by the third-party New Power Party caucus. The drafter of the bill, Yu Mei-nu of the DPP, is optimistic the law can be introduced as <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>next</b> year and that same-sex marriage can be legal in the country by the end of 2017. On 29 October, President Tsai Ing-wen reaffirmed her support for same-sex marriage. On 31 October 2016, the Executive Yuan (the executive branch of the Government) Secretary-General Chen Mei-ling stated that the Executive supports same-sex marriage and that Premier Lin Chuan has urged the Ministry of Justice to take action on the issue. Two draft amendments to Taiwan's Civil Code which would legalise same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption, passed their first reading in the Legislative Yuan on 8 November 2016. Both bills were immediately referred to the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee for discussion.|$|E
5000|$|The night {{started with}} a gender war and as prize winners receive a trip to Las Vegas to see the Latin Grammy and walk the red carpet. The first to sing were the women. They sang a song by Anais, [...] "Lo Que Son Las Cosas" [...] and men sang [...] "Tantita Pena" [...] by Alejandro Fernández. Although there were some {{disagreement}} between the judges, two groups received good reviews. Chiquibaby called the three women the three musketeers and Enrique Santos called the men, the Fantastic Seven. In the end, thanks to which the public is involved, the judges scored a draw and all participants are prepared to travel to Las Vegas. For being protected by the judges last week, Fedro had an afternoon of guidance and support of Angélica Vale. For the singer, {{it was a surprise}} because Angelica was among the first people who trusted him early in his career. Fedro took the stage to sing El Ultimo Viernes by Espinoza Paz. All the artists came down to the stage to hear the public's vote. Cristina was the first saved by public's vote and sang Una Noche Mas by Jennifer Lopez. Zone D 'Tambora did not have the public's support and thus passed into the danger zone. The public, however, did vote for Ana Isabelle and her challenge was to interpret a song by band: [...] "Culpable O Inocente" [...] by Jenni Rivera. Paulina Rubio came as a special guest to the Viva el Sueño scenario to sing [...] "Ni Rosas Ni Juguetes" [...] de from her album [...] "Gran City Pop". After several weeks of mystery about gold content of the judges, Chiquibaby announced they would give a second chance to a participant who already left the competition. But, the artist won't be named until next week. Ojeda, Diego and Yessica were next. Among them was only one who would be saved and the other two would go to the danger zone. The lucky one was Ojeda to the challenge of the week he sang [...] "Como Fue" [...] by José José. Zone D 'Tambora, Yessica and Diego were in the danger zone and Cristian de la Fuente announced that starting this week there will be no rescue by peers, they only tell the public vote. The members of Zone D 'Tambora received the most votes and therefore remained in the competition and sang [...] "Entra En Mi Vida" [...] by Sin Bandera. Diego and Yessica were with nerves and fought over the votes of the public. The public supported Diego and so, for Yessica, the end came in Viva el Sueño. The Peruvian took the stage, dressed like a cowboy to sing [...] "Por Amarte" [...] by Pepe Aguilar. Carolina Guerra came to give the name of the last protected judges as <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>next</b> week, judges will not protect any artist and fight in a dogfight for the votes of the public. The members of Zone D 'Tambora judges fell in love and so were chosen as the protégés of the night. To leave the show, Yessica sang [...] "Ojala Que Llueva Café" [...] by Juan Luis Guerra.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{with the aim}} to isolate, identify and characterize the bacteria from agricultural soil. The traditional method of bacterial species identification relies upon the phenotypic characteristics of biochemical testing and colonial morphology. Biochemical tests are simple to execute, require minimal equipment, and generally accurately differentiate between the more common species. However, they are time-consuming and present a delay to final identification due to long incubation times. Several genes common to all bacteria have been studied in sequence-based identification. The most well-known, the 16 S rDNA gene, is considered a gold standard for identification for all bacteria and is widely recognized as a rapid and accurate method of identifying known and novel bacteria. Sequence identification can be completed <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> the <b>next</b> working day. Fragment of 16 S rDNA gene of the DNA of isolated bacteria was amplified by PCR. Forward and reverse DNA sequencing reaction of purified PCR amplicon was carried out with 16 sF and 16 sR primers. BLAST was performed and phylogenetic tree constructed using the sequences.
