5|$|A leak was <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> Jan 8, 2011, in the {{basement}} of the booster pump at Pump Station 1. For more than 80 hours, pipeline flow was reduced to 5 percent of normal. An oil collection system was put in place, and full flow resumed until the pipeline was again shut down while a bypass was installed to avoid the leaking section.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} supernovae have been {{discovered}} in Coma Berenices. Four (SN 1940B, SN 1969H, SN 1987E and SN 1999gs) were in the NGC 4725 galaxy, and another four were discovered in the M99 galaxy (NGC 4254): SN 1967H, SN 1972Q, SN 1986I and SN 2014L. Five were discovered in the M100 galaxy (NGC 4321): SN 1901B, SN 1914A, SN 1959E, SN 1979C and SN 2006X. SN 1940B, <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> 5 May 1940, was the first observed type II supernova. SN 2005ap, <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> 3 March 2005, is the brightest known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not {{visible to the naked}} eye and was discovered telescopically. SN1979C, discovered in 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, several hardships {{struck the}} band in 2014. In May, bassist David Ellefson lost a brother to cancer, {{following}} which, the band cancelled {{a number of}} scheduled shows. On October 4, Mustaine's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> November 26. Furthermore, drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick announced their resignations from the band that November. The pair would later emerge in a new band, Act of Defiance.|$|E

5000|$|Instead of {{specially}} composed music {{because it}} [...] "creates {{a sort of}} monoculture", he uses tracks {{from a variety of}} genres, decades, and countries, as well as sound effects that he <b>discovers</b> <b>on</b> old tapes.|$|R
5|$|Amalthea was <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard {{using the}} 36 inch (91 cm) {{refractor}} telescope at Lick Observatory. It {{was the last}} planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation (as opposed to photographically) {{and was the first}} new satellite of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei's discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610.|$|E
5|$|An early type of axe {{known as}} a palstave has been <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> Crompton Moor, {{providing}} evidence of Bronze Age human activity. It is believed that the area was inhabited by Ancient Britons, and that the Brigantes gave the River Beal its name. An ancient track, perhaps of Roman origin, crosses the modern Buckstones Road leading to Castleshaw Roman fort in neighbouring Saddleworth.|$|E
5|$|Bracken is {{very common}} in upland areas, Beech Fern in woods and other shaded {{locations}} and Scaly Male Fern in wooded or open areas. Wilsons Filmy-fern is a common upland variety in the Highlands, along with the Tunbridge Filmy-fern, Alpine Lady-fern and the rarer stunted form Newman’s Lady-fern (A. distentifolium var. flexile) which is endemic to Scotland. The Killarney Fern, once found on Arran {{was thought to be}} extinct in Scotland, but has been <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> Skye in its gametophyte form.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> July 23, 1995 {{separately}} by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp {{prior to}} it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with {{any degree of}} certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the naked eye}} for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Ida was <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> 29 September 1884 by Austrian {{astronomer}} Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory. It was his 45th asteroid discovery. Ida {{was named}} by Moriz von Kuffner, a Viennese brewer and amateur astronomer. In Greek mythology, Ida was a nymph of Crete who raised the god Zeus. Ida {{was recognized as}} a member of the Koronis family by Kiyotsugu Hirayama, who proposed in 1918 that the group comprised the remnants of a destroyed precursor body.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> the then-smooth glacier surface. Many {{of these}} glacier caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like the glacier caves on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and {{volcanic}} gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{new species}} of chewing louse, Psittacobrosus bechsteini, was {{described}} based on a dead specimen <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> a museum skin of the Cuban macaw. It {{is thought to have}} been unique to this species, and is therefore an example of coextinction. The feather mite species Genoprotolichus eurycnemis and Distigmesikya extincta have also been reported from Cuban macaw skins, the latter new to science.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had <b>discovered</b> <b>on</b> show at the World Cup – {{at the time they}} were not available to buy in England. He would wear the customized boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate that he got through countless pairs every season.|$|E
