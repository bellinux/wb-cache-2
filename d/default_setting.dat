25|$|While playing {{computer}} games, and {{mainly in}} first-person shooter games, some cases of simulation sickness {{can be resolved}} by changing {{the field of view}} in the game. Some games have a <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> which places a player's vision a small distance ahead of the actual object controlled, which will most likely trigger simulation sickness.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{edition of}} the core M book comes with a <b>default</b> <b>setting,</b> but both include an {{adventure}} {{that takes place in}} the Freedom City setting. The 1st edition book has pregenerated characters which players can use in the adventure, but those characters are associated with another M setting, META-4. Despite this, Freedom City and META-4 are officially separate and their worlds and characters do not intersect.|$|E
25|$|In HVAC applications, a {{heat pump}} is {{typically}} a vapor-compression refrigeration device {{that includes a}} reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building. In cooler climates, the <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> of the reversing valve is heating.|$|E

The second possibility for the sequence of <b>default</b> <b>sets</b> {{is that it is}} strictly increasing from one round to another, i.e., D_k+ 1 ⊃D_k. This means that a new bank joined the <b>default</b> <b>set,</b> and payments and prices have to be adjusted. But since there are at most n banks that can join the <b>default</b> <b>set,</b> after at most n+ 1 iterations 11 the <b>default</b> <b>set</b> does not change anymore. Thus, we eventually end up in the first possible case, finding the greatest price-payment equilibrium.|$|R

25|$|The <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> in warmer climates is cooling. Because the two heat exchangers, the {{condenser}} and evaporator, must swap functions, {{they are}} optimized to perform adequately in both modes. Therefore, the SEER rating, {{which is the}} Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating, of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines. For equipment to receive the Energy Star Rating, it must have a rating of at least 14.5 SEER.|$|E
25|$|Cyberpunk 2020, as {{the name}} implies, {{takes place in the}} year 2020. The game's <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> is the fictional Night City, a city of five million people on the west coast of the United States located between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It is {{described}} as being near San Jose but the map puts it closer to Monterey. Later supplements to the game have contained information {{about the rest of the}} US and the world.|$|E
25|$|The Green Sun Princes {{are made}} with the fifty Essences of Solar Exalts which the Yozis took in payment from the Neverborn and altered to emulate {{themselves}} in exchange for teaching the Neverborn to corrupt Solar Essences to create the Abyssals. While the first edition hinted at their existence, they did not get official rules until 2nd edition's Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals (April 2009). The Green Sun Princes were created by a cadre of five of the Yozis; Malfeas, She Who Lives In Her Name, Cecylene, Adorjan, and the Ebon Dragon. Each of these Yozis {{is responsible for the}} creation of one caste of Green Sun Princes and the charms associated with that caste, Malfeas created the Slayers, Cecylene created the Malefactors, She Who Lives in Her Name created the Defilers, Adorjan created the Scourges and the Ebon Dragon created the Fiends. Green Sun Princes of any caste can learn the charms of all five castes, as well as the charms of any other Yozis who have opened up access to their charms to the Green Sun Princes; in the <b>default</b> <b>setting,</b> Kimbery is the only other Yozi who has done so. The Yozis have tasked the Green Sun Princes with transforming Creation into a mirror of Malfeas, which they believe will break their bonds and reverse their disfiguring imprisonment. They call this effort the Reclamation.|$|E

On the other hand, ST (standard IEEE 802.11 e stations {{that are out of}} the sphere-of-control of the RT architecture) stations are intended to model external traffic sources, that are sharing the communication medium with the RT traffic sources. These ST stations transmit several types of traffic using the <b>default</b> <b>set</b> of parameters defined by the EDCA mechanism (Table 1).|$|R
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E

2500|$|The policy names, {{locations}} and possible settings vary slightly between Windows versions. The list of settings are relatively short and are always additional {{to the system}} <b>default</b> <b>setting.</b> Therefore, on Windows 2000, enabling the [...] "Disable Autoplay" [...] policy and setting it to [...] "CD-ROM drives", disables AutoRun (as distinct from AutoPlay) for CD-ROM and DVD drives, removable drives, network drives, and drives of unknown type.|$|E
2500|$|Adventures and {{supplements}} {{soon followed}} and eventually a <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> began to emerge. [...] This {{is known as}} the Official Traveller Universe (OTU) or [...] Charted Space. The OTU is also known by the primary political entity in the setting, The Third Imperium. [...] The Third Imperium is the largest and human-dominated interstellar empire in Charted Space. It is a feudalistic union of worlds: local nobility operate largely free from oversight, restricted by convention and feudal obligations.|$|E

2500|$|In Windows 7 Microsoft {{included}} a user interface to change User Account Control settings, and introduced one new notification mode: the <b>default</b> <b>setting.</b> By default, UAC does not prompt for consent when users make changes to Windows settings that require elevated permission through programs stored in %SystemRoot% and digitally signed by Microsoft. Programs that require permission to run still trigger a prompt. Other User Account Control settings {{that can be}} changed through the new UI could have been accessed through the [...] registry in Windows Vista.|$|E
2500|$|Women who do {{not follow}} the {{domestic}} norm are looked down upon in society. Beauvoir is explaining that woman referred as “the other.” She states, “What is a woman?’...The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of {{writing a book on}} the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: ‘I am a woman’; on this truth must be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; {{it goes without saying that}} he is a man. [...] It would be out of the question to reply: ‘And you think the contrary because you are a man,’ for it is understood that the fact of being a man is no peculiarity.” (34-5) As for man there is no need to define what is to be a man, there is no reason because they identified themselves as the superior part. Man represents both “the positive and the neutral,” which doesn’t need to be explained or defined, and it is self-explanatory. “Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in relation to herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.” (35) Men are the <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> and women are considered a recessive gender. “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.” (35) It is like an asymmetrical comparison, but masculine and feminine aren’t asymmetrical.|$|E
50|$|The Forgotten Realms are the <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> for the modules for 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons, {{although}} the D&D Multiverse (including Greyhawk, Eberron, Dragonlance, Mystara, and Planescape) is the <b>default</b> <b>setting</b> for the 5th Edition core books.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{the action}} {{taken by the}} DBMS for SET NULL or <b>SET</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> is the same forboth ON DELETE or ON UPDATE: The value of the {{affected}} referencing attributes ischanged to NULL for SET NULL, and to the specified <b>default</b> value for <b>SET</b> <b>DEFAULT.</b>|$|R
