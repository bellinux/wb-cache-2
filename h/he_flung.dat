5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, <b>he</b> <b>flung</b> himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
25|$|The 5000 metres final {{was held}} {{on the final day}} of the Championships. In his second-best event, Vainio {{surprised}} the Finnish audience with a bronze medal. The tight race again culminated in the final metres with Eamonn Coghlan as the overwhelming champion. As in the 10,000 metres race, Werner Schildhauer took the silver, beating Vainio by 0.14 seconds. Vainio won his bronze medal in an extraordinary way; <b>he</b> <b>flung</b> himself in the last 5 metres and fell flat on his face. As a result, he beat Dmitri Dmitriyev, who was fourth, by 0.04 seconds. Vainio considers this race to be the most sentimental event in his career.|$|E
25|$|More {{bad news}} piled up. He learned on 12 May 1568 that {{southern}} Siam (Ayutthaya) too had revolted, and entered into {{an alliance with}} Lan Xang. The rebellion was led by Maha Chakkraphat, the deposed king of Siam whom Bayinnaung had just showered with honors and permitted to return to Ayutthaya on pilgrimage as a monk. No sooner had the monk arrived at Ayutthaya than <b>he</b> <b>flung</b> off the robe, and declared independence. But all was not lost. The ruler of central Siam (Phitsanulok), Maha Thammarachathirat, remained loyal to him. On 29 May 1568, a dismayed Bayinnaung sent an army of 6,000 to reinforce Phitsanulok.|$|E

500|$|No formal {{declaration}} of war was immediately made. French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met {{on the evening of}} 2 September. In fact, Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet, however, demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once, and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, that war be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnet's pleas from Paris that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation, and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum (which had in fact not yet been served). Chamberlain's lengthy statement made no mention of an ultimatum, and the House of Commons received it badly. Greenwood rose to [...] "speak for the working classes". Conservative backbencher Leo Amery urged Greenwood to [...] "Speak for England, Arthur", implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so. Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success: too many members knew of Bonnet's efforts. National Labour MP and diarist Harold Nicolson later wrote, [...] "In those few minutes <b>he</b> <b>flung</b> away his reputation." [...] The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler. Chamberlain's last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin at nine o'clock the following morning—to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon. At 11:15am, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany: ...|$|E

2500|$|On 2 February 1977, Hussein {{died in a}} fire at his New York apartment. On 8 February, he {{was buried}} in Musmus, where his tomb has since served as a Palestinian {{nationalist}} symbol. Many of Hussein's works were published in a volume edited by Kamel Ballouta called The World of Rashid Hussein: A Palestinian Poet in Exile (Detroit, 1979). In Shefa-'Amr in 1980, a commemorative volume of Hussein's poems and other literary works was published, including Qasa'id Filastiniyya. Another Arabic collection of his poems, Palestinian Poems, was published in 1982. In a 1986 poem, Mahmoud Darwish, who had encountered Hussein in Cairo, commemorated his death as a sudden loss of a charismatic figure who could invigorate the Palestinian people, writing: He came to us a blade of wine [...] And left, a prayer's end [...] <b>He</b> <b>flung</b> out poems [...] At Christo's Restaurant [...] And all of Acre would rise from sleep [...] To walk upon the sea [...] — Mahmoud Darwish, On Fifth Avenue he greeted me (1986) ...|$|E

2500|$|Dian Wei {{later became}} a {{subordinate}} of Xiahou Dun, a general under the warlord Cao Cao. He was promoted to Major (司馬) for his efforts in battle. Around 194, Cao Cao attacked a rival warlord Lü Bu in Puyang (濮陽) and launched a surprise night attack on one of Lü's camps located 40-50 li west of Puyang. However, Lü Bu led reinforcements from Puyang and joined in the battle. Cao Cao and his forces were caught in an onrush by Lü Bu's forces. Dian Wei ordered dozens of men to gather around him, put on two layers of armour, discard their shields and arm themselves only with spears and jis. Another wave of enemy soldiers closing in from the west unleashed a barrage of arrows onto Dian Wei and his men. Dian Wei remained oblivious to the arrows and told his men, [...] "Let me know when the enemy is ten paces away." [...] The men did so. Dian Wei then said again, [...] "Let me know when they are five paces away." [...] The men then suddenly cried out in fear, [...] "The enemy is upon us!" [...] Dian Wei was holding on to a dozen jis, and <b>he</b> <b>flung</b> them at the enemy when they were near him. Each ji knocked down an enemy soldier {{and not a single}} ji missed its target. Lü Bu's forces retreated. By then, it was nearing dawn, so Cao Cao and his forces returned to their camp. Cao Cao was impressed with Dian Wei so he promoted the latter to Commandant (都尉). Dian Wei was placed in command of hundreds of Cao Cao's personal guards, who patrolled around Cao's tent. Dian Wei was a robustly built fighter, so the guards under his command were specially selected by him. In battle, Dian Wei and his men were always the first to charge into the enemy formation. Dian Wei was later promoted to Colonel (校尉).|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March 1945, {{his company}} became pinned down by an enemy sniper and were {{suffering}} casualties. As this sniper was inflicting casualties on the section, Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung, {{being unable to}} fire from the lying position, stood up fully exposed to the heavy fire and calmly killed the enemy sniper with his rifle, thus saving his section from suffering further casualties. The section advanced again but {{came under heavy fire}} once again. Without waiting for orders, Gurung dashed out to attack the first enemy fox-hole. Throwing two grenades, he killed the two occupants and without any hesitation rushed on to the next enemy fox-hole and killed the Japanese in it with his bayonet. He cleared two further fox-holes with bayonet and grenade. [...] "During his single-handed attacks on these four enemy fox-holes, Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung was subjected to almost continuous and point-blank Light Machine Gun fire from a bunker on the North tip of the objective." [...] For the fifth time, Gurung [...] "went forward alone in the face of heavy enemy fire to knock out this position. He doubled forward and leapt on to the roof of the bunker from where, his hand grenades being finished, <b>he</b> <b>flung</b> two No. 77 smoke grenades into the bunker slit." [...] Gurung killed two Japanese soldiers who ran out of the bunker with his Kukri, and then advanced into the cramped bunker and killed the remaining Japanese soldier. Gurung ordered three others to take up positions in the bunker. [...] "The enemy counter-attack followed soon after, but under Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung's command the small party inside the bunker repelled it with heavy loss to the-enemy. Rifleman Bhanbhagta Gurung showed outstanding bravery and a complete disregard for his own safety. His courageous clearing of five enemy positions single-handed was in itself decisive in capturing the objective and his inspiring example {{to the rest of the}} Company contributed to the speedy consolidation of this success.|$|E
