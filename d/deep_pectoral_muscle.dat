40|$|Collection and {{transport}} of chickens from the production farm to the slaughterhouse causes stress. In this study, {{the relationship between}} stress causing factors and broiler meat quality was evaluated. Thirty apparently healthy 60 -day-old broilers {{of the same sex}} and breed were allocated equally to three groups (A and B as treatment and C as the control group). The nutritional and rearing conditions were similar for all groups. Broilers in the first treatment group (A) were subjected to various muscular injuries similar to those occurring during gathering and transfer to abattoir while those in the second treatment group (B) were forced to flap their wings severely. Twelve hours after exertion, blood samples were collected for measurement of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and total volatile nitrogen (TVN) levels and tissue samples were taken from <b>deep</b> <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> to prepare microscopic sections in all groups. Macroscopically, swelling, bruising and severe hemorrhage was evident in <b>deep</b> <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> of the treatment groups, while edema, degeneration, necrosis and infiltration of heterophiles, lymphocytes and macrophages were observed microscopically.   Specific tissue changes were not seen in the control group.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years the {{worldwide}} growing demand of poultry meat {{has resulted in}} pressure on breeders, nutritionists and growers to increase {{the growth rate of}} birds, feed efficiency, size of breast muscle and reduction in abdominal fatness. Moreover, the shift toward further processed products has emphasized the necessity for higher standards in poultry meat to improve sensory characteristics and functional properties. It is believed that genetic progress has put more stress on the growing bird and it has resulted in histological and biochemical modifications of the muscle tissue by impairing some meat quality traits. The most current poultry meat quality concerns are associated with <b>deep</b> <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> disease and white striping which impair product appearance, and increased occurrence of problems related with the meat’s poor ability to hold water during processing and storage (PSE-like condition) as well as poor toughness and cohesiveness related to immaturity of intramuscular connective tissue.

40|$|O plexo braquial é um conjunto de nervos que surge na região medular cervicotorácica e que se distribui pelos membros torácicos e porção interna do tórax. O plexo braquial de oito pacas foi dissecado para evidenciação da origem e distribuição de seus nervos. O nervo supraescapular distribuía-se para os músculos supra e infra-espinhal, e o subescapular para o músculo subescapular. O nervo axilar ramificava-se para os músculos redondo maior, subescapular, redondo menor e deltóide. Os nervos ulnar e mediano ramificavam-se para a musculatura do antebraço, e o musculocutâneo para os músculos coracobraquial, bíceps braquial e braquial. O nervo radial abrangia o músculo tríceps braquial, tensor da fáscia do antebraço e ancôneo. O nervo torácico longo e o toracodorsal emitiam ramos para o músculo grande dorsal, e o torácico lateral para o músculo cutâneo do tronco. Os nervos peitorais craniais ramificavam-se no músculo peitoral profundo, e os nervos peitorais caudais distribuíam-se para o músculo peitoral superficial. O plexo braquial da paca é formado por doze pares de nervos com origens distintas, os quais surgem do quinto par de nervos cervicais até o segundo par de nervos torácicos, não havendo troncos ou cordões na formação destes. PALAVRAS-CHAVES: Agouti paca, distribuição, plexo braquial, sistema nervoso. The {{brachial plexus}} {{is a set}} of nerves {{originated}} in the cervicothoracic medular region and distributed in the thoracic limbs and inner thorax. The brachial plexus of eight pacas was dissected for study on the nerves origin and distribution. The suprascapular nerve went through the supra and infraspinal muscles and the subscapular gave off on the subscapular muscle. The axilar nerve was distributed on the teres major, subscapular, teres minor and deltoid muscles. The ulnar and the median nerves branched off on the forearm musculature, and the musculocutaneous branched on the coracobrachial, biceps brachial and brachial muscles. The radial nerve went through the triceps brachial, tensor fasciae latae and anconeus muscles. The long thoracic and the thoracodorsal nerves branched on the latissimus dorsi muscle, and the lateral thoracic gave off on the trunk cutaneous muscle. The cranial pectoral nerves branched on the <b>deep</b> <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> and the caudal pectoral nerves gave off on the superficial pectoral muscle. The brachial plexus of pacas is formed by 12 pairs of nerves presenting different origins, which arose from ventral roots from the fifth pair of cervical to the second pair of thoracic nerves, not occurring trunks or cords in those formation.

Blood gas analysis revealed severe metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia. Plasma biochemistry analysis showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase, marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperkalemia.

The relationship between fat and <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> in first-year Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenobaenus was investigated using the carcasses of 20 birds that died by flying into the lighthouse on Bardsey Island, North Wales, UK, in autumn 1996, and data for fat and <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> scores from 3, 281 Sedge Warblers ringed while on migration through the Wetland Trust Reserve at Elms Farm, Sussex, UK, between the end of July and early October in the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. For the Bardsey sample, the mass of tracheal pit fat (claviculo-coracoid fat body) correlated with the masses of fat at other body sites, and was a good measure of overall fat levels.

Mitochondrial volume in liver and <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> and SDH activity in liver and heart did not alter with life-cycle stage. However, red knot undergoing premigratory fattening exhibited significantly lower <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> SDH activity {{in concert with}} significantly elevated activity in the small intestine compared {{with the other two}} time-points, suggesting that tissue metabolic rate alters with life-cycle stage.

The concomitant decrease in <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> activity may act to reduce overall metabolic rate, or at least help counter the elevation in intestinal mass-specific metabolic rate. Both tissues hypertrophy prior to migration in wild red knot, but hypertrophy of the intestine precedes that of <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle.</b> Indeed, it appears that the intestinal mass undergoes atrophy by the time <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> hypertrophy occurs in wild red knot.

The proximal ends of the original nerves were ligated {{to prevent them from}} reinnervating the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle.</b> Then the remnant arm nerves (brachial plexus) were transferred into the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscles.</b> The musculocutaneous nerve was transferred to the clavicular head of the pectoralis major muscle; the median nerve was transferred to the upper sternal of the pectoralis major muscle; the radial nerve was transferred to the lower sternal head of the pectoralis major muscle. The pectoralis minor muscle was translocated from under the pectorialis major muscle to the lateral chest wall, so that its EMG signals would not interfere with those of the pectoralis major muscle, and it is also a fourth muscle target. The ulnar nerve was then transferred to the moved pectoralis minor muscle. The musculocutaneous, median, radial, and ulnar nerves (brachial plexus) were sewn onto the distal ends of the original <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> nerve fascicles and onto the muscle itself. Subcutaneous fat over the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> was removed so that the electrodes can be as close to the muscle as possible to obtain optimal EMG signals.|$|R
50|$|Avian Tnnt3 gene with {{additional}} alternatively spliced exons has unique expression pattern. The seven P exons are specifically expressed in <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscles</b> but not leg muscles. During post hatch {{development of the}} avian <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscles,</b> the segment encoded by the P exons (named Tx from the original annotation of the coding exons as an x exon) is up-regulated and included predominantly in fsTnT of adult <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscles.</b> Each P exon encodes a pentapeptide AHH(A/E)A. The Tx segment of adult fsTnT in avian orders of Galliformes and Craciformes contains 7-9 H(A/E)AAH repeats that possess high affinity binding to transition metal ions Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Co(II). The Tx segment of chicken breast muscle fsTnT also a binding capacity for calcium, presumably serves as a calcium reservoir in avian fast <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscles.</b> Together with more N-terminal negative charges, this function {{may contribute to the}} higher calcium sensitivity of chicken breast muscle than that of leg muscle.|$|R
40|$|Mammograms are X-ray {{images of}} the breast which are used to detect breast cancer. When mammograms are {{analyzed}} by computer, the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> should preferably be excluded from processing intended for the breast tissue. For this and other reasons, {{it is important to}} identify and segment out the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle.</b> In this paper, a new, adaptive algorithm is proposed to automatically extract the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> on digitized mammograms; it uses knowledge about the position and shape of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> on mediolateral oblique views. The pectoral edge is first estimated by a straight line which is validated for correctness of location and orientation. This estimate is then refined using iterative "cliff detection" to delineate the pectoral margin more accurately. Finally, an enclosed region, representing the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle,</b> is generated as a segmentation mask. The algorithm was found to be robust to the large variations in appearance of pectoral edges, to dense overlapping glandular tissue, and to artifacts like sticky tape. The algorithm has been applied to the entire Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database of 322 images. The segmentation results were evaluated by two expert mammographic radiologists, who rated 83. 9 % of the curve segmentations to be adequate or better...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the mammographic {{presentation of the}} <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> on the mediolateral oblique view of the breast {{and its relationship to}} current image evaluation criteria. Methods: A retrospective review of 100 paired mediolateral oblique mammograms performed on women undergoing routine mammographic screening with BreastScreen NSW South West, Australia was undertaken. Measurements of length, width, contour type and inferior angle of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> and of the relationship of its inferior aspect to the posterior nipple line and the nipple level were recorded. Results: A wide range of parameter values representing acceptable imaging were found to exist for each of the key imaging criteria. In 75. 5 % of images reviewed the inferior aspect of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> did not reach the level of the nipple, failing the quality criterion of the image evaluation systems used by the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme and the Australian BreastScreen Program. Conclusion: It is recommended that aspects of current image evaluation criteria relating to the presentation of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> should be modified to include quantified ranges to reduce inherent subjectivity and variability in interpretation. The criterion for the inferior aspect of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> to reach the level of the nipple should be reviewed by the national accreditation bodies...|$|R

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the major causes of {{fatality}} among women aged above 40. Digital mammography is used by radiologists for analysis and interpretation of cancer. Visual reading and interpretation of mammograms is a very demanding and expensive job. Even well-trained experts may have an interobserve variation rate of 65 - 75 percent. Extraction of the breast contour and <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> segmentation is necessary in order to limit the search for abnormalities by Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD). A new technique for breast border extraction and <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle</b> segmentation is explored in this paper. The technique is applied to 250 MIAS mammograms. This method has given about 98 % in segmenting the <b>pectoral</b> <b>muscle...</b>|$|R
