500|$|An unimpressed Alec sucks Presto's {{head into}} a {{ventilation}} pipe offstage, Presto (screaming painfully) removes the hat revealing his hair spiked and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> red. When Presto lunges at Alec through the hat, Alec directs Presto's {{hand into the}} podium's drawer and closes the drawer, painfully restraining the hand while he looks through Presto's sleeve for the carrot. Presto runs towards Alec, but instead is poked in both eyes by his own hand. Presto drops his hat, and when he grabs the wizard hat, he accidentally strips his slacks down to underwear, to Alec's amusement.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} came on 2 November. Air {{pollution}} in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By {{the end of}} the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, [...] "I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!" [...] The barman, and the owner of the pub who served him, later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the steroid ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> blue. An ambulance was summoned.|$|E
2500|$|Case 8. This case {{illustrates}} {{that children with}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome may be misdiagnosed and treated for encephalitis. This boy had a first seizure at age 4 years and 2 months. Whilst sleeping in his mother’s lap, he suddenly vomited. Then his eyes stared into the space upwards, his head deviated to the right, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> green and he became incontinent of urine and faeces. The seizure lasted for 15 min {{and there were no}} convulsions. Abdominal ultrasound performed because of the vomiting was normal. A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5°C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. Brain CT scan, EEG and CSF were normal. [...] Subsequent EEGs showed infrequent occipital and frontal spikes. [...] At follow-up aged 7, he was normal and had experienced no further seizures.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill claimed, {{perhaps not}} {{directly}} discussing himself, that [...] "ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment {{has been of}} some assistance in securing {{the attention of the}} audience..." [...] However, those who knew Churchill and [...] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that [...] "Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter" [...] in her 1941 book I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary. She also noted about one incident [...] "It’s s s simply s s splendid" [...] he stuttered, as he always did when excited." [...] Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of The American Mercury (1942) that [...] "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>turned</b> purple" [...] and that [...] "born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man’s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time." ...|$|E

60|$|But he {{was coming}} to her. She had seen the bronze of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> to white. How gaunt and worn he looked. Older he appeared, with deeper lines and whiter hair. His jaw quivered.|$|R

60|$|I saw <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> livid, and I saw {{the hand}} shake upon the golden {{head of his}} cane. He was very {{sensitive}} upon the score of his foul infirmities. His eyes grew baleful as he controlled himself. Then he smiled, displaying a ruin of blackened teeth.|$|R
