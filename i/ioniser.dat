50|$|An air <b>ioniser</b> (or {{negative}} ion generator or Chizhevsky's chandelier) is {{a device}} that uses high voltage to ionise (electrically charge) air molecules. Negative ions, or anions, are particles {{with one or more}} extra electrons, conferring a net negative charge to the particle. Cations are positive ions missing one or more electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. Most commercial air purifiers are designed to generate negative ions. Another type of air <b>ioniser</b> is the electrostatic discharge (ESD) <b>ioniser</b> (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise static charge.In 2002, Cecil Alfred 'Coppy' Laws was credited with being the inventor of the domestic air <b>ioniser</b> in an obituary in The Independent newspaper.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ionisers</b> are {{distinct}} from ozone generators, although both devices {{operate in a}} similar way. <b>Ionisers</b> use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions (for instance N2− or O2−) that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to static electricity. Even the best <b>ionisers</b> will also produce {{a small amount of}} ozone—triatomic oxygen, O3—which is unwanted. Ozone generators are optimised to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O2 molecule, using either a corona discharge tube or UV light.|$|R

40|$|Nocturnal asthma The {{purpose of}} this double-blind, randomised, {{placebo-controlled}} cross-over study was to evaluate whether corona <b>ionisers</b> placed in bedrooms could improve nocturnal asthma and other symptoms in asthmatics which {{might be related to}} the indoor climate. Active or inactive (placebo) <b>ionisers</b> were placed in the bedrooms of 15 patients for two subsequent 4 -week periods. The patients recorded daily/nightly symptoms, medication and peak expiratory flow. A histamine challenge was performed initially and after each period to measure the effect on hyperresponsiveness. Statistical analysis showed no sig-nificant differences between active and placebo periods with regard to lung function, medication, nocturnal asthma or other symptoms supposed to be related to indoor climate...|$|R
50|$|The Doctor and Victoria {{adjust the}} Martian sonic cannon {{so it will}} harm the Ice Warriors and not the humans. Penley alters the {{temperature}} and atmosphere controls in the base so it becomes uncomfortable for the Martians. The Doctor fires the sonic cannon, forcing Varga and his men to retreat from the base. He fuses the sonic cannon before he and Victoria flee the ship. The Doctor works with Penley to recalibrate the <b>Ioniser.</b> The computer calculates a fifty-percent chance that the <b>Ioniser</b> will explode when trained on a spacecraft with an ion engine; Penley tells Clent to work without {{the advice of the}} computer. When the computer overloads, Penley takes charge and starts the <b>Ioniser.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sonic blast {{triggered}} by Zondal glances the base, causing minor damage. Varga uses the communicator to call Clent, threatening to fire again unless the humans surrender. Clent knows the base dome cannot survive another sonic blast and suggests a peace {{meeting between the}} two sides. The talks fail when a demented technician, Walters, tries to shoot the Martians. Varga dismantles the <b>Ioniser</b> reactor to get the mercury isotopes he needs for his ship. Without the <b>ioniser,</b> the glaciers move forward.|$|E
50|$|Cecil Alfred 'Coppy' Laws (also C A ‘Coppy’ Laws and C A Laws) (21 November 1916 - 28 May 2002) was a British {{electronic}} {{engineer and}} radar engineer during World War II, and {{the inventor of}} the domestic air <b>ioniser</b> or ionizer.|$|E
50|$|Acupuncture is not {{recommended}} for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use. Air <b>ionisers</b> show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.|$|R
50|$|Negative air {{ionization}} {{therapy is}} the use of air <b>ionisers</b> as an experimental non-pharmaceutical treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and mild depression. Research seems to indicate that high doses work better than placebo but low doses do not.|$|R
50|$|The SARS {{epidemic}} {{fueled the}} desire for personal <b>ionisers</b> in East Asia, including Japan (where many products have been specialised to contain negative ion generators, including toothbrushes, refrigerators, air conditioners, air cleaners, and washing machines). There are no specific standards for these devices.|$|R
50|$|Funding all the {{research}} himself, he developed the world’s first effective home air <b>ioniser.</b> In the decades that followed, he became an international expert in electro-medical science. Other machines came on the market, all based on versions of his patents, but his instruments set the standard.|$|E
50|$|The Martian craft {{begins to}} power up but is {{destroyed}} by the <b>Ioniser.</b> The ship explodes without starting a chain reaction, which solves {{the problem of the}} Ice Warriors and the glacier. Their work done, the TARDIS crew slip away as green shoots emerge through the melting snow.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ioniser</b> {{planning}} {{meeting is}} interrupted when Jamie {{reports that the}} creature has taken Victoria. However, only Arden and Jamie can be spared for a search party. The creature identifies itself to Victoria as Varga, an Ice Warrior from the planet Mars, who has been frozen for millennia. He insists that Victoria help him find his ship and crew.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{negative}} ions to improve {{indoor air quality}} has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Although the physical action of air <b>ionisers</b> is accepted, there is still debate over their apparent biocidal action. A recent clinical trial in an intensive care unit suggested that air <b>ionisers</b> may {{have a role in}} reducing the transmission of infection in healthcare environments 1 and several authors have reported that ions inhibit the growth of a range of microorganisms. A further understanding of this process was gained through bench scale experiments exposing sessile cultures to positive and negative ions 2. The aim of the work presented here was to follow on from the bench scale experiments to investigate the efficacy {{of negative}} ions with aerosolised microorganisms...|$|R
5000|$|Consumer Reports, a {{non-profit}} US-based product-testing magazine, reported in October 2003 that air <b>ionisers</b> do not perform to high enough standards compared to conventional HEPA filters. The exception {{was a combination}} unit that used a fan to move air while ionizing it. In response to this report, The Sharper Image, a manufacturer of air <b>ionisers</b> (among other products), sued Consumer's Union (the publishers of Consumer Reports) for product defamation. Consumer Reports gave the Ionic Breeze and other popular units a [...] "fail" [...] {{because they have a}} low Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). CADR measures the amount of filtered air circulated during a short period of time, and was originally designed to rate media-based air cleaners. The Sharper Image claimed that this test was a poor way to rate the Ionic Breeze, since it {{does not take into account}} other features, such as 24-hour-a-day continuous cleaning, ease of maintenance, and silent operation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on {{negative}} ion generators. Some studies show that the ozone generated can exceed guidelines in small, non ventilated areas. One study showed that ozone can react with other constituents, namely cleaning agents to increase pollutants such as formaldehyde (importantly, this study had as its objective the testing of the use of cleaning products and air fresheners indoors and associated health risks as opposed to adverse health effects of air <b>ionisers).</b>|$|R
50|$|Penley brings Jamie to base on a {{motorised}} sled. Clent gives Penley a frosty reception, {{and they}} bicker. Clent {{says he has}} {{decided to use the}} <b>Ioniser.</b> Zondal has been given the task of arming the sonic cannon. The Doctor and Victoria release the chemical solution in Zondal’s face. The Warrior collapses, but his hand activates the sonic cannon as he falls.|$|E
50|$|Air ionisers {{are often}} used in places where work is done {{involving}} static-electricity-sensitive electronic components, to eliminate the build-up of static charges on non-conductors. As those elements {{are very sensitive to}} electricity, they cannot be grounded because the discharge will destroy them as well. Usually, the work is done over a special dissipative table mat, which allows a very slow discharge, and under an air gush of <b>ioniser.</b>|$|E
50|$|All Cube {{models have}} {{optional}} extras including an Ion filter (Air <b>Ioniser)</b> for cleaning {{the air and}} Nissan's 'smart key' which allows the driver to enter the car without having to use a key. Other options include a sunroof, 12 different styles of front grill and satellite navigation. Other specific models also have different styles of bodykits and fender flares. They come with optional 14 or 15 inch wheels and the Autech version with chrome stylings and a vinyl style of seat covering.|$|E
50|$|CW {{multipliers}} {{are typically}} {{used to develop}} higher voltages for relatively low-current applications, such as bias voltages ranging from tens or hundreds of volts to millions of volts for high-energy physics experiments or lightning safety testing. CW multipliers are also found, with a higher number of stages, in laser systems, high-voltage power supplies, X-ray systems, LCD backlighting, traveling-wave tube amplifiers, ion pumps, electrostatic systems, air <b>ionisers,</b> particle accelerators, copy machines, scientific instrumentation, oscilloscopes, television sets and cathode ray tubes, electroshock weapons, bug zappers and many other applications that use high-voltage DC.|$|R
50|$|Some buildings, {{as well as}} {{aircraft}} and other human-made environments (e.g., satellites and space shuttles) use foam, pleated paper, or spun fiberglass filter elements. Another method, air <b>ionisers,</b> use fibers or elements with a static electric charge, which attract dust particles. The air intakes of internal combustion engines and air compressors tend to use either paper, foam, or cotton filters. Oil bath filters have fallen out of favor. The technology of air intake filters of gas turbines has improved significantly in recent years, due to improvements in the aerodynamics and fluid dynamics of the air-compressor part of the gas turbines.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the primeval sources of {{radiation}} and particles on the thermodynamical state of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionisation is still unclear. In this work, we explore the contribution of electrons accelerated in the jets of high-redshift microquasars to heating and ionising the intergalactic medium. We develop Monte Carlo simulations of the propagation and energy deposition of these electrons as they travel away from their sources. We find that microquasars contribute significantly to heating the intergalactic medium and are effective <b>ionisers</b> only near the galaxies. Their effect on heating is of the same order of magnitude than that of CRs from SNe...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} instance, shaped {{electrostatic}} fields (ESF's) create hydrostatic pressure (HSP, or motion) in dielectric media. When such media are fluids, a flow is produced. If the dielectric is a vacuum or a solid, no flow is produced. Such flow can be {{directed against the}} electrodes, generally to move the electrodes. In such case, the moving structure acts as an electric motor. Practical fields of interest of EHD are the common air <b>ioniser,</b> electrohydrodynamic thrusters and EHD cooling systems.|$|E
5000|$|The TARDIS arrives {{outside the}} base. The Second Doctor, Jamie and Victoria go inside, where the Doctor helps with the <b>Ioniser.</b> Arden and Walters reach the base with their prize, and Arden {{sets up a}} device to melt the ice around the man. The Doctor {{examines}} the frozen man, and they determine that the [...] "ice warrior" [...] is an alien being. An emergency meeting distracts the staff; no one notices that the ice block has melted, with the creature showing signs of life. The creature becomes mobile, knocks Jamie unconscious, and takes Victoria hostage.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Penley {{has found}} the Doctor and taken him to Jamie. He determines that Jamie has {{temporary}} paralysis and heads to the Martian craft. He offers himself as an envoy, leaving his communicator active so Clent can hear, and is allowed to enter the airlock. With the glacier threatening to crush the spacecraft, the Doctor gets Victoria released to him. Before Varga takes the communicator the Doctor relays the message that Clent needs to use the <b>Ioniser,</b> regardless of consequences. The Doctor is marched {{to the core of}} the spacecraft, where he spots an ion propulsion system. Varga decides to attack the base and orders his Warriors to prepare a sonic cannon.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} renewed {{interest}} in the use of air <b>ionisers</b> to control of the spread of airborne infection. One characteristic of air ions which has been widely reported is their apparent biocidal action. However, whilst the body of evidence suggests a biocidal effect in the presence of air ions the physical and biological mechanisms involved remain unclear. In particular, it is not clear which of several possible mechanisms of electrical origin (i. e. the action of the ions, the production of ozone, or the action of the electric field) are responsible for cell death. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify this issue and to determine the physical mechanisms associated with microbial cell death. ...|$|R

50|$|Air <b>ionisers</b> {{are used}} in air purifiers to remove {{particles}} from air. Airborne particles are attracted to the electrode in an effect similar to static electricity. These ions are de-ionised by seeking earthed conductors, such as walls and ceilings. To increase the efficiency of this process, some commercial products provide such surfaces within the device. The frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service (NHS) to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne acinetobacter infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser—the infection rate fell to zero, an unexpected result. Positive and negative ions produced by air conditioning systems have also been found by a manufacturer to inactivate viruses including influenza.|$|R
50|$|In {{the distant}} future at Brittanicus Base, senior control {{technician}} Jan Garrett {{and her staff}} struggle to control an <b>ioniser</b> they are using to slow the progress of glaciers rolling over Britain. Leader Clent is convinced they can avert a new Ice Age, but the group knows they {{are only a few}} hours away from being forced to abandon the base. Tensions rise when Penley, a maverick scientist who has defected from the team, is mentioned. The remaining senior scientist, Arden, is on the glacier searching for archaeological finds, where he discovers an armoured man within a block of ice. Arden and his colleagues dig the ice man from the glacier. Two scavengers observe their actions: the anti-technology Storr and Penley, who live in the tundra. When one of Arden’s team is killed in an avalanche, the other two head back to base with the ice man. Storr too is injured in the avalanche.|$|E
50|$|Shah wrote {{around two}} dozen more books over the {{following}} decades, many of them drawing on classical Sufi sources. Achieving a huge worldwide circulation, his writings appealed primarily to an intellectually oriented Western audience. By translating Sufi teachings into contemporary psychological language, he presented them in vernacular and hence accessible terms. His folktales, illustrating Sufi wisdom through anecdote and example, proved particularly popular. Shah received and accepted invitations to lecture as a visiting professor at academic institutions including the University of California, the University of Geneva, the National University of La Plata and various English universities. Besides his literary and educational work, he found time to design an air <b>ioniser</b> (forming a company together with Coppy Laws) and run a number of textile, ceramics and electronics companies. He also undertook several journeys to his ancestral Afghanistan and involved himself in setting up relief efforts there; he drew on these experiences later on in his book Kara Kush, a novel about the Soviet war in Afghanistan.|$|E
40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{interest}} in the possible benefits to asthmatic patients of negative ion generators and the largely uncontrolled and inconclusive nature of earlier studies a double blind crossover study of this treatment {{was carried out in}} 20 subjects with stable asthma over six months. After an initial two week period without an <b>ioniser,</b> active or placebo ionisers were installed in subjects' bedrooms for two eight week periods separated by a four week "washout" period when no <b>ioniser</b> was present. The study was completed by a final four week period when no <b>ioniser</b> was present. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive an active or a placebo <b>ioniser</b> first. Subjects recorded their peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) twice daily, completed a daily symptom score questionnaire, and noted any treatment they took on a diary card. Recordings were completed throughout the trial. Ion counts and dust concentrations were measured in subjects' bedrooms during the study. Mean ion counts rose considerably when ionisers were activated (p less than 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences in}} PEFR, symptom score, or consumption of medication between the periods that active ionisers and either no ionisers or placebo ionisers were in operation. This study has failed to show a statistically significant benefit in asthmatic subjects from the use of negative ion generators...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundNon-specific cough {{has been}} defined as {{non-productive}} cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology and is common in childhood. These children are treated with a variety of therapies, including non-pharmacological treatments. There is a wide variety and a growing market for these non-pharmacological treatments that include air-modification modalities. ObjectivesTo determine the efficacy of air-modification modalities, (<b>ionisers,</b> vaporisers, humidifiers, air filters, regular vacuuming), in treating children with non-specific cough. Search methodsThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in November 2008. Selection criteriaAll randomised controlled trials comparing air-modification modalities with a placebo treatment, for any duration. Data collection and analysisResults of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Five papers were considered for inclusion but no eligible trials were identified and thus no data was available for analysis. Main resultsNo randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy of air-modification modalities in the management of prolonged, non-specific cough in children were found. Authors 2 ̆ 7 conclusionsBased on the evidence currently available, a recommendation can not be given for air-modification interventions in the treatment of prolonged, non-specific cough in children...|$|R
