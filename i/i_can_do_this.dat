25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Saunderson {{has also}} {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Europe but {{he claims to have}} been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: [...] "I was more infatuated with the idea that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> all myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|I don't feel {{helpless}} or anything. I don't {{feel like}} I {{have to be}} like, [...] "I'm a female and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> if I want to", cause, of course I can. I already know that, and I never felt being female hurt anything. If anything, it helped.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{determined}} to stop off at Cleveland," [...] {{he said to}} Captain Jasper. [...] "If there is anything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for <b>this</b> poor fellow, I will do it willingly." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, my dearest, it's {{not hard}} to risk your life {{in the midst of}} battle. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that--but <b>this</b> needs more {{strength}} than I've got. I tell you I can't endure it.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Better so than live here, useless and despised,’ said Perseus. ‘Tell me, then, oh tell me, {{fair and}} wise Goddess, of your great {{kindness}} and condescension, how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> but <b>this</b> one thing, and then, if need be, die!’ ...|$|R
2500|$|During the trial, Corby {{wrote to}} the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, saying [...] "as a father and as a leader, I plead for your help. I did not do this. I beg for justice. I don't know how much longer <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Please bring me home." [...] Of Corby, Howard said: [...] "I feel for her. I {{understand}} why there's a lot of public sympathy for her; I would simply say that I hope justice is done and it's a fair and true verdict ... I would ask the rhetorical question: My fellow Australians, if a foreigner were to come to Australia and a foreign government were to start telling us how we should handle , we would react very angrily to that." [...] The Australian Labor Party generally supported the government's approach to the case in not wanting to interfere in Indonesia's judicial system, while Australian Greens leader Bob Brown criticised the verdict.|$|E

6000|$|Jeff spared him {{the pain}} of a response. [...] "Very well," [...] {{he said to his}} mother; [...] "I'm not the hotel, and you never want me to be. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> on my own account." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{pressed my}} hand gently. [...] "Remember what I told {{you on the}} moor," [...] he answered. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> you <b>this</b> little service, Mr. Blake, I shall feel it like a last gleam of sunshine, falling {{on the evening of}} a long and clouded day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you see, dear, {{that it is}} {{just because}} your future as obscure that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> You never would have done it, I know,--and I couldn't face that. Don't you {{understand}} that I am demanding the great sacrifice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{make it all}} right," [...] Lane declared, {{crawling}} around another corner. [...] "Gee! {{but this}} is the toughest thing in driving I've ever known! I can do ninety with this car easier than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> three. Hullo, some one else in trouble!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet I dare {{swear that}} you will be of a {{different}} mind within five minutes. A wizard is one who discloses things unknown to his fellow-men. I am about to convince you that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and by convincing you I am about to serve you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to favourable reviews, with Creosote noting, [...] "It feels {{like this is}} the beginning of something. And to feel that so far down the line, after putting out forty effing albums... oh my God! It means, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> it's not over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I needed {{not to be}} a prophetess to {{know that}} you would speak thus,' said Medea. 'But one thing even <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> Take <b>this</b> phial, and bear it in your breast, and, when you face the Minotaur, do as I shall tell you.' Then she whispered some words to Theseus, and he marked them carefully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{that is my}} name. I {{never had}} the {{pleasure}} of meeting you at Norwich, though I often heard of you there. And since I left the place I have been told how kind a friend you have been to this young lady. I trust I may live to thank you for it more warmly though not more sincerely than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> at <b>this</b> moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of hotel? It's {{what you}} call hostel. The man that can do this miracle can keep hostel. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> miracle; I shall do this miracle; yet I {{do not try to}} conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the occult powers to the last strain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that card!!!! Say--just {{hold on a}} second. Here, now, {{watch what}} you're at this time. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> cursed thing, mind you, every time. I've done it on father, on mother, and on every one that's ever come round our place. Pick a card. (Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle--flip, bang.) There, that's your card." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They're--some one else's. But isn't it good? Isn't it thundering good? Wasn't {{it worth}} the whiskey? I did it. Alone I did it, and it's the best I can do.' He drew his breath sharply, and whispered, 'Just God! what could I not do ten years hence, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> now!--By the way, {{what do you think}} of it, Bess?' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I wish {{mine was}} the {{experience}} of all Arab women," [...] she says, [...] "and {{one of the reasons}} I still live in the Arab world is because I want to rally people around me and influence young people not to be confined by society or relationships or family or gender roles. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>do</b> <b>this</b> through film and poetry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'VE {{finished}} my book, {{and now what}} <b>CAN</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> till <b>this</b> tiresome rain is over?" [...] exclaimed Carrie, as she lay back {{on the couch with}} a yawn of weariness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't she hire a valet de place, {{and talk}} to him? I'd hire one myself for her. It {{would be a good}} deal cheaper for me. It's as much as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to stand <b>this</b> weather as it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wayland had his misgivings, {{but did not}} say so. His {{confidence}} in his guide was complete. She would do her part, that was certain. Several times {{she was forced to}} dismount and blaze out a new path in order to avoid some bog; but she sternly refused his aid. [...] "You must not get off," [...] she warned; [...] "stay where you are. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> work better alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{hold the}} light, Songbird," [...] {{directed}} Tom. [...] "Sam and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> work without any help." [...] Then the two Rovers set to work, {{and in a}} very short time the old shoe with its inner tube had been removed. In the meantime, Songbird had brought out another inner tube, and unstrapped one of the extra shoes attached to the side of the car, and these were quickly placed over the wheel rim.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have become}} a human being----owning myself. I had never thought what this change would be to me.... It has been----. It has been--like being born, when one hadn't {{realized}} before that one wasn't born.... Now--now I can act. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> and that. I used to feel as though I was on strings--with somebody able to pull.... There is no one now able to pull at me, no one able to thwart me...." ...|$|E
5000|$|Estelle {{said about}} the video: [...] "There are two {{arguments}} {{going on in your}} head. I can't be fake, but how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> without feeling like a slut?" [...] It's a tough one.|$|R
60|$|BUILDER. I'm to be {{nominated}} for Mayor next month. Harris tipped me the wink at the last Council meeting. Not so bad at forty-seven--h'm? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make a thundering good Mayor. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> things for <b>this</b> town that nobody else can.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> {{to please}} your aunt, who thinks better of me than I deserve, when---Oh! excuse me---I {{know it is}} all your kindness---but when I am {{allowing}} you to deceive her---almost, I mean---' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is impossible," [...] {{he broke}} forth in answer, {{and his voice}} gave her a {{perceptible}} shock. [...] "There must be something I can do. If {{it will help you}} there is my arm--its blood is yours." [...] He stammered a little. [...] "It isn't right that one so young and beautiful should die. We won't let you die. There must be something <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> wind and sun--and the good water will work with us to do you good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 60. I pass to {{the second}} great {{function}} of religious art, the limitation {{of the idea of}} Divine presence to particular localities. It is of course impossible within my present limits to touch upon this power of art, as employed on the temples of the gods of various religions; we will examine that on future occasions. To-day, I want only to map out main ideas, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> best by speaking exclusively of this localising influence as it affects our own faith.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{that will}} do." [...] Smith placed the knife inside his coat, {{and led the}} way to the quadrangle. [...] "We are neither of us chickens, Hastie," [...] said he. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> job alone, but I take you as a precaution. I am going to have a little talk with Bellingham. If I have only him to deal with, I won't, of course, need you. If I shout, however, up you come, and lam out with your whip {{as hard as you can}} lick. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he paused}} {{on the steps}} to the hotel, a gust of bitter rage swept over him. [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> against <b>this</b> implacable town? Oh, for a squad of the boys in blue!" ...|$|R
60|$|Almanz. I'll stop {{at nothing}} that appears so brave: I'll do't, and now I no reward will have. You've given my honour such an ample field, That I may die, but that shall never yield. Spite of myself I'll stay, fight, love, despair; And <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> all <b>this,</b> because <b>I</b> dare. Yet I may own one suit-- That scarf, which, since by you {{it has been}} borne, Is blessed, like relicks which by saints were worn.|$|R
40|$|I found Professor Dell'Orto's {{account of}} 'the Husserlian notion of "motivation" by {{comparison}} with Kantian Schematism' instructive and I appreciate her aim 'to recast the transcendental basis of Phenomenology taking the opacity of consciousness in serious account'. I must admit that I am not sure if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> justice to <b>this</b> compact paper...|$|R
