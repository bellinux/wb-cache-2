5|$|The common {{thresher}} is migratory, {{moving to}} higher latitudes following warm water masses. In the eastern Pacific, males travel further than females, reaching {{as far as}} Vancouver Island {{in the late summer}} and early fall. Juveniles tend to remain in warm nursery areas. There appear to be separate populations with <b>different</b> <b>life</b> history characteristics in the eastern Pacific and western Indian Ocean and possibly elsewhere; this species is not known to make transoceanic movements. In the northwestern Indian Ocean, males and females segregate by location and depth during the pupping season from January to May. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed substantial regional genetic variation within common threshers in all three oceans. This could support the idea that, despite being high mobile, sharks from different areas rarely interbreed.|$|E

25|$|Emanuel co-wrote, The {{complete}} lives system discriminates against older people. Age-based allocation is ageism. Unlike allocation by sex or race, allocation by age is not invidious discrimination; {{every person}} lives through <b>different</b> <b>life</b> stages {{rather than being}} a single age. Even if 25-year-olds receive priority over 65-year-olds, everyone who is 65 years now was previously 25 years. Treating 65-year-olds differently because of stereotypes or falsehoods would be ageist; treating them differently because they have already had more life-years is not.|$|E
25|$|Cuvier’s fossil {{evidence}} {{showed that}} very <b>different</b> <b>life</b> forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists. The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature. Cuvier understood extinction {{to be the result}} of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time. His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism.|$|E

25|$|C.S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity and elsewhere, {{raised the}} {{argument}} from desire. He posed that all natural desires {{have a natural}} object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies {{the existence of such}} things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a <b>different</b> <b>life,</b> necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptist Lamarck, a gradualist and {{colleague}} of Cuvier, saw the fossils of <b>different</b> <b>life</b> forms {{as evidence of}} the mutable character of species. While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change. Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that {{the surface of the earth}} was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.|$|E
25|$|When Watson and Crick {{produced}} their {{double helix}} model of DNA, {{it was known}} {{that most of the}} specialized features of the many <b>different</b> <b>life</b> forms on Earth are made possible by proteins. Structurally, proteins are long chains of amino acid subunits. In some way, the genetic molecule, DNA, had to contain instructions for how to make the thousands of proteins found in cells. From the DNA double helix model, it was clear that there must be some correspondence between the linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules to the linear sequences of amino acids in proteins. The details of how sequences of DNA instruct cells to make specific proteins was worked out by molecular biologists during the period from 1953 to 1965. Francis Crick played an integral role in both the theory and analysis of the experiments that led to an improved understanding of the genetic code.|$|E
