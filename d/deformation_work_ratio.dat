There was a close correlation between the mechanical characteristics and the non-ideal storage time. Sensory evaluation showed significant ranking in “bite and chewing”, “sweet taste” and “global impression” attributes according to the Page test. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were determined for the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force and <b>deformation</b> <b>work</b> <b>ratio</b> and these showed that PC 1 followed a tendency {{similar to that of}} the storage time. PCA plots were determined for the electronic tongue measurements and this PCA separated the sample groups along PC 1 and PC 2. We used partial least square (PLS) regression to predict “bite and chewing” from the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force, and <b>deformation</b> <b>work</b> <b>ratio</b> with an acceptable correlation. The “sweet taste” was predicted from the electronic tongue measurement results with good correlation.

Exploring the isokinetic <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> of eccentric antagonist/concentric agonist shoulder rotators in {{the late}} cocking and deceleration phases of a forehand overhead smash in badminton players. Comparing the <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> between dominant and nondominant shoulders. Background: The strength of shoulder muscles for badminton players has been studied {{but there is little}} information on the work output of these muscles for a specific range of movement. Methods and Measures: Twenty-five skilled men who play badminton at club level {{with a mean age of}} 29. 4 years (SD = 6. 1) were measured for concentric and eccentric isokinetic work (joules) of shoulder internal (IR) and external (ER) rotators on both upper extremities at 120 °/s. Bilateral isokinetic <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> for eccentric IR/concentric ER between 60 ° and 90 ° of shoulder external rotation were calculated to denote strength profile {{in the late}} cocking phase of the badminton smash. <b>Work</b> <b>ratios</b> for eccentric ER/concentric IR between 10 ° external rotation and 30 ° internal rotation were calculated to denote strength profile in the deceleration phase of the badminton smash. The respective <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> were compared between both shoulders. Result: The eccentric IR/concentric ER <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> in late cocking were 1. 9 : 1 and 1. 3 : 1 (P = 0. 001) for the dominant and nondominant shoulders, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} the isokinetic strength profiles and <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> {{of the shoulder}} internal and external rotators in sport climbers and to compare them with these profiles and ratios in nonclimbers. We hypothesized that the strength profiles of the shoulder rotators were different between sport climbers and nonclimbers. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Exercise science laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Thirty-one experienced sport climbers and 27 nonclimbers. Main Outcome Measure(s) : We tested all participants by measuring the isokinetic concentric and eccentric work output of their shoulder rotators in the middle 110 ° of shoulder rotation. We measured mean conventional <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> of concentric external rotation (ER) to internal rotation (IR) (con ER:IR) and eccentric ER to IR (ecc ER:IR), and we measured mean functional <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> of eccentric ER to concentric IR (ecc ER:con IR) and eccentric IR to concentric ER (ecc IR:con ER). Results: All <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> were different between the 2 groups (P <. 001). In the climbers, the conventional <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> were smaller than 1 for con ER:IR (0. 79) and ecc ER:IR (0. 88), whereas for the nonclimbers, the ratios were 1. 03 and 1. 13, respectively. The functional <b>work</b> <b>ratio</b> of ecc ER:con IR was smaller for the climbers (1. 05) than for the nonclimbers (1. 30), but the functional <b>work</b> <b>ratio</b> of ecc IR:con ER was larger for the climbers (1. 58) than for the nonclimbers (1. 17). Conclusions: The difference in <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> of the shoulder rotators between participant groups {{might be due to}} traininginduced changes in the shoulder rotation muscles of sport climbers.

Crack nucleation period of low cycle fatigue might even be shortened by material and fabrication defects and by environmental attack. In these cases, fatigue life is largely crack propagation period. The characteristic crack tip field was studied by the finite element method, and the crack tip field {{is related to the}} far field parameters: the <b>deformation</b> <b>work</b> density, and the product of applied stress and applied strain. The cyclic carck growth rates in specimens in general yielding as measured by Solomon are analyzed in terms of J-integral. A generalized crack behavior in terms of delta is developed. The relations between J and the far field parameters and the relation for the general cyclic crack growth behavior are used to analyze fatigue lives of specimens under general-yielding cyclic-load. Fatigue life is related to the applied stress and strain ranges, the <b>deformation</b> <b>work</b> density, crack nucleus size, fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth threshold, Young's modulus, and the cyclic yield stress and strain.

40|$|Division {{of labor}} {{has been studied}} {{separately}} from a proximate self-organization and an ultimate evolutionary perspective. We aim to bring together these two perspectives. So far this {{has been done by}} choosing a behavioral mechanism a priori and considering the evolution of the properties of this mechanism. Here we use artificial neural networks to allow for a more open architecture. We study whether emergent division of labor can evolve in two different network architectures; a simple feedforward network, and a more complex network that includes the possibility of self-feedback from previous experiences. We focus on two aspects of division of labor; worker specialization and the <b>ratio</b> of <b>work</b> performed for each task. Colony fitness is maximized by both reducing idleness and achieving a predefined optimal <b>work</b> <b>ratio.</b> Our results indicate that architectural constraints play an important role for the outcome of evolution. With the simplest network, only genetically determined specialization is possible. This imposes several limitations on worker specialization. Moreover, in order to minimize idleness, networks evolve a biased <b>work</b> <b>ratio,</b> even when an unbiased <b>work</b> <b>ratio</b> would be optimal. By adding self-feedback to the network we increase the network’s flexibility and worker specialization evolves under a wider parameter range. Optimal <b>work</b> <b>ratios</b> are more easily achieved with the self-feedback network, but still provide a challenge when combined with worker specialization...|$|R
