500|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, Us Weekly ran a cover story titled Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On. Timberlake denied that Spears {{inspired}} the video, saying, [...] "The video is not about her. The video is about me." [...] However, Spears told Rolling Stone in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her would be in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, [...] "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal". Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, [...] "Well, I got a controversial video." [...] She stated that it was a great publicity stunt, commenting, [...] "So he got what he wanted. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like such a desperate attempt, personally."

2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now {{we have to move}} on. We have done our best, but he has made it clear he wants to go and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> pretty final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E

De Ribaumont, our governor, will give orders for the supply of your state costume. He is a good fellow. Of course, he has to be rather strict with us; but so long as there is nothing done that he considers discreditable to our position, he lets us do pretty nearly as we like.|$|E
2500|$|As for Hopkins, he {{was upset}} with the {{official}} decision {{and said that he}} was robbed of a clear points win. Hopkins said, [...] "I just really feel like I took the guy to school.

6000|$|I was so {{surprised}} this afternoon, when I happened {{to go down to}} the door, to see Mr. Peters, the ice gentleman that was on the ship, with his ice cart delivering ice into the basement. I knew that he delivered ice in this part of the city because he said so, and I think he had mentioned this street, and two or three times I thought I had seen him from the window. But it did seem surprising to happen {{to go down to the}} door (I forget what I went for) at the moment that he was there. He looked very fine in his big rough suit of overalls. It is not quite like a military uniform, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> better. Mr. Peters knew me at once. [...] "Good afternoon, Miss Hohen," [...] he said (that is the name, as I think I said, that we have here), [...] "how are all the folks?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Magda Cordell {{has said}} that [...] "While Richard, of course, put {{together}} the well-known poster collage for the group (Just {{what is it that}} makes today's homes so different, so appealing?), some of the material in that collage came from John McHale's files, and both Terry Hamilton and I helped gather the images. We often looked for material in the studio John and I shared. Sometimes when I look at that poster, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> a bit like the sitting room in Cleveland Square where our studio was, but this may be only my imagination".|$|E
5000|$|According to Matt Skiba, {{the band}} were: [...] "doing the photo shoot {{and we had}} a {{completely}} different idea of what the record was going to look like. And Monica was there doing our styling; she got a bunch of outfits and she did the styling for pretty much all the new pictures for the record. She was there and the photographer was just doing all these different things and he had her stand in. He was toying with these different ideas with just a small portion of her face in the picture and then, lo and behold, she's our cover star. So we thought it looked cool and the people at the art department are in cahoots with the photographer who is amazing. Everybody who worked on the thing was cool and hands on and saw these pictures of her and were asking “who is that?” I said “that's my girlfriend” and they said “that's perfect, we have to use her." [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> very cinematic, and that's what we were going for. Once it was coming together, it was like film noir.|$|E
6000|$|Adeline {{began to}} cry. [...] "I want to <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> seems such a dreadful thing {{to sell the}} place. And why need you hurry to send off a letter to Mr. Hilary about it?

6000|$|Miserable little propitiators of a remorseless Idol, how abject {{we were to}} him! What {{a launch}} in life <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> now, on <b>looking</b> back, to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions! ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was quite}} easy to portray {{him because he}} has strong characteristics. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> does <b>look</b> like him, if not at his most rested. He keeps up a {{rigorous}} international performance schedule and lives between Sydney and London. He was suffering jet lag or in post concert letdown when he sat for this painting. When he last saw the work he said, love the whiskers, remind me to stop over in Bangkok next time.|$|R

Gerrard scored 23 goals in 53 appearances in 2005-06, and in April became the first Liverpool player since John Barnes in 1988 to be voted the PFA Player of the Year. He scored twice in the 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham United, including a 35-yard equaliser that sent the match into extra time, and Liverpool won their second consecutive major trophy on penalties. The goals made him the only player to have scored in the FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup and Champions League finals. Liverpool eliminated Chelsea in the 2006-07 Champions League semi-finals on penalties, to return to their second final in three seasons, which they lost 2-1 to Milan in Athens.|$|E
5000|$|Ryan was not {{designed}} to be an immortal character from the beginning. According to Executive Producer Bill Panzer talking about [...] "The Gathering", [...] "we weren't sure ourselves that he was gonna become an Immortal." [...] Panzer adds, [...] "we'd laid some pipe for {{that in the first}} episode of season one. But we hadn't really decided whether we were gonna make him an Immortal or not make him an Immortal." [...] Panzer goes on, [...] "When we cast Stan, we were just looking for a good actor and we found one, likeable, charming, and building a very nice fanbase. We had not anticipated, when we cast him, that the option might exist for him to become an Immortal. But we laid at that into the very first episode, [...] "The Gathering", and we decided that we were gonna exercise that option as a fact now. Certainly, he had to go from being MacLeod's sort of, sidekick, and, you know, younger brother character, to taking his place in the world of Immortals. And the first thing you have to learn as an Immortal is {{how to take care of}} yourself. So, Stan had to, in addition to (...) beginning to change the way his relationship worked with his character and MacLeod's character, he also had to learn how to do this stuff and we had to see (...) a growth pattern coming from him." [...] Panzer explains that a specific location was chosen for Richie's first fight, because both Stan Kirsch and Sheena Easton were doing their first swordfight ever: [...] "To make everything a little easier for them, we set it in an almost impossible location-- the steps leading up to the lighthouse (...) And for two people who really had never done it before, between some clever directing and some clever editing, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like they're going at it." [...] Panzer thinks [...] "Under Color of Authority" [...] was Ryan's coming of age because it was his first Quickening. Panzer says, [...] "This is the time for Richie to leave and kind of find himself, sort of see what it's like, surviving on the outside," [...] and it is also a hard time for MacLeod; is he crying, is he sad to see him go, is he a little afraid for him, you know it's like any time you turn a youngster loose in the world, even today's world, it's a pretty scary moment for the parent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear lad," [...] he said, with a laugh, laying his fat hand upon my shoulder, [...] "I {{remember}} {{one of your}} widows writing me a pathetic letter about some shares she had taken in a Silver Company of mine. Lord knows where the mine is now--somewhere in Spain, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> as though all her savings were gone. She had an only son, and it was nearly all they possessed in the world, etc., etc.--you know the sort of thing. Well, I did what I've often been numskull enough to do in similar cases, wrote and offered to buy her out at par. A week later she answered, thanking me, but saying it did not matter. There had occurred a momentary rise, and she had sold out at a profit--to her own brother-in-law, as I discovered, happening to come across the transfers. You can find widows and orphans round the Monte Carlo card tables, {{if you like to}} look for them; they are no more deserving of consideration {{than the rest of the}} crowd. Besides, if it comes to that, I'm an orphan myself;" [...] and he laughed again, one of his deep, hearty, honest laughs. No one ever possessed a laugh more suggestive in its every cadence of simple, transparent honesty. He used to say himself it was worth thousands to him.|$|R

The world title in a second {{division}} and a win in America is just icing on the cake for my career."Roy Jones, Jr. was discussed as the next most likely opponent for Calzaghe,and that fight took place in November 2008.As for Hopkins, he was upset with the official decision and said that he was robbed of a clear points win. Hopkins said, [...] "I just really feel like I took the guy to school. I feel like I made him fight my fight, not his. I wanted him to run into my shots. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> made him do that, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> made <b>it</b> <b>look</b> pretty easy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> controlled the pace, and I controlled the fight." ...|$|R

Gordon tells me every day I must decide, and then I ask Captain Lovelock what he thinks; because, you see, he always thinks a great deal. Captain Lovelock says he does n't care a fig--that he will go {{wherever}} I go. So you see that does n't carry us very far. I want to settle on some place where Captain Lovelock won't go, but he won't help me at all. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will <b>look</b> better for him not to follow us; don't you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will <b>look</b> better, Mrs. Vivian? Not that I care in the least where we go--or whether Captain Lovelock follows us, either. I don't take any interest in anything, Mrs. Vivian; don't you think that is very sad? Gordon may go anywhere he likes--to St. Petersburg, or to Bombay." ...|$|R

60|$|As Isaac grew older, it {{was found}} that he had far more {{important}} matters in his mind than the manufacture of toys like the little windmill. All day long, if left to himself, he was either absorbed in thought or engaged in some book of mathematics or natural philosophy. At night, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> probable, he <b>looked</b> up with reverential curiosity to the stars, and wondered whether they were worlds like our own, and how great was their distance from the earth, and what was the power that kept them in their courses. Perhaps, even so early in life, Isaac Newton felt a presentiment that he should be able, hereafter, to answer all these questions.|$|R
5000|$|Pastore {{served as}} the {{chairman}} of United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications. He is probably best remembered for taking part in a 1969 hearing involving a $20 million grant for the funding of PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was proposed by former President Lyndon Johnson. President Richard Nixon had wanted to cut the proposed funding to $10 million due {{to the demands of the}} Vietnam War, and Fred Rogers, host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, appeared before the committee to argue for the full $20 million. In about six minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television provided. Pastore was not previously familiar with Rogers' work, and was sometimes described as gruff and impatient. However, he told Rogers that the testimony had given him goose bumps, and after Rogers recited the lyrics to [...] "What Do You Do with the Mad that You Feel?", one of the songs from his show, Pastore finally declared: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> wonderful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> wonderful. <b>Looks</b> like you just earned the $20 million." [...] The following year's appropriation increased PBS funding from $9 million to $22 million.|$|R

I was a rough one, my dear; I wasn't a pretty little lamb like that pair. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> because you <b>look</b> after them--that's what makes 'em so sweet. The one in my time--what was her name? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was Bald or Bold--I rather think she found me a handful. I used to kick her shins--I was decidedly vicious. And do you see it's kept so well, Laura?' he went on, looking round him. ''Pon my soul, it's the prettiest room in the house.

Perhaps you ARE a hundred years old, now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it.</b> You <b>look</b> more than a hundred. Yes, {{you may be a}} thousand years old for what I know. Your teeth are false. One eye is evidently false. Can I say that the other is not? If a man's age may be calculated by the rings round his eyes, this man may be as old as Methuselah. He has no beard. He wears a large curly glossy brown wig, and his eyebrows are painted a deep olive-green. It was odd to hear this man, this walking mummy, talking sentiment, in these queer old chambers in Shepherd's Inn.|$|R

We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, our {{opinions}} were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous!
