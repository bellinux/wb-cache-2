5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E
5|$|During {{the season}} it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that the player would be joining a bigger club. Amid {{reported}} interest {{from a list}} of clubs including Manchester City, Arsenal, Leeds United, Roma, Internazionale, reportedly willing to pay around €3million for the player and then loan him back to Albacete for a season, and Deportivo La Coruña, who agreed terms with the club but were unable to agree with Camaño, Pablo signed a four-year contract with Atlético Madrid for a fee of €3.5m plus add-ons. He was reunited with Ferrando, who had recently been appointed coach of Atlético.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of Dreadnought coincided with increasing {{tension between the}} United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun to build a large battlefleet in the 1890s, {{as part of a}} deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the conclusion of the Entente Cordiale between the United Kingdom and France in April 1904, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building up a large, modern fleet under the 'Tirpitz' laws. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-war period.|$|E
50|$|In {{the medieval}} period a {{settlement}} grew up at Page Green and the woodland was <b>increasingly</b> <b>cleared</b> for agriculture.In {{the early decades}} of the nineteenth century, the Seven Sisters Road was constructed and the area saw the construction of a number of large houses, including Suffield Lodge, Seven Sisters House and Grove Place. These fine buildings soon fell victim to the spread of Victorian London and by the third quarter of the century the area had been almost completely built over.|$|R

Charles Haynes, in describing Meher Baba's sense of involution writes, [...] "The old and new impressions, both of which create a veil over consciousness, gradually wear away, revealing an <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> experience of God; that is, the soul wearies {{of the world and}} is ready to begin the third phase of the journey, involution, which may be seen as the 'ascent' back to God." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
5|$|The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States as {{a result}} of the latter's victory in the Spanish–American War. A {{compensation}} of US$20million was paid to Spain according to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. As it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> the United States would not recognize the nascent First Philippine Republic, the Philippine–American War broke out, the First Republic was defeated, and the archipelago was administered under an Insular Government. The war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians, mostly from a cholera epidemic.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{it became}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that the SAS-cooperation was weak, and that either a full merger or a {{discontinuation}} of the cooperation would be necessary. Braathen suggested {{to the government}} that DNL, Fred. Olsen Airtransport and Braathens SAFE should merge {{to create a new}} domestic airline, but this proposal was rejected by both DNL and Fred. Olsen. In 1949, the Swedish branch of SAS, Aerotransport (ABA), and the Danish branch, Det Danske Luftfartselskab (DDL) started a joint route to the Far East. For a merger to be completed, Danish and Swedish authorities required that SAS be granted all international routes from Norway, meaning that Braathens SAFE would lose its concession from 1 March 1954. The SAS merger was completed on 8 August 1951.|$|E

During the journey, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> to Drecker where she comes from, and the music she creates {{is the result of}} this Nordic arctic acoustic landscape, with influences of music from all around the world. She has composed the music with lyrics based on poems by the Northern Norwegian poet Arvid Handsen. At the Vossajazz festival 2015, Drecker performed the tune [...] "Little Tree" [...] from this album, with her daughter Luna (b. 2006).|$|R
5000|$|Other eco-socialists, like Wall, {{highlight}} how, in the Global South, free-market capitalism structures economies {{to produce}} export-geared crops that take water from traditional subsistence farms, increasing hunger {{and the likelihood}} of famine; furthermore, forests are <b>increasingly</b> <b>cleared</b> and enclosed to produce cash crops that separate people from their local means of production and aggravate poverty. Wall shows that many of the world's poor have access to the means of production through [...] "non-monetised communal means of production", such as subsistence farming, but, despite providing for need and a level of prosperity, these are not included in conventional economics measures, like GNP.|$|R
50|$|Although lowland {{rainforest}} in Papua New Guinea is <b>increasingly</b> being <b>cleared</b> for {{logging and}} conversion to agriculture, this species is widespread across {{the island and}} can persist in some modified habitats, so it's unlikely to be in any imminent danger.|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E
5|$|Then, in {{the spring}} of 1466, Warwick was sent to the {{continent}} to carry out negotiations with the French and Burgundians. The negotiations centred around a marriage proposal involving Edward's sister Margaret. Warwick increasingly came to favour French diplomatic connections. Meanwhile, Edward's father-in-law, Richard Woodville, Earl Rivers, who had been created treasurer, was in favour of a Burgundian alliance. This set up internal conflict within the English court, which was not alleviated by the fact that Edward had signed a secret treaty in October with Burgundy, while Warwick was forced to carry on sham negotiations with the French. Later, George Neville was dismissed as chancellor, while Edward refused to contemplate a marriage between Warwick's oldest daughter Isabel, and Edward's brother George, Duke of Clarence. It became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that Warwick's position of dominance at court had been taken over by Rivers.|$|E
40|$|Obesity is {{an urgent}} and growing global health problem. Among other co-morbidities, obesity is {{associated}} with a significantly increased risk of developing many cancers. The epidemiological evidence linking obesity and cancer has ignited multiple studies trying to understand how obesity contributes to cancer risk. Although mechanisms underlying the obesity-cancer link are becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer,</b> they are very complex and still under intense investigation. Strategies that prevent and/or reverse obesity may also be useful for reducing the progression of cancer. Recent interests are focused towards brown fat as a primary target to combat obesity. In this review, we integrate the classic understandings of the mechanistic role of obesity in cancer to the studies which suggest a beneficial role of brown fat to humans...|$|R

5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Whereas the {{understanding}} of most phases of stellar evolution made considerable progress throughout {{the whole of the}} twentieth century, stellar formation remained rather enigmatic and poorly constrained by observations until about three decades ago, when major discoveries (e. g., that protostars are often associated with highly collimated jets) revolutionized the field. At this time, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> that magnetic fields were playing a major role at all stages of stellar formation. We describe herein a quick overview of the main breakthroughs that observations and theoretical modelling yielded for our understanding of how stars (and their planetary systems) are formed and on how much these new worlds are shaped by the presence of magnetic fields, either those pervading the interstellar medium and threading molecular clouds or those produced through dynamo processes in the convective envelopes of protostars or in the accretion discs from which they feed. ...|$|R

5000|$|Sultan Ibrahim became {{increasingly}} {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of Johor as a state within the Federation of Malaya, particularly when the prospect of an independent Federation free from British interference became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> under Tunku Abdul Rahman's leadership. In a letter which he wrote to The Straits Times in 1953, [...] "Straits Settlement Forever", Sultan Ibrahim expressed a sceptical opinion of Johor's future as part of an independent Malaya, and voiced support for the continuation of British Adviser system in Johor. At his Diamond Jubilee celebrations in September 1955, Sultan Ibrahim publicly called for Johor's secession from the Federation. Sultan Ibrahim's calls for secession inspired the formation of Persatuan Kebangsaan Melayu Johor (PKMJ) the following month, a secessionist movement led by Ungku Abdullah bin Omar, a relative of Sultan Ibrahim who was serving as one of Johor's state executive councillor. The Sultan voiced public support for PKMJ during a public gathering in mid-December 1955, and PKMJ courted considerable support from the grassroots within the first half of 1956.|$|R

5000|$|D. stierlingi has {{a rather}} limited range and is patchily distributed, being a {{generally}} uncommon species.

40|$|The {{ecological}} protection {{required under}} the South African National Water Act requires assessment criteria that {{are effective in}} the assessment of the ecological impact of pollutants. Advances in fundamental ecotoxicology in the past decade or two may be useful in this regard: establishing the lethal body burden of various classes of compounds, rapid estimation of bio concentration factors and modelling of the uptake/excretion processes in aquatic organisms. Using the example of the effect of cadmium on Daphnia magna, the impact of temporally variable toxicant concentrations on the population growth is demonstrated. The population no-effect levels for exponentially and normally distributed cadmium concentrations may differ by an order of magnitude. There are still some crucial information gaps. For example, while the toxicology of pollutants to individual species is becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer,</b> the ecotoxicology of pollutants is still somewhat nebulous. However, given the potential usefulness of such stochastic assessment criteria in water resource management in a water-stressed, developing, country, research expenditure in addressing these questions may aid in crystallising crucial ecological sustainability water quality issues and help to focus water quality management / treatment technology development...|$|R
30|$|In any {{particular}} geographical region, various leptospiral serovars are prevalent and {{are associated with}} one or more maintenance host(s) that serves as reservoir of infection. Leptospira spp. are traditionally classified into 29 serogroups and over 300 serovars (Levett 2001). Further, genotypic methods like DNA-DNA hybridization have identified 20 Leptospira spp. to date (Cerqueira and Picardeau 2009). However, antigenically related serovars are classified in two or more different species and a serogroup is often found in several species of leptospira. Serovar identification of isolates are essential to understand the prevalence of leptospira in the epidemiology of this disease, but few laboratories perform Cross Agglutination Absorption Test (CAAT) (Terpstra et al. 1985) and most isolates are therefore not identified at serovar level. Serogroups identified using the MAT have no official taxonomic status, can serve as practical purpose of grouping common antigens together. With the emergence of molecular typing methods, it has become <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> that the concept of a “serovar” is no longer fully satisfactory as it may fail to define epidemiologically important strains/isolates in an adequate manner (Cerqueira and Picardeau 2009). For example, molecular typing has been shown to give better discrimination of strains of the Grippotyphosa serogroup than serological typing (Steinen et al. 1992; Hartskeerl et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} tool that has enabled experimentalists to characterize molecular dynamics and kinetics spanning {{a wide range of}} time-scales from picoseconds to days. This review focuses on addressing the previously inaccessible supra-τc window (defined as τc < supra-τc < 40 μs; in which τc is the overall tumbling time of a molecule) from the perspective of local inter-nuclear vector dynamics extracted from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and from the perspective of conformational exchange captured by relaxation dispersion measurements (RD). The goal of the first section is to present a detailed analysis of how to extract protein dynamics encoded in RDCs and how to relate this information to protein functionality within the previously inaccessible supra-τc window. In the second section, {{the current state of the}} art for RD is analyzed, as well as the considerable progress toward pushing the sensitivity of RD further into the supra-τc scale by up to a factor of two (motion up to 25 ms). From the data obtained with these techniques and methodology, the importance of the supra-τ c scale for protein function and molecular recognition is becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> as the connection between motion on the supra-τc scale and protein functionality from the experimental side is further strengthened with results from molecular dynamics simulations...|$|R
