40|$|We present far-infrared {{spectral}} line observations of five galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS sample: DDO 69, DDO 70, DDO 75, DDO 155, and WLM. While most studies of dwarfs focus on bright systems or starbursts due to observational constraints, our data extend the observed parameter space into {{the regime of}} low surface brightness dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and moderate star formation rates. Our targets were observed with Herschel at the [CII] 158 um, [OI] 63 um, [OIII] 88 um, and NII 122 um emission lines using the PACS Spectrometer. These high-resolution maps allow us {{for the first time}} to study the far-infrared properties of these systems on the scales of larger star-forming complexes.

25|$|About 3000 {{planetary}} nebulae are now known to exist <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy,</b> out of 200 billion stars.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy,</b> the {{distribution}} of clusters depends on age, with older clusters being preferentially found at greater distances from the galactic centre, generally at substantial distances above or below the galactic plane. Tidal forces are stronger nearer {{the centre of the}} galaxy, increasing the rate of disruption of clusters, and also the giant molecular clouds which cause the disruption of clusters are concentrated towards the inner regions of the galaxy, so clusters in the inner regions of the galaxy tend to get dispersed at a younger age than their counterparts in the outer regions.|$|E

25|$|High-energy {{gamma rays}} (>50MeV photons) were finally {{discovered}} in the primary cosmic radiation by an MIT experiment carried on the OSO-3 satellite in 1967. Components of both galactic and extra-galactic origins were separately identified at intensities much less than 1% of the primary charged particles. Since then, numerous satellite gamma-ray observatories have mapped the gamma-ray sky. The most recent is the Fermi Observatory, which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma ray intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and numerous point-like extra-galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere.|$|E
25|$|When {{looking for}} life on other planets like Earth, some {{simplifying}} assumptions are useful {{to reduce the size}} of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> are based on carbon chemistries, as are all life forms on Earth. Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of molecules that can be formed around it. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and complex molecules.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{detection}} experiments {{search for}} {{the products of the}} self-annihilation or decay of dark matter particles in outer space. For example, in regions of high dark matter density (e.g. the centre of our galaxy) two dark matter particles could annihilate to produce gamma rays or Standard Model particle-antiparticle pairs. Alternatively if the dark matter particle is unstable, it could decay into standard model (or other) particles. These processes could be detected indirectly through an excess of gamma rays, antiprotons or positrons emanating from high density regions <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> or others. A major difficulty inherent in such searches is that there are various astrophysical sources which can mimic the signal expected from dark matter, and so multiple signals will likely be required for a conclusive discovery.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a successful strategy for identifying extremely metal poor <b>galaxies.</b> <b>Our</b> preliminary survey of 24 candidates contains 10 metal poor galaxies of which 4 have 12 +log(O/H) < 7. 65, {{some of the}} lowest metallicity blue compact galaxies known to date. Interestingly, our sample of metal poor galaxies have systematically lower metallicity for their luminosity than comparable samples of blue compact galaxies, dIrrs, and normal star-forming <b>galaxies.</b> <b>Our</b> metal poor <b>galaxies</b> share very similar properties, however, with the host galaxies of nearby long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including similar metallicity, stellar ages, and star formation rates. We use Hβ to measure the number of OB stars present <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxies</b> and estimate a core-collapse supernova rate of 10 ^- 3 yr^- 1. A larger sample of metal poor galaxies may provide new clues into the environment where GRBs form and may provide a list of potential GRB hosts.

25|$|Once the {{distances}} to nearby clusters have been established, further techniques can extend the distance scale to more distant clusters. By matching the main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for a cluster at a known distance {{with that of}} a more distant cluster, the distance to the more distant cluster can be estimated. The nearest open cluster is the Hyades: the stellar association consisting of most of the Plough stars is at about half the distance of the Hyades, but is a stellar association rather than an open cluster as the stars are not gravitationally bound to each other. The most distant known open cluster <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy</b> is Berkeley 29, at a distance of about 15,000parsecs. Open clusters are also easily detected in many of the galaxies of the Local Group.|$|E
25|$|Glycolaldehyde, {{the first}} example of an {{interstellar}} sugar molecule, was detected in the star-forming region near the centre of our galaxy. It was discovered in 2000 by Jes Jørgensen and Jan M. Hollis. In 2012, Jørgensen's team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. These findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior {{to the formation of}} planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. Because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two of the most basic aspects of life, it is thought the discovery of extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>galaxy.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the astrophysical {{community}} {{has yet to}} settle on a single, universally favored model for the progenitors of short GRBs, the generally preferred model is the merger of two compact objects {{as a result of}} gravitational inspiral: two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole. While thought to be rare in the Universe, a small number of cases of close neutron star - neutron star binaries are known <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> and neutron star - black hole binaries are believed to exist as well. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, systems of this nature will slowly lose energy due to gravitational radiation and the two degenerate objects will spiral closer and closer together, until in the last few moments, tidal forces rip the neutron star (or stars) apart and an immense amount of energy is liberated before the matter plunges into a single black hole. The whole process is believed to occur extremely quickly and be completely over within a few seconds, accounting for the short nature of these bursts. Unlike long-duration bursts, there is no conventional star to explode and therefore no supernova.|$|E
40|$|With a goal toward {{deriving}} {{the physical}} conditions in external galaxies, {{we present a}} survey of formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and ammonia (NH 3) emission and absorption {{in a sample of}} starburst galaxies using the Green Bank Telescope. By extending well-established techniques used to derive the spatial density in star formation regions <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>Galaxy,</b> we show how the relative intensity of the 1 (10) - 1 (11) and 2 (11) - 2 (12) K-doublet transitions of H 2 CO can provide an accurate densitometer for the active star formation environments found in starburst galaxies (c. f. Mangum et al. 2008). Similarly, we employ the well-established technique of using the relative intensities of the (1, 1), (2, 2), and (4, 4) transitions of NH 3 to derive the kinetic temperature <b>in</b> starburst <b>galaxies.</b> <b>Our</b> measurements of the kinetic temperature constrained spatial density <b>in</b> <b>our</b> starburst <b>galaxy</b> sample represent the first mean density measurements made toward starburst galaxies. We note a disparity between kinetic temperature measurements derived assuming direct coupling to dust and those derived from our NH 3 measurements which points to the absolute need for direct gas kinetic temperature measurements using an appropriate molecular probe. Finally, our spatial density measurements point to a rough constancy to the spatial density (10 ^{ 4. 5 } to 10 ^{ 5. 5 } cm^{- 3 }) <b>in</b> <b>our</b> starburst <b>galaxy</b> sample. This implies that the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation between L_{IR} and M_{dense}: (1) Is a measure of the dense gas mass reservoir available to form stars, and (2) Is not directly dependent upon a higher average density driving the star formation process in the most luminous starburst galaxies.
