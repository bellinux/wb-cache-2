2500|$|The 282 {{which had}} a larger bore is {{considered}} the ancestor of the 4.0 stroker engine where {{it is common for}} the <b>engine</b> <b>rebuilder</b> to use an AMC 258 crankshaft in a Jeep 4.0 cylinder block - a 4.5 uses the stock AMC 258 connecting rods (with a stock or [...]020 overbore using aftermarket pistons) while the 4.6, 4.7, and 5.0 strokers use the 258 crank but retaining the 4.0 connecting rods.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanics {{purchase}} a shortblock as a quicker way to rebuild an engineâ€”avoiding {{the work and}} time of rebuilding and assembling the shortblock components. Companies that provide short blocks may also offer performance improving engine work. Machine shop work can increase performance by boring out the engine to increase cylinder diameter (which increases internal volume), balancing rotating assemblies (such as the crankshaft), installing a higher performance camshaft, etc. Bored-out engines require larger pistons and new piston rings. This kind of work {{can be done by}} amateurs ("shade tree mechanics") or by professional machine shops and <b>engine</b> <b>rebuilders.</b>|$|R
