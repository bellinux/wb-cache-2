60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the strange}} {{circumstances}} under which the letter had been discovered.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the {{platform}} {{when we had}} left it far behind, and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.|$|E
6000|$|Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the poor, humbled little chap, {{my heart}} tingled with pity and remorse. [...] "We were too rough," [...] I said. [...] "We {{must be more}} gentle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] George answered. [...] "It isn't {{altogether}} a novelty. I once {{spent three}} years in manual labor; and now when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> them, <b>I</b> believe I was happy then." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{and see it}} there, shrinking, shrinking, [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it {{amid the}} rain For the very last time; for my sand is sinking, [...] And I shall {{traverse}} old love's domain [...] Never again.|$|R
60|$|Still {{clinging}} to the past--that past which I represented to her, in my way, as Miss Halcombe did in hers! It troubled me sorely to see her <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of her}} career, just as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the end of mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "So, I {{just looked}} at him--coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him again--taking my time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair {{question}} to put to me,' says I." ...|$|E
60|$|She said nothing. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{her from}} the door. Her eyes were fixed upon me, a little distended, full of mute questioning. I only shook my head. So I left her and passed out into the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stewart {{ran after}} us {{for more than}} a mile, and I could not [...] help {{laughing}} as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> last and saw him on a hill, [...] holding his hand to his side, and nearly burst with running.|$|E
5000|$|Tim Rogers {{later said}} of the album, [...] "It hadn't been a great couple of years, and it's even worse when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it now. <b>I</b> had no {{confidence}} at all so I wanted the guitars too loud and everything aggressive and loose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mad is {{the right}} word! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> my own infatuation--and I can't account for it; I can't {{understand}} myself. What was there in you," [...] she asked, with an outbreak of contemptuous surprise, [...] "to attract such a woman as I am?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “My eye {{was really}} {{sitting on my}} cheek. Now that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at that album cover, it reminds me what not to do. Not {{to take matters into}} my own hands and leave it to God.” - Bushwick Bill to DigBoston, June 19, 2013 ...|$|R
60|$|Stewart {{ran after}} us, a childish thing to do, {{for more than}} a mile; and I could not help laughing, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> last and saw him on a hill, holding his hand to his side, and nearly burst with running.|$|E
60|$|How? Where? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the last}} page of writing. But my {{attention}} wandered strangely; I confused one paragraph with another; the longer I read, the less I was able to grasp the meaning, not of sentences merely, but even of the simplest words.|$|E
60|$|At the stile <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> his {{receding}} figure. His bearing {{had changed}} remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast {{with his former}} gesticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as pathetic. I watched him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.|$|E
5000|$|Dylan, {{when asked}} in 1985 {{if he had}} any regrets about [...] "Ballad In Plain D", replied: [...] "Oh yeah, that one! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and say 'I must have been a real schmuck to write that.' <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> that {{particular}} one and say, of all the songs I've written, maybe I could have left that alone." ...|$|R
60|$|I wonder, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, {{at my own}} obstinacy. I am almost {{ashamed to}} relate that I made Mr. Playmore no reply. He waited, still <b>looking</b> at me. <b>I</b> felt irritated by that fixed <b>look.</b> <b>I</b> arose, and stood before him with {{my eyes on the}} floor.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{those words}} {{by the light}} of later events; and I {{pronounce}} them, as you will soon pronounce them, to be the words of an essentially rash man, whose hasty judgment never stopped to consider what surprises time and chance together might have in store for him.|$|R
60|$|Estella took {{no notice}} {{of either of}} us, but led us the way that I knew so well. I {{followed}} next to her, and Joe came last. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on {{the tips of his}} toes.|$|E
60|$|She {{kissed me}} {{two or three}} times--good, hearty smacks! did I not say {{she was still a}} child?--and stood waving her hand to me as I rode away. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the end of the avenue and saw her {{standing}} there, short-skirted and hatless, fronting the lowering sun with those fearless eyes of hers. So I looked my last on the child Betty.|$|E
60|$|With {{that answer}} he retraced his steps. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the cottage {{and saw the}} clerk coming out, with the lantern lighted once more. I took the old man's arm to help him on the more quickly. We hastened along the lane, and passed {{the person who had}} accosted me. As well as I could see {{by the light of the}} lantern, he was a servant out of livery.|$|E
5000|$|... "The artist that Koda Kumi should {{represent}} finally became clear. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{the years}} until 2003, I {{was filled with}} enthusiasm, but had no clear goal [...] [...] [...] The fog {{in front of my}} eyes cleared and the path I should walk became visible." [...] - Koda Kumi ...|$|R
5000|$|After announcing her AV {{retirement}} plans in 1999 with Last Scene, Komuro commented, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> my acting days, it {{was lots of}} fun. Just by following somebody's instructions to disrobe I could make millions, or even {{tens of millions of}} yen. I think back on the opportunity with a sense of gratitude." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe if}} I {{made an effort}} I could disinter some dozens of such memories, more and more faded until the {{marginal}} ones would be featureless and all but altogether effaced. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it now <b>I</b> am struck by an absurd image; {{it is as if}} a fish nibbled at this bait and then at that.|$|R
60|$|And {{they were}} sincere, these two women. They were drunk with {{conviction}} of {{the superiority of}} their class and of themselves. They had a sanction, in their own class-ethic, for every act they performed. As I drove away from Mrs. Pertonwaithe's great house, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, and I remembered Ernest's expression that they were bound to the machine, but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} room for the second time. For the second time my uncle looked at me in blank perplexity--and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him in the same {{condition}} of mind. The sound of the luncheon bell was equally a relief to both of us. Not a word more was spoken {{on the subject of}} the new groom. His references were verified; and he entered the General's service in three days' time.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} door and entered. The room was dimly lit by a lamp, placed on the table near the window. Upon the bed, covered by a sheet, his waxen-like face alone visible, was the body of the man who had been my guest. Beyond, with the {{connecting}} door wide open, was the anteroom where the nurse had been sleeping. Except for the ticking of a clock, there was no sound to be heard; there was no sign anywhere of any disturbance or disorder. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the nurse for an explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was settled,--before Friday. Indeed, as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it all now, I {{can hardly}} tell {{when it was}} not settled. It is impossible, and has been impossible, that I should do otherwise. I still hold my place, Madame Goesler, but I have {{declared}} that I shall give it up before the debate comes on." ...|$|R
40|$|Artist statement: “I carve peach pits, plastics, wood, and I mold clay. It is {{my way of}} {{capturing}} the present moment, and every moment is different. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> what <b>I</b> have done, I see many moments that I like. I hope that the work does {{the same for the}} viewer, passing on the emotion that the impossible is possible. ”[URL]...|$|R
5000|$|... "Everything I see disgusts and {{depresses}} me: <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the streaming {{of blood}} {{for so many}} years, and everything everywhere relapsed into its former degradation - France rechained, Spain again saddled for the priests, and Ireland, like a bastinadoed elephant, kneeling to receive the paltry rider." [...] - Written in a letter, after the exile of Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|R
60|$|She {{walked with}} me to the hall door, but she {{declined}} to shake hands with me. Her appearance was little short of tragic. I think that at another time I might have been amused, for never in my life had I spoken more than a few courteous words to the girl. But my nerves were all on edge, and I took her seriously. I walked down the street, leaving her standing in the threshold with the door open as though anxious to {{give me a chance to}} return if I would. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the corner, and waved my hand. There was something almost threatening in the grim irresponsive figure, standing watching me, and making no pretence at returning my farewell--watching me with steady eyes and close-drawn brows.|$|E
60|$|This picture put {{a kind of}} {{constraint}} upon me to look upward too--at {{the top of the}} bed. It was {{a gloomy}} and not an interesting object, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the picture. I counted the feathers in the man's hat--they stood out in relief--three white, two green. I observed the crown of his hat, which was of conical shape, according to the fashion supposed to have been favored by Guido Fawkes. I wondered what he was looking up at. It couldn't be at the stars; such a desperado was neither astrologer nor astronomer. It must be at the high gallows, {{and he was going to}} be hanged presently. Would the executioner come into possession of his conical crowned hat and plume of feathers? I counted the feathers again--three white, two green.|$|E
6000|$|Marian smiled, {{and watched}} them from the door. As they {{lost sight of the}} house, Edmund turned to his wife, saying, [...] "How little we are fit to order events! Here, Agnes, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> this house six years ago in a sort of despair. I was ready to reproach Providence, to reproach everything. I thought I saw my uncle's {{children}} in the way to be ruined, all his work undone, and there was I, unable to act, and yet with the responsibility of the care of them. I tell you, Agnes, I never was so wretched in my life. And yet what short-sightedness! There has Marian been, placed, like a witness of the truth, calm, firm, constant, guarding herself and her brother first, and then softening, and winning all that came under her influence." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Brad Hamlin asked Marie Currie [...] "Tell us how Messin' {{with the}} Boys came about." [...] Marie said [...] "That's {{a very long}} story, but I still to this day believe {{it is one of}} the best albums we could've made. We had the best musicians, songwriters, and a {{tremendous}} amount of support. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> recording that album with a smile." ...|$|R
40|$|CIPANP 2009 is {{the tenth}} meeting of this series. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{some of the}} key events of past meetings, comment on a few of the presentations of this meeting, and look foward to the next CIPANP gathering, when first data from the LHC will be in hand.

500|$|Working in {{this fashion}} profoundly {{influenced}} everyone involved with the show. Series star Kyle Chandler said: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> my life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [...] Peter Berg really changed my life.'" [...] Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying: [...] "When I first came on [...] set, I thought, it’s interesting – this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, before I saw what filmmaking was." ...|$|R
