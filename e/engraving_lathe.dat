50|$|Alison Cornwall Geissler, née McDonald (13 April 1907- 25 January 2011), {{was one of}} the {{foremost}} glass engravers in Scotland during the mid-twentieth century. Educated at The Mary Erskine School for Girls in Edinburgh, she entered Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) in 1925, where she studied drawing and painting. After graduating in 1930, she was awarded a post-graduate scholarship. In 1931 she married the watercolourist painter William Geissler, former tutor at ECA and recently appointed Art Master at Perth Academy. In 1935, William was appointed to the Art Department of Moray House College of Education, and the couple returned to Edinburgh, where their three children, Paul, Erik and Catherine, were born. Between 1940 and 1943, the menace of German bombing on Leith Docks not far from their home induced the family to evacuate first to Dolphinton, then to Carlops, villages outside Edinburgh. Geissler’s glass engraving career started {{at the end of the}} Second World War, when she returned to ECA to study under Helen Monro Turner, who had come back from studies in Germany just before the outbreak of World War II. Monro Turner opened the glass engraving department at Edinburgh College of Art in January 1941, despite the challenges of obtaining equipment during the war period. At the time of Geissler's enrolment in 1945, ECA possessed a single glass <b>engraving</b> <b>lathe</b> that overheated, which allowed only intermittent and unreliable access, and had to be shared in shifts with Monro’s other student, Harold Gordon. This inconvenience was compounded by the official regulation preventing students from working in the evenings. Acquisition of a glass <b>engraving</b> <b>lathe</b> from Germany in 1947 finally enabled Geissler to work independently from home. Almost all of her work involved traditional copper wheel engraving, with oil and carborundum powder as abrasive.|$|E

5000|$|The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has {{its origins}} in {{legislation}} enacted to help fund the Civil War. In July 1861, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue paper currency in lieu of coins {{due to the lack}} of funds needed to support the conflict. The paper notes were essentially government IOUs and were called Demand Notes because they were payable [...] "on demand" [...] in coin at certain Treasury facilities. At this time the government had no facility for the production of paper money so a private firm produced the Demand Notes in sheets of four. These sheets were then sent to the Treasury Department where dozens of clerks signed the notes and scores of workers cut the sheets and trimmed the notes by hand. The Second Legal Tender Act (July 11, 1862; [...] ) authorized the Treasury Secretary to engrave and print notes at the Treasury Department; the design of which incorporates fine-line <b>engraving,</b> intricate geometric <b>lathe</b> work patterns, a Treasury seal, and engraved signatures to aid in counterfeit deterrence.|$|R
