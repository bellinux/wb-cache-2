5|$|Ferret-legging was an <b>endurance</b> <b>test</b> or stunt {{in which}} ferrets {{were trapped in}} {{trousers}} worn by a participant. Also known as put 'em down and ferret-down-trousers, {{it seems to have}} been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Training {{also took}} place at Port Sunlight, where they were shown how to destroy large {{condensers}} of the kind found in the plant. The sappers were given detailed briefings on the plant and the surrounding area, and were trained on large models and mock-ups of the buildings that the plant was composed of, all based on {{information provided by the}} SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month. Because the operation was considered to be extremely important, and its results vital to the Allied war effort, security efforts were extremely thorough. A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional 'Washington Cup' athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding <b>endurance</b> <b>test.</b> The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored.|$|E

To predict the durability, <b>endurance</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out. In this thesis, one of the <b>endurance</b> <b>tests,</b> thermal cycling is performed for three different internal coolant flows until failure which is known as Wöhler test. A tool is developed in MATLAB that could import data from all kinds of <b>endurance</b> <b>tests</b> and visualizes time histories of every channel of the test (test parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow). An algorithm is developed for Level Crossing counting method which works based on the Markov cycle counting method. This produces Level crossing curves (LCC) for all the channels of the test which says how well a test has been performed and the total number of cycles of the test. It was observed that the LCCs obtained from the tool gives accurate results when compared with those obtained from LMS software whose approach of producing LCCs is Rainflow cycle counting method. Strain measurements are performed for the same flowrates as that of the Wöhler tests. The results from strain measurements and Wöhler tests are used in the determination of Basquin’s coefficient of the Wöhler curve. It was observed that the optimal value of Basquin’s coefficient is 3. 4...|$|R
