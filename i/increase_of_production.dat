There are four major causes: <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues. Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or lymphocytosis.|$|E

Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E
25|$|Timothy Kailing, in a 2008 Journal of Energy Security article, {{pointed out}} the {{difficulty}} of increasing production in mature petroleum regions, even with vastly increased investment in exploration and production. By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort, he claimed that very little <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{could be attributed to}} increased drilling. This was due to a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort: As drilling effort increased, the energy obtained per active drill rig was reduced according to a severely diminishing power law. This analysis suggested that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to lead to significantly increased oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region like the United States.|$|E

25|$|Monetary {{circulation}} and minting steadily increased throughout {{the period of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire, reaching their climax during the reign of Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371). Along with his recognition by the Pope, emperor Kaloyan (r. 1197–1207) acquired the right to mint coins. Well-organized mints and engraving workshops were set up in the mid-13th century, producing copper, billon, and silver coinage. The reform was initiated by Constantine Tikh Asen (r. 1257–1277) and led to a stabilization of the monetary market in Bulgaria. The Uprising of Ivaylo and the pillage raids of the Mongols in the late 13th century destabilized the coinage, resulting in a tenfold decrease of minting activities. With the stabilization of the empire since 1300, Bulgarian monarchs issued an increased number of coins, including silver ones, but were able to secure the market with domestic coins after the 1330s. The erosion of the central authorities {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion gave rise to primitive, anonymous, and crudely-forged counterfeit coins. Along with the Bulgarian coinage, coins from the Byzantine Empire, Latin Empire, Venice, Serbia, the Golden Horde, and the small Balkan principalities were widely used. Due to the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> there was a tendency to limit the circulation of foreign coins by the second half of the 14th century. Coins were minted by some independent or semi-independent Bulgarian lords, such as Jacob Svetoslav and Dobrotitsa.|$|E

Despite the rapid relocation of Red Army armaments production east of the Urals and a dramatic <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> in 1942, especially of armour, new aircraft types and artillery, the Wehrmacht was able to mount another large-scale offensive in July 1942, although on a much reduced front than the previous summer.

60|$|We {{have seen}} that the {{essential}} requisites of production are three—labor, capital, and natural agents; the term capital including all external and physical requisites which are products of labor, the term natural agents all those which are not. The <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> therefore, depends on the properties of these elements. It {{is a result of}} the increase either of the elements themselves, or of their productiveness. We proceed to consider the three elements successively, with reference to this effect; or, in other words, the law of the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> viewed in respect of its dependence, first on Labor, secondly on Capital, and lastly on Land.|$|E

60|$|But {{there are}} other countries, and England [and the United States are] {{at the head of}} them, in which neither the spirit of {{industry}} nor the effective desire of accumulation need any encouragement. In these countries there would never be any deficiency of capital, if its increase were never checked or brought to a stand by too great a diminution of its returns. It is the tendency of the returns to a progressive diminution which causes the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to be often attended with a deterioration in the condition of the producers; and this tendency, which would in time put an end to <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> altogether, {{is a result of the}} necessary and inherent conditions of production from the land.|$|E
60|$|Land {{differs from}} the other {{elements}} of production, labor, and capital, in not being susceptible of indefinite increase. Its extent is limited, {{and the extent of}} the more productive kinds of it more limited still. It is also evident that the quantity of produce capable of being raised on any given piece of land is not indefinite. This limited quantity of land and limited productiveness of it are the real limits to the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [This {{progress}} affords] {{space and}} scope for an indefinite {{increase of capital}} and production, and for the increase of population which is its ordinary accompaniment. That the growth of population will overpass the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> {{there is not much}} reason to apprehend. It is, however, quite possible {{that there might be a}} great progress in industrial improvement, and in the signs of what is commonly called national prosperity; a great increase of aggregate wealth, and even, in some respects, a better distribution of it; that not only the rich might grow richer, but many of the poor might grow rich, that the intermediate classes might become more numerous and powerful, and the means of enjoyable existence be more and more largely diffused, while yet the great class at the base of the whole might increase in numbers only, and not in comfort nor in cultivation. We must, therefore, in considering the effects of the progress of industry, admit as a supposition, however greatly we deprecate as a fact, an increase of population as long-continued, as indefinite, and possibly even as rapid, as the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and accumulation.|$|E

60|$|From the {{preceding}} exposition {{it appears that}} the limit to the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> is twofold: from deficiency of capital, or of land. Production comes to a pause, either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further increase of capital, or because, however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it, the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence.|$|E
6000|$|The {{increase}} in {{the population of the}} United States has been [...] enormous, as already seen, but the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> has been [...] still greater, owing to the fertility of our land, to improvements [...] in the arts, and to our great genius for invention, as may be seen [...] by the following table (amounts in the second column are given in [...] millions).(141) The steady increase of the valuation of our wealth [...] goes on faster than the increase of population, so that it [...] manifests itself in a larger average wealth to each inhabitant.|$|E

There can not be more people in any country, or in the world, than can be supported from the produce of past labor until that of present labor comes in [although it is not to be supposed that capital consists wholly of food]. We have next, therefore, to inquire into the conditions of the increase of capital: the causes by which the rapidity of its increase is determined, and the necessary limitations of that increase.|$|E

60|$|Gold {{and silver}} may vary like other things, {{though they are}} not so likely to vary as other things in their cost of production. The demand for them in foreign {{countries}} may also vary. It may increase by augmented employment of the metals for purposes of art and ornament, or because the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and of transactions has created a greater amount of business {{to be done by}} the circulating medium. It may diminish, for the opposite reasons; or, from the extension of the economizing expedients by which the use of metallic money is partially dispensed with. These changes act upon the trade between other countries and the mining countries, and upon the value of the precious metals, according to the general laws of the value of imported commodities: which have been set forth in the previous chapters with sufficient fullness.|$|E
60|$|All {{the labor}} [not engaged in {{preparing}} materials] tends constantly and strongly toward diminution, {{as the amount}} of production increases. Manufactures are vastly more susceptible than agriculture of mechanical improvements and contrivances for saving labor. In manufactures, accordingly, the causes tending to increase the productiveness of industry preponderate greatly over the one cause which tends to diminish it; and the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> called forth by the progress of society, takes place, not at an increasing, but at a continually diminishing proportional cost. This fact has manifested itself in the progressive fall of the prices and values of almost every kind of manufactured goods during two centuries past; a fall accelerated by the mechanical inventions of the last seventy or eighty years, and susceptible of being prolonged and extended beyond any limit which it would be safe to specify. The benefit might even extend to the poorest class. The increased cheapness of clothing and lodging might make up to them for the augmented cost of their food.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} get over all difficulties, some {{political}} economists seem disposed to make the terms express a distinction sufficiently definite indeed, but more completely arbitrary, and having less foundation in nature, {{than any of the}} former. They will not allow to any labour or to any expenditure the name of productive, unless the produce which it yields returns {{into the hands of the}} very person who made the outlay. Hedging and ditching they term productive labour, though those operations conduce to production only indirectly, by protecting the produce from destruction; but the necessary expenses incurred by a government for the protection of property are, they insist upon it, consumed unproductively: though, as has been well pointed out by Mr. M'Culloch, these expenses, in their relation to the national wealth, are exactly analogous to the wages of a hedger or a ditcher. The only difference is, that the farmer, who pays for the hedging and ditching, is the person to whom the consequent <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> accrues, while the government, which is at the expense of police officers and courts of justice, does not, as a necessary consequence, get back into its own coffers the increase of the national wealth resulting from the security of property.|$|E
