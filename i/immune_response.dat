5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> causes both {{hepatocellular}} damage and viral clearance. Although the innate <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>response,</b> in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E

40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (HSPs) {{have been}} known for decades {{for their ability to}} protect cells under stressful conditions. In the 1980 s a new role was ascribed for several HSPs given their ability to elicit specific <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in the setting of cancer and infectious disease. These <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> have primarily been harnessed for the immunotherapy of cancer in the clinical setting. However, because of the ability of HSPs to prime diverse <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> they have also been used for modulation of <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> during autoimmunity. The apparent dichotomy of <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> elicited by HSPs is discussed here on a molecular and cellular level.

5|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors are proteins used {{by nearly}} all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved {{component of the}} innate <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity. The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life. Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought {{to play a role}} in the <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> to viruses.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E

However, although it is a strong prediction of this functional flexibility principle, there is little compelling evidence that individuals with stronger physiological <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> show weaker behavioral <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> Here we show that men with the combination of high testosterone and low cortisol levels, a hormonal profile recently found to be associated with particularly strong physiological <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> show weaker preferences for color cues associated with carotenoid pigmentation.

5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered <b>immune</b> <b>response,</b> to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E
5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning.

As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E

A xopN- mutant of X. oryzae pv. oryzae retains the ability to suppress these innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> indicating the presence of other functionally redundant proteins. In transient transfer assays, we have assessed the ability of 15 other X. oryzae pv. oryzae T 3 S secreted effectors to suppress rice innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> Amongst these proteins, XopQ, XopX and XopZ are suppressors of LipA induced innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> A mutation in any one of the xopN, xopQ, xopX or xopZ genes causes partial virulence deficiency while a xopN- xopX- double mutant exhibits a greater virulenc...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) HCV {{infection is}} associated with viraemia which induces cellular and humoral <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> {{in the majority of}} individuals, regardless of subsequent outcome. HCV-specific <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> have also been documented in subjects who appear to have never had infection, including in injecting drug users who are at high-risk of infection. These <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> may be protective, either against incident infection, or against the development of chronic infection. Minute amounts of HCV RNA at levels below detection by conventional assays have been detected in subjects who have cleared HCV infection. This occult virus infection may also occur in high risk injecting drug users, and may therefore provide the antigenic stimulus for the observed <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> This study examined the presence of HCV-specific cellular <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in a cohort of high-risk, seronegative, aviraemic prisoners using interferon-gamma enzyme linked immunospot assays. Detailed behavioural analyses to identify potential correlates of the presence of these <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> and with incident infection were undertaken. In addition, initial efforts to establish an ultra-sensitive, nested reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction to detect both vegetative and replicative HCV RNA strands in highrisk apparently uninfected subjects in this cohort were undertaken. A significant prevalence of HCV-specific cellular <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> and a high rate of incident infection were found. There was a significant association of measured cellular <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> with injecting crystal methamphetamine, and surprisingly a negative association between incident infection and tattooing.

5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary <b>immune</b> <b>response).</b> Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E

40|$|The major {{limitation}} of the clinical use of replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad) vectors is the interference by innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> including induction of inflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFN), following in vivo application of Ad vectors. Ad vector-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and IFNs also results in severe organ damage and efficient induction of acquired <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against Ad proteins and transgene products. Ad vector-induced innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> are triggered by the recognition of Ad components by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In {{order to reduce the}} side effects by Ad vector-induced innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> and to develop safer Ad vectors, it is crucial to clarify which PRRs and which Ad components are involved in Ad vector-induced innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> Our group previously demonstrated that myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD 88) and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) play crucial roles in the Ad vector-induced inflammatory cytokine production in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.
