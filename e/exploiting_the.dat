5|$|Ethical Oil: The Case for Canada's Oil Sands is a {{book written}} by Canadian lawyer, talk-show host and {{lobbyist}} Ezra Levant, which makes a case for <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> Athabasca oil sands and its sister projects in Alberta. Published in 2010 by McClelland & Stewart in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the book became a non-fiction best seller and won the National Business Book Award for 2011.|$|E

5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{wasted no}} time <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons. By signing the treaty, {{they were able to}} recover Thessalonika and much of the Peloponnese. The Ottoman civil war ended in 1413 when Mehmed I, {{with the support of the}} Byzantine Empire, defeated his opponents.|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Peter of Angoulême, who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. <b>Exploiting</b> <b>the</b> situation {{to get rid of}} his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of Angoulême with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of the}} commune in early 1207. Peter of Angoulême was reconciled with the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to rise up against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of Angoulême was captured and died of drink deprivation in his prison.|$|E
5|$|During {{its three}} years in production, several {{versions}} of Dishonored were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set {{to take place in}} medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them. Dishonoreds music score was produced by composer Daniel Licht to represent London in the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Muslim threat, which reached its peak {{in the first half}} of the 8th century, the Isaurian emperors adopted the policy of Iconoclasm, which was abandoned in 786 only to be readopted in the 820s and finally abandoned in 843. Under the Macedonian dynasty, <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate, the Byzantines gradually went into the offensive, and recovered much territory in the 10th century, which was lost however after 1071 to the Seljuk Turks.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's design aims were {{to create}} a well-balanced, {{high-performance}} bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> power of the Merlin engine, while being relatively easy to fly. At the time, with France as an ally, and Germany {{thought to be the}} most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain, enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single-engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields; to carry out the mission of home defence, the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February, German {{troops from}} the 4th Panzer Army counterattacked the Southwestern Front troops <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> {{breakthrough}} {{to the south of}} Kharkov, encircling many and forcing the remainder to retreat towards the Donets, beginning the Third Battle of Kharkov. The 3rd Tank Army was ordered to relieve the encircled troops, and the 15th Tank Corps changed direction, advancing towards Krasnograd. During the last days of February, the corps fought in a fierce meeting engagement with the LSSAH and 320th Infantry Division. Operating alongside the 111th Rifle Division, the 15th captured Novaya Vodolaga and on 26February resumed its advance south, leaving the 195th Brigade to hold Novaya Vodolaga.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory (FeMO), {{funded by}} the National Science Foundation and Microbial Observatory Program, has led cruises to Lōʻihi {{investigate}} its microbiology every October. The first cruise, on the ship R/V Melville and <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> submersible JASON2, lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study {{the large number of}} Fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi's extensive vent system is characterized by a high concentration of CO2 and Iron, while being low in sulfide. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> binary representation used by computers. However, this alternative also scales like O(h²). It is generally {{faster than the}} Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was built}} over several centuries. Founded in the 1120s around a {{powerful}} Norman great tower, the castle was significantly enlarged by King John {{at the beginning}} of the 13th century. Huge water defences were created by damming the local streams, and the resulting fortifications proved able to withstand assaults by land and water in 1266. John of Gaunt spent lavishly in the late 14th century, turning the medieval castle into a palace fortress designed in the latest perpendicular style. The Earl of Leicester then expanded the castle once again, constructing new Tudor buildings and <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> medieval heritage of Kenilworth to produce a fashionable Renaissance palace.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E

By <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> coffee trade and allying with the lowlands Buginese, Tiku was able to obtain large amounts of wealth, land, and power. During the Coffee War (1889–1890), his capital at Tondon was razed by another lord, but retaken the same day. When the Dutch colonials, based in Java, invaded Sulawesi in the early 1900s, Tiku and his soldiers utilised fortresses to withstand and launch attacks. Captured in October 1906, in January 1907 he escaped and remained at large until June. He was executed several days later.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} great {{difference}} between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. G. W. S. Barrow, in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom. This view of Edward is reflected in the popular perception of the King, {{as can be seen in}} the 1995 movie Bravehearts portrayal of the King as a hard-hearted tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, immigration, {{urbanisation}} and industrialisation {{transformed the}} territories, destroying the old frontier way of life. Three million immigrants arrived in Canada between 1910 and 1914, many of them from eastern Europe, and over half of them settled in the territories. The urban population grew significantly as new towns were established across the Prairies. Many of the immigrants were employed by the growing industries of the region, especially the large mining and manufacturing centres enabled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. As society changed, there were fears of immigrants and criminals <b>exploiting</b> <b>the</b> new rail network.|$|E
