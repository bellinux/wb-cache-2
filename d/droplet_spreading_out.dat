Here, we study the <b>spreading</b> of <b>droplets</b> of complex fluids having either surfactants or polymers dissolved in the fluid. It turns out that both surfactants and polymers slow down the spreading. A special type of surfactants (trisiloxanes), however, leads to a “superspreading”, in which the <b>droplet</b> <b>spreads</b> <b>out</b> orders of magnitude quicker than with usual surfactants.

40|$|Keywords: emulsion, {{spreading}} coefficient, surface tension, emulsifier, whipped cream, dairy foam, partial coalescence In this thesis, {{the interaction}} between emulsion droplets and expanding air/water interfaces was investigated. The objective was to deepen our knowledge concerning the physical processes that {{take place at the}} expanding air surfaces that form during aeration of emulsions. Emulsions can become aerated as a result of various processing operations, for example, stirring or pouring. Moreover, emulsions may be aerated with the intention of producing an aerated food product such as whipped cream or ice cream. Emulsion droplet/air interaction can have important consequences for emulsion stability. For example, emulsion <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> at the air/water interface can initiate a collective oil spreading mechanism, resulting in the spreading of many oil droplets. This may lead to coalescence of the emulsion droplets. The tendency for an oil <b>droplet</b> to <b>spread</b> at an expanding air/water interface depends on the values of the dynamic interfacial tensions at the air/water, oil/water and oil/air interfaces. This can be expressed in terms of a dynamic spreading coefficient; when the spreading coefficient is positive, oil <b>spreads</b> <b>out</b> of the <b>droplets.</b> Experimental results confirmed that oil indeed only <b>spreads</b> <b>out</b> of emulsion <b>droplets</b> if the dynamic spreading coefficient is positive. The tendency for an emulsion <b>droplet</b> to <b>spread</b> at the air/water interface could be controlled by manipulating the surface expansion rate, the protein type and concentration, and type and concentration of emulsifier in the emulsion. The presence of crystalline fat, although relevant to the stability of emulsions exposed to shear, was not found to influence the spreading behaviour of emulsion droplets at the air/water interface. The results of the emulsion <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> experiments lead {{to the development of a}} model that describes the whipping time of cream in terms of the proportion of the air bubble surface for which the spreading coefficient is positive. Experimental results for the whipping of model creams could be well explained by this model...|$|R

These processes require a more detailed knowledge of the fluid mechanics, heat transfer and solidification that occur during <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading.</b> Previous work using computer simulations of this process {{have been difficult to}} implement and have required long running times. This paper examines the use of an alternative, simplified, method developed by Madjeski for solving for the problem of <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> and solidification.

Although a number of pilot scale trials have been carried out, relatively {{little is known about}} the fundamental mechanisms on how to control spray coating. The spray coating process can be divided into droplet formation, <b>droplet</b> impact <b>spreading,</b> consolidation and drying of coating layer, etc. Each sub-process has an influence on the outcome of coating.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the spatial droplet distribution around a rotary atomizer in an air cross flow. The droplet size, velocity, and spray distribution were measured using a phase Doppler particle analyzer system. The spray was photographed using a high-speed camera. The rotary atomizer was driven at speeds of 5000 rpm, 10, 000 rpm, and 15, 000 rpm. The fuel flow rate was held constant at 15 kg/h, and the air cross-flow velocities varied from 25 m/s to 150 m/s. The overall spray shape was observed to shrink toward the axis of rotation with increasing cross-flow speeds. High-speed visualization showed that the injected ligaments disintegrate into fairly large <b>droplets</b> and <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> in the radial direction at lower cross-flow velocities. At higher cross-flow speeds, the injected ligaments are abruptly deflected and broken up in the downstream direction close {{to the surface of the}} atomizer and are mixed with the cross-flow air stream immediately. The axial velocity profile indicates that a strong recirculation zone is formed just below the rotating nozzle. A high tangential velocity is shown to exist close to the injection point. Further downstream, the radial velocity component is shown to be dominant, while the tangential velocity becomes weak. The axial velocities show similar trends for the same cross-flow velocities, as the droplets follow the dominant air stream formed by the cross flow regardless of rotational speed. Near the injection orifice, relatively larger droplets are concentrated in a narrow region close to the radius of the atomizer. As the liquid jet travels downstream, the droplets are dispersed by the cross flow and distributed over a wider area. The cross flow influences the Sauter mean diameter directly; however, the rotational speed of the nozzle only has a large effect on the spray at slower cross-flow conditions. This injector design is shown to have a circumferential uniformity of 14 3 ̆bcm, making it an acceptable choice for combustion applications. 9 2012 by Begell House, Inc.

40|$|Master of EngineeringSpray dryers are {{the core}} {{components}} of a milk powder production plant, where the basic configuration usually features co-current flow of milk powder and air. Spray dryers have to be cleaned frequently due to powder deposit build-up on the walls. Powder deposit build-up gives rise to lower product yields and poses a potential fire risk. If the powder deposits are scorched (from being overheated) they will contaminate, and thus compromise, the quality and consumer safety of the final product, if the powder deposits fall in and mix with it. With milk powder production rates of most industrial spray dryers ranging from 4 - 28 tonnes of dry powder an hour, these wall deposition problems are significant. This problem is worth investigating because the outcome of reducing or eliminating wall deposition is that a spray dryer could operate {{for a longer period}} of time without having to be cleaned. Reduction in downtime due to cleaning would give rise to increased production time and possibly a reduction in the cost of manufacturing the product. The spray dryer used in this work was a modified short-form co-current Niro unit, fabricated from stainless steel. The spray dryer had an internal diameter of 0. 80 m, narrowing down to 0. 06 m at the base, and a height of 2 m. A two-fluid nozzle was used to spray the process fluids (water, skim milk and grape skin extract) into the drying chamber. To measure the wall deposition fluxes on the internal walls of the spray dryer, four stainless steel plates (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) were inserted in place of the windows that were previously used as sight glasses. A fifth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) and a sixth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 110 mm) were also placed on the conical section of the spray dryer at different circumferential locations. Before this work, no quantitative data on the effects of spray dryer operating conditions on the wall deposition fluxes of food material were available. This work investigated the effect on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls of the spray dryer of (i) flow patterns in the spray dryer, by changing the degree of swirl imparted to the incoming air by using three swirl vane angles of 0 o, 25 o and 30 o, and (ii) the stickiness of the product, through first changing the temperature of the incoming air by using three inlet air temperatures of 170 oC, 200 oC and 230 oC; and then changing the process fluid flowrate by using three flowrates of 1. 4 kg hr- 1, 1. 6 kg hr- 1 and 1. 8 kg hr- 1. Previous researchers have found that the extent to which water <b>droplets</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> in the drying chamber is affected by the amount of swirl in the inlet air. This is likely to affect wall deposition fluxes because the particles will be closer to the walls if the <b>droplets</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> widely. The results of this work have quantitatively confirmed that the spray deposition flux increases at higher swirl vane angles, where the spray deposition flux increased from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 (swirl vane angle 0 o) to 12. 9 g m- 2 hr- 1 (swirl vane angle 30 o). When a swirl vane angle of 0 o was used, it was observed that the cross-sectional area of the spray cloud did not change very significantly with time. However, when a swirl vane angle of 25 o was used, the spray cloud was observed to “flutter”, and when the swirl vane angle was increased to 30 o, the spray cloud was observed to recirculate rapidly back in the direction of the nozzle. Thus, the chance of the particles being thrown further towards the walls of the chamber is likely to increase at higher swirl vane angles. This result suggests that higher wall deposition arises because more swirl is imparted to the air entering the dryer, which in turn affects the stability of the spray cloud and, therefore, the stability of the flow patterns in the spray dryer. The stickiness of the skim milk powder is related to the temperature and moisture content of the particles. In the past, the sticky-point curve has been suggested as a semi-quantitative concept in selecting operating conditions for spray drying food material containing carbohydrates, where it has been implied that there is no significant wall deposition below the sticky-point curve. This work has quantified the spray deposition in spray dryers with respect to the sticky-point curve, where the highest spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls was 16 g m- 2 hr- 1, and the operating point corresponding to this spray deposition flux was located at and above the sticky-point curve. Hence, both particle stickiness and flow patterns affect the wall deposition of particles in a spray dryer. This work also investigated the effect of wall properties, namely a non-stick food grade material (nylon), adhesive tape and stainless steel, on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls. The effect of electrostatics on wall deposition was studied by grounding the spray dryer and an anti-static agent was added to the skim milk to investigate if altering the properties of the feed material could reduce wall deposition. This work has quantitatively confirmed that cohesion occurs at the same rate as adhesion for skim milk powder in this spray dryer, because firstly, decreasing the adhesion tendency of the v wall by using nylon coating had no significant effect on the spray deposition flux compared with a smooth stainless steel wall and a wall covered with a double-sided adhesive tape; and secondly the powder collected on the walls was a linear function of time with and without adhesive on the plates. Furthermore, using a nylon coated wall did not eliminate wall deposition, and the wall deposition flux was found to be the same as when a stainless steel wall was used. This result further supports the finding here that spray deposition on the walls for skim milk powder is controlled by cohesion rather than adhesion. The spray dryer operating parameters that gave rise to the least spray deposition flux on the walls were a swirl vane angle of 0 o, an inlet air temperature of 230 oC and a process fluid flowrate of 1. 4 kg hr- 1. Decreasing the feed flowrate from 1. 8 kg hr- 1 to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 (decrease by 24 %), with the inlet air temperature and swirl vane angle held constant, decreased the wall deposition flux by 43 % from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 to 4 g m- 2 hr- 1. Since the spray deposition flux on the walls decreased by 43 % when the feed flowrate was decreased by 24 %, it might be considered that the production process is in favour of a decrease in the feed flowrate to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 in this dryer, and consequently a decrease in the spray deposition flux on the walls per unit production output. Finally, this work investigated if the outlet moisture content from this small spray dryer used here was equilibrium limited or controlled by drying kinetics. The findings in this work confirmed the product moisture locus concept, which implies that the outlet moisture content of the skim milk particles approaches the equilibrium moisture content (in equilibrium with the outlet gas), and that the outlet moisture content of spray-dried food material containing carbohydrates is probably not limited by particle drying kinetics, even though the spray dryer is smaller (diameter 0. 8 m, height 2 m) than those used in the dairy industry, typically with a diameter of 30 m and a height of 10 m...|$|R

Deeper analysis coupling fluid dynamics and heat transfer processes was also performed, evidencing a strong correlation between maximum and minimum temperature values and heat transfer coefficients with the vorticity fields in the lamella, which lead to particular mixing processes in the boundary layer region. The correlation between the resulted temperature fields and the droplet dynamics was obtained by assuming a relation between the vorticity and the local heat transfer coefficient, in the first fluid cell i. e. near the liquid-solid interface. The two measured fields revealed that local maxima and minima in the vorticity corresponded to spatially shifted local minima and maxima in the heat transfer coefficient, at all stages of the <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading.</b> This was particularly clear in the rim region, which therefore should be considered in future <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> models...|$|R

There is growing recognition that {{the ultimate goal of}} achieving efficient and sustainable pesticide usage will require greater understanding of the fluid mechanical mechanisms governing the delivery to, and <b>spreading</b> of, pesticide <b>droplets</b> on leaf surfaces. This has led to increasing use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as an important component of efficient process design with regard to pesticide delivery to the leaf surface. This perspective highlights recent advances in CFD methods for <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> and film flows which have the potential to provide accurate, predictive models for pesticide flow on leaf surfaces, and which can take account of each of the key influences of surface topography and chemistry, initial spray deposition conditions, evaporation and multiple <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> interactions. The mathematical framework of these CFD methods is described briefly and a series of new flow simulation results relevant to pesticide flows over foliage is provided. The potential benefits of employing CFD for practical process design are also discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|Coating of {{a surface}} by <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> plays an {{important}} role in many novas industrial processes, such as plasma spray coating, ink jet printing, nano safeguard coatings and nano self-assembling. Data analysis of nano and micro <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> can be widely used to predict and optimize coating processes. In this article, we want to select the most appropriate statistical distribution for spread data of aluminum oxide splats reinforced with carbon nanotubes. For this purpose a large class of probability models including generalized exponential (GE), Burr X (BX), Weibull (W), Burr III (BIII) distributions are fitted to data. The performance of the distributions are estimated using several statistical criteria, namely, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Baysian Information Criterion (BIC), LogLikelihood (LL) and Kolmogorove-Smirnove distance. Also, the fitted plots of probability distribution function and quantile-quantile (q-q) plots are used to verify the results of different criteria. An important implication of the present study is that the GE distribution function, in contrast to other distributions, may describe more appropriately in these datasets...|$|R
40|$|In series I and II of {{this study}} ([Chua et al., 2010 a] and [Chua et al., 2010 b]), we {{discussed}} the time scale of granule–granule collision, droplet–granule collision and <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading</b> in Fluidized Bed Melt Granulation (FBMG). In this third one, we consider {{the rate at which}} binder solidifies. Simple analytical solution, based on classical formulation for conduction across a semi-infinite slab, was used to obtain a generalized equation for binder solidification time. A multi-physics simulation package (Comsol) was used to predict the binder solidification time for various operating conditions usually considered in FBMG. The simulation results were validated with experimental temperature data obtained with a high speed infrared camera during solidification of ‘macroscopic’ (mm scale) droplets. For the range of microscopic droplet size and operating conditions considered for a FBMG process, the binder solidification time was found to fall approximately between 10 - 3 and 10 - 1 s. This is the slowest compared to the other three major FBMG microscopic events discussed in this series (granule–granule collision, granule–droplet collision and <b>droplet</b> <b>spreading)</b> ...|$|R
30|$|The inkjet {{print head}} with 50 -μm-diameter nozzle {{originally}} generated 50 -μm Zn acetate ink <b>droplets,</b> and they <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> and dried to various sized circular pattern {{depending on the}} substrate heating condition. Substrate heating can reduce the spreading of the Zn acetate ink. Figure  2 a shows that the grown ZnO array size can be adjusted by substrate heating from room temperature to 70 °C (room temperature, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, respectively from left). The inkjet-printed precursor droplet will dry on the substrate. Substrate heating will accelerate the drying rate and subsequently increase contact line receding rate as the heating temperature increases. At high drying rate, the contact line will recede to smaller pattern to reduce {{to the size of}} the grown ZnO nanowire array. As the heating temperature increases, elevated ZnO nanowires were observed at the center of the droplet as indicated as blue dotted lines in Figure  1. The elevated ZnO nanowires were not observed in ZnO nanowire array grown from the nanoparticle inkjet printing [9]. The elevated ZnO nanowires might be due to the high concentration of the Zn acetate precursor during the fast drying process on the heated substrate. At the extreme cases, Zn acetate ink droplet may shrink {{to the size of the}} single nanowire diameter size to grow a single ZnO nanowire. However, the smallest nanowire array was a bundle of nanowire array growing from a point as shown in Figure  2 b (left figure) at 70 °C substrate heating case. For that case, the nanowire diameter and length were much bigger than those of the nanowires grown from the larger inkjet patterns. Interestingly, when two droplets have overlap, the grown ZnO nanowire array has little influence to each other.|$|R

This case demonstrates that no primary source elsewhere has been identified, and the patient’s partner has tested negative.|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} process of spray cooling, {{due to the}} impact of in-flight droplet impingings onto a heated surface, consequently may lead to splashing, spreading, or rebounding [6]. Obviously, the rebound process would result in decreased liquid cooling capacity and efficiency. The impinging <b>droplets</b> <b>spread</b> on the surface and can form a continuous liquid film. At high wall superheat, a thin vapor layer can form under the droplets or the thin liquid films due to boiling [7].|$|R
