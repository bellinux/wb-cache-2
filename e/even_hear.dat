5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper Batzen by 50% to adjust its face value to its intrinsic value to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. Not many people could thus {{take advantage of this}} exchange offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese Batzen were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable. Insider deals of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population. The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by Hans Emmenegger from Schüpfheim and Christian Schybi from Escholzmatt, sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (Landsgemeinde) {{of the population of the}} valley at Heiligkreuz, in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the freedom of assembly. The assembly, which took place after the mass on February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.|$|E

25|$|Both {{historians who}} relate {{the attack on}} Delphi, Pausanias and Junianus Justinus, say that the Gauls were {{defeated}} and driven off. They were overtaken by a violent thunderstorm, which {{made it impossible to}} manoeuvre or <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> their orders. The night that followed was frosty, and in the morning the Greeks attacked them from both sides. Brennus was wounded and the Gauls fell back, killing those of their own wounded who were unable to retreat. That night, a panic fell on the camp, as the Gauls divided into factions and fought amongst themselves. They were joined by Acichorius {{and the rest of the}} army, but the Greeks forced them into a full-scale retreat. Brennus took his own life by drinking neat wine according to Pausanias, or by stabbing himself according to Justinus. Pressed by the Aetolians, the Gauls fell back to the Spercheios, where the waiting Thessalians and Malians destroyed them.|$|E

500|$|In an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} composition [...] "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> strains of Philip Glass’ music. He says there is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song’s finale. [...] Parsons characterizes this same song as [...] "a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until {{near the end of}} the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, [...] "floating effortlessly" [...] on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme". At the same time, Debbage notes [...] "...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..." [...] and says that it [...] "...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ...

500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when you are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem was}} {{compounded}} by the educational system. [...] Until 1881 only Ancient Greek — not even katharevousa — was taught in Greek primary schools, continuing {{the tradition of the}} Greek Orthodox Church, which had exercised an effective monopoly over education for centuries. [...] (The Church had always taught the ancient koine Greek of the gospels and the Divine Liturgy.) [...] The children thus had to learn to read and write in a language they did not speak, or <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> outside church. [...] This had been acceptable in previous centuries, when the schools had concentrated on training future priests; but it could not provide universal popular literacy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} {{schedule was}} so hurried {{that the group}} often did not <b>even</b> <b>hear</b> the playbacks. Page recalled, [...] "It was just so bloody rushed.

Yardbirds' chronicler Gregg Russo notes the result was that [...] "many [...] have a demo quality that time shortages would not allow them to change".
