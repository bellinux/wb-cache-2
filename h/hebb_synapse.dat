40|$|The <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapse</b> {{has become}} better known than Donald Hebb himself. In this respect he has joined an {{exclusive}} club {{along with the}} Ising model in condensed matter physics and Parkinson's disease in medicine. This {{is not to say}} that Hebb has not made other important contributions, as Peter Milner and Bryan Kolb document, but the <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapse</b> has eclipsed these other achievements. The goal of this essay is to examine how this happened. The <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapse</b> remains a vital organizing concept for both experimental studies and theoretical analysis, as Geoffrey Hinton emphasizes. I am sometimes asked to identify important advances made by theory and computational modeling in neuroscience. Most would agree that the achievement of Hodgkin and Huxley in modeling the action potential was of seminal importance. Not only did they provide a mechanistic explanation of the action potential that has withstood the test of time, they also outlined a research strategy for explaining even more complex internal properties of neurons that has served us well over the last 50 years (Destexhe & Sejnowski, 2001). It is more difficult to find success stories at the systems level, but Donald Hebb would qualify in my mind. Not only did he make a prediction about the conditions for synaptic plasticity that was subsequently confirmed, he also outlined a framework for building links between neurophysiology and psychology that has become a major research program. I wrote a review of Hebb's 1949 book on the occasion of the 50 th anniversary (Sejnowski, 1999) and this essay gives me the opportunity to put recent discoveries in synaptic plasticity into the context of Hebb's research program. The central problem that Hebb posed in Th...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{experimentation}} {{in much of}} {{this area}} is very difficult or impossible. For such circumstances, {{it is argued that}} much can be achieved by a rigorous quantitative programme of interdisciplinary theorizing based on available data. The paper then outlines progress arising from this approach from: (1) a Piagetian view of behaviour, through (2) a model for the "scheme" as a statistical population of discrete linear molecules (despite <b>Hebb's</b> <b>synapse</b> suggestions), down to (3) the physics and chemistry of signal emission, transmission and absorption. The latter analysis yields the surprising suggestion (corroborated by Cope's work) that a vital frequency-component for neural signals occurs in the infra-red range: about 10 ^ 13 cycles/second.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{bases of}} learning are currently under active investigation by both experimental and theoretical means. In this paper, a simple neuronal wiring diagram is proposed that can reproduce both simple and higher-order behavioral paradigms seen in invertebrate classical conditioning experiments. Learning {{in this model}} does not take place by modification of synaptic strength values. Instead, the model uses a layer of interneurons with modifiable thresholds for spike initiation, {{as suggested by the}} plasticity mechanisms thought to operate in Hermissenda [Alkon, D. L. (1983) Sci. Am. 249, 70 - 84]. The model therefore has an advantage in plausibility compared with more standard models using <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapses</b> or their functional equivalents, which have not yet been demonstrated in any invertebrate organism...|$|R
5000|$|The machine {{itself is}} a {{randomly}} connected network of approximately 40 <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapses.</b> These synapses each have a memory that holds the probability that signal comes in one input and another signal {{will come out of}} the output. There is a probability knob that goes from 0 to 1 that shows this probability of the signals propagating. If the probability signal gets through, a capacitor remembers this function and engages a [...] "clutch". At this point, the operator will press a button to give reward to the machine. At this point, a large motor starts and there is a chain that goes to all 40 synapse machines, checking if the clutch is engaged or not. As the capacitor can only [...] "remember" [...] for a certain amount of time, the chain only catches the most recent updates of the probabilities.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the molecular biology of synaptic transmission, in particular of neurotransmitter receptors, offers novel information relevant to `realistic' modeling of neural processes at the single cell and network level. Sophisticated computer analyses of two-dimensional crystals by high resolution electron microscopy yield images of single neurotransmitter receptor molecules with tentative identifications of ligand binding sites and of conformational transitions. The dynamics of conformational changes can {{be accounted for by}} a `multistate allosteric network' model. Allosteric receptors also possess the structural and functional properties required to serve as coincidence detectors between pre- and post-synaptic signals and, therefore, can be used as building blocks for a chemical <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapse.</b> These properties were introduced into networks of formal neurons capable of producing and detecting temporal sequences. In more elaborate models of pre-frontal cortex functions, allosteric receptors control the selection of transient `pre-representations' and their stabilization by external or internal reward signals. We apply this scheme to Shallice's Tower of London test, and we show how a hierarchical neuronal architecture can implement Z. executive or planning functions associated with frontal areas.

40|$|Hippocampal {{damage in}} people causes {{impairments}} of episodic memory, but in rats it causes impairments of spatial learning. Experiments in macaque monkeys show {{that these two}} kinds of impairment are functionally similar to each other. After any lesion that interrupts the Delay-Brion system (hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies and anterior thalamus) monkeys are impaired in scene-specific memory, where an event takes place against a background that is specific to that event. Scene-specific memory in the monkey corresponds to human episodic memory, which is {{the memory of a}} unique event set in a particular scene, as opposed to scene-independent human knowledge, which is abstracted from many different scenes. However, interruption of the Delay-Brion system is not sufficient to explain all of the memory impairments that are seen in amnesic patients. To explain amnesia the specialized function of the hippocampus in scene memory needs to be considered alongside the other, qualitatively different functional specializations of other memory systems of the temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex and the amygdala. In all these specialized areas, however, including the hippocampus, there is no fundamental distinction between memory systems and perceptual systems. In explaining memory disorders in amnesia {{it is also important to}} consider them alongside the memory disorders of neglect patients. Neglect patients fail to represent in memory the side of the world that is contralateral to the current fixation point, in both short- and long-term memory retrieval. Neglect was produced experimentally by unilateral visual disconnection in the monkey, confirming the idea that visual memory retrieval is retinotopically organized; patients with unilateral medial temporal-lobe removals showed lateralized memory impairments for half-scenes in the visual hemifield contralateral to the removal. Thus, in scene-memory retrieval the Delay-Brion system contributes to the retrieval of visual memories into the retinotopically organized visual cortex. This scene memory interpretation of hippocampal function needs to be contrasted with the cognitive-map hypothesis. The cognitive-map model of hippocampal function shares some common assumptions with the Hebb-synapse model of association formation, and the Hebb-synapse model can be rejected on the basis of recent evidence that monkeys can form direct associations in memory between temporally discontiguous events. Our general conclusion is that the primate brain encompasses widespread and powerful memory mechanisms which will continue to be poorly understood if theory and experimentation continue to concentrate too much, as they have in the past, on the hippocampus and the <b>Hebb</b> <b>synapse...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{central theme}} in {{neurobiology}} is {{the search for}} the mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Since the seminal work, first of Cajal and later of <b>Hebb,</b> the <b>synapse</b> is thought to be the basic "storing unit. " Hebb proposed that information is stored by correlation: synapses between neurons, which are often coactive, are enhanced. Several recent findings suggest that such a mechanism is indeed operative in the central nervous system. Pairing of activity on presynaptic fibers with strong postsynaptic depolarization results in synaptic enhancement. While there is substantial evidence in favor of a postsynaptic locus for detection of the synchronous pre- and postsynaptic event and subsequent initiation of synaptic enhancement, the locus of this enhancement and its ensuing persistence is still disputed: both pre- and postsynaptic contributions have been suggested. In all previous studies, the enhancement was presumed to be specific to the synapses where synchronous pre- and postsynaptic stimulation was applied. We report here that two recording techniques [...] optical recording, using voltage-sensitive dyes, and double intracellular recordings [...] reveal that synaptic enhancement is not restricted to the stimulated cell. Although we paired single afferent volleys with intracellular stimulation confined to one postsynaptic cell, we found that strengthening also occurred on synapses between the stimulated presynaptic fibers and neighboring cells. This suggests that synaptic enhancement by the "paired-stimulation paradigm" is not local on the presynaptic axons and that, in fact, the synapses of many neighboring postsynaptic cells are enhanced...|$|R
40|$|According to Hebb’s {{original}} hypothesis (<b>Hebb,</b> 1949), <b>synapses</b> are reinforced when presynaptic activity triggers postsynaptic firing, {{resulting in}} long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic efficacy. Long-term depression (LTD) is a use-dependent decrease in synaptic strength that {{is thought to}} be due to synaptic in put causing a weak postsynaptic effect. Although the mechanisms that mediate long-term synaptic plasticity have been investigated for at least three decades not all question have as yet been answered. Therefore, we aimed at determining the mechanisms that generate LTP or LTD with the simplest possible protocol Low-frequency stimulation of basal dendrite inputs in Layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat barrel cortex induces LTP. This stimulation triggered an EPSP, an action potential (AP) burst, and a Ca 2 + spike. The same stimulation induced LTD following manipulations that reduced the Ca 2 + spike and Ca 2 + signal or the AP burst. Low-frequency whisker deflections induced similar bidirectional plasticity of action potential evoked responses in anesthetized rats. These results suggest that both in vitro and in vivo similar mechanisms regulate the balance between LTP and LTD. This simple induction form of bidirectional hebbian plasticity could be present in the natural conditions to regulate the detection, flow, and storage of sensorimotor informationWork supported by “Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología y Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación” grants (BFU 2005 - 07486, BFU 2008 - 03488, SAF 2009 - 10339, BFU 2011 - 23522, BFU 2012 - 36107, BFU 2013 - 43668 -P and BFU 2016 - 80802 -P) and a “Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid” (GR/SAL/ 0877 / 2004) grant.

40|$|<b>Hebb</b> {{proposed}} that <b>synapses</b> between neurons that fire synchronously are strengthened, forming cell assemblies and phase sequences. The former, on a shorter scale, are ensembles of synchronized cells that function transiently as a closed processing system; the latter, {{on a larger}} scale, correspond to the sequential activation of cell assemblies able to represent percepts and behaviors. Nowadays, the recording of large neuronal populations allows {{for the detection of}} multiple cell assemblies. Within Hebb’s theory, the next logical step is the analysis of phase sequences. Here we detected phase sequences as consecutive assembly activation patterns, and then analyzed their graph attributes in relation to behavior. We investigated action potentials recorded from the adult rat hippocampus and neocortex before, during and after novel object exploration (experimental periods). Within assembly graphs, each assembly corresponded to a node, and each edge corresponded to the temporal sequence of consecutive node activations. The sum of all assembly activations was proportional to firing rates, but the activity of individual assemblies was not. Assembly repertoire was stable across experimental periods, suggesting that novel experience does not create new assemblies in the adult rat. Assembly graph attributes, on the other hand, varied significantly across behavioral states and experimental periods, and were separable enough to correctly classify experimental periods (Naïve Bayes classifier; maximum AUROCs ranging from 0. 55 to 0. 99) and behavioral states (waking, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep; maximum AUROCs s ranging from 0. 64 to 0. 98). Our findings agree with Hebb’s view that assemblies correspond to primitive building blocks of representation, nearly unchanged in the adult, while phase sequences are labile across behavioral states and change after novel experience. The results are compatible with a role for phase sequences in behavior and cognition...|$|R
