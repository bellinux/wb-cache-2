40|$|Abstract. Deep Cryogenic {{treatment}} (DCT) is a {{one time}} permanent process, {{carried out in}} such a way that the material is slowly cooled down to the cryogenic temperature, after which it is held at that temperature for a specified period of time and is heated back to room temperature at slow rate followed by low temperature tempering. In this study, the orthogonal experiment method was used to study the DCT process of YT 30 cemented carbide inserts. The primary relation of the different factors of DCT was analyzed. TH 300 sclerometer was used to measure the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>inserts.</b> The microscopes were used to observe the wearing profiles of inserts and microstructures before and after DCT. The orthogonal experiment results show that the effect of soaking temperature on the properties of inserts is the first factor, the soaking time is second one, the cooling rate is third one, and the last one is the tempering temperature. DCT improves the multi-type martensite transformation of Co. Therefore DCT increases hardness and enhance wear resistance of the cemented carbide inserts...|$|E

The paper studies the interrelation at the contact point of friction pair «contact wire – current col lector insert», the connection was established between the hardness and electrical resistivity. It is proposed to narrow the range of carbon inserts hardness. The method of sorting coal collector inserts in hardness was developed, and the research has revealed the discrepancy of current collector inserts with existing regulations.

Originality. In the course of the study the current collector inserts the sharp structural heterogeneity and fluctuations of the density of the material along the length of the insert were established. The dependence between <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> <b>inserts</b> and electrical resistivity was established. It was analyzed and concluded about the need to reduce the values of the normal range of hardness. Based on the results of the research, the experimental dependences were obtained and proposed the method for sorting carbon current collector inserts for the structural parameters. Practical value. The obtained results of coal current collector inserts define the need to use method for sorting the coal current collector inserts and the use of a special scheme for equipping pantograph slide.

The proposed measures can reduce the intensity of the electrical and mechanical wear of materials friction pair «contact wire – current collector inserts». The use of specialized research facility for the study of the friction pair, will allow carrying out the studies to determine the intensity of wear of contact surfaces of the pair of friction and the coefficient of friction at various external factors...|$|E

Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a draw plate, becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate.

30|$|We {{know that}} the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> a {{material}} directly relates to wear, and that increasing the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> the steel can reduce the wear of wheels and rails. There {{is a limit to}} the benefit <b>of</b> increasing the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> the wheel and rail, however, and simply improving the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> material to reduce the wear is not an effective method. Many studies have shown that a plastic deformation layer on the surface of hard steel is formed during wearing, significantly increasing the <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> the worn surface [5, 6, 7, 8]. This forms a special material which consists of a hard external material and a tough internal material which is ideal for railway operation.
