In 2015, Jordan became the first billionaire NBA player in history {{as a result of}} the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of NBA franchises. He is the third-richest African-American, behind Oprah Winfrey and Robert F. Smith.|$|E
5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E

A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth; the two chains would retain separate operations post-merger.

25|$|Following {{the death}} of William Bell's wife in 1870, the family moved back to Seattle, now much more built up then when they had left. Austin however {{remained}} in San Francisco where he had built up a career in real estate. The value of Bell's property had skyrocketed in the previous years and he proceeded to make improvements to the land. In late 1883, the senior Bell completed his last great project, the four story wooden Bell Hotel {{at the corner of}} First and Battery Streets. Suffering from mental illness in his later years, William Bell died September 8, 1887 at the age of 70. He left to Austin a quarter his estate valued at $400,000, which continued to <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value.</b> Bell soon became one of Seattle's wealthiest citizens.|$|E

500|$|A Congressional {{investigation}} in June, 1870 led by Senator Carl Schurz revealed that Babcock and Ingalls both had land {{interests in the}} Bay of Samaná that would <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> if the Santo Domingo treaty were ratified. U.S. Navy ships, with President Grant's authorization, {{had been sent to}} protect Báez from an invasion by a Dominican rebel, Gregorio Luperón, while the treaty negotiations were taking place. The investigation had initially been called to settle a dispute between an American businessman Davis Hatch against the United States government. Báez had imprisoned Hatch without trial for his opposition to the Báez government. Hatch had claimed that the United States had failed to protect him from imprisonment. The majority Congressional report dismissed Hatch's claim and exonerated [...] both Babcock and Ingalls. The Hatch incident, however, kept certain Senators from being enthusiastic about ratifying the treaty.|$|E
500|$|Because Denny Fairfax was a British subject {{residing}} in England, {{he had no}} legal rights under American jurisdiction; thus, he and his British relatives were considered [...] "alien enemies" [...] and his landholdings were confiscated under escheat laws. In 1785, the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records, books, and documents pertaining to the proprietary's lands be confiscated {{by the state of}} Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar's Office in Richmond. Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted, and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land. Land values in the Northern Neck continued to <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value,</b> which Martin noted in a 1790 letter. The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier, which Martin commented: [...] "The emigration of inhabitants is... astonishing." ...|$|E

500|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} under the 1909 Act [...] which had become {{effective}} January 1, 1909 [...] the taxpayer should be taxed only on the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> after 1908. Increases in value prior to the effective date of the statute {{were not to be}} taxed under the terms of that statute. Thus, the taxpayer was entitled to deduct, from its gross receipts from the sale of finished lumber, a basis amount computed with reference to the $40 per acre value as of December 31, 1908. [...] Doyle is a case involving statutory (not constitutional) interpretation. In this case, the Court was interpreting the 1909 statute. Although some tax protesters cite this case for an argument about the constitutional definition of income as excluding income of individuals, no issues involving the constitutional definition of income, or of income under any other tax statutes, were presented to or decided by the Court.|$|E
500|$|Some tax protesters {{have cited}} the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Eisner v. Macomber for the theory that wages are not taxable, or for the theory that dividends are not taxable. The case dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split, as opposed to a cash dividend on stock. In the case of this kind of [...] "dividend" [...] the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value. For example, if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of $4 per share, the total value is $400. If the corporation declares, say, a [...] "two for one" [...] stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split (and the corporation distributes no money or other property), the stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of $2 each, which is still $400 in value - i.e., no <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> and no income. The pie is still the same size [...] but it's sliced into more pieces, each piece being proportionately smaller.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1620s the {{trustees}} reported problems receiving rents from the tenants in Gedney. Although the school received a bequest {{from a local}} gentleman, Robert Cammock, in 1631, which provided an additional income of £4 per annum, no more followed; the English Civil War also disrupted funding: rents were not collected between 1644 and 1646. These financial problems were compounded {{by the nature of}} the land itself: it was agricultural and not urban, thus it did not <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> significantly in the 17th century. Carre's lagged behind other schools and its buildings fell into disrepair as the fixed endowment failed to keep up with inflation (despite the Gedney lands increasing in value to £180 by the early 19th century). In 1783, the foeffees (by then, often called trustees) spent £50 on improvements, but by 1794, the adjacent Carre's Hospital agreed that part of its building be pulled down to make way for a new schoolhouse. This did not materialise and pupils were taught in the vestry at St Denys' Church by the early 19th century. In 1816, {{the trustees}} discontinued the master's salary because there were [...] "no duties to perform" [...] at the school.|$|E
