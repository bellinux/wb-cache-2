5|$|The {{land that}} became Sullivan County was {{originally}} part of Northumberland County, then {{became part of}} Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. Settlers first arrived in the park's townships in 1794. Shrewsbury Township was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> Muncy Township in 1803, and Forks Township was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> Shrewsbury Township in 1833, both while still part of Lycoming County. Sullivan County was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847.|$|E
5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

Sullivan County itself was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847.

5|$|Twenty other Pennsylvania {{counties}} today contain {{land that}} was once part of Lycoming County: five were formed completely from it (Jefferson, McKean, Potter, Tioga, and Sullivan), eight were <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> it and other counties (Armstrong, Bradford, Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Indiana, Venango, and Warren), three were <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> counties that were themselves formed partly from it (Cameron, Clarion, and Elk), Forest was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> a county that was formed completely from it, two (Luzerne and Wyoming) contain territory {{that was part of}} lycoming County in 1795, and finally Union received a township from it in 1861.|$|E
5|$|While {{all four}} boroughs were formed after Sullivan County was established, {{seven of the}} nine townships were formed while still part of Lycoming County. The first of these was Shrewsbury Township, which {{encompassed}} all of modern Sullivan County when it was formed in 1803. Elkland Township was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> Shrewsbury in 1804, as were Cherry (1824), Davidson (1833), and Forks Townships (1833). Plunketts Creek Township was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> Franklin and Davidson Townships in 1838, and Fox Township was <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> Elkland in 1839. When Sullivan County was formed in 1847, both Shrewsbury and Plunketts Creek Townships were split, with each county having a township of that name. Plunketts Creek Township in Sullivan County {{changed its name to}} Hillsgrove Township in 1856. Sullivan County has no former townships, and no counties have been <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E
