40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how.</b> First, the abstract notion of knowledge is discussed, and a terminological basis is introduced to treat know-how {{as a kind of}} knowledge. Next, a brief survey of the recently reported works dealt with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how</b> is presented, and an explicit definition of know-how is formulated. Finally, the problem of utilizing know-how with knowledge-based systems is analyzed, and some ideas useful for its solving are given. ...|$|R

Sugar production, the first large-scale colonial agricultural enterprise, was made possible by a series of favorable conditions. Portugal had the agricultural and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how</b> from its Atlantic islands and manufactured its own equipment for extracting sugar from sugarcane. Furthermore, being involved in the African slave trade, it had access to the necessary manpower. Finally, Portugal relied on the commercial skills of the Dutch and financing from Holland to enable a rapid penetration of sugar in Europe's markets.|$|R

50|$|Lenses with 11, 12, or 15 blade iris {{diaphragms}} {{are often}} claimed {{to excel in}} bokeh quality. Because of this, the lenses don't need to reach wide apertures to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how</b> required, {{at a time when}} all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good bokeh at f/4.5. Today {{it is much easier to}} make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{two years}} of William’s return, two {{additional}} plants had been built in Devon/Cornwall to make blasting powder. These were at Herodsfoot, Cornwall and at Powdermills on Dartmoor. Sodium nitrate was suitable for blasting powder, which {{was used in the}} mines and quarries of the region. [...] The sodium nitrate as received from Peru was of sufficient purity to be used without further treatment. This accounts for the absence at these two plants of the usual facilities for upgrading the potassium nitrate that came from India, which had a purity of only 65-70%. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how</b> probably came from the Perran Foundry. Barclay Fox, the owner of the Perran Foundry, certainly had some commercial interest in the second plant and a connection through the Quakers to the owners of the first.|$|R

Based on the analysis of a survey conducted on 230 Japanese parent companies with investments in China, the empirical research findings include: Japanese MNCs in China favor global integration strategies; the more significant the ownership advantages and internalization advantages are, the greater the global integration is; the success factors of their operations in China due to global integration are present in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how,</b> procurement of parts and supplies, financial power, previous investment experience in China as well as sales networks and technologies; locational advantages mainly lie in labor cost among other things; internalization factors do not have any significant correlation with the success and performance of the subsidiary company.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany {{developing}} countries lack or have inadequate {{pandemic influenza vaccine}} manufacturing capacity. In the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic, this led to delayed and inadequate vaccine coverage in the developing world. Thus, bolstering developing country influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is urgently needed. The Cantacuzino Institute in Bucharest, Romania has been producing seasonal influenza vaccine since the 1970 s, and {{has the capacity to}} produce ∼ 5 million doses of monovalent vaccine {{in the event of an}} influenza pandemic. Inclusion of an adjuvant in the vaccine could enable antigen dose sparing, expanding vaccine coverage and potentially allowing universal vaccination of the Romanian population and possibly neighboring countries. However, adjuvant formulation and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>know-how</b> are difficult to access. This manuscript describes the successful transfer of oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant manufacturing and quality control technologies from the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle, USA to the Cantacuzino Institute. By describing the challenges and accomplishments of the project, it is hoped that the knowledge and experience gained will benefit other institutes involved in similar technology transfer projects designed to facilitate increased vaccine manufacturing capacity in {{developing countries}}...|$|R
