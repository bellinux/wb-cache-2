5|$|Williams {{suffers from}} <b>idiopathic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura. He was first {{diagnosed}} with the recurring rare blood disorder in 2009. Since then, he has been taking regular medications.|$|E
5|$|DPB is <b>idiopathic,</b> {{which means}} an exact physiological, environmental, or {{pathogenic}} {{cause of the}} disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected {{to be involved with}} its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).|$|E
5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> {{interstitial}} pneumonia or noninfectious pneumonia is a {{class of}} diffuse lung diseases. They include diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, and usual interstitial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from <b>idiopathic</b> intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The <b>idiopathic</b> (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category <b>idiopathic.</b> Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is <b>idiopathic,</b> {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|Flournoy died of <b>idiopathic</b> {{pulmonary}} fibrosis {{at the age}} of 75 on May 17, 1961, at Kanawha Valley Memorial Hospital in Charleston following a prolonged illness. He was survived by his wife, his son, and his sister Frances Flournoy Preston. Flournoy's funeral services were held at the Barlow-Bonsall Funeral Home and his family requested that memorial donations be made to Marmet Hospital in his honor. He was interred at Spring Hill Cemetery in Charleston on May 19, 1961.|$|E
5|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the <b>idiopathic</b> progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as <b>idiopathic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} the most common from a group of {{hereditary}} diseases that cause copper overload in the liver. All can cause cirrhosis at a young age. The other members of the group are Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis and <b>idiopathic</b> copper toxicosis. These are not related to ATP7B mutations: for example, ICC has been linked to mutations in the KRT8 and the KRT18 gene.|$|E
5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after <b>idiopathic</b> VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are <b>idiopathic,</b> though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
25|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> {{scoliosis}} {{can appear}} at different ages. Infantile <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis that appear from the birth to 3 years old, account for 0.5% of <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis. Juvenile <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis that appear from the 4 to 10 years old, account for 10.5% of <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis. Adolescent <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis that appear {{after the age}} of 10 years, account for 89% of <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis. From these statistics, it seems that individuals are at highest risk of developing <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis during adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Several {{candidate}} gene {{studies have found}} associations between <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis and genes mediating bone formation, bone metabolism, and connective tissue structure. Several genome-wide studies have {{identified a number of}} loci as significantly linked to <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis. In 2006 <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis was linked with three microsatellite polymorphisms in the MATN1 gene (encoding for Matrilin 1, cartilage matrix protein). Fifty-three single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis were identified through a genome-wide association study.|$|E
25|$|Congenital and <b>idiopathic</b> {{scoliosis}} {{that develops}} {{before the age}} of 10 is referred to as early onset scoliosis (EOS). Scoliosis that develops after 10 is referred to as adolescent <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>idiopathic</b> {{scoliosis}} {{accounts for}} 80–90% of scoliosis cases. Its pathogenesis is unknown. However, {{changes in the}} vestibular system, a lateral shift of the hand representation and abnormal variability of erector spinae motor map location in the motor cortex {{may be involved in}} this disease. Besides, <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, intervertebral disc and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis, although these are perhaps results rather than causes.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{vaginismus}} {{is often}} <b>idiopathic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Epilepsy in dogs {{can be a}} primary, <b>idiopathic,</b> {{inherited}} disorder {{or secondary}} to previous head trauma or CNS infections. <b>Idiopathic</b> epilepsy is commonly found in breeds such as German Shepherd Dogs, Beagles, and Dachshunds. The most common sign recurring generalized seizures beginning at a young adult age.|$|E
25|$|In certain words, the {{circumflex}} is <b>idiopathic,</b> {{and has no}} precise linguistic role.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{longitudinal}} studies {{reveal that the}} most common form of the condition, late-onset <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis, causes little physical impairment other than back pain and cosmetic concerns, even when untreated, with mortality rates similar to the general population. Older beliefs that untreated <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis necessarily progresses into severe (cardiopulmonary) disability by old age have been refuted by later studies.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo*, {{better known}} as {{vestibular}} disease* in dogs, is an uncommon condition in older dogs. Most cases are <b>idiopathic,</b> {{but it can also}} be caused by otitis interna, or inner ear infection, tumors, and encephalitis. Signs include nystagmus, head tilt, circling, vomiting, and falling to one side. <b>Idiopathic</b> vestibular disease will usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally {{tamoxifen}} is used {{in treatment}} of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and <b>idiopathic</b> sclerosing mesenteritis.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Photosensitivity occurs {{following}} the ingestion of certain plants, such as alfalfa. The reason is obscure or <b>idiopathic.</b>|$|E
25|$|William Miller died on March 17, 2006 from <b>idiopathic</b> {{pulmonary}} fibrosis, a lung condition, {{at the age}} of 81.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{angle is}} a common measure to {{classify}} scoliosis. The greater the angle, the more serious is the disease but the smaller {{is the number of}} patients. One to three out of every hundred people have <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis curves greater than 10° with an equal proportion of boys and girls. One to three out of every thousand people have <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis curves greater than 30° with a ratio of eight girls for every one boy.|$|E
25|$|Coding and noncoding {{variation}} of the human calcium-channel beta4-subunit gene CACNB4 in patients with <b>idiopathic</b> generalized epilepsy and episodic ataxia.|$|E
25|$|ANAs {{are found}} in many {{disorders}}, {{as well as some}} healthy individuals. These disorders include: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, discoid lupus, thyroid disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, juvenile <b>idiopathic</b> arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, <b>idiopathic</b> thrombocytopaenic purpura, infection and cancer. These antibodies can be subdivided according to their specificity, and each subset has different propensities for specific disorders.|$|E
25|$|The FDA {{issued a}} Safety Alert in August 2011, {{communicating}} {{the fact that}} a French study found that persons with certain kinds of short stature (<b>idiopathic</b> growth hormone deficiency and <b>idiopathic</b> or gestational short stature) treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood and who were followed {{over a long period of}} time, were at a small increased risk of death when compared to individuals in the general population of France.|$|E
25|$|When eosinophilic {{gastroenteritis}} {{is observed}} {{in association with}} eosinophilic infiltration of other organ systems, the diagnosis of <b>idiopathic</b> hypereosinophilic syndrome should be considered.|$|E
25|$|A {{very common}} {{treatment}} for long-term, especially <b>idiopathic,</b> cranial hypertension is medication {{with a special}} diuretic, especially one prescribed by a neurologist.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 65% of scoliosis {{cases are}} <b>idiopathic,</b> about 15% are congenital and about 10% are secondary to a neuromuscular disease.|$|E
25|$|Because scoliotic {{people have}} higher joint laxity {{compared}} to non-scoliotic people, they are drawn toward gymnastics but {{the practice of}} gymnastics for less than 20 hours training per week does not cause scoliosis. Based on populations that had more than 20 hours training per week, <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis has been observed among 10% of tennis players, 16% of young swimmers and 24% in professional ballet companies. The exposure {{of the body to}} high repetitive mechanical constraints may influence the occurrence of <b>idiopathic</b> scoliosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{variable}} {{degree of}} ventricular enlargement is seen, either obstructive (e.g. by a subependymal nodule {{in the region}} of the foramen of Monro) or <b>idiopathic</b> in nature.|$|E
