60|$|The servant did so; but the {{mistress}} of the house merely transmitted her <b>former</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R
50|$|The /l/ {{has also}} {{been lost in the}} words would and should. The word could was never {{pronounced}} with /l/; its spelling results from analogy with the <b>former</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R
60|$|Quest {{pushed his}} way through the crowd to where Craig was {{speaking}} eagerly to Inspector French. He stopped short and stooped down. He was near enough to hear the <b>former's</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Hawaiian mythology, kapuku or kupaku is {{the magic}} of reincarnation (see necromancy). The <b>former</b> <b>word</b> means [...] "to restore life" [...] in Hawaiian while the later means [...] "to recover from a nearly fatal illness." ...|$|R
60|$|Expectorate for Spit. The <b>former</b> <b>word</b> is {{frequently}} used, even in laws and ordinances, as {{a euphemism for}} the latter. It not only means something entirely different, but to one with a Latin ear is far more offensive.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Leave her alone, everybody!' cried Mrs. Sparsit, {{with great}} energy. 'Let nobody touch her. She belongs to me. Come in, ma'am!' then said Mrs. Sparsit, {{reversing}} her <b>former</b> <b>word</b> of command. 'Come in, ma'am, or we'll have you dragged in!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The name Sant Feliu {{goes back}} to the martyred saint, Feliu, who came from Africa. Guíxols is a word derived from the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> Iecsalis, of a {{document}} the 10th century that mentions to the monastery and that seems to mean [...] "Rope-maker" ...|$|R
500|$|Mahanoy Creek's {{name comes}} from a {{corruption}} of the Delaware Indian word [...] "mahoni" [...] or [...] "maghonioy". The <b>former</b> <b>word</b> means [...] "lick".

6000|$|... "Oh, from me;--from me. If {{she were}} told {{it came from}} the {{governor}} she'd keep it whether or no. I am sure I hope she will keep it," [...] he said, trying to remove the bad impression which his <b>former</b> <b>words</b> might perhaps have left.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} vowel differences: compare Anglo-Norman {{profound}} with Parisian French profond, soun sound with son, round with rond. The <b>former</b> <b>words</b> were originally pronounced something like profoond, soond, roond respectively (compare the similarly denasalised vowels of modern Norman), but later developed their modern pronunciation in English.|$|R
5000|$|The {{translation}} of [...] "bucke uerteþ" [...] is uncertain. Some translate the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> as [...] "buck-goat" [...] {{and the latter}} as [...] "turns" [...] or [...] "cavorts," [...] but the current critical consensus is that the line is the stag or goat [...] "farts" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|R

40|$|In his August 1977 Word Ways {{article on}} words ending in -onym, George Scheetz asked readers {{if they could}} {{identify}} contronym or charactonym, neither of which appears in standard dictionaries.

5000|$|The term [...] "brake", {{used for}} members of this genus, is a Middle English word for [...] "fern" [...] from {{southern}} England. Its derivation is unclear, and is generally thought {{to be related to}} [...] "bracken", whereby the latter word has been assumed to be a plural, as with [...] "children", and the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> a back-formation. However it may have a separate derivation.|$|R
40|$|Dmitri Borgmann has {{informed}} {{us in the}} February 1974 and May 1985 Word Ways that the longest English-language isograms (words without repeated letters) are UNCOPYRIGHTABLE and DERMATOGLYPHICS, each iwth fifteen letters. Although the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> uses all six vowels, the latter does not, as it lacks U. An affixed form of either the word or its adjectival cousin, the 14 -letter DERMATOGLYPHIC, seemed scientifically and linguistically plausible, employing this unused vowel...|$|R

5000|$|In Maltese, only {{emphatic}} [...] (= q) remains distinct, having {{developed into}} a glottal stop. All other emphatics have been merged into plain consonants. However, they are sometimes still recognizable from special vocalic developments that they triggered before the mergers. Compare [...] ("sword") with [...] ("summer"), which latter originally had an emphatic ṣ that prevented the a from becoming e (as {{it did in the}} <b>former</b> <b>word</b> with a plain s).|$|R
60|$|So {{perfectly}} assured did he look, that Lucilla felt a moment's {{doubt whether}} her memory served her {{as to his}} <b>former</b> <b>words,</b> but just as she raised her eyes and opened her lips in refutation, she met a glance from him full of ludicrous reassurance, evidently meaning that he was guarding his own secret and hers. He was gone the next moment, and Horatia turned upon her with exultant merriment.|$|R
50|$|Word Alive (previously {{known as}} New Word Alive) is an annual evangelical Christian conference {{originated}} by a partnership of the UK Christian organisations UCCF and Keswick Ministries. The conference is focussed on Bible teaching, corporate worship, and family time. The conference {{is a continuation}} of the <b>former</b> <b>Word</b> Alive event which ran within Spring Harvest. As well as attracting around 4000 guests, the conference has historically included the largest evangelical student conference in Europe.|$|R
60|$|Anne smiled, {{and let it}} pass. It was too {{pleasing}} a blunder for a reproach. It {{is something}} {{for a woman to}} be assured, in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne, by comparing it with <b>former</b> <b>words,</b> and feeling it to be the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.|$|R
5000|$|In ancient Athens, {{the villages}} of Attica {{combined}} with the polis of Athens; consequently the [...] "demos" [...] and [...] "polis" [...] became identical in Athens and the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> assumed preference to denote the whole polity. Popular government was first established in the wealthy and populous Greek cities in Ionia. From this history the word and concept of [...] "democracy" [...] is derived. This synoecism {{was one of the}} primary causes of the Kyklos in ancient Hellas.|$|R
25|$|After officially being {{prohibited}} {{for many}} years, eating beef was legalised in 1871 following the Meiji Restoration {{as part of}} an effort to introduce western culture to the country. The Emperor Meiji became part of a campaign to promote beef consumption, publicly eating beef on January 24, 1873. Steak and roasted meat were translated as yakiniku (焼肉) and iriniku (焙肉), respectively, as proposed western-style menus in Seiyō Ryōri Shinan although this usage of the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> was eventually replaced by the loanword sutēki.|$|R
50|$|After 3 {{years without}} a {{recording}} contract, <b>former</b> <b>Word</b> Records executive James Bullard signed Winans to Intersound Records, an Atlanta-based classical recording label, {{for which he was}} forming a gospel music division. Her label debut Vickie Winans rose to #10 on the gospel charts, spawning the hits Work It Out and We Shall Behold Him. However, she developed nodes on her vocal cords, causing her to fail to hit all the right notes in her re-recording of We Shall Behold Him.|$|R
2500|$|When Seonjo asked Jeong who [...] "the other officials" [...] were, Jeong {{replied that}} it was Jeong Cheol and the Yun Dugu brothers, {{who were at the}} time the sole Westerners in court. Yi I was angered that Jeong had changed the words of his advice, forcing Jeong to revoke his <b>former</b> <b>words</b> by saying that though Jeong Cheol had done much wrong, he did not create a faction. He then retired to his hometown, causing the Easterners to be furious at Yi I.|$|R
5000|$|The Anjana (Cantabrian: (Western) anˈhana, (Eastern)an.xa.nɜ; [...] ) (from jana, a <b>former</b> <b>word</b> for witches {{during the}} Middle Ages) {{are one of}} the best known fairies of Cantabrian mythology. These female fairy creatures foil the cruel and {{ruthless}} Ojáncanu. In most stories, they are the good fairies of Cantabria, generous and protective of all people. Their depiction in the Cantabrian mythology is reminiscent of the lamias in ancient Greek mythology, as well as the xanas in Asturias, the janas in León, and the lamias in Basque Country, the latter without the zoomorphic appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Mrs. Renuka Patekar [...] - She {{the wife}} of Virendra Patekar [...] She also loves poetry and speaks long and {{complicated}} Sanskrit words, and meaningless loops of words which form another words with only literary, not logical relation to her <b>former</b> <b>words.</b> Her sentences always result in Pratibha Upasani saying [...] "Matlab??" [...] (What do you mean??) which is answered by [...] "Urmila Trivedi". She often quote [...] "Maha Kavi Shr Ramakant Doiphode ne bhi kaha hai ke" [...] in her poems. They both have a daughter Mrinmai.|$|R
5000|$|The battle progressed largely {{according}} to Nelson's plan. At 11:45, Nelson sent the famous flag signal, [...] "England expects that every man will do his duty" [...] He had instructed his signal officer, Lieutenant John Pasco, to {{signal to the}} fleet the message [...] "England confides is confident that every man will do his duty." [...] Pasco suggested to Nelson that expects be substituted for confides, since the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> was in the signal book, whereas confides {{would have to be}} spelt out letter-by-letter; Nelson agreed to the change.|$|R

30|$|One {{reviewer}} {{thinks that}} the additive hai can appear before haoxiang. After checking BLCU, {{there are much more}} examples with the additive hai following haoxiang than those with the reverse order. Besides, for the native speakers that I consulted, the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> order is preferred over the latter one, and more importantly, in either order, haoxiang is interpreted as taking a wide scope. This means that hoaxing always scopes over the additive hai regardless of their surface order. Accordingly, I suggest that hai is located below haoxiang, and the reverse order may result from other reasons, like the performance factors.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{awareness}} and opinion survey on Carbon Capture Storage was conducted {{a representative sample}} of French aged 15 years and above. About 6 % of respondents were able to define the technology. The key question about ‘approval or opposition to’ the use of CCS in France was asked twice, first after presenting technology, then exposing potential adverse consequences. Approval rates, 59 % and 38 %, show that opinion is not anchored, but there no a priori rejection. Using ‘Storage’ instead of ‘Sequestration’ had no significant effect on approval rates, but the <b>former</b> <b>word</b> is more meaningful...|$|R
