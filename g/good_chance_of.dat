5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These weapons were slow to reload, so {{to ensure that the}} castle would have a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary had a very <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 but critics {{considered}} England {{to have a}} <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by fibrositis which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed {{early in the second}} innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain {{for the remainder of the}} series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Krichell is {{considered}} one of the greatest scouts in baseball history. Birdie Tebbetts, a member of the Veterans Committee in the 1980s, led a campaign to have Krichell, along with fellow scouts Charlie Barrett and Hugh Alexander, inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Under Hall of Fame rules, scouts are not eligible for induction. Tibbets appealed to the Hall of Fame Board of Directors every year from 1981 to 1986 to make the three scouts members of the Hall of Fame, but with no success. In The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, James awards the Paul Krichell Talent Scout Award to an example of a team that has a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> signing a player who later becomes a star, who they end up passing on as the result of poor scouting.|$|E
5|$|When Ernst Lindemann {{returned}} to Germany, it was uncertain {{whether he could}} remain on active military service. As {{a result of the}} Treaty of Versailles which was signed on 28 June 1919, the former Imperial German Navy was downsized to 15,000 men, including 1,500 officers, while being renamed the Reichsmarine in the era of the Weimar Republic. As Lindemann had finished fifth in the Class of 1913, he stood a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being retained. He served temporarily in the Dahlem Protection Company a part of the Protection Regiment of Greater Berlin (June–July 1919), before he became adjutant to the newly created chief of the Naval Command Department (1 August 1919 – 30 September 1922), at the time under the command of William Michaelis. The Naval Command Department was directly subordinated to the Admiralty Staff. At the same time, he held the position of adjutant in the Fleet Department. During this assignment Lindemann was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See (Sub-Lieutenant) on 7 January 1920.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would have a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention {{in the hope that}} it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker {{in the event of a}} stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E

5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{possible}} {{defeat of the}} Jurchens threatened {{the power of the}} new emperor of the Southern Song, Gaozong and his premier Qin Hui. The reason for this was that Qinzong, the last emperor of the Northern Song was living in Jin-imposed exile in Manchuria and had a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being recalled to the throne should the Jin dynasty be destroyed. Although Yue Fei had penetrated into enemy territory as far as Luoyang, he was ordered to head back to the capital and halt his campaign. Emperor Gaozong signed the Treaty of Shaoxing in 1141 that fixed the borders at the Huai River, as well as conceded territory regained through the efforts of Yue Fei, while Yue was killed during imprisonment. As part of the treaty, the Song were also forced to pay tribute to the Jin, much as it had to the Liao. With the treaty of Shaoxing, hostilities ceased between the Jin and Song dynasties for the next two decades. In the meantime, Emperor Gaozong negotiated with the Jin over his mother's ransom while he commissioned a symbolic art project about her, the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, originally based upon the life of Cai Wenji (b. 177). Gaozong's mother was eventually released and brought south, but Qinzong was never freed from his confinement in the north.|$|E
5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} tobacco company Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being picked.|$|E

25|$|A {{continued}} lack {{of oxygen}} in the brain, hypoxia, will quickly render a person unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg. An unconscious person rescued with an airway still sealed from laryngospasm stands a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a full recovery. Artificial respiration is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point the person stands a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> recovery if attended to within minutes. More than 10% of drownings may involve laryngospasm, but {{the evidence suggests that}} it is not usually effective at preventing water from entering the trachea. The lack of water found in lungs during autopsy does not necessarily mean there was no water at the time of drowning, as small amounts of freshwater are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Hypercarbia and hypoxia both contribute to laryngeal relaxation, after which the airway is effectively open through the trachea. There is also bronchospasm and mucous production in the bronchi associated with laryngospasm, and these may prevent water entry at terminal relaxation.|$|E
