We have investigated the apparent parsec-scale <b>jet</b> <b>speeds</b> of 26 MOJAVE AGN measured by the VLBA that are in the LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS). We find that the γ-ray bright quasars have faster jets on average than the non-LBAS quasars, with a median of 15 c, and values ranging up to 34 c. The LBAS AGN in which the LAT has detected significant γ-ray flux variability generally have faster jets than the non-variable ones. These findings are in overall agreement with earlier results based on non-uniform EGRET data which suggested that γ-ray bright AGN have preferentially higher Doppler boosting factors than other blazar jets. However, the relatively low LAT detection rates for the full MOJAVE sample (24 %) and previously-known MOJAVE EGRET-detected blazars (43 %) imply that Doppler boosting is not the sole factor that determines whether a particular AGN is bright at γ-ray energies. The slower apparent <b>jet</b> <b>speeds</b> of LBAS BL Lac objects and their higher overall LAT detection rate as compared to quasars suggest that the former are being detected by Fermi because of their higher intrinsic (unbeamed) γ-ray to radio luminosity ratios...|$|R

These five blazars all belong to the class of high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs), which {{are the most common}} blazar type detected at the TeV energy range. Because of their relative faintness in the radio, these HBLs are not well represented in other radio blazar surveys. Our observations consist of five epochs of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) imaging from 2006 to 2009, of each of the five blazars 1 ES 1101 - 232, Markarian 180, 1 ES 1218 + 304, PG 1553 + 113, and H 2356 - 309, at frequencies from 5 to 22 GHz. Fundamental jet properties, including the apparent <b>jet</b> <b>speeds,</b> that can be measured from these multi-epoch series of VLBA images are presented and compared with other gamma-ray blazars. Confirming prior work, we find that the TeV HBLs have significantly slower apparent <b>jet</b> <b>speeds</b> than radio-selected blazars. Together with other radio properties of the HBL class, this suggests modest Lorentz factors in their parsec-scale radio jets.

40|$|Radio {{galaxies and}} quasars produce collimated, {{relativistic}} flows with. Lorentz factors {{of at least}} 15. It is generally believed that such flow Velocities indicate that jet acceleration and collimation occurs in the relativistic environment of a supermassive black hole. Recently, several groups {{around the world have}} begun to test theories of jet formation using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of magnetized gas flow around black holes. This paper reviews the field of simulations of MHD jet formation, with an emphasis on producing the observed <b>jet</b> <b>speeds</b> and on the role that black hole angular momentum might play. <b>Jet</b> <b>speeds</b> are expected to be of order the escape velocity in the jet-formation region (bulk Lorentz factor similar to 2. 4 if in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole), but could be potentially much higher if rapid acceleration can occur near the hole in less than a dynamical time. Transient simulations often produce tightly-collimated jets, but in a steady state jet collimation is generally quite slow and broad. Regardless of the source of the rotational energy powering the jet (accretion disc or black hole spin), the total jet power should be proportional to the black hole mass and the accretion rate. When the type of accretion disc is taken into account, it is shown that the most powerful jets should occur when the black hole is rotating rapidly and when the accretion disc is geometrically. thick and hot. The implications of this modified spin paradigm for explaining phenomenological properties of both supermassive and stellar mass black hole systems is discussed...|$|R
