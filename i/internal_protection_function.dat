Here, we present a new and practical porous membrane with three-dimension (3 D) heat-resistant skeleton and high curvature pore structure as a promising separator candidate to facilitate advances in battery safety and performances beyond those obtained from the conventional separators. The unique material properties combining with the well-developed structural characteristics enable the 3 D porous skeleton to own several favorable properties, including superior thermal stability, good wettability with liquid electrolyte, high ion conductivity and <b>internal</b> short-circuit <b>protection</b> <b>function,</b> etc. which give rise to acceptable battery performances.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the problem of}} the risk of an unnecessary tripping of a generation unit’s underimpedance <b>protection</b> <b>functions</b> in circumstances of generator power swings following elimination of long-lasting fault in the external power grid. The fi rst part describes typical solutions of a generator impedance <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> (21 e) and unit distance <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> (21 s). Starting characteristics of these <b>protection</b> <b>functions</b> are shown, as well as their typical operating logics and ways of calculating their settings.

Following this introduction, the issues of the threat of unnecessary operation of fast-tripping protection zones of 21 e and 21 s <b>protection</b> <b>functions</b> are described, which arises in the circumstances of generator asynchronous power swings occurring after elimination of long-lasting faults in the grid supplied by the power unit.

40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 The {{rotor shaft}} of a {{synchronous}} machine can experience severe mechanical stress due to torque pulsations during a pole-slip condition. All pole-slip protection relays {{currently on the}} market use the impedance pole-slip protection method to detect a pole-slip. No commercial relay currently available can predict accurately when a generator is about to experience a damaging pole-slip. All the relays will only trip a generator after it has pole-slipped one or more times. Severe mechanical damage could be caused to a machine after only one pole-slip. It is therefore essential to enhance pole-slip protection relays {{to such an extent}} that it can trip a generator before it pole slips. The proposed pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> must predict when a generator will become unstable during a network fault. As soon as instability is predicted, the generator must be tripped before the fault is cleared to avoid damaging post-fault torque effects. Conventional impedance pole-slip protection methods are are also discussed and the shortcomings of impedance pole-slip protection are investigated. The new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> was designed by using PSCAD. Detailed PSCAD simulations on different network configurations proved that the new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> will trip a generator before a damaging pole-slip occurs. The new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> was also implemented on an ABB REM 543 multifunctional protection relay and tested on a RTDS. The concept of the new pole-slip function was successfully demonstrated on the protection relay. The operation of conventional impedance scheme relays was compared with the proposed pole-slip function for different fault conditions. Although the new pole-slip <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> is more complex than the existing impedance functions, it was concluded that similar skills are required to test and commission the new <b>protection</b> <b>function.</b> The new pole-slip function outperforms the impedance protection methods, since the new <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> can trip the generator before it pole-slips.

40|$|Abstract Background Effective health {{protection}} requires systematised responses with clear accountabilities. In England, Primary Care Trusts and the Health Protection Agency both have statutory responsibilities for {{health protection}}. A Memorandum of Understanding identifies responsibilities of both parties, {{but there is}} a potential lack of clarity about responsibility for specific health <b>protection</b> <b>functions.</b> We aimed to investigate professionals' perceptions of responsibility for different health <b>protection</b> <b>functions,</b> to inform future guidance for, and organisation of, health protection in England. Methods We sent a postal questionnaire to all health protection professionals in England from the following groups: (a) Directors of Public Health in Primary Care Trusts; (b) Directors of Health Protection Units within the Health Protection Agency; (c) Directors of Public Health in Strategic Health Authorities and; (d) Regional Directors of the Health Protection Agency Results The response rate exceeded 70 %. Variations in perceptions of who should be, and who is, delivering health <b>protection</b> <b>functions</b> were observed within, and between, the professional groups (a) -(d). Concordance in views of which organisation should, and which does deliver was high (≥ 90 %) for 6 of 18 health <b>protection</b> <b>functions,</b> but much lower (≤ 80 %) for 6 other functions, including managing the implications of a case of meningitis out of hours, of landfill environmental contamination, vaccination in response to mumps outbreaks, nursing home infection control, monitoring sexually transmitted infections and immunisation training for primary care staff. The proportion of respondents reporting that they felt confident most or all of the time in the safe delivery of a health <b>protection</b> <b>function</b> was strongly correlated with the concordance (r = 0. 65, P = 0. 0038). Conclusion Whilst we studied professionals' perceptions, rather than actual responses to incidents, our study suggests that there are important areas of health protection where consistent understanding of responsibility for delivery is lacking. There are opportunities to clarify the responsibility for health protection in England, perhaps learning from the approaches used for those health <b>protection</b> <b>functions</b> where we found consistent perceptions of accountability. </p...|$|R
