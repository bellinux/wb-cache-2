40|$|A {{collection}} of resistors with two possible resistivities is considered. This paper investigates the overall or macroscopic {{behavior of a}} square two–dimensional lattice of such resistors when each type is present in fixed proportion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lattice. The macroscopic behavior is that of an anisotropic conductor at the continuum level and {{the goal of the}} paper is to describe the set of all possible such conductors. This is thus a problem <b>of</b> bounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> <b>of</b> an abundant literature on <b>the</b> topic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> continuum case. The originality of the paper is that the investigation focusses on the interplay between homogenization and the passage from a discrete network to a continuum. A set of bounds is proposed and its optimality is shown when the proportion of each resistor on the discrete lattice is 1 2. We conjecture that the derived bounds are optimal for all proportions. Keywords: Γ–convergence, lattice, resistor network, homogenization, bounds, optimality. ...|$|R
40|$|Most of <b>the</b> people <b>in</b> {{developing}} countries live {{in rural areas}} and depend on subsistence farming. Otherwise fertile areas {{are not able to}} feed the population because of century old farming techniques and technology. The small industry existing is basically on light industries based on simple labour intensive technologies that are unable to compete internationally in terms of quality and price. The productivity of labour is very low because of low level of skills. Illiteracy is a major problem. As a result, many {{developing countries}} are in a very poor economic shape. They have tried to follow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrialised countries to ameliorate their situation with out avail. If you see the African continent the view is depressing.

50|$|Following <b>in</b> <b>the</b> populist <b>footsteps</b> <b>of</b> Affandi, Kartika {{also has}} a long history of {{painting}} rural and dispossessed people such as fishermen, farmers, workers and beggars. Since these individuals pose while interacting with her and exchanging life histories as she paints, these must be considered portraits. Although narrative, her paintings when viewed close up dissolve into strong, abstract statements in energetically applied impasto oils. Kartika's work ranges from the sweet and idyllic to an expressive realism that can be harsh. The latter is evident in her paintings of beggars, handicapped people and suffering animals and in her uncompromising depiction of the progress of old age, whether painting a stranger, her father, or herself.|$|R
