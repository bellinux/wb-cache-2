We deduce the expected size of the largest vulnerable component, a network's tinderbox-like critical mass, {{as well as the}} probability that infecting a randomly chosen individual seed will trigger <b>global</b> <b>spreading.</b> In the appropriate limits, our results naturally reduce to standard ones for models of disease spreading and to the condition for the existence of a giant component. Recent advances in the distributed, infinite seed case allow us to further determine the final size of <b>global</b> <b>spreading</b> events, when they occur. To provide support for our results, we derive exact expressions for key spreading quantities for a simple yet rich family of random networks with bimodal degree distributions.

40|$|Poster Sessions: no. P- 76 BACKGROUND: Recent {{outbreaks}} of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), including SARS, pandemic influenza, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and Zika virus, have caused substantial health and economic burden. Large-scale computational models parameterized with worldwide air network (WAN) and populations {{have been the}} mainstream tool for studying <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of EIDs since the 1980 s. In addition to advanced global epidemic simulators such as GLEAM, recent analytical studies have partially revealed how epidemic arrival time (EAT) for different populations in the WAN depends on epidemic parameters and the network features of the WAN. Our objective is to explicitly characterize the dynamics underlying <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of EIDs. METHOD: We developed a novel probabilistic framework based on nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NPP) to characterize <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of EIDs. Specifically, our framework entails (i) modelling exportations of cases from the epidemic origin as NPPs; (ii) accounting for the effect of high outgoing air traffic (the ‘hub-effect’) and continuous seeding on local epidemic growth rate and mobility rate; (iii) modeling the effect of multiple paths using superposition of NPPs. To verify the accuracy of our framework, we developed a stochastic global epidemic simulator comprising more than 3, 000 airports and 30, 000 flight connections. RESULTS: Comparing the simulated EAT with the analytically derived EAT, we showed that our analytical framework can provide very good estimates of EAT for almost all populations in the WAN. CONCLUSION: We reveal that the EATs in WAN-based global meta-population models can be analytically measured with high accuracy from the epidemiologic and network parameters. In pursuit for analytical insights, we explicitly characterize how the dynamics of <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of EIDs depend on the underlying epidemiologic and network properties...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{models that}} {{describe}} the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> {{of infectious diseases}} such as influenza, {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) often consider a sample of international airports as a network supporting disease spread. However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, {{a relatively small number of}} areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such a...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The recent {{emergence}} of hypervirulent subtypes of avian influenza has underlined the potentially devastating effects of pandemic influenza. Were such a virus {{to acquire the}} ability to spread efficiently between humans, control would almost certainly be hampered by limited vaccine supplies unless <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> could be substantially delayed. Moreover, the large increases {{that have occurred in}} international air travel might be expected to lead to more rapid global dissemination than in previous pandemics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To evaluate the potential of local control measures and travel restrictions to impede global dissemination, we developed stochastic models of the international spread of influenza based on extensions of coupled epidemic transmission models. These models {{have been shown to be}} capable of accurately forecasting local and <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> of epidemic and pandemic influenza. We show that under most scenarios restrictions on air travel are likely to be of surprisingly little value in delaying epidemics, unless almost all travel ceases very soon after epidemics are detected. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce local transmission of influenza are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of <b>global</b> <b>spread</b> and less vulnerable to implementation delays than air travel restrictions. Nevertheless, under the most plausible scenarios, achievable delays are small compared with the time needed to accumulate substantial vaccine stocks...|$|R
