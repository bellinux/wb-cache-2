Due to transfer rules, Pollard was forced to sit out the 1949 season, and he enrolled at Rutherford Preparatory School to pass West Point's entrance exam. While at Army, {{he was known to}} focus his attention mainly on football, and not care much for academics. Gil Reich, his roommate at West Point, noted that he and several other friends of Pollard frequently <b>helped</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> so as to not see anyone drop out.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{veterans}} moved in, they formed the Oak Hill Park Association (OHPA), which {{dealt with the}} city and developers, published a monthly newsletter and became the dominant social and political force in the community.

They put on shows and plays, had block parties and barbecues, and would always be available to help one another.

25|$|Regardless {{the type}} of patrol, a night march would {{normally}} {{be made to the}} area.

The civilians were not regarded as hostiles by the troops. There were numerous occasions when they <b>helped</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and process of great empathy took place. If a patrol learned of enemy presence the patrol force immediately moved to engage the enemy. On occasions the patrols were ambushed. Patrols in Mozambique were considered the most hazardous, due to the violent reaction of FRELIMO (also known as FPML).|$|E

25|$|By her own account, Casco {{began working}} with women's groups around 1946, mainly because she {{had the support of}} her brother Adolfo. While as a woman she had no real {{political}} power, she felt she had been less marginalized than others. Initially, women <b>helped</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with social service needs, but in 1953, she and other professional women founded the Intituto Cultural de Amparo a la Mujer (Cultural Institute of Refuge for Women). Made up primarily of teachers, with a few doctors and lawyers, their objective was to counsel women and assist them in overcoming societal impediments, such as poor pay, discrimination, poverty, lack of health care, though at times they provided material support. They also attempted to refer women to other benevolent associations that {{might be able to help}} them. In 1954, a coup d'etat brought the dictator Alfredo Stroessner to power and within two years, he issued a decree banning the Institute and placing the women who organized it on lists of suspicious persons. The group did not disband, but instead transformed into the Women's Department of the Liberal Party, though in fact, the Liberal Party was still an illegal organization, as the one-party state was limited to the Colorado Party. Women were not allowed to run for office or participate in any decision-making process. Instead they performed benevolent works, visiting prisoners, raising money, hosting meetings and providing food for functions.|$|E

After having <b>helped</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to find {{the essence of the}} spiritual life, their friendship remained. In many sutras they show high appreciation and kindness to one another. For example, when Śāriputra falls ill, it is described that Maudgalyāyana used his psychic powers to obtain medicine for Śāriputra [...] Śāriputra was considered the wisest disciple of the Buddha, but Maudgalyāyana was second to him in wisdom. The one thing that gave them a strong bond as spiritual friends was the love for the Buddha, which both expressed often.|$|E
2500|$|Although sceptical of the Rosicrucian Order, Gardner got on {{well with}} a group of {{individuals}} inside the group who were [...] "rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves." [...] Gardner's biographer Philip Heselton theorised that this group consisted of Edith Woodford-Grimes (1887–1975), Susie Mason, her brother Ernie Mason, and their sister Rosetta Fudge, all of whom had originally come from Southampton before moving to the area around Highcliffe, where they joined the Order. According to Gardner, [...] "unlike many of the others , [...] had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult". Gardner became [...] "really very fond of them", remarking that he [...] "would have gone through hell and high water even then for any of them." [...] In particular he grew close to Woodford-Grimes, being invited over to her home to meet her daughter, and the two <b>helped</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with their writing, Woodford-Grimes probably assisting Gardner edit A Goddess Arrives prior to publication. Gardner would subsequently give her the nickname [...] "Dafo", for which she would become better known.|$|E

Newsweek magazine in 2006 made reference to Leibovitz's decade-plus relationship with Sontag, stating, [...] "The two first met in the late '80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket.

Leibovitz has suggested that Sontag mentored her and constructively criticized her work.

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} developed simultaneously with the previous Zero Escape game, Virtue's Last Reward, with the two games being [...] "paired as a set", and with Virtue's Last Reward having a cliffhanger ending. With Zero Time Dilemma, Uchikoshi intended to resolve all mysteries left from the previous game, {{as well as all}} introduced in the third, while also attempting to make the story enjoyable for first-time players. This was used as a [...] "basic framework" [...] to write the story within. In addition to figuring out how to explain the mysteries while avoiding contradictions with Virtue's Last Reward, they added side stories to the narrative to give it [...] "a little extra punch". They also took the time-travel ability some characters in Virtue's Last Reward have into consideration, as it opened up for more narrative possibilities. Uchikoshi worked with two other writers; the three <b>helped</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> come up with ideas and figure out the best ways to make the story work. When coming up with the story, he knew from the start that he wanted Sigma, Phi and Diana to be on one team, and Akane on another; this left open slots in the teams, which were filled with other characters as story development progressed. The script took one year to write. While Uchikoshi had already had an idea for the setting and events of Zero Time Dilemma when writing Virtue's Last Reward, the game structure changed when the time came to implement it. One reason was that characters [...] "take on {{a life of their own}} and make their own decisions" [...] when he writes from their point of view, and that characters might pull the story in a different direction than he had originally planned; most of the time, he would let the story go where the characters want to go rather than forcing it to follow his original plans, leading to changes in story and structure. The budget partly dictated the game's setting in an enclosed space as it required few art assets to develop.|$|E
