The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in {{the fact that she had}} never had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E

25|$|Each Veda {{has been}} subclassified into four major text types – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies such as newborn baby's rites of passage, coming of age, marriages, {{retirement}} and cremation, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), the Brahmanas (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices), and the Upanishads (text discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge).

Witzel notes that the rituals, rites and ceremonies described in these ancient texts reconstruct {{to a large degree}} the Indo-European marriage rituals observed in a region spanning the Indian subcontinent, Persia and the <b>European</b> <b>area,</b> and some greater details are found in the Vedic era texts such as the Grhya Sūtras.|$|E

60|$|Thus I am led {{to think}} that by far the {{simplest}} and most rational mode of accounting for the great change {{which took place in}} the living inhabitants of the <b>European</b> <b>area</b> {{at the end of the}} Mesozoic epoch, is the supposition that it arose from a vast alteration of the physical geography of the globe; whereby an area long tenanted by Cainozoic forms was brought into such relations with the <b>European</b> <b>area</b> that migration from the one to the other became possible, and took place on a great scale.|$|E

60|$|For {{thousands}} of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals that the <b>European</b> <b>area</b> had ever seen; and then some thirty or thirty-five thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of kindred beings, more intelligent, knowing more, talking and co-operating together, came drifting into the Neanderthaler's world from the south. They ousted the Neanderthalers from their caves and squatting places; they hunted the same food; they probably made war upon their grisly predecessors and killed them off. These newcomers from the south or the east--for at present {{we do not know}} their region of origin--who at last drove the Neanderthalers out of existence altogether, were beings of our own blood and kin, the first True Men. Their brain-cases and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the same as our own. In a cave at Cro-Magnon and in another at Grimaldi, a number of skeletons have been found, the earliest truly human remains that are so far known.|$|E
