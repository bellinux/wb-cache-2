40|$|We used {{electrophysiological}} and {{electron spin}} resonance (e. s. r.) techniques to study the mechanism of the protective effect of <b>darodipine</b> on rat isolated cardiomyocytes exposed to an exogenous source of oxygen free radicals (OFR). The L-type calcium current (ICa,L), action potential and cell shortening were measured in patch-clamped cells in the whole-cell configuration. ICa,L blockade by <b>darodipine</b> was concentration-dependent, peak current being reduced by 20 % with 50 [*]nM and by 58 % with 100 [*]nM <b>darodipine.</b> The lowest concentration of <b>darodipine</b> did not affect action potential or twitch profile. Exposure to OFR-generating solution (5 [*]mM dihydroxyfumarate, DHF) caused the appearance of electrophysiological alterations and/or spontaneous activity in 73 % of cells (n= 26) within 5 [*]min; action potential duration (APD) was prolonged (195 ± 16 [*]ms vs 140 ± 6 [*]ms in the control) and maximum diastolic potential (MDP) was reduced (− 59. 5 ± 2. 6 [*]mV vs − 69. 8 ± 0. 8 [*]mV in the control) (P< 0. 05, n= 25). A 2 [*]min pretreatment with 50 [*]nM <b>darodipine</b> significantly reduced the incidence of these arrhythmogenic events following a 5 [*]min exposure to OFR (36 % of cells, n= 14; P< 0. 05 vs nonpretreated cells). Pretreatment with <b>darodipine</b> also prevented APD prolongation caused by OFR (137 ± 12 [*]ms after DHF vs 117 ± 6 [*]ms before DHF n= 14, not significant) but not the decrease of MDP (− 63. 4 ± 2. 5 [*]mV after DHF vs − 70. 9 ± 1. 0 [*]mV before DHF, P< 0. 05). The e. s. r. spectra obtained from the DHF-DMPO solution {{in the absence of}} <b>darodipine</b> demonstrated the presence of two components corresponding to two DMPO adducts. The addition of <b>darodipine</b> (50 – 500 [*]nM) led to a concentration-dependent decrease in intensity of the signals, the intensity of the DMPO-COO. − adduct being decreased more than that of the DMPO-OH. adduct. Our results demonstrate that <b>darodipine</b> dose-depentently blocks ICa,L in rat isolated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore it exerts protective effects against free-radical-induced electrophysiological alterations independently of its calcium antagonistic properties; this effect is possibly due to trapping of specific radical species...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of aging and}} of treatment with the dihydropyridine Ca 2 + antagonist <b>darodipine</b> (PY 108 - 068) on the age-related microanatomical changes of rat brain were studied in male Wistar rats treated from the 18 th to the 24 th month of age with an oral dose of 5 mg/kg/day of <b>darodipine.</b> Twelve-month-old untreated rats were used as an adult reference group. A decreased number of nerve cells and of alkaline phosphatase-positive capillaries and an increased lipofuscin deposition were observed in the frontal and occipital cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellar cortex of rats of 24 months in comparison with 12 -month-old animals. The number of nerve cells was higher in the occipital cortex and in the hippocampus, {{but not in the}} frontal cortex and in the cerebellar cortex, of darodipine-treated rats in comparison with age-matched untreated animals. Lipofuscin deposition is reduced in all the brain areas investigated. The density of alkaline phosphatase-reactive capillaries is also increased in the frontal and occipital cortex and in the hippocampus of aged rats treated with <b>darodipine.</b> The above results suggest that treatment with <b>darodipine</b> is able to counter some microanatomical changes occurring in the brain of aged rats and involving not only microvascular parameters. The occipital (visual) cortex and the hippocampus were the cerebral areas more sensitive to treatment with <b>darodipine.</b> The possible relevance of these findings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{treatment}} with the dihydropyridine Ca+ 2 antagonist <b>darodipine</b> (PY 108 - 068) on age-related {{changes in the}} cerebral capillary network was studied using alkaline phosphatase histochemistry with quantitative image analysis. The investigation was performed on male Wistar rats of 12 months (adult reference group) and 27 months. The 27 -month-old rats consisted of two groups, the first of control untreated animals and the second of rats receiving an oral dose of 5 mg/kg/day of <b>darodipine</b> from the 21 st to the 27 th month. The cerebral areas examined included the frontal cortex, the occipital cortex, Ammon's horn of the hippocampus, and the dentate gyrus. The number and {{the average length of}} alkaline phosphatase-positive capillaries were decreased in old rats, when compared with adult rats. The intercapillary distance, which is considered as a sensitive parameter for capillary density was increased in aged rats in comparison to adult rats. The capillary diameter was increased slightly or unchanged in old rats. The Ammon's horn and the frontal cortex were the cerebral areas most affected by age-dependent changes of the capillary network. Treatment with <b>darodipine</b> increased the number and the average length of alkaline phosphatase-reactive capillaries and reduced the intercapillary distance and the diameter of cerebral capillaries in old rats. The pericapillary microenvironment of the Ammon's horn was the most sensitive to treatment with <b>darodipine.</b> The above results showed that treatment with <b>darodipine</b> is capable of counteracting some microvascular changes occurring in the brain of aged rats. This suggests that the blockade of dihydropyridine-type Ca 2 + channels has a positive effect on the brain microvascular system and may counteract the impairment of pericapillary microenvironment occurring with aging...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{into the}} site of {{vasodilator}} and antivasoconstrictor activity of calcium antagonists previously performed in cats were extended to a second species, barbiturate-anaesthetized rabbits, and a second vasoconstrictor agent, vasopressin. The dihydropyridine derivative <b>darodipine</b> (code name PY 108 - 068; 10, 30 and 100 micrograms kg- 1 i. v.) showed systemic haemodynamic effects comparable to those seen in cats at half these doses. <b>Darodipine</b> effected regional vasodilatation (measured with tracer microspheres) in the heart, brain and skeletal muscles as in cats. Only the vessels of the adrenals (dilated in rabbits but not in cats), and the kidneys and skin (constricted in rabbits but not in cats) responded differently to <b>darodipine.</b> Angiotensin II (A II; 0. 15 and 1. 5 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1) constricted the same vascular beds in rabbits as in cats, namely the heart, kidneys, small intestine, pancreas, spleen, skin and arterio-venous shunts (inferred from microspheres reaching the lungs), the only exceptions being the vessels of the stomach and liver (constriction only in cats) and the adrenals (constriction only in rabbits). <b>Darodipine</b> (30 and 100 micrograms kg- 1) attenuated the A II-induced vasoconstriction in the same vascular beds in rabbits as in cats including the kidneys, which were constricted after administration of the antagonist alone. These results indicate surprisingly small species differences for the vasodilator effects of <b>darodipine</b> {{as well as the}} attenuation of the vasoconstrictor effects of A II. Lysine-vasopressin (2 and 50 mu kg- 1 min- 1) did not increase blood pressure in anaesthetized rabbits but dose-dependently lowered heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral conductance and myocardial contractile force (measured with a strain gauge). Vasopressin constricted all peripheral vascular beds dose-dependently, except for those of the kidney and liver. The effects of vasopressin persisted in the animals infused with placebo solution. <b>Darodipine</b> (30 and 100 micrograms kg- 1), but not verapamil (300 and 1000 micrograms kg- 1) reversed the vasopressin-induced cardiac depression and decrease in cardiac output. This probably also explains most of the apparent differences between the effects of the two calcium antagonists on the peripheral circulation. Both calcium antagonists diminished the vasopressin constriction in most vascular beds except those of the spleen, skin and arterio-venous shunts. Most of the effects were dose-related but not strictly competitive, as far as this can be judged based on two doses of agonist and antagonist. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of long term treatment with the dihydropyridine-type Ca 2 + antagonist <b>darodipine</b> (PY 108 - 068) on age-dependent changes in calbindin D- 28 K immunoreactivity in the cerebellar cortex of male Wistar rats was assessed. In 12 -month-old rats {{used as an}} adult reference group, specific calbindin D- 28 K immunoreactivity was found within the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons and their dendritic processes. The number of Purkinje neurons displaying calbindin D- 28 K immunoreactivity was decreased in the cerebellar cortex of aged in comparison with adult rats. The pattern of calbindin D- 28 K immunoreactivity was similar in the cerebellar cortex of 24 -month-old rats (aged), although {{a significant decrease in}} the intensity of immunoreactivity was noticeable. Treatment of aged rats with <b>darodipine</b> for 6 months increased the percentage of immunoreactive Purkinje neurons and the intensity of calbindin D- 28 K immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of Purkinje neurons. Calbindin D- 28 K is a Ca 2 + binding protein probably involved in the modulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis. The observation of a positive effect of <b>darodipine</b> treatment on calbindin D- 28 K immunoreactivity in the cerebellar cortex suggests that manipulation of dihydropyridine-type Ca 2 + channels may contribute to counter age-dependent changes of Ca 2 + homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the cardiodepressant effect of vasopressin was studied by measuring simultaneously myocardial contractile force and coronary blood flow (with tracer microspheres) in anaesthetized open-chest rabbits. Lysine-vasopressin administered at two dose levels (10 and 100 mu kg- 1 infused in 2 min with a maintenance dose of 2 mu kg- 1 min- 1 between these two loading doses) {{to a group of}} 6 rabbits caused dose-dependent myocardial depression and also severely decreased coronary blood flow in a dose-dependent manner. Blood pressure remained almost unchanged but heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral conductance were also decreased dose-dependently. In another group of 6 rabbits treated in the same way with lysine-vasopressin, <b>darodipine</b> (PY 108 - 068, 30 and 100 micrograms kg- 1) was infused intravenously. It reversed the vasopressin-induced coronary constriction and cardiodepression. The high dose of vasopressin brought back cardiac depression but did not reduce coronary blood flow below baseline values. Myocardial depression could therefore not be adequately explained by the changes in coronary blood flow. In a further group of rabbits which had been subjected to cervical vagotomy and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg kg- 1 i. v.) before the experiment, vasopressin still caused coronary constriction which was reversed by <b>darodipine,</b> but had no effect on myocardial contractile force and heart rate. The cardiodepressant effect of vasopressin can thus be explained fully by effects on the autonomic nervous system which are reversed by lowering blood pressure, whereas the severe reduction of coronary flow did not contribute to the vasopressin-induced myocardial depression...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of {{myocardial}} Ca 2 + channels {{was investigated}} for three dihydropyridines with different structural features: Ro 18 - 3981, <b>darodipine</b> (PY 108 - 068) and nifedipine. Ro 18 - 3981 contains a sulphamoyl acetyl side-chain. In voltage-clamps experiments with isolated cardiac myocytes of guinea-pig, Ro 18 - 3981 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the Ca 2 + current, which {{was influenced by}} the membrane holding potential. A markedly greater inhibition by Ro 18 - 3981 was observed when myocytes were depolarized (to + 10 mV) from a holding potential (Vh) of - 20 mV (IC 50 = 2. 3 nm) than at - 50 mV (IC 50 = 100 nM). The three dihydropyridines caused a concentration-dependent reduction in contractile force of isolated, electrically-stimulated left atria of the guinea-pig. Elevation of the extracellular K+ concentration from 5. 9 to 24 mM resulted in a significant reduction in negative inotropic IC 50 values for Ro 18 - 3981 (137 fold), <b>darodipine</b> (8 fold) and nifedipine (20 fold). The affinity of these drugs for the high-affinity (+) -[3 H]-PN 200 - 110 binding site was determined in guinea-pig cardiac membranes. The KD value of Ro 18 - 3981 (1. 0 nM) was similar to the IC 50 value for blockade of ICa at a Vh of - 20 mV (2. 3 nM), i. e. at a level of near-maximal depolarization. Thus, structurally-different dihydropyridines exert potential-dependent inhibition of myocardial Ca 2 + channel activity consistent with the modulated receptor hypothesis. These results demonstrate that blockade of myocardial excitation-contraction coupling by Ca 2 + entry blockers is also potential-dependent...|$|E
40|$|Endothelin- 1 is an endothelium-derived {{vasoconstrictor}} peptide. Its circulating {{levels are}} below those known to evoke direct vascular effects. To study whether low concentrations of endothelin- 1 potentiate {{the effects of}} other vasoconstrictor hormones, we suspended isolated human internal mammary and left anterior descending coronary artery rings in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. In mammary artery rings, the contractions to norepinephrine (3 x 10 (- 8) M) were potentiated by threshold (3 x 10 (- 10) M) and low concentrations (10 (- 9) M) of endothelin- 1 (96 +/- 35 % and 149 +/- 58 % increase from control; p less than 0. 01 and 0. 001; n = 6). The inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide formation L-NG-monomethyl arginine {{did not affect the}} potentiating effects of the peptide. The calcium antagonist <b>darodipine</b> (10 (- 7) M) prevented the potentiation of the response to norepinephrine evoked by endothelin- 1. Similarly, contractions to serotonin (10 (- 7) or 3 x 10 (- 8) M) were amplified by endothelin- 1 (3 x 10 (- 10) M) in the mammary (30 +/- 9 %) and in the coronary arteries (59 +/- 25 %). Endothelin- 1 (10 (- 9) M) further potentiated the response (57 +/- 23 % in mammary and 87 +/- 26 % in coronary arteries; p less than 0. 05; n = 7 and 3). The sensitivity of mammary arteries to calcium chloride was markedly enhanced in the presence of endothelin- 1 (3 x 10 (- 10) M; concentration shift, eightfold; p less than 0. 01; n = 5).
