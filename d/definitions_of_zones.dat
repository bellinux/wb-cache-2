40|$|The aim of {{this note}} is to {{describe}} preliminary results on assessment of land use by cattle, obtained in a pilot study using Geographic Information System (GIS). The research was carried out on a semi-natural pasture in Sweden, where the geographic positions of one cow were recorded during 25 consecutive days during summer. The cow, wearing a GPS collar, was integrated in a herd of 53 Hereford cattle. Each location point registered for the animal was considered as a sampling unit (N= 3, 097). The spatial distribution of ground declivity, water sources, cattle tracks, and classes of woody vegetation cover (forest, grassland with trees and open grassland) were recorded. The storage, processing and data analysis were carried out using the Idrisi and GS+ softwares. Three occupation zones were identified in function {{of the variation in}} the space used by the animal, which were occupied in a cyclical pattern; with the animal moving from one zone to another in cycles of five days.

A method based on fuzzy indicator model theory for <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>zones</b> with different levels of productivity is considered. Fuzzy indicator model for identification <b>of</b> <b>zones</b> with different levels of productivity is based on two general types of fuzzy indicators: the individual fuzzy indicator (IFI) type and the combined fuzzy indicator (CFI) type. IFIs are defined as a number {{in the range from}} 0 to 1, which reflect an expert concept and are modeled by an appropriate membership function. CFI is defined using fuzzy aggregated operations. The theoretical considerations are illustrated with this example based on data collected from a precision agriculture study in central Texas, USA. Soil samples were collected at different points, taking into account the actual longitude and latitude for each of these points. Because the experimental data (as in many cases) contained information only about a limited number of parameters, the calculations were restricted in this study. In this study, the parameters grain yield, total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (P) were utilized.

40|$|Abstract Using {{data from}} 27 {{seismograph}} stations {{for the period}} 1990 – 2001, we have relocated 106 hypocenters of earthquakes with magnitudes from 0. 9 to 5. 4 {{in the region of}} the southern Great Lakes. Two complementary methods were used for relocation: a conventional least-squares approach (Lienert and Havskov, 1995) and joint hypocentral determination (Pujol, 2000). These two methods yielded mutually consistent spatial patterns of seismicity with an average difference of 3. 7 km in epicentral locations and 1. 1 km in focal depths. We show that the hypocenter loca-tions are not very sensitive to realistic uncertainties in 1 D crustal velocity. Our sharp-ened <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> seismicity delineates several clusters beneath Lake On-tario, around Niagara Falls, and near the south shore of Lake Erie. These seismicity zones appear to correlate with areas where the regional magnetic data exhibit promi-nent short-wavelength (5 km) linear anomalies. The magnetic anomalies are as-sociated with basement structures that formed during the Precambrian (Mesoproter-ozoic) Grenville orogen. Both the seismicity and magnetic anomalies exhibit statistically significant preferred orientations at N 40 E–N 45 E, but the correlation of the earthquake clusters with specific aeromagnetic lineaments remains uncertain. Three preliminary focal mechanisms of earthquakes with magnitudes mN 3. 1 to 3. 8 show unusual normal faulting, with nodal planes in almost the same direction as the magnetic trends, N 42 E–N 52 E. Proximity of the earthquake clusters to large bodies of water, coupled with colinearity with magnetic anomaly trends, suggests that both surface water and pre-existing basement structures may play significant roles in con-trolling intraplate seismicity in the southern Great Lakes region...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{maritime}} joint development zones {{have emerged as}} an important means to overcome deadlock in relation to maritime jurisdictional claims. A key consideration in the negotiation and establishment of maritime joint development arrangements is the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the precise geographical area within which joint development is to proceed. This chapter reviews joint development practice with particular reference to the spatial <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> joint <b>zones.</b> This experience can be broadly divided into joint zones that have been agreed {{in addition to a}} maritime boundary line and those that have been defined {{in the absence of a}} boundary line, which have proved a more popular alternative. With respect to the latter type <b>of</b> joint <b>zone,</b> many such joint areas are determined by the limits of competing maritime claims and thus involve the joint development of disputed waters. The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> joint <b>zones</b> in this manner is often a sensitive and challenging issue. This is the case because, without prejudice clauses notwithstanding, the use of unilateral maritime claims as the limits of a joint area to an extent validates such claims, giving them practical impact and thereby a degree of endorsement and legitimacy which they may not, in fact, warrant. This has led to reluctance on the part of some States to, in a sense, recognise and accept what are regarded as excessive claims through their use in the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the limits of a maritime joint development zone. This chapter explores past experience of how this delicate issue has been dealt with. Some observations drawn from this inventory and assessment of past practice are offered, together with some preliminary considerations on the applicability of these observations to overlapping claims in the South China Sea...|$|R

40|$|A {{distributed}} or semi-distributed deterministic hydrological model {{should consider}} the hydrologically most relevant catchment characteristics. These are heterogeneously distributed within a watershed but often interrelated and subject to a certain spatial organization which results in archetypes of combined characteristics. In order to reproduce the natural rainfall–runoff response the reduction of variance of catchment properties {{as well as the}} incorporation of the spatial organization of the catchment are desirable. In this study the width-function approach is utilized as a basic characteristic to analyse the succession of catchment characteristics. By applying this technique we were able to assess the context of catchment properties like soil or topology along the streamflow length and the network geomorphology, giving indications of the spatial organization of a catchment. Moreover, this information and this technique have been implemented in an algorithm for automated sub-basin ascertainment, which included the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>zones</b> within the newly defined sub-basins.
