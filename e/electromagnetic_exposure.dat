Objective: Investigation of the associations between <b>electromagnetic</b> field <b>exposure</b> and miscarriage among women of Tehran. Materials and Methods: In this longitudinal study, 462 pregnant women with gestational age < 12 wks from seven main regions of Tehran city in Iran with similar social and cultural status were participated. Women were interviewed face-to face to collect data. Reproductive information was collected using medical file recorded in those hospitals the subjects had delivery. The measuring device measured electromagnetic waves, Narda safety test solutions with valid calibration date at the entrance door of their houses.

This work presents measurements taken near the cellular mobile towers which are situated in densely populated urban areas in India.

It was observed {{that most of the}} cellular base station antenna sites following the Indian guidelines for cellular phone radiation measurements. The average power density noted is 3479. 65 μW/m 2. A total 80 % of the power densities increase beyond 500 μW/m 2. The amplitude of <b>electromagnetic</b> field <b>exposure</b> (EMF) depends on distance, height of base station tower, number of antennas on base station tower and direction. In densely populated residential areas the line of site distance available was up to 100 m and thereafter non line of site distance exists. It is observed that line of site power density was greater than non line of site power density. The results shows that, especially in some places near the cellular base stations the power densities were more and at some other places densities were too low, it is found that there was drastic change in power density and electric field intensity everyday and by measuring the general <b>electromagnetic</b> field <b>exposure</b> one can provide this data to the agencies who were control the <b>electromagnetic</b> field <b>exposure</b> and minimize the undesirable health effects...|$|R

Pain and tolerance thresholds remained unchanged after sham exposure but signiﬁcantly decreased after <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>exposure.</b> Systolic blood pressure was signiﬁcantly higher during <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>exposure</b> and heart rate signiﬁcantly decreased, both during sham and electro- magnetic exposure, while the high frequency (150 – 400 mHz) component of heart rate variability, which is an index of parasympathetic activity, increased as expected during sham exposure but remained unchanged during <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>exposure.</b> Cortisol signiﬁcantly decreased during sham exposure only.

40|$|A hybrid mobile {{communication}} network as considered {{in this paper}} consists of a point-to-point network (UMTS) and a point-to-multipoint network (DVB-H).
