40|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} objectives for this thesis. The first {{was to develop}} a methodology and evaluation model of moisture redistribution {{in order to make the}} future relative humidity in a screeded concrete slab predictable. The second objective {{was to develop a}} method to determine the critical humidity for ion transport in concrete. Residual moisture in screeded concrete slabs may be redistributed to the top screed surface under a semi-permeable flooring, thus elevating the relative humidity, RH, and possibly exceeding the critical humidity level. Passing the critical humidity level may result in material damage to the flooring and adhesive. In order to avoid such damage there is a need of a methodology to estimate the maximum humidity obtained underneath flooring. The redistribution of residual moisture may increase the concentration of alkali at the contact area between the adhesive and concrete. This alkali increase may initiate and sustain adhesive deterioration, which is a common moisture related damage. Several screeded concrete slabs with PVC flooring were prepared to reproduce and monitor moisture distribution and the subsequent redistribution. The moisture distribution before flooring and after a certain period of redistribution is presented. In addition, sorption isotherms including scanning curves were determined in a sorption balance for materials used in the floor constructions, viz, w/c 0. 65 concrete, w/c 0. 4 concrete, w/c 0. 55 cement mortar, and Floor 4310 Fibre Flow, a self levelling <b>flooring</b> <b>compound.</b> Repeated absorption and desorption scanning curves starting from the desorption isotherm were also investigated. The measurements performed made it possible to develop both a qualitative and quantitative model of moisture redistribution and to quantify the humidity achieved under the flooring. The hysteresis phenomenon of the sorption isotherm is considered in the model. The model is well suited for estimations of the future RH underneath flooring in a screeded concrete slab and may also be used on homogeneous slabs. Results from previous research suggested that early drying of the concrete slab can mitigate the increase in relative humidity that occurs when an impermeable floor covering is installed. A study was conducted to verify these results. The results of this new study of the effects of early drying could not demonstrate any significant difference between an early and late dehydration. The redistribution of ions under different moisture conditions was investigated with a newly developed method. The method is divided into a preconditioning of test specimens and also a method to determine the redistribution of potassium ions. This preconditioning provides a well defined moisture condition of the specimen, which is important for determining the critical humidity for the transport of ions. The redistribution is detected by examining the ion content distribution before and after the preconditioning of ion species already present in the concrete. Previous research in this area has been conducted through adding chloride ions to the specimens. However, redistribution of chloride ions is impeded in that they bind to the inner pore surfaces, which poses a risk that the critical moisture level may be affected/misjudged...|$|E

The drying of cementitious materials is complex, involving several different drying processes. The conditions for each drying process change as the material changes its properties as it goes from a particle suspension in the fresh state to a fine porous material in the hardened state. The present article describes and quantifies the drying processes of cement-based self-leveling <b>flooring</b> <b>compounds</b> (SLCs) and relates them to the extent of reaction, which here is quantified by isothermal calorimetry. The relative importance of the different drying processes is discussed and a model for the drying of the SLCs is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Diffusion {{coefficients}} of three self-levelling <b>flooring</b> <b>compounds</b> (SLC) and water vapour resistance of a primer have been measured with the cup method. The {{results show that}} the diffusion coefficient is dependent not only on the vapour content (relative humidity), but also on the absolute moisture content, i. e., there is a hysteresis effect on moisture transport. At RH lower than approximately 90 %, SLC have higher diffusion coefficients than a standard concrete (w/c 0. 7 OPC), but the opposite is true at higher RH. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that SLC have different pore structure than concrete. The latter may also be an effect of the high amount of polymer in SLC that form a film throughout the material and thereby limits capillary moisture transport...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{products}} of chemical reaction {{have been at}} issue as the topic of research on Indoor Air Quality. In this study, the emission mechanism of 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol (2 E 1 H) is studied. It {{has been reported that}} 2 E 1 H at high concentrations is measured in indoor air over the long term. The emission mechanism for 2 E 1 H is considered that water with high pH in concrete slabs and self-leveling sub-floor material reacts to di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in PVC <b>flooring</b> and <b>compounds</b> containing the 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexyl group in the adhesive. It is important to clarify the 2 E 1 H emission mechanism for IAQ, because 2 E 1 H is the cause of indoor odor and sick building syndrome. In this study, PVC floorings are attached using various adhesives to a self-leveling sub-floor material that contains water, and their 2 E 1 H emission rates are measured. Furthermore, the components of the adhesives are analyzed using chemical analysis. It is found that the 2 E 1 H emission rate from the floor is affected by the type of adhesive. On the other hand, some components in the adhesives may suppress the hydrolysis of esters. The hydrolysis of polymers and residual monomers in the adhesive causes 2 E 1 H emission from the adhesive...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in the indoor environment and its connections with public health. One important topic discussed has been the relation between the moisture in buildings and health. Cementitious materials, when cast, contain excess water since this is necessary for workability and for flow properties. The pore solutions in cementitious materials, besides being high in water content, often have a high pH. High-moisture conditions can cause biological growth. A combination of high moisture conditions and high pH can also result in chemical degradation of other materials, affecting both indoor environment and the technical functioning and appearance of the materials involved. Self-levelling <b>flooring</b> <b>compounds</b> (SLCs) that provide smooth horizontal surfaces are used to level the substrates (mainly concrete slabs) before floor coverings are applied. Although such compounds are used extensively, only limited research on their moisture and alkali properties and their functioning in floor constructions has thus far been conducted. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the moisture and alkali properties of SLCs and gain a better understanding of their interaction with other materials in floor constructions. Many traditional methods of determining the moisture properties of building materials are time-consuming and are unsuitable for SLCs. Within the project, new methods, such as a rapid method for the simultaneous determination of both the moisture sorption isotherms and of diffusion coefficients, were developed. Measurements were performed of such moisture properties as the chemical binding of water, the physical binding of it (the moisture sorption isotherm), moisture transport (diffusion), and the rate of surface evaporation and of moisture transport to a concrete substrate, with the aim of better understanding the drying behaviour involved and enabling predictions of the long-term moisture state of SLCs to be obtained. The results served as the basis for a drying model that was developed into a computer-based simulation programme for predicting drying times and long-term moisture states of SLCs. Only very low rates for the transport of hydroxide ions from the concrete substrates to the SLCs and within SLCs were found to occur. This implies that SLCs can be used as barriers for protecting floor coverings and floor adhesives from the high pH of concrete. The alkaline degradation of floor adhesives is dependent upon the pH (hydroxide ion concentration) in the zone of contact of the adhesives with the substrate. Secondary emissions from a floor construction due to alkaline degradation are thus dependent upon the pH-level and the transport of hydroxide ions in the substrate. For highly alkaline substrates, such as concrete, carbonation is essential for avoiding degradation of sensitive materials. This is not the case for SLCs that have considerably lower pH. The carbonated layer at the concrete surface may, however, due to its limited thickness, be unable to serve as a long-term protection in terms of secondary emissions. This is better provided by an SLC of lower alkalinity...|$|R
40|$|The {{flame-retardant}} chemicals, which commercially find {{applications in}} rubbers, {{are considered to}} be toxic chemicals, because of the liberation of their harmful volatile by products, when rubbers are on fire.

As a result, the application of this chemical as a flame-retardant in rubbers and plastics is on the rise, at present particularly in the developed western countries.
