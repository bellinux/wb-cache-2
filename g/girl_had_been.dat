5|$|In April 1849, the Ipswich Express and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper {{reported}} on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> afflicted with fits. Her family believed that a witch was to blame, with Murrell being called in to free her of the perceived bewitchment. He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail clippings and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E
5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order {{to run for}} Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In {{the wake of the}} Tea Party movement and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2015, it was {{reported}} that the Nigerian military had reclaimed most of the areas previously controlled by Boko Haram in Nigeria including many of the camps in the Sambisa forest where it was suspected the Chibok <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> kept. Although many women <b>had</b> <b>been</b> freed, none of the Chibok <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found. [...] It {{was reported}} that some of the <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sold into slavery for N2,000 (about $10) each, others <b>had</b> <b>been</b> forcibly married to Boko Haram fighters and they may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed. Kashim Shettima, the Borno state governor said he suspected the Chibok girls were being kept in underground bunkers.|$|R

25|$|There {{were also}} {{reported}} sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements {{during the same}} time period.

The shooter was located inside with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. ERT officers provided CPR at scene until BCAS paramedics arrived, however the shooter later died.|$|E
25|$|Bridges {{spoke out}} against the {{abolition}} of slavery and he was an enemy of Methodist missionaries. There was a parliamentary enquiry into a flogging that Bridges had given to a slave as punishment for attending a Methodist meeting. The case was raised in 1830 in the British House of Commons by Henry Brougham who reported that a <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hit by Bridges, flogged by two men at Thomas(sic) Wilson Bridges' instruction. The punishment was for failing to carry out an order. She had complained but the local committee had decided by fourteen to four to take no further action.|$|E
25|$|Hirsi Ali is a {{prominent}} opponent of female genital mutilation (FGM), {{which she has}} criticized in many of her writings. When in Dutch parliament, she proposed obligatory annual medical checks for all uncircumcised girls living in the Netherlands who came from countries where FGM is practised. She proposed that if a physician found that a Dutch <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> mutilated, {{a report to the}} police would be required– with protection of the child prevailing over privacy. In 2004 she also criticized male circumcision, particularly as practiced by Jews and Muslims, which she regarded as being another variant of mutilation practiced without the consent of the individual.|$|E

25|$|Concurrently {{with the}} {{developments}} surrounding Barry's murder, a 13-year-old girl, {{known in the}} press as Binta, was allegedly raped by a uniformed paramilitary police officer (part of the Police Intervention Unit) at the Independence Stadium during an inter-schools sports competition. A medical examination confirmed that the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raped, and GAMSU again pressed the government for answers, calling for the girl {{to be allowed to}} identify the rapist. Following a long delay in any government action, GAMSU requested a police permit to hold a public protest. The request was denied, but, referring to their constitutional right to protest, GAMSU called its members {{to take part in a}} peaceful march towards the capital city of Banjul.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two days}} of these sightings, a man called police to report the {{discovery}} of a body in the river, clothed in a blue plaid shirt, lying face-down, at about 7:00 AM on December 5, 1982. This body is now presumed to be that of the adult woman. Authorities responded to the scene, located along Interstate 10, but instead came across the child's body. The sheriff who found Delta Dawn initially mistook her for his daughter, who was later found to be alive and well at his residence. Authorities immediately believed that the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thrown from the bridge to the area where her body was found, as it was blocked by weeds and it was unlikely that the girl's body had drifted to the location.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood {{had been found in}} the snow near the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school rucksack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river {{at the end of the}} street (indicating the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive. Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko who, as a teenager, had served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the blood type was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, the PTC also {{organized}} a mass advertiser {{boycott of the}} professional wrestling television program WWF SmackDown! over claims that the program caused the deaths of young children whom the PTC felt were influenced by watching the program; in particular, the PTC cited the case of Lionel Tate, a 12-year-old Ft. Lauderdale boy who was arrested after murdering a 6-year-old girl. Tate's attorney claimed that he had accidentally killed her when he botched a professional wrestling move. It was ultimately determined that the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stomped to death and had not {{been the victim of}} any professional wrestling move, and that the children were watching cartoons at the time the murder occurred. The World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE) would ultimately sue Bozell and the PTC for libel. PTC's insurance carrier eventually chose to settle the case and pay $3.5 million to the WWE and PTC issued a public apology. The same year, Bozell and the PTC appeared as the subject of criticism in the book , a memoir published by former WWF wrestler Mick Foley, who questioned the reasoning and research that the PTC used to associate SmackDown with violent acts performed by children watching the program.|$|E

500|$|The {{child was}} {{identified}} as Bella Neveah Amoroso Bond on September 18, 2015.

They stated that the <b>girl</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> [...] "taken away by the Department of Children and Families" [...] (this was later disproved). Subsequently, the neighbor told his sister that he believed that [...] "Baby Doe" [...] was Bella Bond, and she contacted authorities. One witness told authorities she grew concerned when she stopped seeing the child at her mother's apartment and when the girl's toys were disposed of. On September 17, 2015, a search warrant was executed {{at the home of}} Rachelle Bond, 40, the child's mother, in Dorchester, Massachusetts.|$|E

This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled [...] "Save Barker Cricket Now" [...] in the school community attacking the selection as a [...] "disgrace" [...] and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team. The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as [...] "gutless" [...] and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit. Ian Healy and Alex Blackwell, a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author. The emailer was also criticised, and Alyssa Healy commended, by social commentators in newspapers. In 2010, she reflected [...] "I'd do it all again...I really enjoyed playing school cricket with the boys and it definitely helped lift my skills and tighten my technique." [...] Both she and Australian teammate Ellyse Perry have publicly advocated girls playing against boys.|$|E
500|$|He {{spoke out}} {{strongly}} against the lynching of Ell Persons in 1917. Persons, {{a black man}} accused of raping and decapitating a sixteen-year-old white <b>girl,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> burned alive {{in front of a}} crowd of thousands in Memphis, and his remains dismembered, scattered, and displayed. Fineshriber called a congregational meeting to protest the lynching, convinced the membership to endorse a public condemnation of it, and acted as secretary to a group of clergymen who issued a statement decrying the practice. He also convinced the editor of Memphis's largest newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, to write an editorial criticizing the lynching. Fineshriber supported other causes affecting African-Americans; he worked to improve their housing, spoke at black churches, and helped raise funds for them. He criticized the Ku Klux Klan from his pulpit, the only clergyman in Memphis to do so. In 1921 he publicized his intention to [...] "preach on the Ku Klux Klan" [...] at Children of Israel at an event that, it was hoped, would attract many non-members. The Klan had re-organized in Memphis that year, and {{less than a month after}} Fineshriber's speech, marched publicly in Nashville's Armistice Day parade. Despite threats against him, his wife, and children, Fineshriber continued to preach against the Klan at the temple and other venues.|$|E
