During one live performance, he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was [...] "strung out" [...] because of his alleged drug problem, he got angry and said: [...] "Well by God, I'll tell you something, I have never been strung out in my life, except on music [...] [...] [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> the individual who said that about me, I’m going to break your neck, you son-of-a-bitch. I will pull your goddamn tongue out by the roots." ...|$|E
500|$|After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had {{difficulty}} {{finding a new}} subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced {{that it would be}} expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, [...] "Will we go back to it? [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A." [...] Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E

2500|$|According to RZA, {{he tries}} to have no more than 20–25% {{sampling}} on any given record, something starkly different from many other major hip hop groups. He uses [...] "the sampler more like a painter's palette than a Xerox. Then again, I might {{use it as a}} Xerox <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> rare beats that nobody had in their crates yet". He played much of the piano himself, with Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk as major influences; for instance, he created the piano part to [...] "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" [...] after watching the Thelonious Monk documentary, Straight, No Chaser.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I have to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E

Then the French in turn {{addressed}} {{the same questions}} to the Spaniards, to which Menéndez himself replied: [...] "I am Captain-General of the fleet of the King of Spain, and I am come into this country to hang and behead all Lutherans I may find by land or sea, {{and in the morning}} I will board your ships; and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> any Catholics they will be well treated; but all who are heretics shall die." [...] In the silence which prevailed while the parley was in progress, those aboard his ship heard a boat put out from one of the Frenchmen, carrying a message to their flagship and the reply of the French commander, [...] "I am the Admiral, I will die first," [...] from which they inferred that it was a proposition to surrender.|$|E
2500|$|.....my Way is, {{to divide}} half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one Pro, {{and over the}} other Con. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the {{different}} Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> a Reason pro equal to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons con equal to some three Reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.|$|E
