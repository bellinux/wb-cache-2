Methods Methods included analysis of routine data, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and administration of a structured questionnaire. Results Providers modified exemptions policy <b>implementation</b> <b>arrangements,</b> sometimes giving partial or no exemptions. Clients who knew or suspected exemption entitlements failed to request them because of fear of negative reactions from providers. Providers attributed their modification of <b>implementation</b> <b>arrangements</b> and negative reactions to the threat posed to the financial viability of their institutions by reimbursement uncertainty and delays. At {{the time of the}} study insurance coverage was low and frontline workers were not noticeably modifying <b>implementation</b> <b>arrangements.</b> However, the underlying goal conflicts, resource scarcity, conditions of work and relationships between frontline workers and clients that fueled the exemptions policy implementation gaps were unchanged. The potential for the health insurance policy to stumble over implementation gaps as happened with the exemptions policy therefore remained. Conclusions Policies that do not take into account the incentives for frontline worker adherence and align them better with policy objectives may experience implementation gaps.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{approach}} to successful KM implementation by understanding the dynamics among various knowledge management barriers (KMBs) that hinder the implement of KM in organisations. Using interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the research presents a hierarchy-based model and the mutual relationship among the KMBs. The research shows that there is a group of KMBs having high driving power and low dependence which require maximum attention and are of strategic importance. Another group consists of those KMBs which have high dependence and low driving power which necessitate the resultant actions. This categorisation provides a useful tool to top management to differentiate between independent and dependent KMBs and their mutual relationships which would help them to focus on those key KMBs that are most significant for effective KM <b>implementation.</b> <b>Arrangement</b> of KMBs in a hierarchy and the categorisation into driver and dependent categories is an exclusive effort in the area of KM implementation.
