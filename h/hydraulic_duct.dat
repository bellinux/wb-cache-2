40|$|The work {{covers the}} vapour- and gas-liquid {{mixtures}} of different {{structure in the}} channel under action on the intensive shock loading. The aim {{of the work is}} to investigate the dynamics of the wave flows and vibrational processes in such a system. The physical-mathematical models describing the vibrational processes in the hydraulic line with gas hollow and propagation of the shock waves in the vapour-liquid medium of the bubble and slug structure have been developed. The investigation results revealed the pressure amplification effects at natural and forced vibrations in the gas-liquid system and also at propagation of the shock waves in the liquid with decreasing concentration of the vapour bubbles and in the vapour-liquid medium of the slug structure. The influence of the liquid compressibility and relative gas volume on the pressure amplification in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>duct</b> with gas hollow has been studied firstly; the efficiency of the resonance condition of the forced vibrations in this system for creating hogh-speed pulsating spray of the liquid has been shown.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} inside {{rectangular}} intake air duct of 300 MW lignite {{coal-fired power plant}} is investigated in order to analyze and reduce overall inlet system pressure drop. The system consists of the 45 -degree inlet elbow, the flow instrument, the 90 -degree mitered elbow and fans, respectively. The energy loss in each section can be determined by Bernoulli’s equation and ASHRAE standard table. Hence, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is {{used in this study}} based on Navier-Stroke equation and the standard k-epsilon turbulence modeling. Input boundary condition is 175 kg/s mass flow rate inside the 11 -m 2 cross sectional duct. According to the inlet air flow rate, the Reynolds number of airstream is 2. 7 x 106 (based on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>duct</b> diameter), thus the flow behavior is turbulence. The numerical results are validated with the real operation data. It is found that the numerical result agrees well with the operating data, and dominant loss occurs at the flow rate measurement device. Normally, the air flow rate is measured by the airfoil and it gets high pressure drop inside the duct. To overcome this problem, the airfoil is planned to be replaced with the other type measuring instrument, such as the average pitot tube which generates low pressure drop of airstream. The numerical result in case of average pitot tube shows that the pressure drop inside the inlet airstream duct is decreased significantly.

40|$|A {{rotating}} {{cooling system}} with a 180 deg turn is investigated experimentally using the 2 C PIV technique to measure the flow inside. This cooling configuration consists of two ducts of arbitrary cross-sections representing a two-pass front part of an idealized but nevertheless engine relevant turbine blade cooling design. The system has been investigated with ribbed walls in both passages for cooling enhancement {{as well as with}} smooth walls as a reference version in order to identify the effects induced by ribs. The rib orientation on the walls is 45 deg. With a rib height of 0. 1 of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>duct</b> diameter and a pitch of 10 times rib height, a representative well-established rib lay-out was selected. This paper presents measurements of the axial flow during rotation of this two-pass system for rotation numbers up to 0. 1. Together with previously obtained stationary results, this data completes the investigation of the secondary flow field with rotational results acquired with a two-component PIV measuring technique with improved sequencer technique. The Two-Pass Cooling System was analyzed on the rotating test rig using two-component Particle Image Velocimetry (2 C PIV) a non-intrusive optical planar measurement technique. PIV is capable of obtaining complete flow maps of the instantaneous as well as averaged flow field even at high turbulence levels, which are typical for the narrow serpentine-shaped ribbed cooling systems. An in-house developed synchronization device enables very accurate control of the laser flashes and image acquisition with regard to the angular position of the measurement plane (light sheet) and thereby very accurately stabilizes the position of the channel within the image during PIV recording which then leads to very accurate mean velocities. The presented investigations were conducted in stationary and rotating mode. The results demonstrate the combined interaction of different vortices induced by several effects such as the inclination of ribs, Coriolis forces due to rotation and inertial forces within the bend. Additionally, a flow separation was observed at the divider wall downstream of the bend (in the second pass) that has a strong impact on the flow field depending on the rotational speed. The axial flow maps presented in this paper in combination with the secondary flow maps published previously are of sufficient high quality and spatial resolution to serve as a benchmark test case for the validation of flow solvers. The turbulent channel flow was investigated at a Reynolds number of 50, 000 and at rotation numbers of 0. 0 and 0. 1. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Staggered {{arrays of}} short cylinders, known as pin–fins, are {{commonly}} used as a heat exchange method in many applications such as cooling electronic equipment and cooling {{the trailing edge of}} gas turbine airfoils. This study investigates the near wake flow as it develops through arrays of staggered pin fins. The height-to-diame-ter ratio was unity while the transverse spacing was kept constant at two cylinder diameters. The streamwise spacing was varied between 3. 46 and 1. 73 cylinder diameters. For each geometric arrangement, experiments were conducted at Reynolds numbers of 3. 0 e 3 and 2. 0 e 4 based on cylinder diameter and velocity through the minimum flow area of the array. Time-resolved flowfield measurements provided insight into the dependence of row position, Reynolds number, and streamwise spacing. Decreasing streamwise spacing resulted in increased Strouhal number as the near wake length scales were confined. In the first row of the bundle, low Reynolds number flows were mainly shear-layer-driven while high Reynolds number flows were dominated by periodic vortex shedding. The level of velocity fluctuations increased for cases having stronger vortex shedding. The effect of streamwise spacing was most apparent in the reduction of velocity fluctuations in the wake when the spacing between rows was reduced from 2. 60 diameters to 2. 16 diameters.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that when {{computing}} a compressible flow in a rotating duct of a given geometry and radial distance from the axis of rotation, the inlet Mach number must be specified {{in addition to the}} inlet Reynolds number, inlet rotation number, coolant-to-wall temperature ratio, and Prandtl number. This is because the inlet Mach number and other dimensionless parameters collectively fix the rotational speed, which strongly influences centrifugal buoyancy. This study also shows the nature of the three-dimensional flow induced by Coriolis force, centrifugal buoyancy, and a 180 -deg bend in a U-shaped square duct with smooth walls for three rotation numbers (0, 0. 24, and 0. 48), and two Reynolds numbers (2. 5 x 104 and 5 X 104). Key flow mechanisms that affect heat transfer are identified. The computed heat transfer coefficient on the leading and trailing faces of the rotating duct compares well with available experimental data.

The channel has a 120 mm wide, 12 mm high cross-section, and it is operated with the lower and upper walls at fixed temperature whereas the side ones are adiabatic. Ribs have a square cross section and are mounted transversely to air-flow direction; the tested configurations differ for the rib side dimension, namely, 2 or 4 mm, and for their pitch-to-side ratio equal to 10, 20 and 40.

40|$|Incompressible flow in a {{guide vane}} bend may be {{considered}} as composed of a primary two-dimensional, nearly potential flow upon which is superimposed a secondary flow. The two-dimensional flow lies in {{the plane of the}} bend and is determined by the flow boundaries alone. If the flow entering a bend were everywhere irrotational, the two-dimensional flow pattern would be the three-dimensional pattern (nearly). Because the real flow entering a bend has a nonuniform velocity profile in planes normal to the plane of the bend, the streamlines in the nonuniform region are determined not alone by the flow boundaries but also by the entrance profile or vorticity. The main purpose of this research was the study of the influence of secondary flows on the basic two-dimensional flow. It is shown in the report from experimental data that the secondary flows have a negligible influence on the average deflection of the flow by the guide vanes, but they have a major influence on the energy loss. The two-dimensional loss coefficient is increased 100 per cent and more by the secondary flows. The loss attributable to secondary flows may be divided into two parts. The smaller of the two parts occurs at the vanes and the larger part occurs in a region downstream of the vanes extending over three or four <b>duct</b> <b>hydraulic</b> diameters. This larger part of the loss is attributed mainly to increased wall shear downstream of the vanes. The increased wall shear occurs because the secondary flow brings high-energy, high-velocity fluid to the duct wall from the interior.

Methodology includes air from a blower entering the test section through orificemeter and differential-micro manometer to measure the flow rate and pressure drop across the test section. Depending upon the pressure drops, friction factors for smooth and rough surface of the duct are estimated. The effect of geometrical parameters of delta wing and duct aspect ratio on friction factor ratios are reported Based on Reynolds number in the range of 8000 − 24000. The geometrical parameters of vortex generators varied in this study were the pitch-to-vortex generator height ratio (p/e), vortex generator height to <b>duct</b> <b>hydraulic</b> diameter ratio (e/Dh), aspect ratio of vortex generator (ar). Results are reported for 0. 1 <e/Dh< 0. 5, p/e= 4, 8, 12, 16, (ar) = 1. 6, 2. 3, 4, N= 1 in ducts having aspect ratio AR= 1, Detailed friction factor analysis for Re 8000 − 24000 has been presented for different configurations of vortex generators used in the square duct. The experimental {{results of the present study}} for friction factor in smooth square duct matches well with values taken from formula proposed by Blasius. The friction factor ratio increases with increase in e/Dh value, which may be attributed to increased blockage of the flow passage. For a given p/e, increasing e/Dh ratio for the same (ar) has the effect of increasing circulation strength and core size of the vortex thereby offering more resistance to flow that results into a higher friction factor ratio.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} simulation {{was conducted by}} making use of a RANS approach for the flow in a duct ac-companying longitudinal vortices and discussions are given for the related thermal fields. In {{the first half of}} this pa-per, applicability of the three turbulence models adopted in the present study is discussed based on the comparison with published experimental results both for the flow around a rectangular winglet vortex generator and for the inclined im-pinging jets. The results obtained with the non-linear eddy viscosity models agree reasonably well with the experiments. Main part of the article treats the numerical results for the flow around a discrete rib attached obliquely to the flow direction onto the bottom wall of a square duct in which a fully developed turbulent flow is established at the inlet. The rib attack angle to the main flow was varied in several levels from β = 20 ◦ to 75 ◦. The ratio of the rib height to the <b>duct</b> <b>hydraulic</b> diameter and the duct Reynolds number were set to be e/D = 0. 15 and Re = 20, 000, respectively. Due to the rib inclination and the gaps existing between the rib ends and the sidewalls, a noticeable heat transfer augmenta-tion is obtained downstream the rib where the separated flow from the leading edge of the rib reattaches. As β decreases, the region of heat transfer deterioration behind the rib is reduced in size. Furthermore, heat transfer enhancement in-curred by the downwash flow and the longitudinal vortex becomes more conspicuous. Heat transfer enhanced region however becomes narrower as β decreases since the cross sec-tion of the generated longitudinal vortex becomes smaller then. Combination of the two effects produces the most ef-fective heat transfer enhancement in the case of β = 45 ◦ among the tested cases.

In the present study, experimental data for local heat transfer coefficients are presented for a converging channel with rib roughening elements with the cross-section being maintained square from inlet to exit. The local heat transfer coefficient distribution shows the same qualitative behavior observed for the straight channel. The overall averaged heat transfer coefficient along with the measured pressure drop across the test channel {{is used to calculate}} thermal performance based on constant pumping power and constant heat transfer area criterion. Data are presented for straight ribs normal to the flow, V ribs with included apex angle of 45 degrees and with apex pointing in the upstream and downstream directions, W ribs with all included angles of 45 degrees and with central apex pointing in the upstream and downstream directions. The inlet Reynolds number (Re-in) was varied from 5000 to 35, 000. The rib height (e) was maintained constant throughout the length of the channel. The rib height to mean <b>duct</b> <b>hydraulic</b> diameter ratio (e/D-h,D-m) was kept constant at 0. 08. Data for three pitch to height ratios (P/e) equal to 6, 10 and 17. 5 are reported for straight and V ribs. The optimum P/e ratio based on constant pumping power thermal performance criterion was observed to be equal to 10 and this was the only configuration studied for W ribs. The difference in thermal performance between the V and W ribs was within uncertainty limits. However, the local variation in heat transfer coefficient in the cross stream direction on the ribbed wall was noticed to be very high for the V ribs compared to that for the W ribs making the W ribs a better choice as enhancement device.
