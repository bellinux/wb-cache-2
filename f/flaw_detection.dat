Because each testing method makes use of different physical effects for defect localization, a multi-method approach is promising to effectively distinguish the many false alarms from actual material defects. To this end, we propose a new fusion technique for scattered two- or three-dimensional location data. Using a density-based approach, the proposed method is able to explicitly address the localization uncertainties such as registration errors. We provide guidelines on how to set all key parameters and demonstrate the technique's robustness.

During fatigue test, after defined number of cycles, samples were heated using infra-red heater and at the opposite side temperature increase was evaluated with thermovision camera. Findings: Analysis of achieved results allowed to elaborate relation between number of fatigue cycles and the degree of fatigue degradation. Such relation may be applied in diagnostic procedures. Research limitations/implications: Performed tests were of preliminary character and results will be applied to prepare research programme on thermographic testing of composites.

The memristor is the fourth and last such circuit element and thus completes circuit theory. Predicted already in 1971, the eventual discovery of something seemingly so basic needed almost 40 years. However, this discovery is doubted. The predicted memristor has no material memory {{and is based on}} magnetic flux, but the discovered devices constitute analogue memory storage that do not involve magnetism. The person who originally proposed the memristor did not reject the discovery but instead changed his mind about what a memristor is. We briefly introduce the history and then carefully memristance and the memristor as such. We discuss its status as a model rather than a device. We discuss the discovered devices, their stability, and how stability relates to the consistency of the theoretical entities. A thought experiment assumes a world without magnetism.
