40|$|The {{longitudinal}} instability has potentially disastrous {{effects on the}} ion beams used for heavy ion driven inertial confinement fusion. This instability is a {open_quotes}resistive wall{close_quotes} instability with the impedance coining from the <b>induction</b> <b>modules</b> in the accelerator used as a driver. This instability can greatly amplify perturbations launched from the beam head and can prevent focusing of the beam onto the small spot necessary for fusion. This instability has been studied using the WARPrz particle-in-cell code. WARPrz is a 2 1 / 2 dimensional electrostatic axisymmetric code. This code includes {{a model for the}} impedance of the <b>induction</b> <b>modules.</b> Simulations with resistances similar to that expected in a driver show moderate amounts of growth from the instability as a perturbation travels from beam head to tail as predicted by cold beam fluid theory.

This reduction in the growth rate is seen in both cold beam fluid theory and in simulations with WARPrz. Instability growth rates for warm beams measured from WARPrz are lower than cold beam fluid theory predicts. Longitudinal thermal spread cannot account for this decrease in the growth rate. A mechanism for coupling the transverse thermal spread to decay of the longitudinal waves is presented. The longitudinal instability is no longer a threat to the heavy ion fusion program. The simulations in this thesis have shown that the growth rate for this instability will not be as large as earlier calculations predicted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{implementation}} of a rule-based intuitive reasoner is presented. The implementation included two parts: the rule <b>induction</b> <b>module</b> and the intuitive reasoner. A large weather database was acquired as the data source. Twelve weather variables from those data were chosen as the “target variables” whose values were predicted by the intuitive reasoner. A “complex” situation was simulated by making only subsets of the data available to the rule <b>induction</b> <b>module.</b> As a result, the rules induced were based on incomplete information with variable levels of certainty. The certainty level was modeled by a metric called "Strength of Belief", which was assigned to each rule or datum as ancillary information about the confidence in its accuracy. Two techniques were employed to induce rules from the data subsets: decision tree and multi-polynomial regression, respectively for the discrete and the continuous type of target variables. The intuitive reasoner was tested for its ability to use the induced rules to predict the classes of the discrete target variables and the values of the continuous target variables. The intuitive reasoner implemented two types of reasoning: fast and broad where, by analogy to human thought, the former corresponds to fast decision making and the latter to deeper contemplation [...] For reference, a weather data analysis approach which had been applied on similar tasks was adopted to analyze the complete database and create predictive models for the same 12 target variables. The values predicted by the intuitive reasoner and the reference approach were compared with actual data. The intuitive reasoner reached near- 100 % accuracy for two continuous target variables. For the discrete target variables, the intuitive reasoner predicted at least 70 % as accurately as the reference reasoner. Since the intuitive reasoner operated on rules derived from only about 10 % of the total data, it demonstrated the potential advantages in dealing with sparse data sets as compared with conventional methods.

40|$|The Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment (NDCX) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is {{exploring}} the physical limits of compression and focusing of ion beams for heating material to warm dense matter (WDM) and fusion ignition conditions. The NDCX is a beam transport experiment with several components at a scale comparable to an inertial fusion energy driver. The NDCX is an accelerator {{which consists of}} a low-emittance ion source, high-current injector, solenoid matching section, <b>induction</b> bunching <b>module,</b> beam neutralization section, and final focusing system. The principal objectives of the experiment are to control the beam envelope, demonstrate effective neutralization of the beam space-charge, control the velocity tilt on the beam, and understand defocusing effects, field imperfections, and limitations on peak intensity such as emittance and aberrations. Target heating experiments with space-charge dominated ion beams require simultaneous longitudinal bunching and transverse focusing. A four-solenoid lattice is used to tune the beam envelope to the necessary focusing conditions before entering the <b>induction</b> bunching <b>module.</b> The <b>induction</b> bunching <b>module</b> provides a head-to-tail velocity ramp necessary to achieve peak axial compression at the desired focal plane.

The weld geometries used included mainly T-joint samples, and also butt welds were done, and some further analyses were done on CWF and shear samples made previously. Three different Design of Experiments (DOE) matrices were used to create three sets of T-joint samples which were analyzed to understand the interactions among the process parameters. The usual analysis of variance was extended by multivariate analysis to better define the individual roles of each of the process parameters. Cross-sections of the various types of welds were examined. DOE matrices were also performed on butt welds where the samples were either 3 mm thick welded to 3 mm thick samples, or 6 mm thick to 6 mm thick welds.

40|$|Heavy ion {{drivers for}} warm dense matter and heavy ion fusion {{applications}} use intense charge bunches which must undergo transverse and longitudinal compression {{in order to}} meet the requisite high current densities and short pulse durations desired at the target. The neutralized drift compression experiment (NDCX) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is used to study the longitudinal neutralized drift compression of a space-charge-dominated ion beam, which occurs due to an imposed longitudinal velocity tilt and subsequent neutralization of the beam’s space charge by background plasma. Reduced theoretical models have been used in order to describe the realistic propagation of an intense charge bunch through the NDCX device. A warm-fluid model is presented as a tractable computational tool for investigating the nonideal effects associated with the experimental acceleration gap geometry and voltage waveform of the <b>induction</b> <b>module,</b> which acts as a means to pulse shape both the velocity and line density profiles. Self-similar drift compression solutions can be realized in order to transversely focus the entire charge bunch to the same focal plane in upcoming simultaneous transverse and longitudinal focusing experiments. A kinetic formalism based on the Vlasov equation has been employed in order to show that the peaks in the experimental current profiles are a result of the fact that only the central portion of the beam contributes effectively to the main compressed pulse. Significant portions of the charge bunch reside in the nonlinearly compressing part of the ion beam because of deviations between the experimental and ideal velocity tilts. Those regions form a pedestal of current around the central peak, thereby decreasing the amount of achievable longitudinal compression and increasing the pulse durations achieved at the focal plane. A hybrid fluid-Vlasov model which retains the advantages of both the fluid and kinetic approaches has been implemented to describe the formation of pedestals in the current profiles. The comparison between the experimental measurements and the various theoretical models is excellent...|$|E

In principle, both PLIA and induction accelerators might benefit from multiple short bunches (see June 24, 2005 talk by Logan on multi-pulsing in PLIA accelerators for IFE), although the PLIA approach, because of fixed circuit wave velocities at any z, requires imaginative work-arounds to handle the different bunch velocities required. George's RPIA 06 paper also describes a different type of radial line induction linac that might be considered, but its unclear how the required pulse-to-pulse variable waveforms can be obtained with such pulselines. This initial MathCad analysis explores multi-pulsing in modular solenoid induction linacs (concept shown in Figure 1) considering high-q ECR sources, basic induction acceleration limits assuming affordable agile waveforms, transverse and longitudinal bunch confinement constraints, models to optimize bunch lengths, solenoid fields, core radial builds and switching.
