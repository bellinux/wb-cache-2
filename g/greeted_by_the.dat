5|$|Nerva was succeeded without {{incident}} by his adopted son Trajan, who was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to Pliny the Younger, Trajan dedicated a temple {{in honour of}} Nerva, yet no trace of {{it has ever been}} found; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio, however, the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.|$|E

He reached Tripoli on 26 January, where he was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Army's commander, General Bernard Montgomery. Leclerc's command, now reinforced by the Greek Sacred Squadron, and known as L Force, covered the Eighth Army's inland flank during its advance into Tunisia. L Force beat off a German counterattack on 10 March, and participated in the attack on the Mareth Line.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his father}} {{saying he was}} betrayed by his friend C. W. McAllister during their climb on the mountain, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them {{secretly}} dragging him up. Realizing he lacks the strength and resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired and ashamed, Homer sticks his flag pole on the ledge. The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> crowd.|$|E

After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of the Heavens. Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful.

5|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. He boarded the troopship RMS Kaiser-i-Hind in London on 4 May 1919, and reached Hobart on 30 June, {{after a long}} sea voyage, a rail trip from Fremantle to Melbourne, passage across the Bass Strait, and a week in quarantine on Bruny Island due to the 1918 flu pandemic. As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He {{came up with a plan}} for a temporary reclassification of positions, which would offer some relief, at a cost to the government of Â£12,000. This was implemented in December. On 19 July 1920, he was formally knighted by the Prince of Wales.|$|E

5|$|President Arthur {{departed}} Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17. While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from President Arthur {{got into}} a confrontation {{with members of the}} Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the Jewish sabbath, but President Arthur was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship. Sources are unclear as to what actually happened aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.|$|E
5|$|Tess, {{awakening}} {{on a table}} {{inside a}} laboratory, is <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parallel universe version of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), who reveals that Lex took his imperfect clones' best pieces and assembled them to create a perfect clone of himself. Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and shoots Lionel during her escape.

5|$|Metternich's {{primary focus}} {{remained}} on preserving unity among the Great Powers of Europe and hence his own power as mediator. He was also concerned by liberal-minded Ioannis Kapodistrias' increasing influence over Tsar Alexander and the continual threat of Russia annexing {{large areas of}} the declining Ottoman Empire (the so-called Eastern Question). As he had earlier envisaged, by April 1818 Britain had drawn up, and Metternich pushed through, proposals to have a Congress at Aachen, then a Prussian frontier town, six months later. Meanwhile, Metternich was advised to go to the spa town of Karlsbad to treat the rheumatic tension in his back. It was a pleasant month-long trip, although it was there he received news of {{the death of his father}} at the age of 72. He visited the family estate at KÃ¶nigswart and then Frankfurt in late August to encourage the member states of the German Confederation to agree on procedural issues. He could also now visit Koblenz for the first time in 25 years and his new estate at Johannisberg. Travelling with Emperor Francis, he was warmly <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Catholic towns along the Rhine as he progressed towards Aachen. He had arranged in advance for newspapers to cover the first peacetime congress of its kind. As discussions began, Metternich pushed for the withdrawal of allied troops from France and means for preserving the unity of the European powers. The former was agreed almost immediately; but on the latter agreement extended only to maintaining the Quadruple Alliance. Metternich rejected the Tsar's idealistic plans for (among other things) a single European army. His own recommendations to the Prussians for greater controls on freedom of speech was equally hard for other powers such as Britain to support openly.|$|E

5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adamsâ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E
