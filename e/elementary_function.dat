25|$|Elementary {{arithmetic}} is the simplified {{portion of}} arithmetic {{that includes the}} operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It {{should not be confused}} with <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} {{automaton}} {{constructed in}} this way is not an <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> {{of the size of the}} input MSO formula. This non-elementary complexity is necessary, in the sense that (unless P = NP) it is not possible to test MSO properties on trees in a time that is fixed-parameter tractable with an elementary dependence on the parameter.|$|E
25|$|The {{elementary}} functions are constructed by composing arithmetic operations, the exponential function (exp), the natural logarithm (log), trigonometric functions (sin, cos), and their inverses. The complexity of an <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> {{is equivalent to}} that of its inverse, since all {{elementary functions}} are analytic and hence invertible by means of Newton's method. In particular, if either exp or log in the complex domain can be computed with some complexity, then that complexity is attainable for all other elementary functions.|$|E
50|$|Finding antiderivatives of <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> {{is often}} {{considerably}} harder than finding their derivatives. For some <b>elementary</b> <b>functions,</b> {{it is impossible}} to find an antiderivative in terms of other <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b> See the articles on <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> and nonelementary integral for further information.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Elementary</b> <b>functions</b> were {{introduced}} by Joseph Liouville {{in a series}} of papers from 1833 to 1841. [...] An algebraic treatment of <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> was started by Joseph Fels Ritt in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Importantly, the <b>elementary</b> <b>{{functions}}</b> are not closed under integration, {{as shown}} by Liouville's theorem, see Nonelementary integral. The Liouvillian functions are defined as the <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, the polylogarithm (also {{known as}} Jonquière's {{function}}, for Alfred Jonquière) {{is a special}} function Lis(z) of order s and argument z. Only for special values of s does the polylogarithm reduce to an <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> such as the natural logarithm or rational functions. In quantum statistics, the polylogarithm function appears as the closed form of integrals of the Fermi–Dirac distribution and the Bose–Einstein distribution, and {{is also known as}} the Fermi–Dirac integral or the Bose–Einstein integral. In quantum electrodynamics, polylogarithms of positive integer order arise in the calculation of processes represented by higher-order Feynman diagrams.|$|E
2500|$|Weaker systems than {{recursive}} comprehension can be defined. [...] The weak system RCA {{consists of}} <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> arithmetic EFA (the basic axioms plus Δ00 induction in the enriched language with an exponential operation) plus Δ01 comprehension. Over RCA, [...] recursive comprehension as defined earlier (that is, with Σ01 induction) {{is equivalent to}} the statement that a polynomial (over a countable field) has only finitely many roots and to the classification theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups. The system RCA has the same proof theoretic ordinal 3 as EFA and is conservative over EFA for [...] sentences.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{mathematical}} {{difficulty in}} symbolic integration {{is that in}} many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, {{it is known that}} the antiderivatives of the functions [...] and [...] cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only rational and exponential functions, logarithm, trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions, and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in elementary functions, which are the functions which may be built from [...] rational functions, roots of a polynomial, logarithm, and exponential functions. The Risch algorithm provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed <b>elementary</b> <b>function.</b> On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The Risch algorithm, implemented in Mathematica and other computer algebra systems, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from [...] rational functions, radicals, logarithm, and exponential functions.|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{function}} Φ cannot be expressed as the composition of <b>elementary</b> <b>functions,</b> therefore, it is valuable to find sharp bounds for the Mills ratio by certain simple and <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|R
50|$|All <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> are Liouvillian.|$|R
5000|$|Part 2 {{deals with}} some {{additional}} [...] "basic" [...] operations on integer and floating pointdatatype values, but focuses primarily on specifying requirements on numericalversions of <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b> Much of the specifications in LIA-2 are inspiredby the specifications in Ada for <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On {{the design}} {{rationale}} of the x87 [...] 80-bit format, Kahan notes: [...] "This Extended format {{is designed to}} be used, with negligible loss of speed, for all but the simplest arithmetic with float and double operands. For example, it should be used for scratch variables in loops that implement recurrences like polynomial evaluation, scalar products, partial and continued fractions. It often averts premature Over/Underflow or severe local cancellation that can spoil simple algorithms". Computing intermediate results in an extended format with high precision and extended exponent has precedents in the historical practice of scientific calculation and in the design of scientific calculators e.g. Hewlett-Packard's financial calculators performed arithmetic and financial functions to three more significant decimals than they stored or displayed. The implementation of extended precision enabled standard <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> libraries to be readily developed that normally gave double precision results within one unit in the last place (ULP) at high speed.|$|E

50|$|Changing the {{variance}} value {{will change the}} duration of the <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> (window size), and the center of the <b>elementary</b> <b>function</b> is no longer fixed. By adjusting the center point and variance of the <b>elementary</b> <b>function,</b> we are able to match the signal's local time-frequency feature. The better performance of the adaptation is achieved at the cost of matching process. The trade-off between different window length now become the trade-off between computation time and performance.|$|E

3000|$|In general, {{the mean}} gravity norm F ([...] A,P [...]) cannot be {{expressed}} by the <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> since it involves the elliptic integral [11]. Therefore, {{in order to facilitate}} the applications, we need to find its sharp lower and upper bounds, which can be {{expressed by the}} <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lower <b>elementary</b> {{recursive}} <b>functions</b> {{follow the}} definitions as above, except that bounded product is disallowed. That is, a lower <b>elementary</b> recursive <b>function</b> {{must be a}} zero, successor, or projection function, a composition of other lower <b>elementary</b> recursive <b>functions,</b> or the bounded sum of another lower <b>elementary</b> recursive <b>function.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kalmar defined {{what are}} known as <b>elementary</b> <b>{{functions}},</b> number-theoretic functions (i.e. those based on the natural numbers) built up from the notions of composition and variables, the constants 0 and 1, repeated addition + of the constants, proper subtraction ∸, bounded summation and bounded product (Kleene 1952:526). Elimination of the bounded product from this list yields the subelementary or lower <b>elementary</b> <b>functions.</b> By use of the abstract computational model called a register machine Schwichtenberg provides a demonstration that [...] "all <b>elementary</b> <b>functions</b> are computable and totally defined" [...] (Schwichtenberg 58).|$|R
