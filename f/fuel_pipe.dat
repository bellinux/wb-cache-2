5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe,</b> igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
25|$|The prototype, with a {{workshop}} number SL-4, {{was built in}} 1926 and first flown on October 4, 1926 in Warsaw. During landing, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> broke and the aircraft burned, injuring the military pilot Kazimierz Kalina. The pilot, however, expressed a good opinion on its handling, so the second modified aircraft was built (SL-6), and one more airframe for static trials (SL-5).|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} that a fuel pressure pipe had chafed against a metal clip, causing the pipe to leak aviation spirit. This fuel was then ignited, probably by a hot exhaust pipe. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (outer port) engine. With the port wing on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control.|$|E

25|$|On {{the fifth}} day of the enquiry, {{managing}} director of Imperial Airways Colonel Frank Searle gave evidence that Imperial Airways pilots had absolute discretion to refuse to fly any aircraft if, in their opinion, the aircraft was unfit for flight for whatever reason. He stated that the petrol pipe supplied by Petro-Flex to Imperial Airways was of an armoured type, but that unarmoured pipes had been fitted to some aircraft taken over when Imperial Airways had been formed, and that spares from these companies were in stock and being used. Both armoured and unarmoured pipes had been approved {{for use by the}} Air Ministry. A representative from Petro-Flex corroborated Searle's evidence in respect of the type of piping supplied to Imperial Airways. Evidence was given that the flight from Lympne to Croydon was with the aircraft lightly loaded, and that the performance of the engine with a restricted <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> would be different from that with a full load. The Chief Engineer of D. Napier & Son gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was of the highest standard. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E
500|$|On 17 January 1977, Vulcan B.2 XM600 of No. 101 Squadron crashed near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During a {{practice}} emergency descent, the bomb bay fire warning light flashed on followed by No.2 engine fire warning light. The captain shut the engine {{down and the}} AEO reported flames coming from the area of No.2 engine, just behind the deployed Ram air turbine (RAT). As the fire intensified, the captain ordered the aircraft to be abandoned. The three rear crew members escaped at around [...] After ordering the co-pilot to eject, the captain ejected at around , as control was lost. The cause was due to arcing on the RAT's electrical terminals, burning a hole in an adjacent <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> and setting the fuel on fire.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011 it was {{reported}} by the Financial Times that when the decision was taken to scrap the aircraft, [...] " [...] was still riddled with flaws.... Safety tests conducted [...] found there were still 'several hundred design non-compliances' with the aircraft. It was unclear, for example, whether its bomb bay doors functioned properly, whether its landing gear worked and, most worryingly, whether its <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> was safe." [...] According to Air Forces Monthly magazine, [...] "significant aerodynamic issues and associated flying control concerns in certain regimes of flight meant that it was grounded {{at the time of}} cancellation and may not have been signed over as safe by the Military Aviation Authority." [...] The magazine also stated that the reason for the cancellation was that the RAF and Navy placed a higher priority on fast jets and frigates than on maritime patrol.|$|E

[...] The nozzle mates to the [...] "receptacle" [...] in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. [...] A poppet valve in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. [...] Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{of this section}} allowed much-needed supplies to flow to the troops engaged in attacking the Japanese 18th Division, which was defending the northern area of Burma with their strongest forces around the towns of Kamaing, Mogaung, and Myitkyina. Before the Ledo road reached Shingbwiyang, Allied troops (the majority of whom were American-trained Chinese divisions of the X Force) had been totally dependent on supplies flown in over the Patkai Range. As the Japanese were forced to retreat south, the Ledo Road was extended. This was made considerably easier from Shingbwiyang {{by the presence of}} a fair weather road built by the Japanese, and the Ledo Road generally followed the Japanese trace. As the road was built, two [...] <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> lines were laid side-by-side so that fuel for the supply vehicles could be piped instead of trucked along the road.|$|E

50|$|In general, pogo {{oscillation}} {{occurs when}} a surge in engine pressure increases back pressure against the fuel coming into the engine, reducing engine pressure, causing more fuel {{to come in and}} increasing engine pressure again. Flexing of <b>fuel</b> <b>pipes</b> can also induce fluctuations in fuel pressure. If the cycle happens to match a resonance frequency of the rocket then dangerous oscillations can occur through positive feedback, which can, in extreme cases, tear the vehicle apart.|$|R

A more powerful Lyulka AL-7F-1 turbojet was installed, providing 9.8 kN (2,210 lbf) more afterburning thrust for improved climb rate and high-altitude performance (and to compensate for increased weight).
