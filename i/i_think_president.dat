5000|$|Mercedes {{arrived at}} the second race {{of the season with}} maximum points from Australia, having {{finished}} first and second with third placed Sebastian Vettel half a minute down. Following their dominant performance, many commentators voiced fears that the sport might become even more one-sided and boring {{over the course of the}} 2015 season than it had been the previous year. Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner called for the FIA to step in and apply rule changes that would level the competition, stating: [...] "The FIA, within the rules, have an equalisation mechanism and that needs to be looked at." [...] Red Bull subsequently threatened to leave the sport, should no measures be taken. While many commentators pointed out that Red Bull had enjoyed their own share of dominance in the prior years, Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone voiced understanding for the team, saying: [...] "There is a rule that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>president</b> Max Mosley put in when he was there that in the event... that a particular team or engine supplier did something magic - which Mercedes have done - the FIA can level up things. They Mercedes have done a first class job which everybody acknowledges. We need to change things a little bit now and try to level things up a little bit." [...] Mercedes' executive director Toto Wolff reacted to the calls by urging his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to sort it out". McLaren driver Jenson Button also raised doubt over the practicality of rule changes, saying [...] "There's nothing really to ban because it doesn't look like Mercedes are doing anything other teams aren't doing." [...] "All you bloody crowd have been complaining about everything, so let's hear it. If you were in my position, apart from leaving, what would you do?" [...] Bernie Ecclestone, speaking about Formula One's problems with journalists in Malaysia. Following criticism voiced by Red Bull, the future of engine supplier Renault was also a matter of debate. While Renault contemplated exiting the sport, another scenario that received media attention was a possible buy-out of the Toro Rosso team. The discussion about the future of the sport was additionally fuelled by the news that the German Grand Prix would be dropped from the 2015 calendar, due to a lack of financing. The exclusion of one of motorsport's most traditional events caused many to raise the question whether the same fate might await other traditional venues such as Monza.|$|E

We are lessening, {{degrading}} his ability to use this. The weapons of mass destruction are the threat of the future. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>president</b> explained very clearly to the American people that this is the threat of the 21st century. … What it means is that we know we can't get everything, but degrading is the right word." ...|$|R

2500|$|When asked {{during the}} Meet the Press {{interview}} {{if she would}} take back her previous comments that Obama [...] "may have anti-American views" [...] and that his administration had [...] "embraced something called gangster government", Bachmann backed her statements, saying [...] "I do believe that actions {{that have been taken}} by this White House—I don't take back my statements on gangster government. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt... I said I have very serious concerns about the <b>president's</b> views, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>president's</b> actions {{in the last two years}} speak for themselves." ...|$|R

But, if there's just one thing where they're wrong, it's in the matter of the theatres. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it would be much better for the Government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres in any way. The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>President</b> is doing fine. So, all I say is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the theatres ought to be allowed to do fine, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Gates's lawyers, Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr, {{a former}} {{professor}} of Obama, stated that [...] "I <b>think</b> the <b>president</b> {{has taken the}} right approach by {{trying to make sure}} we move forward ... He's always had the ability to negotiate difficult conversations, and his steps today are an important step in the right direction. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>president</b> has given his assessment, which makes a lot of sense, and, however you feel about it, it has reduced the temperature and allowed everyone to move forward in a constructive way." [...] Ogletree has since written a book about the case. Steve Killion, president of the Cambridge patrol officers association, also stated [...] "I'm absolutely pleased with call. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was a good thing}} for the president to do. .... We all want to see this behind us." ...|$|R
5000|$|An 80-year-old man, {{a former}} KMT member named Liu Bai-yan (劉柏煙), sets himself on fire at Taipei Liberty Square. He {{suffered}} from 80% body burns. His suicide note referred to Chen as follows: [...] "When Chen Yun-lin {{met with the}} President Ying-jeou, he pointed his finger at the President, saying [...] "you, you, you". <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> the <b>President</b> looked quite content, smiling a little. Is the President's name [...] "you, you, you"? As a member of Kuomintang, I am embarrassed by this display. If the mainland sends over someone higher, shouldn't the President kneel?" [...] Liu died on December 14, 2008.|$|R

We must have a great deal more restraint, and much more done by onlookers' reactions instead of by shots of 'pulsating obscenity', hideous scars, hideous sightless faces, etc, etc. It is keeping on and on in the same vein that makes this script so outrageous. They must take it away and prune. Before they take it away, however, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>President</b> the BBFC should read it. I have a stronger stomach than the average (for viewing purposes) and perhaps I ought to be reacting more strongly." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the Vice Presidential Debate, after Joe Biden criticized Romney's comments, Ryan responded, [...] "With {{respect to}} that quote, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the vice <b>president</b> very well knows that {{sometimes}} the words don’t come {{out of your mouth}} the right way.” President Obama stated in an interview with David Letterman, [...] "My expectation is {{if you want to be}} president, you've got to work for everybody, not just for some".|$|R

5000|$|Dick Cheney reiterated his {{position}} {{of four years}} prior, stating the issue {{should be left to}} the states but that he supports the Bush administration. He did not mention his family nor his daughter in his immediate response to the question. In his response, Edwards said: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the vice <b>president</b> and his wife love their daughter. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they love her very much. And you can't have anything but respect for the fact that they're willing to {{talk about the fact that}} they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. It's a wonderful thing. And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy. John Edwards ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>President</b> does Mr. Barber an {{injustice}} {{when he speaks}} of [...] "a certain cumbersomeness of mind and inability to do the speediest modern work, as shown by these delays," [...] here. The making of the models for these coins was given to Saint Gaudens, who was a sculptor and had no experience with coinage designs. When the models were received, the Bureau the Mint was notified that the dies made from them would not work in the coining press ... the models were returned to Saint Gaudens, at his request and a modified set furnished after some time. The Bureau was informed that even these would not make dies satisfactory for coinage, but the dies were made and it was found {{they could not be}} used in the coining press. How are we going to strike coins from these for the President? ...|$|R
5000|$|Agenda Project founder Erica Payne {{explained}} the campaign by stating, [...] "The Chamber claims {{to speak for}} American business, but half of the Chamber's budget is paid for by 45 big corporations. The President is well aware that the Chamber is in actuality just a high priced lobbyist for {{a small number of}} corporations. <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> the <b>President</b> will restore our faith in government by fawning over the banks {{at the center of the}} financial crisis, oil companies like BP who destroyed the Gulf, and insurance companies who secretly funneled $10 million through the Chamber to fight insurance reform." ...|$|R
60|$|We are now up {{and have}} a {{continuous}} line of troops, {{and in a few}} hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river above. Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were not captured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or because they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps is above them. Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak Road to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met them, and at last accounts was engaged with them. Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with another division from here. The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery. I do not know the number of men and guns accurately however. * * * <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>President</b> might come out and pay us a visit tomorrow.|$|R
60|$|Not so Leghorn (made illustrious by SMOLLETT'S grave), {{which is}} a thriving, business-like, matter-of-fact place, where idleness is {{shouldered}} {{out of the way}} by commerce. The regulations observed there, in reference to trade and merchants, are very liberal and free; and the town, of course, benefits by them. Leghorn had a bad name in connection with stabbers, and with some justice it must be allowed; for, not many years ago, there was an assassination club there, the members of which bore no ill-will to anybody in particular, but stabbed people (quite strangers to them) in the streets at night, for the pleasure and excitement of the recreation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>president</b> of this amiable society was a shoemaker. He was taken, however, and the club was broken up. It would, probably, have disappeared in the natural course of events, before the railroad between Leghorn and Pisa, {{which is a}} good one, and has already begun to astonish Italy with a precedent of punctuality, order, plain dealing, and improvement--the most dangerous and heretical astonisher of all. There must have been a slight sensation, as of earthquake, surely, in the Vatican, when the first Italian railroad was thrown open.|$|R

5000|$|As {{chairman}} of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (which is tasked with investigating [...] "waste, fraud, and abuse" [...] in the executive branch), Chaffetz {{has been criticized for}} showing a disinterest in investigating President Trump's conflicts of interest and for failing to criticize him for not resolving ethical questions. Chaffetz has said that Trump's global financial ties don’t merit a congressional investigation: [...] "It’s interesting, because under Section 208 of the criminal code, the president is exempt from almost every conflict-of-interest law... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>president</b> has a duty and an obligation {{to live up to the}} Constitution and the law. And what he’s required to do by law, it appears he’s done." [...] However, ethics experts have said that Trump's business conflicts and his failure to resolve them are [...] "nakedly unconstitutional." [...] Chaffetz also declined to investigate the circumstances surrounding the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who stepped down amid controversy over his communications with the Russian government before Trump took office. Chaffetz said that [...] "it's taking care of itself" [...] and that any investigation into Flynn was for the House Intelligence Committee to conduct; Chaffetz also asked the Justice Department inspector general to investigate the leaks that brought Flynn's contracts with Russian officials to public light.|$|R

5000|$|Brown was {{the subject}} of a {{national}} controversy in June 2011 when, during a nationally televised performance by Brown at the Republican Leadership Conference, he was cut off mid-sentence by Conference Chairman Charlie Davis. Davis told CNN that he ended Brown's performance because the Conference has a [...] "zero tolerance [...] for racially insensitive jokes." [...] At first, Brown disputed the factual basis of Davis' statement, claiming that the performance was ended because Brown [...] "was over [...] time by a few minutes." [...] Later, Brown responded to the allegations of racism by stating that he [...] "didn't hear any boos on any of the racial jokes" [...] and that he felt [...] "very safe delivering content like that" [...] because he and the President are of a similar mixed racial background. [...] "I wouldn't touch anything that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> the <b>President</b> would feel comfortable with or hasn't done himself. He is someone I respect. I want to make him happy," [...] said Brown.|$|R

2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law.
