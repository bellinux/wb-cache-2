5|$|On 1 August 2006, CNN {{reported}} that Barney, a Doberman Pinscher {{employed as a}} security dog at Wookey Hole, had destroyed parts of a valuable collection of teddy bears, including one which had belonged to Elvis Presley, which {{was estimated to be}} worth £40,000 (US$75,000). The insurance company insuring the exhibition of stuffed animals <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> having guard dog protection.|$|E
5|$|The next {{trial hearing}} {{took place on}} June 4. At the hearing, Takaesu stated that Brown had {{arranged}} with the Camp Courtney officers' club manager {{to have sex with}} V. N., but that V. N. resisted Brown's advances after driving him to the secluded road off base. The Naha prosecutor said during the hearing that V. N. <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> pressing charges.|$|E
5|$|The next court {{session was}} on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an {{attorney}} for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, testified that he had tried to arrange a jidan settlement between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once the charges were filed, she {{would not be able to}} withdraw them until the trial began.|$|E

5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|Aristodemus: The lone Spartan {{survivor}} of the slaughter of the 300 at the Battle of Thermopylae had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by Leonidas I because of an eye infection. However, his colleague <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed {{to fight in the}} disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg reluctantly {{agreed to}} appoint Hitler as {{chancellor}} after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not {{resulted in the}} formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia. Hitler <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.|$|E

5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the shorter title.|$|E
5|$|Sarah and Queen Anne {{never made}} up their differences, {{although}} one eyewitness claimed to have heard Anne asking whether the Marlboroughs had reached the shore, leading to rumours that she had called them home herself. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714 at Kensington Palace; the Protestant Whig Privy Councillors <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> their right to be present, preventing Henry St. John, the first Viscount Bolingbroke from declaring for the Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. The Marlboroughs returned home {{on the afternoon of}} Anne's death. The Act of Settlement of 1701 ensured a Protestant succession by passing over more than fifty stronger Roman Catholic claimants and proclaiming Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover (the great grandson of James I through Georg's mother Sophia of Hanover), King George I of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> {{writing the}} {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, {{who had no}} familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E

5|$|Phát {{and other}} pro-Diệm {{officers}} opposed the Buddhist influence being exerted on Khánh. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed that he was remaining neutral. Thảo thus believed Kỳ would not intervene against him, but Kỳ was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. American intelligence analysts had believed that General Don {{was involved in the}} coup with Phát and Thảo, but this was proven false when the action started. Eight months after the coup was over, Don told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but that the Đại Việt and Thảo's Catholic civilian allies <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> installing Khiêm, a Catholic. A month before the coup, American intelligence analysts had believed that Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} season in 1991–92, Galis {{was forced to}} leave Aris. The new {{management}} of the team, {{and the fact that the}} club was in decay, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored Thessaloniki, <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still had a lot to offer.|$|E

Rove helped finance {{the sale of the}} company, which had 11 employees. Selling Karl Rove & Co. was a condition that George W. Bush <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> before Rove took the job of chief strategist for Bush's presidential bid.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins {{has said}} that the title The Root of All Evil? was not his {{preferred}} choice, but that Channel 4 <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> it to create controversy. The sole concession from the producers on the title was the addition of the question mark. Dawkins has stated that the notion of anything being the root of all evil is ridiculous. Dawkins' book The God Delusion, released in September 2006, goes on to examine the topics raised in the documentary in greater detail. The documentary was rebroadcast on the More4 channel on 25 August 2010 under the title of The God Delusion.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} {{forcibly}} {{struck by a}} certain laxness {{in the management of}} theatre by Shook and Palmer, especially in comparison to Sara Conway's management prior to her death. Many witnesses reported that Conway <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> filled water buckets to be positioned in various places back stage or in the rigging loft and kept the fire hose maintained. In contrast, Mike Sweeny could recall using the hose only once, and was not certain of its condition {{on the day of the}} fire; many of his colleagues thought the hose leaked and was up in the painter's gallery in the roof above the stage.|$|E

25|$|From 26 December 1986 to 26 January 1987, The Triffids were on {{the bill}} of the Australian Made tour, which was the largest touring festival of Australian music talent {{attempted}} to that point. Jimmy Barnes and INXS headlined, {{and the rest of}} the line-up featured Mental As Anything, Divinyls, Models, The Saints, and I'm Talking. A concert film, Australian Made: The Movie, was directed by Richard Lowenstein and released later that year. The lead singer of INXS, Michael Hutchence, <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> The Triffids being part of the bill. 1987 also saw the release of three tracks recorded for John Peel on 5 May 1985, The Peel Sessions.|$|E
25|$|When {{the affair}} was discovered, those {{involved}} (except de La Motte and Réaux de Villette, who both managed to flee) were arrested, tried, convicted, and either imprisoned or exiled. The only one imprisoned was Mme de La Motte, who {{was given a}} life sentence to Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which {{also served as a}} prison for women. Judged by the Parlement, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing and allowed to leave the Bastille. Marie Antoinette, who <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the arrest of the Cardinal, was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, {{and despite the fact that}} the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.|$|E
25|$|According to the Book of Jubilees, Simeon {{was born}} on 21 Tevet, and {{according}} to the book of Genesis he had six sons. Although some classical rabbinical sources argue that the mother of his children, and his wife, was Bonah, one of the women from Shechem, other classical rabbinical sources argue that Simeon's wife (and the mother of his children) was Dinah, his sister, who <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> the marriage before she would be willing to leave Shechem's home (Shechem was her rapist/lover). Many of the rabbinical sources argue that Simeon {{died at the age of}} 120, roughly three years before the death of his brother Reuben, although Numbers Rabbah states that Simeon became the senior of the brothers after Reuben had died.|$|E
