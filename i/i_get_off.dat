500|$|When he {{returned}} to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager Red Rolfe noted, [...] "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [...] ". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>off.</b> I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E

2500|$|Jack Souther, {{a leading}} {{authority}} on geothermal resources and volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera has stated, [...] "at present the volcanoes of the Garibaldi Belt are quiet, presumed dead but still not completely cold.

[...] Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies {{in the region of}} Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly [...] below the surface. The existence of hot springs at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes. This long history of volcanic activity along a still active plate boundary indicates that volcanic eruptions in the Garibaldi Belt have not ended and risks for future eruptions remain.|$|E
