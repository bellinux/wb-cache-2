50|$|Industrial use of K. marxianus is chiefly in the {{conversion}} of lactose to ethanol as a precursor {{for the production of}} biofuel. The ability for K. marxianus to reduce lactose is useful because of the potential to transform industrial whey waste, a problematic waste product for disposal, into useful biomass for animal feed, food additives or fuel. Certain strains of the fungus {{can also be used to}} convert whey to ethyl acetate, an alternative fuel source. K. marxianus is also used to produce the industrial enzymes: inulinase, β-galactosidase, and pectinase. Due to the heat tolerance of K. marxianus, high heat fermentations are feasible, reducing the costs normally expended for cooling as well as the potential for contamination by other fungi or bacteria. In addition, fermentations at higher temperatures occur more rapidly, making production much more efficient. Due to the ability of K. marxianus to simultaneously ustilize lactose and glucose, the prevalence of K. marxianus in industrial settings is high as it decreases production time and increases productivity. Recent efforts have attempted to use K. marxianus in the production of <b>food</b> <b>flavourings</b> from waste products tomato and pepper pomaces as substrata.|$|E

5000|$|Grasse {{has had a}} prospering perfume {{industry}} {{since the}} end of the 18th century. Grasse is the centre of the French perfume industry and is known as the world's perfume capital (la capitale mondiale des parfums). Many [...] "noses" [...] (or, in French, [...] "Les nez" [...] (plural)/"Le nez" [...] (singular)) are trained or have spent time in Grasse to distinguish over 2,000 kinds of scent. Grasse produces over two-thirds of France's natural aromas (for perfume and for <b>food</b> <b>flavourings).</b> This industry turns over more than 600 million euros a year. [...] Grasse's particular microclimate encouraged the flower farming industry. It is warm and sufficiently inland to be sheltered from the sea air. There is an abundance of water, thanks to its situation in the hills and the 1860 construction of the Siagne canal for irrigation purposes. The town is 350 m above sea level and 20 km from the Coast (Côte d'Azur). Jasmine, a key ingredient of many perfumes, was brought to southern France by the Moors in the 16th century. Twenty-seven tonnes of jasmine are now harvested in Grasse annually. There are numerous old 'parfumeries' in Grasse, such as Galimard, Molinard and Fragonard, each with tours and a museum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract (R. Kiwamoto ISBN 978 - 94 - 6257 - 284 - 3) Various α,β-unsaturated {{aldehydes}} {{are present}} in fruits, vegetables, spices, or processed products containing these items as natural constituents or as added food flavouring agents. Because of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde moiety the β carbon in the molecule becomes electron deficient and the aldehydes react with electron rich molecules including DNA via Michael addition. The formation of DNA adducts raises a concern for genotoxicity, although formation of DNA adducts may not be significant at low doses relevant for dietary exposure in vivo because of adequate detoxification. This thesis therefore aimed at determining dose-dependent detoxification and DNA adduct formation of food-borne α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by using a physiologically based in silico modelling approach in order {{to contribute to the}} safety assessment of these aldehydes used as <b>food</b> <b>flavourings</b> instead of performing animal experiments. Physiologically based in silico models were developed for 18 α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The model outcomes indicated that the DNA adduct formation by the 18 α,β-unsaturated aldehydes as <b>food</b> <b>flavourings</b> is negligible and does not raise a safety concern at their levels of intake resulting from their use as <b>food</b> <b>flavourings.</b> The application of QSAR models strongly accelerated the development process of the PBK/D models of the group of 18 compounds. Also, it was illustrated that physiologically based in silico models provide a very useful and powerful tool to facilitate a group evaluation and read-across for food-borne DNA reactive agents. PBK/D models developed for the group of compounds supported read-across from cinnamaldehyde which is known not to be genotoxic or carcinogenic in vivo to other aldehydes, by allowing comparison of dose-dependent DNA adduct formations. Altogether this thesis presented physiologically based in silico modelling as an approach to test relevance of positive in vitro genotoxicity results by DNA reactive compounds in vivo without using animal experiments.      ...|$|E

The Scientific Panel on <b>Food</b> Additives, <b>Flavourings,</b> Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food has also been asked to evaluate the safety in use of lycopene from Blakeslea trispora as a food colour in the food categories and use levels as proposed in the dossier. In addition, in view of the re-evaluation of lycopene from tomatoes within the re-evaluation programme of all food colours, the Panel decided to make a global safety assessment of lycopene from all sources. Thus, in the present opinion the Panel evaluates the safety in use of lycopene from different sources as a food colour. Results from animal and human intervention studies with synthetic lycopene or tomato extract as lycopene source indicate that lycopene from these sources is bioavailable.

40|$|Orchids (Orchidaceae) {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse plant groups on the planet with over 25, 000 species. For over a century, {{scientists}} and horticulturalists have been fascinated by their complex floral morphology, pollinator specificity and multiple ethnobotanical uses, including as <b>food,</b> <b>flavourings,</b> medicines, ornaments, and perfumes. These important traits have stimulated world-wide collection of orchid species, often for the commercial production of hybrids and leading to frequent overexploitation. Increasing human activities and global environmental changes are also accelerating the threat of orchid extinction in their natural habitats. In order to improve gene conservation strategies for these unique species, innovative developments of cryopreservation methodologies are urgently needed based on an appreciation of low temperature (cryo) stress tolerance, the stimulation of recovery growth of plant tissues in vitro and on the 'omics' characterization of the targeted cell system (biotechnology). The successful development and application of such cryobiotechnology now extends to nearly 100 species and commercial hybrids of orchids, underpinning future breeding and species conservation programmes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the progress in cryobanldng of a range of orchid tissues, including seeds, pollen, protocorms, protocorm-like bodies, apices excised from in vitro plants, cell suspensions, rhizomes and orchid fungal symbionts. We also highlight future research needs...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{alkaline}} Comet assay detects primary DNA {{damage in}} various organs and tissues of exposed animals {{and can be}} used to assess the genotoxicity of a great variety of chemical compounds, which include <b>food</b> additives, <b>flavourings,</b> <b>food</b> contact materials, foodborne by-products, pesticides, contaminants, etc. Among the various versions of the assay, the alkaline method (pH of DNA unwinding and electrophoresis buffer > 13) identifies the broadest spectrum of DNA damage and is, therefore, recommended for regulatory purposes. It can detect double- and single-strand breaks, alkali-labile lesions that are expressed as single-strand breaks and single-strand breaks arising as DNA repair intermediates. No OECD Test Guideline yet exists for the Comet assay but internationally agreed protocols are available for performing this test. Since establishing of an OECD Test Guideline for this assay will require some further time, {{there is a need for}} an agreed approach on the minimum requirements on conduction and reporting of the in vivo Comet assay, which should be fulfilled for the purposes of EFSA during this transition period...|$|R

40|$|Genotoxicity of α,β-unsaturated {{aldehydes}} {{shown in}} vitro raises {{a concern for}} the use of the aldehydes as <b>food</b> <b>flavourings,</b> while at low dose exposures the formation of DNA adducts may be prevented by detoxification. Unlike many α,β-unsaturated aldehydes for which in vivo data are absent, cinnamaldehyde was shown to be not genotoxic or carcinogenic in vivo. The present study aimed at comparing dose-dependent DNA adduct formation by cinnamaldehyde and 18 acyclic food-borne α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using physiologically based kinetic/dynamic (PBK/D) modelling. In rats, cinnamaldehyde was predicted to induce higher DNA adducts levels than 6 out of the 18 α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, indicating that these 6 aldehydes may also test negative in vivo. At the highest cinnamaldehyde dose that tested negative in vivo, cinnamaldehyde was predicted to form at least three orders of magnitude higher levels of DNA adducts than the 18 aldehydes at their respective estimated daily intake. These results suggest that for all the 18 α,β-unsaturated aldehydes DNA adduct formation at doses relevant for human dietary exposure may not raise a concern. The present study illustrates a possible use of physiologically based in silico modelling to facilitate a science-based comparison and read-across on the possible risks posed by DNA reactive agents. </p...|$|E

Due to their importance in plants and human health, {{it would be useful to}} have a better understanding of flavonoid concentration and biological activities that could indicate their potentials as therapeutic agents, and also for predicting and controlling the quality of medicinal herbs. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is a famous and widely used herb, especially in Asia, that contains several interesting bioactive constituents and possesses health promoting properties. In this study, total flavonoids and some flavonoid components including quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol and naringenin were extracted from the leaves and rhizomes of two varieties of Zingiber officinale (Halia Bentong and Halia Bara) at three different growth points (8, 12 and 16 weeks after planting), and analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method in order to determine the potential of the subterranean part of the young ginger. The results showed that Halia Bara had a higher content of flavonoids in the leaves and rhizomes as compared to Halia Bentong. In both varieties, the concentration of flavonoids in the leaves decreased (Halia Bentong, 42. 3 %; Halia Bara 36. 7 %), and in the rhizomes it increased (Halia Bentong 59. 6 %; Halia Bara 60. 1 %) as the growth period increased. Quercetin was abundant in both varieties. The antioxidant activity determined by the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay showed high activities (65. 7 %) in the leaves of Halia Bara at 8 weeks after planting.

40|$|Abstract Background Worldwide, {{herbs and}} spices are much used <b>food</b> <b>flavourings.</b> However, little data exist {{regarding}} actual dietary intake of culinary {{herbs and spices}}. We developed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) {{for the assessment of}} habitual diet the preceding year, with focus on phytochemical rich food, including herbs and spices. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the intakes of herbs and spices from the FFQ with estimates of intake from another dietary assessment method. Thus we compared the intake estimates from the FFQ with 28 days of estimated records of herb and spice consumption as a reference method. Methods The evaluation study was conducted among 146 free living adults, who filled in the FFQ and 2 - 4 weeks later carried out 28 days recording of herb and spice consumption. The FFQ included a section with questions about 27 individual culinary herbs and spices, while the records were open ended records for recording of herbs and spice consumption exclusively. Results Our study showed that the FFQ obtained slightly higher estimates of total intake of herbs and spices than the total intake assessed by the Herbs and Spice Records (HSR). The correlation between the two assessment methods with regard to total intake was good (r = 0. 5), and the cross-classification suggests that the FFQ may be used to classify subjects according to total herb and spice intake. For the 8 most frequently consumed individual herbs and spices, the FFQ obtained good estimates of median frequency of intake for 2 herbs/spices, while good estimates of portion sizes were obtained for 4 out of 8 herbs/spices. Conclusions Our results suggested that the FFQ was able to give good estimates of frequency of intake and portion sizes on group level for several of the most frequently used herbs and spices. The FFQ was only able to fairly rank subjects according to frequency of intake of the 8 most frequently consumed herbs and spices. Other studies are warranted to further explore the intakes of culinary spices and herbs. </p...|$|E
