6000|$|... "Toby {{was in the}} way {{of hiding}} his culinary bones in the small gardens [...] before his own and the {{neighbouring}} doors. Mr. Scrymgeour, two doors [...] off, a bulky, choleric, red-faced man--torvo vultu--was, by law of [...] contrast, a great cultivator of flowers, and he had often scowled Toby [...] into all but non-existence by a stamp of his foot and a glare of his [...] eye. One day, his gate being open, in walks Toby with a huge bone, [...] and making a hole where Scrymgeour had two minutes before been [...] planting some precious slip, the name of which on paper and on a stick [...] Toby made very light of, substituted his bone, and was engaged [...] covering it, or thinking he was covering it up with his shovelling [...] nose, when S. spied him through the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door,</b> and was out upon [...] him, like the Assyrian, with a terrific gowl. I watched them. [...] Instantly Toby made at him with a roar too, and an eye more torve than [...] Scrymgeour's, who, retreating without reserve, fell prostrate, there [...] is reason to believe, in his own lobby. Toby contented himself with [...] proclaiming his victory at the door, and, returning, finished his bone- [...] planting at his leisure; the enemy, who had scuttled behind the glass [...] door, glared at him. From this moment Toby was an altered dog. Pluck [...] at first sight was lord of all [...] . That very evening he paid a visit [...] to Leo, next door's dog, a big tyrannical bully and coward [...] . To [...] him Toby paid a visit that very evening, down into his den, and walked [...] about, as much as to say, 'Come on, Macduff'; but Macduff did not come [...] on." ...|$|E
50|$|The St. John’s Cemetery Chapel was {{converted}} from a storage shed into a chapel. The official ground breaking was in 2003, and the chapel was blessed {{in the fall}} of 2009. A small flagstone courtyard, flanked by stone benches leads to the chapel, whose exterior was finished to compliment the exterior of St John's the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church on East Second Street. Above the entrance hangs a small iron cross that was found on the property, which originally marked the burial site of an unknown Union soldier. The entrance is made up to two sets of doors, the outer gate, which originally served as the cemeteries Fourth Street entrance gates, and the <b>inner</b> full <b>glass</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>doors</b> {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|R
40|$|Cloud-to-ground {{lightning}} strikes produce natural {{glasses on the}} surface of the Earth, called fulgurites. These natural glasses are tubular in shape with a central void surrounded by an <b>inner</b> <b>glass,</b> and the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> is surrounded by an outer crust or toasted region. Previous studies report different kinds of melts existing in several different types of fulgurites; however, little to no chemical data has been collected that tracks chemical variations from the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> to the outer crust of a fulgurite. This study uses microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analytical techniques to collect transects of chemical composition from the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> to the outer crust of eleven fulgurites. Five of the eleven fulgurite samples show a well-mixed, volatile-depleted <b>inner</b> <b>glass,</b> enclosed in a poorly mixed volatile enriched outer melt, suggesting that these fulgurites formed from the vaporization and condensation of materials on the inner fulgurite wall. The remaining six fulgurites show poorly mixed melts in both the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> and outer crust regions, and most likely originated as lightning-produced melting phenomena. These data suggest that certain enigmatic natural glasses, such as Edeowie, Dakhleh and other unknown desert glasses, may be lightning-produced, in contrast to the meteorite burst or impact related origins that have commonly been propounded...|$|R

50|$|To {{reduce their}} {{negative}} thermal {{impact on the}} living space, <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> should have insulated frames and be double or triple glazed, with low-emissivity coatings and gas filling (typically argon). Metal framed <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> should also have thermal breaks. The doors should be properly sized and protected (using shades, blinds, curtains and other means).|$|R
5000|$|Swinging <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> are {{a better}} choice than the typical sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> since they offer a much tighter seal, but glass - even the best type of glass, chosen {{according}} to the climate zone - is always a poor insulator, making doors based on them a poor choice from a thermal comfort perspective.|$|R

Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> ambigrams, {{because they can be}} printed on a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> to be read differently when entering or exiting.|$|R
5000|$|Slightly {{less than}} two months after, a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> at Jurong East's Jem mall {{shattered}} on the evening of Nov 29 2013. The <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> is located on the first floor next to clothing retailer H&M, a third of the glass partition shattered into smaller pieces. The mall's spokesman said no one was hurt in the accident.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the party}} hosts could be found, Officer Hopper left the kitchen, exiting through a side door. He searched the darkened, narrow path area behind the {{home with his}} {{flashlight}} before coming upon a <b>glass</b> <b>door.</b> Behind the door stood Lee and his friend, fellow actor Jeff Denton. The two were in Denton's bedroom chatting with another actor when they saw Officer Hopper's flashlight shine through the <b>glass</b> <b>door.</b> Officer Hopper then shot through the <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> nine times, hitting Lee {{a total of four}} times, once in the head and three times in the back. Lee died at the scene. Officer Hopper later said he fired his weapon because Lee aimed his replica gun at him, and he was unaware that the gun was not real.|$|R

50|$|A sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> or patio door, {{is a type}} of {{sliding door}} in {{architecture}} and construction, is a large glass window opening in a structure that provide door access from a room to the outdoors, fresh air, and copious natural light. A sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> is usually considered a single unit consisting of two panel sections, one being fixed and one a being mobile to slide open. Another design, a wall sized <b>glass</b> pocket <b>door</b> has one or more panels movable and sliding into wall pockets, completely disappearing for a 'wide open' indoor-outdoor room experience.|$|R
