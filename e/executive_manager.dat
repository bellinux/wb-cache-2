25|$|Mr Barker was {{employed}} by the Commonwealth Bank from when he left school in 1981. By 2004 he had been promoted to a position as an <b>executive</b> <b>manager.</b> On 2 March 2009, Mr Barker was told that his position was to be made redundant and {{that if he was}} not redeployed within the Bank his employment would be terminated. Mr Barker was placed on paid leave and his access to the Bank's intranet and email facilities was terminated. Having been deprived of access to his Bank email account and voicemail, Mr Barker was not informed about an alternative position within the Bank until 26 March 2009. He was not contacted by the recruitment consultant involved in facilitating the recruitment process for that position, nor was the possibility of retraining for that role discussed with him. The Commonwealth Bank terminated Mr Barker's employment on 9 April 2009 by reason of redundancy. At the time of his dismissal, Mr Barker's salary was approximately $150,000 per annum. Mr Barker claimed that the Bank acted in breach of its own policies and in so doing breached his contract of employment because (1) the policies were incorporated into his contract or (2) of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence. Mr Barker also claimed the Commonwealth Bank engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.|$|E

40|$|More {{aggressive}} acquiring firms paid higher {{executive compensation}} than non or less aggressive acquiring firms. This paper applies the generalized propensity score (GPS) methodology {{to estimate the}} relationship between a firm’s acquisition and its executive compensation. Allowing for continuous treatment, that is, different levels of the firms’ acquisition activities, we apply the GPS method on a panel data set of Chinese Public Listed Companies (PLCs) and find that there is a causal effect of firms’ acquisition activities on executive compensation. However, there is a divergent interests between the board directors and <b>executive</b> <b>managers</b> which may bring serious agency problem in the acquisition decision. The self-selection effect plays a dominant role in the acquisition premiums of top 3 board directors, while the learning-by-acquiring effect on compensation is more prominent for <b>executive</b> <b>managers</b> than board directors. As the <b>executive</b> <b>managers</b> as a whole, can benefit more executive management positions as well as higher growth of executive compensation from aggressive acquisition than board directors and top 3 <b>executive</b> <b>managers.</b> ...|$|R

Their backstory is established {{early in the}} show: Lorelai grew up in Hartford with her old money parents, Richard and Emily, but always felt stifled by this environment. She accidentally became pregnant at age sixteen, and left home a year later to raise Rory in the close-knit town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn, where she eventually progressed from maid to <b>executive</b> <b>manager.</b> Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living like best friends, and Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has formed away from her parents. In the pilot episode, she is forced to go to them when Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School but she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, {{so long as the}} girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up the show's primary conflict, as the Gilmores are forced to face their differences and complicated history. The contrasting mother–daughter relationships of Emily–Lorelai and Lorelai–Rory become a defining theme of the show.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This is a study that examines the practices and characteristics of executive-level managers in technology-based multinational corporations. Two overriding questions {{are designed to be}} answered: 1. What do effective <b>executive</b> <b>managers</b> do? 2. How do top company executives perform their job relative to these effectiveness-based criteria? These questions are answered in part in terms of the literature and in terms of field research performed on <b>executive</b> <b>managers.</b> The research has focused on the examination of managers in environments characterized by a high degree of change. From a synthesis of research-based skills and abilities on effective executives identified through extensive literature search an "Executive Management Inventory" (EMI) was developed. Subsequent to testing and validation, the EMI was used to measure work performed by corporate managers in the international environment. The sample forming the data-base of this research comprised <b>executive</b> <b>managers,</b> principally General Managers, employed in,multinational corporations headquartered in six nations worldwide: United States United Kingdom West Germany Sweden Japan Korea The six nations were further classified into three regional clusters: Anglo-American Nordic-European Far-Eastern Differences among these <b>executive</b> <b>managers</b> are statistically tested for significance. Interviews were also conducted with successful executives representing each of the six nations comprising the data-base. Not only are conclusions drawn in the conventional way, but inferences are also made with reference to the larger population...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{in this thesis}} is to investigate the effects of organizational change. This is done through the review of literature and empirical analysis. An {{important part of this}} process involves developing measurements of the main constructs of interest; job satisfaction, uncertainty, commitment and change readiness. The relationship between the main constructs and change readiness is then investigated with special emphasis on testing hypotheses introduced under the first of three propositions. Further analysis then investigates two more propositions, one testing the assimilation of attitudes of <b>Executive</b> <b>Managers</b> and employees’ to organizational change, and one testing the relationship between the rate of change and change readiness. The study is based on two types of primary data. One is a questionnaire survey administered among employees of three Icelandic governmental organizations, all considered applicable for a merger. Another type of data was gathered by conducting interviews with <b>Executive</b> <b>Managers</b> of all three organizations. Findings suggest that change readiness increases as measured levels of job satisfaction increases. Findings also suggest that change readiness increases as uncertainty decreases, but the relationship between change readiness and commitment is not determined by the findings. Two of the three organizations surveyed had significantly different levels of change readiness. Findings suggest that employees’ change readiness is reflected in the attitudes of <b>Executive</b> <b>Managers.</b> Findings also suggest that employees and <b>Executive</b> <b>Managers</b> in organizations facing discontinuous or radical change do not report lower levels of change readiness, than those facing incremental organizational change...|$|R
