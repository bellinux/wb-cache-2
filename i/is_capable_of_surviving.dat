5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, it <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while {{the remainder of the}} virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{invites the}} {{regional}} branch managers and Dunder Mifflin Scranton Human Resources representative Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) to a corporate wilderness retreat, {{but does not}} invite Michael Scott (Carell). To show that he <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> in the wilderness, Michael leaves Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{in charge of the}} office and instructs Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to abandon him deep in the forest with merely a knife and a roll of duct tape. Contrary to Michael's wishes, Dwight stays behind and surreptitiously monitors his condition from a distance. Michael proves to be completely incapable of living out in the wild by himself. Dwight is forced to come out of hiding to save Michael when he tries to eat wild mushrooms.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that beach vitex possesses a combinational dormancy mechanism. This dormancy mechanism {{is made up}} of a physical dormancy component and a physiological dormancy component. The physical dormancy mechanism is believed to be inforced at least in part by cuticular alkanes that prevent water penetration. The mechanism of the physiological dormancy component is not yet fully understood. This dormancy mechanism allows {{for the establishment of a}} substantial soil seed bank that <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> and producing new seedlings in excess of 4 years after all vegetation has been removed. Dormancy mechanisms also allow the plant to undergo long-distance dispersal.|$|E

25|$|The only {{species of}} Rattus that <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> {{the climate of}} Alberta is the brown rat, which can only survive in the prairie region of the province, and even then must overwinter in buildings. Although {{it is a major}} {{agricultural}} area, Alberta is far from any seaport and only a portion of its eastern boundary with Saskatchewan provides a favorable entry route for rats. Brown rats cannot survive in the wild boreal forest to the north, the Rocky Mountains to the west, nor can they safely cross the semiarid High Plains of Montana to the south. The first brown rat did not reach Alberta until 1950, and in 1951, the province launched a rat-control program that included shooting, poisoning, and gassing rats, and bulldozing, burning down, and blowing up rat-infested buildings. The effort was backed by legislation that required every person and every municipality to destroy and prevent the establishment of designated pests. If they failed, the provincial government could carry out the necessary measures and charge the costs to the landowner or municipality.|$|E
25|$|Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is a {{bacterial}} subspecies traditionally isolated from European yogurts. Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44 {{differs from the}} rest of the L. bulgaricus strains as it was isolated from the leaves of Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria, becoming the only known strain of this subspecies that has vegan origin (not from yogurt) available as a commercial probiotic. Probiotics are health promoting bacteria which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a benefit on the host, normally associated with positive effects on the digestive and immune systems, and are usually prescribed during or after antibiotic treatment to alleviate the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Probiotics are also associated with decreasing of the risk of traveler’s diarrhea. The natural habitat of the snowdrop flower are European mountainous regions. Thus, GLB44 <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> in freezing temperatures, as the snowdrop flowers between January and May in nature, when the temperatures can fall below freezing in this region. These characteristics of its natural habitat allows for GLB44 to survive in foods that are plant based and remain unaffected when stored in refrigerator temperatures.|$|E
500|$|Epaulette sharks have nocturnal {{habits and}} {{frequent}} shallow water on coral reefs or in tidal pools. This shark has evolved {{to cope with}} the severe night time oxygen depletion (hypoxia) in isolated tidal pools by increasing the blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non-essential neural functions. It <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> complete anoxia for an hour without ill effects, and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia-tolerant animals. Rather than swim, epaulette sharks often [...] "walk" [...] by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins. This species feeds {{on a wide range of}} small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. Epaulette sharks are oviparous, with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from August to December. Due to their hardiness and small size, epaulette sharks are popular with both public and home aquaria. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern, as outside of the small aquarium trade it is of little interest to fisheries.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that <b>is,</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> outside the womb.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} marry a person of a {{different}} race was addressed in Loving v. Virginia, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. Advocates of substantive due process have sought to extend Loving {{in order to establish}} other rights (such as a right to same-sex marriage). A right to have children was addressed in Skinner v. Oklahoma, but the Court in Skinner, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that Meyer might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that [...] "shock the conscience" [...] of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in Rochin v. California, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant's stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment's ban on self-incrimination. The Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous mentally ill person who <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger's concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to [...] "punishment" [...] for being mentally ill, violating the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in Robinson v. California. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in BMW v. Gore, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in Cruzan v. Missouri, decided, in 1990, that due process is not violated if a state applies [...] "a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state." ...|$|E
