I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking back now <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which I can remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, {{and it was a}} most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> [...] always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E
500|$|Whitman {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by deism. He denied any one faith {{was more important}} than another, and embraced all religions equally. In [...] "Song of Myself", he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem [...] "With Antecedents", affirming: [...] "I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception". In 1874, he was invited to write a poem about the Spiritualism movement, to which he responded, [...] "It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude [...]" [...] Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none. God, to Whitman, was both immanent and transcendent and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development. American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who [...] "took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Portal 2s {{additional}} gameplay elements, like light bridges, lasers, and the gels, were praised {{as appropriate}} {{additions to the}} game. Reviewers were pleased with {{the difficulty of the}} puzzles throughout the game, which appeared visually complicated at first but had uncomplicated solutions. Times Evan Narcisse said that he feared the addition of new gameplay elements would [...] "dilute the purity of the experience, but everything's still executed with Valve's high level of charm and panache." [...] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph praised the manner with which these elements were introduced through a [...] "brilliant learning curve of direction, rather than instruction", and considered it a [...] "design ethos that is supremely generous, but dealt with marvellous economy". Chris Kohler of Wired wrote that the game's puzzles [...] "never require excessively complicated solutions", and that much of the puzzle solving is [...] "filled with moments that will have you slapping your forehead and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm such an idiotwhy didn't <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> before?. Stapleton was not as pleased with the gel additions as with the other new mechanics, calling it [...] "difficult to control". He felt that they have [...] "only a couple of uses at most". Bright felt that Portal 2 was easier than its predecessor, in part that he felt much of the game was effectively tutorials for the new gameplay additions, requiring [...] "careful use of the tools provided", leaving him with the impression that [...] "the game was on rails".|$|E

500|$|After {{being hired}} by Jive Records {{to create a}} remix for [...] "Oveprotected", Rodney Jerkins {{revealed}} that the label [...] "needed a remix that's crazy." [...] Jerkins said the remix has [...] "an old-school-type rhythm, which I think is kinda cool because it's an element [...] never had, but I still gave it her edge. I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, because <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> in her." [...] Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled [...] "JS16 Dub" [...] and [...] "JS16 Remix". The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears' debut movie, Crossroads (2002).|$|E
500|$|In 1813, {{with the}} tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously {{consider}} the question of Charlotte's marriage. [...] The Prince Regent and his advisors decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. [...] Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself {{and many of the}} guests. [...] Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers. [...] Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. [...] According to Charlotte, [...] "He spoke as if he had the most improper ideas of my inclinations. [...] <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he is compleatly [...] poisoned against me, and that he will never come round." [...] She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry [...] "the Orange or the Cheese" [...] (a reference to Gloucester cheese), [...] "Slender Billy" [...] or [...] "Silly Billy". [...] The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that [...] "I could not quit this country, as Queen of England still less" [...] and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to [...] "visit his frogs solo". [...] However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. [...] She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.|$|E

2500|$|We {{have never}} dreamt of {{incorporating}} into our Union any but the Caucasian race—the free white race.
