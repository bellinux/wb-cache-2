50|$|Another issue, {{more widely}} debated, is scale—how to address broad-based systems {{of power and}} issues of complexity, {{especially}} those of another development on a global scale. How can PAR develop a macro-orientation to democratic dialogue and meet challenges of the 21st Century, by joining movements to support justice and solidarity on both local and global scales? By keeping things closely tied to local group dynamics, PAR {{runs the risk of}} substituting small-scale participation for genuine democracy and fails to develop strategies for social transformation on all levels. Given its political implications, community-based action research and its consensus ethos have been known to fall prey to powerful stakeholders and serve as Trojan horses to bring global and <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring</b> processes directly to local settings, bypassing legitimate institutional buffers and obscuring diverging interests and the exercise of power during the process. Cooptation can lead to highly manipulated outcomes. Against this criticism, others argue that, given the right circumstances, it is possible to build institutional arrangements for joint learning and action across regional and national borders that can have impacts on citizen action, national policies and global discourses.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that certain behavioral change techniques may help prevent or treat childhood obesity. A recent survey of the literature revealed six techniques that proved effective: providing information on behavior specific to the individual (e.g., “You should not eat so much sugar, like when you have candy after school.”), <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring,</b> prompt practice, identification of a role model, stress management and emotional control training, and general communication skills training.16 While these techniques are useful, {{further research is needed}} to understand how they can best be incorporated into programs for at-risk or obese children. The survey also cites four management techniques that did not promote prevention or intervention: providing information on the consequences of behavior in general (e.g., “Eating too much sugar is bad for one’s health.”) did not promote effective intervention. In a similar vein, providing reward contingent on successful behavior and facilitating social comparison were not effective in preventing childhood obesity. Many interventions center around promoting exercise and physical activity. Research has found that while interventions that utilize supervised exercise reduce BMI most effectively, interventions with a component promoting physical activity were more likely to generate lasting change in physical activity regardless of whether or not there was a supervised exercise component.|$|E

40|$|As Ecological Modernisation Theory {{has been}} {{developed}} {{against the background of}} European industrialised societies, the value and applicability of Ecological Modernisation Theory for developing or industrialising economies is often questioned.

The analysis of <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring</b> of contemporary economic developments in Viet Nam focuses on three major issues: state‐market relations, technology development, and environmental awareness. Regarding all three issues major deviations are found from an environmental reform trajectory as hypothesised by Ecological Modernisation Theory. The study thus concludes that Ecological Modernisation Theory is of limited value for analysing contemporary processes of and attempts at environmental reform in Viet Nam. However, recent developments in Viet Nam such as economic liberalisation, privatisation and internationalisation and the slowly starting democratisation of governance offer ecological modernisation‐inspired opportunities to incorporate environmental considerations in the economic development of Viet Nam.

This review sought {{to describe the}} behaviour change strategies used within interventions that have sought to reduce sedentary behaviour in adults. Studies were identified through existing literature reviews, a systematic database search, and hand-searches of eligible papers. Interventions were categorised as ‘very promising’, ‘quite promising’, or ‘non-promising’ according to observed behaviour changes. Intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were compared across promising and non-promising interventions. Twenty-six eligible studies reported thirty-eight interventions, of which twenty (53 %) were worksite-based. Fifteen interventions (39 %) were very promising, eight quite promising (21 %), and fifteen non-promising (39 %). Very or quite promising interventions tended to have targeted sedentary behaviour instead of physical activity. Interventions based on <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring,</b> persuasion, or education were most promising. Self-monitoring, problem solving, and restructuring the social or physical environment were particularly promising behaviour change techniques.

There are three main reasons to reconsider the contemporary role of knowledge and information in environmental reform. First, the amount of available environmental knowledge and information is growing on almost all environmental issues, for all kinds of decisionmakers (private and public, institu-tional and individual), through increasing scientific research, monitoring practices, information storage capacity, information transport, and scientific understanding. Here, environmental information refers not only to information {{on the state of the}} environment, or on the `additions and withdrawals ' (the emissions and exploitation of natural resources), but to a wider category of knowledge and information, in any form, that has relevance for dealing with environmental challenges.

As a result, these patients {{are more vulnerable}} to potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP). PIP in older patients may result in adverse drug events and hospitalisations. However, little {{has been done to}} identify why PIP occurs. The objectives of this study were; (1) to identify hospital doctors' perceptions as to why PIP occurs, (2) to identify the barriers to addressing the issues identified, and (3) to determine which intervention types would be best suited to improving prescribing. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), a tool used to apply behaviour change theories, were conducted with 22 hospital doctors. Content analysis was conducted to identify domains of the TDF that could be targeted to improve prescribing for older people. These domains were then mapped to the behaviour change wheel to identify possible intervention types. RESULTS: Content analysis identified 5 of the 12 domains in the TDF as relevant; (1) environmental context and resources, (2) knowledge, (3) skills, (4) social influences and (5) memory/attention and decision processes. Using the behaviour change wheel, the types of interventions deemed suitable were those based on training and <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring.</b> CONCLUSION: This study show that doctors feel there is insufficient emphasis on geriatric pharmacotherapy in their undergraduate/postgraduate training.

It finds that recent investments by IPPs have reduced the pollution-intensity of electricity generation in the country. Yet they have not brought the significant gains seen in countries such as the UK, nor are they likely to in the foreseeable future. This is largely a product of the nature and context of electricity sector reform in India which is less favourable to environmentally beneficial outcomes.

It investigates the determinants, problems and prospects of this situation. The study makes use of data collected from primary and secondary sources during which the city was divided into identifiable residential districts. A total of 200 questionnaires were administered for information on the views of residents about their residential areas. Among major findings of the study are that ethnic enclaves in the city present a mixed bag of fortunes. In the first place, ethnic enclaves appear to offer residents a psychological sense of security which is simultaneously counter balanced by an equal sense of insecurity especially during any ethnic conflict. Secondly, since most Nigerians tend to vote along ethnic lines, ethnic enclaves may make themselves easy targets for discrimination by a government that is not supported during an election.   Thirdly, land use may assume different and discordant colouration based on tribal attitudes and habits irrespective of planning laws. It is therefore common to see neighborhoods in laid-out areas experiencing different dimensions of <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring</b> in planned residential areas, a phenomenon which is fast resulting into many residential areas developing into unsightly landscape. Based on these findings the study offers suggestions as to how socio-cultural settings of residents can be integrated into the city residential planning.

40|$|Melioidosis, {{an often}} fatal {{infectious}} disease in Northeast Thailand, {{is caused by}} skin inoculation, inhalation or ingestion of the environmental bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei. The major underlying risk factor for melioidosis is diabetes mellitus. Recommendations for melioidosis prevention include using protective gear such as rubber boots and gloves when {{in direct contact with}} soil and environmental water, and consuming bottled or boiled water. Only a small proportion of people follow such recommendations. Nine focus group discussions were conducted to evaluate barriers to adopting recommended preventive behaviours. A total of 76 diabetic patients from northeast Thailand participated in focus group sessions. Barriers to adopting the recommended preventive behaviours and future intervention strategies were identified using two frameworks: the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Barriers were identified in the following five domains: (i) knowledge, (ii) beliefs about consequences, (iii) intention and goals, (iv) environmental context and resources, and (v) social influence. Of 76 participants, 72 (95 %) had never heard of melioidosis. Most participants saw no harm in not adopting recommended preventive behaviours, and perceived rubber boots and gloves to be hot and uncomfortable while working in muddy rice fields. Participants reported that they normally followed the behaviour of friends, family and their community, the majority of whom did not wear boots while working in rice fields and did not boil water before drinking. Eight intervention functions were identified as relevant for the intervention: (i) education, (ii) persuasion, (iii) incentivisation, (iv) coercion, (v) modeling, (vi) <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring,</b> (vii) training, and (viii) enablement. Participants noted that input from role models in the form of physicians, diabetic clinics, friends and families, and from the government via mass media would be required for them to change their behaviours. There are numerous barriers to the adoption of behaviours recommended for melioidosis prevention. We recommend that a multifaceted intervention at community and government level is required to achieve the desired behaviour changes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Poorly {{controlled}} type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} (T 2 DM) {{can be seen as}} failure to meet recommended targets for management of key risk factors including glycaemic control, blood pressure and lipids. Poor control of risk factors is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Failure to intensify medications for patients with poor control of T 2 DM when indicated is called clinical inertia and is one contributory factor to poor control of T 2 DM. We aimed to develop a theory and evidence-based complex intervention to improve appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled T 2 DM in Irish general practice. METHODS: The first stage of the Medical Research Council Framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions was utilised. To identify current evidence, we performed a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled T 2 DM in community settings. The Behaviour Change Wheel theoretical approach was used to identify suitable intervention functions. Workshops, simulation, collaborations with academic partners and observation of physicians were utilised to operationalise the intervention functions and design the elements of the complex intervention. RESULTS: Our systematic review highlighted that professional-based interventions, potentially through clinical decision support systems, could address poorly controlled T 2 DM. Appropriate intensification of anti-glycaemic and cardiovascular medications, by general practitioners (GPs), for adults with poorly controlled T 2 DM was identified as the key behaviour to address clinical inertia. Psychological capability was the key driver of the behaviour, which needed to change, suggesting five key intervention functions (education, training, enablement, <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring</b> and incentivisation) and nine key behaviour change techniques, which were operationalised into a complex intervention. The intervention has three components: (a) a training program/academic detailing of target GPs, (b) a remote finder tool to help GPs identify patients with poor control of T 2 DM in their practice and (c) A web-based clinical decision support system. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a multifaceted process including an exploration of current evidence and a thorough theoretical understanding of the predictors of the behaviour resulting in the design of a complex intervention to promote the implementation of evidence-based guidelines, through appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled T 2 DM...|$|E

40|$|Food {{plays an}} {{important}} role in people 2 ̆ 7 s health and well being. Eating a healthy diet can improve overall health and reduce the likelihood of developing chronic illness. Although technology has shown promise in supporting healthy eating, more recent research has revealed that sociotechnical interventions may only have small, short-term effects on behavior. There are certainly many factors that influence people 2 ̆ 7 s eating behaviors including educational level, knowledge of cooking, self-efficacy, one 2 ̆ 7 s upbringing, and personal values. Sociotechnical interventions have primarily focused on psychosocial factors (e. g., self-efficacy, knowledge, values), overlooking environmental influences - those external to an individual that create the context in which behaviors take place. These environmental factors, such as the availability of healthy food and the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food outlets, have a major influence on eating behavior, however few studies have considered the role that technology might play in addressing them. This dissertation works at the intersection of technology and health behavior theory to understand how we can create effective healthy eating interventions and support people in engaging with their environment in a way that facilitates healthy eating. We built an Android application, Snack Buddy, to serve as a probe to explore the factors that affect people 2 ̆ 7 s eating behaviors. In doing so, we found that the environment was the most salient factor, leading us to further explore the role technology can play in helping people create healthier food environments for themselves. We discovered technology could support people in <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring</b> [...] the practice of creating an environment supportive of healthy eating [...] and in navigating the constraints in their lives that prevent them from accessing healthy food. This last issue was especially important for people with low socioeconomic status and people who experience food insecurity. For these people, technology presents an opportunity to facilitate greater participation in how food environments are architected and created, while at the same time expanding their own capacity to access healthy food. This dissertation finds that technology can expand their capacity by helping them exercise greater control in their lives and expand their social support network with people who face similar challenges...|$|E

Design 15 bibliographic databases, and reference lists and citations of key papers, were searched for randomised controlled trials of home-based behavioural interventions reporting behavioural or health outcomes. Setting Participants' homes. Participants Community-dwelling adults aged ??? 65 ???years with frailty or at risk of frailty. Primary and secondary outcome measures Trials were coded for effects on thematically clustered behavioural, health and well-being outcomes. Intervention content was described using 96 behaviour change techniques, and 9 functions (eg, education, <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring).</b> Results 19 eligible trials reported 22 interventions. Physical functioning was most commonly assessed (19 interventions). Behavioural outcomes were assessed for only 4 interventions. Effectiveness on most outcomes was limited, with at most 50 % of interventions showing potential positive effects on behaviour, and 42 % on physical functioning. 3 techniques (instruction on how to perform behaviour, adding objects to environment, restructuring physical environment) and 2 functions (education and enablement) were more commonly found in interventions showing potential than those showing no potential to improve physical function. Intervention content was not linked to effectiveness on other outcomes. Conclusions Interventions appeared to have greatest impact on physical function where they included behavioural instructions, environmental modification and practical social support. Yet, mechanisms of effects are unclear, because impact on behavioural outcomes has rarely been considered. Moreover, the robustness of our findings is also unclear, because interventions have been poorly reported. Greater engagement with behavioural science is needed when developing and evaluating home-based health interventions...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{childhood}} obesity are increasing, {{and it is}} essential to identify the active components of interventions aiming to prevent and manage obesity in children. A systematic review of behaviour change interventions was conducted to find evidence of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) that are most effective in changing physical activity and/or eating behaviour for the prevention or management {{of childhood}} obesity. An electronic search was conducted for randomised controlled trials published between January 1990 and December 2009. Of 4309 titles and abstracts screened, full texts of 135 articles were assessed, of which 17 published articles were included in this review. Intervention descriptions were coded according to the behaviour-specific CALO-RE taxonomy of BCTs. BCTs were identified and compared across obesity management (n= 9) vs prevention (n= 8) trials. To assess the effectiveness of individual BCTs, trials were further divided into those that were effective (defined as either a group reduction of at least 0. 13 body mass index (BMI) units or a significant difference in BMI between intervention and control groups at follow-up) vs non-effective (reported no significant differences between groups). We reliably identified BCTs utilised in effective and non-effective prevention and management trials. To illustrate the relative effectiveness of each BCT, effectiveness ratios were calculated as the ratio of the number of times each BCT was a component of an intervention in an effective trial divided by the number of times they were a component of all trials. Results indicated six BCTs that may be effective components of future management interventions (provide information on the consequences of behaviour to the individual, <b>environmental</b> <b>restructuring,</b> prompt practice, prompt identification as role model/position advocate, stress management/emotional control training and general communication skills training), and one that may be effective in prevention interventions (prompting generalisation of a target behaviour). We identified that for management trials, providing information on the consequences of behaviour in general was a feature of non-effective interventions and for prevention trials, providing information on the consequences of behaviour in general, providing rewards contingent on successful behaviour and facilitating social comparison were non-effective. To design effective behaviour change programmes for the prevention and management of childhood obesity, we would recommend utilising the BCTs identified as effective in this review. The impact on intervention effectiveness of combining BCTs should be the topic of further research...|$|E
40|$|Environmental health {{regulation}} {{has been developed}} {{on the premise that}} both problems and solutions are obvious, requiring only attention and commitment. The result has been impossible legislative goals and frenetic, unfocused agency efforts to deal with too many issues. Preventing all environmental health problems is impossible and not the best approach; instead, attention ought to be shifted toward reacting quickly to problems before irreversible, severe health damage has occurred. Rather than having regulatory agencies attempt to manage all problems, they should be focused on exemplifying goals and productive approaches, and on handling a few major issues. Regulatory agencies should be managing the nonregulatory institutions to ensure that they are effective in dealing with the myriad issues that the agencies {{will never be able to}} handle. The inherent limitations of federal regulatory agencies must be recognized to <b>restructure</b> <b>environmental</b> health management to be more effective in lowering risks while being efficient, administratively simple, and more equitable. The history of environmental health problems is grim. Workers labored in dust clouds of asbestos, cotton, coal, or silica so thick they could barely see a few feet. A large proportion of the Japanese living in a communit...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{metabolism}} {{is characterized}} by a remarkable capacity to rapidly adapt to <b>environmental</b> changes. We <b>restructured</b> the central metabolic network in Escherichia coli to force a higher production of NADPH, and then grew this strain in conditions favoring adaptive evolution. A six-fold increase in growth capacity was attained that could be attributed in multiple clones, after whole genome mutation mapping, to a specific single mutation. Each clone had an evolved NuoF*(E 183 A) enzyme in the respiratory complex I that can now oxidize both NADH and NADPH. When a further strain was constructed with an even higher degree of NADPH stress such that growth was impossible on glucose mineral medium, a solid-state screening for mutations restoring growth, led to two different types of NuoF mutations in strains having recovered growth capacity. In addition to the previously seen E 183 A mutation other clones showed a E 183 G mutation, both having NADH and NADPH oxidizing ability. These results demonstrate the unique solution used by E. coli to overcome the NADPH stress problem. This solution creates a new function for NADPH that is no longer restricted to anabolic synthesis reactions but can now be also used to directly produce catabolic energy...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive {{behaviors}} are garnering {{a great deal}} of national attention in research, policy, and practice circles. The majority of these problematic behaviors occur in non-classroom settings, where students outnumber staff and structure is lacking. Although strategies, like active supervision, are effective at reducing problem behavior in these settings, adults often miss opportunities to implement these strategies to achieve desired results. Project RECESS (<b>Restructuring</b> <b>Environmental</b> Contingencies and Enhancing Self-Managed Supervision) introduces a behavioral approach to increase adult active supervision through the use of self-management. Specifically, four recess supervisors participated in a brief training on active supervision and engaged in self-management by filling out a supervision checklist and direct behavior ratings (DBR). Using a multiple baseline across participants design, I introduced the intervention to participants in a randomly assigned order, and I examined the fidelity, effects (measured by direct observations of staff and students and recordings of interactions), and social validity of the RECESS intervention. Results suggest that the brief training and self-management may be associated with increases in some of the active supervision interactions, specifically prompting and praising. There was no change in students’ problematic behavior, although it was at low levels through each phase. This exploratory study has potential implications for schools, and researchers...|$|R
