500|$|Trademarks and {{characteristics}} that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't really matter {{if something is}} hard to play or not. The thing is, what does <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> {{your mind when you}} listen to it? Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and [...] "robotic" [...] death metal vocals.|$|E
500|$|The judging panel, {{headed by}} Calcedonio Ferrari, ruled {{following}} a swift deliberation that Feletti should be released {{as he had}} acted under instructions from {{the government of the}} time. The interval between the priest's arrest and his trial, coupled with the swift progress being made towards Italian unification, meant that the Mortara case had lost much of its prominence, so there was little protest against the decision. The Jewish press expressed disappointment—an editorial in the Italian Jewish paper L'Educatore israelitico suggested that it had perhaps been unwise to target Feletti rather than someone more senior. In France Archives Israélites took a similar line, positing: [...] "what good does <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> strike at the arm when it is the head that in this case conceived, carried out, and sanctioned the attack?" ...|$|E

But Uberto/King James sees insignias of {{his ancestors}} and learns that Elena's father is Douglas, the King's tutor, who has since become a rebel exiled from the court, a decision which Uberto in an aside says the King regrets. Elena's friends arrive and sing of her betrothal by her father to Rodrigo, chief of the Highlanders, a Scots tribe opposed to King James. Uberto/James becomes jealous. However, he suspects that Elena is {{not in love with}} Rodrigo (Duet: Le mie barbare vicende / [...] "What good will <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> hear about my cruel fortunes?"). Directly, he asks if there is someone she loves, and learns this was only a brief episode in her past. Encouraged, he prepares to leave Elena's house (Duet: Cielo! in qual estasi! / [...] "Heavens, I feel myself transported in ecstasy"), and he and Elena expresses similar emotions. All leave as Elena goes inside.|$|E
