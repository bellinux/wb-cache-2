Previous research on competitive advantage of ICT Clustering strategy focused on geographic location of innovation and talent, institutional and economic issues. Today, competition and ICT Clusters rely on ICT jobs that shifted from location to another. In this paper {{we try to}} explore how ICT jobs are shifted from developed countries to developing countries {{on the basis of}} ICT Clustering strategy. <b>ICT</b> <b>Job</b> shifts assessment is a new concern for ICT Clustering strategy. Propositions and conceptual model for this study are applied with an exploratory study on El Gazala ICT Cluster in Tunisia.

This rapid rate of change has produced many opportunities for organizations buy has also brought with it many challenges (Benamati & Lederer, 2001 b; Lederer & Mendelow, 1990). Among these challenges is the struggle for organizations to obtain personnel with the appropriate knowledge and skills in order to meet their ICT needs (Byrd & Turner, 2001; Doke, 1999). This is mirrored by the continual requirement for information technology (IT) professionals to keep tp-to-date with the skills required by organizations (Benamati & Lederer, 2001 a; Klobas & McGill, 1993). Previous research has investigated the importance employers place on various skills and perceived deficiencies in these skills (e. g., Doke, 1999; Leitheiser, 1992; Nelson, 1991).

Yet research on {{the economic and social}} effects of {{public access to}} computers is lacking. This volume offers the first systematic assessment of the impact of shared public access in the developing world, with findings from ten countries in South America, Asia, and Africa. It provides evidence that the benefits of diversified participation in digital society go beyond providing access to technology. Public access venues—most often Internet cafés in cities and state-run telecenters in rural areas—are places for learning, sharing, working, empowerment and finding opportunities. The book documents the impact of public access on individuals, on society and networks, and on women. Chapters report findings and examine policy implications of research on such topics as users’ perceptions of the benefits of Internet café use in Jordan; <b>ICT</b> <b>job</b> training in Rwanda; understanding user motivations and risk factors for overuse and Internet addiction in China; the effect of technology use on social inclusion among low-income urban youth in Argentina; productive uses of technologies by grassroots organizations in Peru; use of technology by migrant ethnic minority Burmese women in Thailand to maintain ties with their culture and their family and friends; and women’s limited access to the most ubiquitous type of venue, cybercafés, in practically all countries studied—and quite severely in some places, e. g.

Workers engaged in interactive learning have to be in close communication with one another. With the United States at the center of the ICT revolution, the assumption was that these jobs could not be relocated to a low-wage developing economy. Indeed, precisely because the United States dominates ICT, it is the place to which people come from around the world for ICT-related higher education and work experience.

40|$|Australia’s {{digital economy}} is {{expected}} to grow significantly over the coming years. This growth will be fuelled by new waves of technological developments. Existing technologies such as cloud services, social media and mobile devices will see growing uses in new industries, sectors and occupations. But a potentially larger source of future digital disruption will be the new technologies that are now emerging and their potential for commercial applications in the future – such as 3 D printing in manufacturing, drones in the construction industry and driverless vehicles on mining sites. The contribution of digital technologies to the Australian economy is forecast to grow from $ 79 billion in 2014 to $ 139 billion in 2020. This represents growth of over 75 % and an increase in the digital economy from 5 % to 7 % of Australia’s GDP. The vast majority of this growth (97 %) {{is expected to}} take place in sectors outside of the traditional Information, Media and Telecommunications industry. Demand for ICT workers is therefore forecast to increase in the future. In 2015, there were around 628, 000 ICT workers in Australia, with 53 % of this ICT workforce employed outside of ICT-related industries, such as in professional services, public administration and financial services (Chart i).

Although this thirst for technology consumption does not always translate into an interest in pursuing technology as a career, the need to encourage more young people to take up careers in Information and Communication Technology {{is a question of}} Australian national interest.

Next-generation, super-fast broadband will be {{a vital part of the}} emerging digital economy’s infrastructure, enabling dramatic improvements in connectivity and offering new possibilities for businesses, public services and local communities. NESTA estimates that the provision of universal super-fast broadband could directly create 600, 000 new <b>ICT</b> <b>jobs,</b> with £ 18 billion added to GDP. The indirect effects could be far larger.

But this fibre-optic infrastructure is expensive, with a baseline cost of universal provision running to £ 5 billion. NESTA is recommending a radical new deal with the telecommunications industry that will deliver superfast broadband rapidly and at minimal immediate cost to consumers or government. Ofcom, the communications regulator, should use its powers to provide radio spectrum access rights to communications companies in return for installing a fibre-optic broadband network: a ‘spectrum for speed’ swap. In addition, with intelligent government procurement, this will rapidly deliver the universal super-fast broadband network the UK will need to compete in a digital world.

40|$|This {{report is}} one of a series {{resulting}} from a project entitled ¿Competitiveness by Leveraging Emerging Technologies Economically¿ (COMPLETE), carried out by JRC-IPTS. Each of the COMPLETE studies illustrates in its own right that European companies are active on many fronts of emerging and disruptive ICT technologies and are supplying the market with relevant products and services. Nevertheless, the studies also show that the creation and growth of high tech companies is still very complex and difficult in Europe, and too many economic opportunities seem to escape European initiatives and ownership. COMPLETE helps to illustrate some of the difficulties experienced in different segments of the ICT industry and by growing potential global players. This report reflects the findings of a study conducted by Egil Juliussen and Richard Robinson, two senior experts from iSuppli Corporation on the Competitiveness of the European Automotive Embedded Software industry. The report starts by introducing the market, its trends, the technologies, their characteristics and their potential economic impact, before moving to an analysis of the competitiveness of the corresponding European industry. It concludes by suggesting policy options. The research, initially based on internal expertise and literature reviews, was complemented with further desk research, expert interviews, expert workshops and company visits. The results were ultimately reviewed by experts and also in a dedicated workshop. The report concludes that currently ICT innovation in the automotive industry is a key competence in Europe, with very little ICT innovation from outside the EU finding its way into EU automotive companies. A major benefit of a strong automotive ICT industry is the resulting large and valuable employment base.
