5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{layout of the}} fuselage suffered from the same obstruction {{as some of the}} earlier Lockheeds. The main spar and its related hump virtually separated the cockpit from the main cabin. This required two different <b>entry</b> <b>doors,</b> both requiring over-wing access.|$|E
25|$|Many {{churches were}} {{destroyed}} or severely damaged, including St. Michael's Catholic Church, which was gutted {{by the storm}} surge, breaking the <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> and stained-glass windows along the first floor; however, the interior was later removed, and the structure was still solid enough to allow repairing the church.|$|E
50|$|The central bay of the {{southern}} facade is emphasised as the main entry to the building by the triangular pedimented gable, the rendered <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> surround, the double stairway and projecting further than the end bays. Also mounted over the main <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> is the school bell.|$|R
50|$|The 1954 {{additions}} use {{brick and}} stone {{similar to the}} original section. An <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> {{in the middle of}} the west and south façades indicates the corners of the original construction. A recessed bay on the west façade with another <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> defines the start of the 1962 addition.|$|R
50|$|The {{algorithm}} is modeled {{on a waiting}} room with an entry and exit doorway. Initially the <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> is open and the exit door is closed. All processes which request entry into the critical section {{at roughly the same}} time enter the waiting room; the last of them closes the <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> and opens the exit door. The processes then enter the critical section one by one (or in larger groups if the critical section permits this). The last process to leave the critical section closes the exit door and reopens the <b>entry</b> <b>door,</b> so the next batch of processes may enter.|$|R
25|$|On {{either side}} of the <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> are medallions {{representing}} Texas commerce. At the St. Paul (west) entrance are designs of cotton and wheat, representing the two main agricultural crops of the state. At the Elm Street (north) entrance, timber and manufacturing are featured and at the Main Street (south) entrance cattle and oil are shown.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the latest}} {{production}} Fahd-240, it shares the position and <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> for the commander and the driver with the APC variant. A 2.5 ton turnable-mounted hydraulic crane is mounted on the roof rear, with a telescopic jib that has 315 degrees of traverse, with the boom being elevated to +70 degrees. The vehicle contains two hydraulic stabilizers for the crane, {{in which they are}} lowered to the ground while the crane is being used to provide a more stable platform. The vehicle is 13 tons in weight, and 2.8 meters in height.|$|E
25|$|The Plunkett-Meeks Store is {{a two-story}} gray {{building}} with a basement and attic. It has a deep pointed rubble fieldstone raised foundation and sheathed in weatherboards with a gable wood shingle roof. The wood shingles are round-butt. The building is about twenty feet wide by thirty six feet deep. The north porch is five feet by sixteen feet. The east end of the Plunkett-Meeks Store has an eight-foot by eighteen-foot temple form entry porch on brick piers. The paried four-panel <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> are flanked by 9/9 double hanging windows. The second floor has 6/9 double hanging windows.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} room (called {{the dining}} room or the palladian room), was public, and was the most elaborately decorated in the house. The classical woodwork shows touches of the fashionable rococo design. The fireplace wall has an ornate chimney breast. On {{either side of the}} fireplace are beaufats, these ones with shallower shelves than in the little parlour, and no doors. Classical broken pediments top the chimney breast and the beaufats. The floor was made of carefully matched blind-doweled planks, an expensive feature. Egg-and-dart carved patterns surround the black-walnut <b>entry</b> <b>doors.</b> During Mason's lifetime, painted or decorated paper covered the thin pine paneling on the walls. The two windows look out onto Mason's garden.|$|E
25|$|The long, {{box-shaped}} SIBMAS hull is of all-welded {{steel construction}} {{and provides the}} crew with protection from small arms fire and artillery fragments. Most SIBMAS variants possess a horizontal roofline, which slopes inwards at the rear. The engine compartment {{is located in the}} rear hull and to the left. Engine components are removed through the hull roof for servicing. Passengers may debark from a large door in the rear hull to the right. <b>Entry</b> <b>doors</b> and firing ports are also present in the sides of the vehicle, and there are three hull roof hatches for observation purposes. Drivers are seated {{at the front of the}} vehicle and provided with a single hatch cover and three large windows. The turret of the SIBMAS AFSV-90 is located near the hull front, immediately behind the driving compartment, and is provided with three large rectangular hatches.|$|E

500|$|The lower storey of the façade was {{dominated}} by a large, rounded-arched doorway in the centre. The unmoulded arch rested on wide piers, each broken by a narrow window, above which ran a simple cornice. Dance placed a transom across the doorway {{at the level of}} the cornice bearing the inscription [...] "Shakespeare Gallery". Below the transom were the main <b>entry</b> <b>doors,</b> with glazed panels and side lights matching the flanking windows. A radial fanlight filled the lunette above the transom. In each of the spandrels to the left and right of the arch, Dance set a carving of a lyre inside a ribboned wreath. Above all this ran a panelled band course dividing the lower storey from the upper.|$|E
500|$|The ornate {{historical}} Chinese {{style of}} the theatre distinguishes itself from the Neo-Renaissance exterior of the Skinner Building. Only at the street entry under the marquee does the viewer get {{a preview of the}} interior design. Here, adorning the ceiling are plaster representations of wood brackets, beams, and carved reliefs painted in a [...] scheme and decorated with stenciled dragons and flower patterns. Carved cloud shapes screen light fixtures to create an indirect lighting effect as the viewer approaches the wooden, brass knobbed <b>entry</b> <b>doors.</b> The original central free-standing box office was replaced by the current box office located {{to the side of the}} entry as part of a 1979 renovation. The original Imperial guardian lions (Ruì Shī), commonly called foo dogs or foo lions, originally located outside the entry were moved inside as part of the 1979 renovation.|$|E
500|$|The church {{interior}} has an {{open floor}} plan, with a sanctuary measuring [...] wide and [...] long. The floor plan {{is an open}} nave, with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews. Although the pews had been painted white, they have been restored to their original wood finish. The sanctuary's interior walls are plaster, and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks. The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on tongue and groove wooden planks painted white. Three large stained-glass windows, framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls. The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication, which opens into its lower hopper sash. On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main <b>entry</b> <b>doors,</b> which access an unadorned narthex. Two tapered-square pilasters support an upper gallery loft, possibly used by slaves during religious services. The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade, accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels.|$|E

500|$|The Hindu temple complex, one of {{the largest}} in North India, which has seven shrines, is built over a raised {{platform}} of [...] height in an octagonal shape. The front fascia is [...] in width while the main shrine is set [...] away from the entrance. Within the enclosed space of the yard there are residential buildings and open cattle yards on its eastern and northern directions. The front fascia of the temple has three <b>entry</b> <b>doors.</b> The main shrine which is x in size, is surrounded by a circumambulatory passage (pradakshina path) of [...] width. The entrance door, set on one side of this octagonal chamber of the shrine, faces east. The interior of the inner chamber is gold plated. The main walls of the outer chamber have 15 panels, each of [...] height. These interior panels have a surfeit of paintings of the Jammu School of painting consisting of images from the Hindu epics Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita, represented by gods such as Ganesha, Krishna, Sheshashayi Vishnu (reclining Vishnu) and also a large painting depicting the Sita Swayamvara scene (Sita choosing her husband from an elite gathering of princesses). Apart from the mythology related themes, some paintings relate to secular aspects, like Kabir, a saint, engaged in weaving and army personnel of Dogra and Sikh communities. The paintings also reveal the type of attire and the weaponry prevalent during the period of temple building. In the main shrine, the idol of Lord Rama, which is the family deity of the then king and the Dogra people, is deified in the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum). The shrine has a dome instead of the normal shikara in a pyramidal shape, which is in the Sikh architectural style. All the seven shrines have gold plated spires. Gods and Goddesses enshrined in the seven shrines are all related to the epic Ramayana. In {{one of the}} shrines there is a Shiva linga, which is carved out of black stone and measures [...] The shrines are also enshrined with a very large number of Saligramas (fossil ammonite stones specially obtained from the Gandaki river, in Nepal – a Vaishnava (Hindu) aniconic representation of Vishnu). The architectural features of the shrines are stated to be largely influenced by Mughal architecture.|$|E

2500|$|The barn is {{a two-story}} {{rectangular}} structure built in 1940. [...] It is a wood-frame {{building on a}} concrete foundation with a gambrel roof. [...] The barn has a wood shingle exterior with simple four-panel wood-casement windows. [...] There are two ground-floor <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> on the south gable end of the building.

The <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> from Fifth Avenue are minimally detailed and fit within the original street-wall framing. Divisions between the two retail spaces are of clear glass for the first several feet behind the glazed facade to minimize their visual presence. The luminous ceilings, which had suffered decades of ad hoc modifications, have been replaced with up-to-date components that accurately replicate the original appearance.
