After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor because I knew that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies." ...|$|E
500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd been doing it 7 years. I cried." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sanger said {{he found}} no {{evidence}} for a God so he became an agnostic. In an interview published in the Times newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: [...] "My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. I drifted away from those beliefs – one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God I would find it very difficult. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to see proof." ...|$|E
2500|$|Congressman Peter T. King {{made his}} likely {{candidacy}} clear in December 2008, partly {{to mention that}} he was not challenging former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as the latter was not in the running and partly to counter the wave of publicity for Caroline Kennedy. By January 2009, King was still deliberating over whether he would run, with the main factor being whether he could raise the estimated millions he would need. [...] National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair John Cornyn was said to support King, which could keep other Republican contenders out of play. [...] However, Cornyn has reportedly met with former Governor George Pataki to discuss his potential candidacy, which other Republicans were advocating. [...] In June 2009, due to an appointment to the House Intelligence Committee, King said he was much less likely to run. [...] As August 2009 closed, King announced officially that he would not run, saying: [...] "Senator Gillibrand generates neither strong support nor opposition. This makes it virtually impossible for me to raise the campaign funds <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to overcome the built-in Democratic registration advantage and the countless millions of dollars which the Democrats will make available to Senator Gillibrand." [...] In September 2009, Giuliani reiterated that he had no interest at all in running for the Senate seat, [...] though, much like Andrew Cuomo's anticipated desire to run for governor, it did not stop speculation that Giuliani might change his mind, and by October 2009, speculation continued that Giuliani would run for the Senate seat, particularly if Cuomo ran for governor. On November 19, 2009, the New York Daily News reported Giuliani would not run for Governor, and in fact would run for the Senate for fill out {{the last two years of}} the Clinton term, then use that as a springboard for another presidential run. [...] However, a Giuliani spokesperson quickly dismissed the notion that any such plan was in place, saying [...] "When Mayor Giuliani makes a decision about serving in public office, he will inform New Yorkers on his own." [...] On November 26, 2009, Mayor of Larchmont Liz Feld said she's considering running for the seat.|$|E

I seemed to deaden and stiffen more each moment. Presently Dick breathed heavily and Hiram snored. The red glow of fire paled and died. I heard the clinking of the hobbles on Target, and a step, now and then, of the other horses. The sky grew ever bluer and colder, the stars brighter and larger, and the night wind moaned in the pines. I heard a coyote bark, a trout splash in the pool, and the hoot of an owl. Then the sounds and the clear, cold night seemed to fade away.|$|E

Indeed, after we had sat for some time chatting together, Mr. Clark began himself to make guarded inquiries on this very subject. Did I know Wilkinson? How was his enterprise of selling Kentucky products regarded at home? But I do not intend to burden this story with accounts of a matter which, though it has never been wholly clear, has been long since fairly settled in the public mind. Mr. Clark was most amiable, accepted my statement that I was travelling for pleasure, and honored Monsieur Chouteau's bon (for my purchase of the miniature had deprived me of nearly all my ready money), and said that Mr. Temple and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> horses to get to Les Iles.|$|E
