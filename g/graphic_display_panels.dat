The displays vary greatly in size, cost and complexity, but all are designed to visually represent a specific interest of the company. Trade show displays use bold images and catch phrases, {{in an attempt to}} attract visitors to their exhibit space, so that sales representatives can give a sales pitch or hand out brochures.|$|R

40|$|<b>Graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be of}} {{significant}} aid in accomplishing a teleoperation task throughout all three phases of off-line task analysis and planning, operator training, and online operation. In the first phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> provide substantial aid to investigate work cell layout, motion planning with collision detection and with possible redundancy resolution, and planning for camera views. In the second phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> can serve as very useful tools for introductory training of operators before training them on actual hardware. In the third phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be used for}} previewing planned motions and monitoring actual motions in any desired viewing angle, or, when communication time delay prevails, for providing predictive graphics overlay on the actual camera view of the remote site to show the non-time-delayed consequences of commanded motions in real time. This paper addresses potential space applications of <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> in all three operational phases of advanced teleoperation. Possible applications are illustrated with techniques developed and demonstrated in the Advanced Teleoperation Laboratory at JPL. The examples described include task analysis and planning of a simulated Solar Maximum Satellite Repair task, a novel force-reflecting teleoperation simulator for operator training, and preview and predictive displays for on-line operations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the method of the LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> {{grayscale}} modulation, a method based on computer calculation is proposed. First, the development history and trends of the LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> are introduced. Second, present {{the structure of the}} LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> and the existed modulation method. Simultaneously, point out the ground for shortcomings of the existed method. Third, describe the principle modulation method based on computer calculation detail from two steps, which are the data signal transformation and the grayscale modulation. Forth, describe the realization steps of this method in accordance with the third step. Finally, this method is supplied in a LED <b>display</b> <b>panel,</b> whose resolution is 320 × 240. Experimental results show that this method is able to increase the grayscale from 14 -bit to 16 -bit, and can enhance the display result of the LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> significantly...|$|R
