5|$|Niche uses of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> {{with high}} atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> including arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>metals</b> are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> are mainly f-block elements {{and the more}} reactive of the d-block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and period 4–6 p-block metals and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E

5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> tend to be less reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E
5|$|Some common uses of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> {{depend on}} the general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses {{depend on the}} characteristics of the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide <b>heavy</b> <b>metals)</b> that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E
5|$|These {{properties}} make it {{relatively easy}} to distinguish a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries.

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
