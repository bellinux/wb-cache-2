5|$|Substrates {{they are}} most {{commonly}} found on in their native habitats include beds and floating clumps of macroalgae like Sargassum muticum, Sargassum miyabei, Sargassum pallidum, Neorhodomela larix, Polysiphonia morrowii, Cystoseira crassipes, Laminaria japonica, Chondrusspp., and Desmarestia viridis; {{as well as in}} marine plants (like <b>eelgrass</b> of the genus Zostera), hydrozoans, and bryozoans.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial <b>eelgrass</b> mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as <b>eelgrass,</b> pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). <b>Eelgrass</b> (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or <b>eelgrass,</b> but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or <b>eelgrass.</b> Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
25|$|Arcuatula senhousia shares its habitat with <b>eelgrass</b> (Zostera marina) {{in many of}} {{the areas}} in which it has invaded. The {{presence}} of the mussel has been shown to affect rhizome growth in the <b>eelgrass.</b> This decreases the ability of established patches to spread. The Asian date mussel had the most detrimental effect on rhizome growth in areas where the <b>eelgrass</b> was sparse and patchy. This is a cause of concern for conservationists because beds of <b>eelgrass</b> are already degraded and sparse as a result of anthropogenic forces. The presence of Arcuatula senhousia can only worsen the situation.|$|E
25|$|S. japonica {{occurs in}} a variety of habitats, with shallow sandy flats in bays, surf zones of beaches, {{protected}} <b>eelgrass</b> seabeds and occasionally estuaries used by the species. They are a shallow water species, operating in s between 0 and 30 m. Juveniles tend to use <b>eelgrass</b> beds as a nursery area, gaining both food and protection from these habitats while adults move to more exposed areas.|$|E
25|$|One {{of several}} {{negative}} impacts of this invasive species {{is that it}} has a detrimental effect on <b>eelgrass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the bridge's construction, environmentalists raised {{numerous}} {{concerns and}} criticisms, chiefly about the immediate damage from construction {{work and the}} effects of long-term pollution from a projected increase in car traffic. The construction process resulted in a temporary increase in turbidity of the Severn's waters. Although <b>eelgrass</b> is reasonably tolerant to short-term high turbidity and consequent loss of light, the bed of <b>eelgrass</b> in the Severn was observed to decline considerably during the period of construction. The construction of the approach roads and toll plaza resulted in the permanent loss of some wet pastureland.|$|E
25|$|Internationally {{important}} {{numbers of}} Sandwich and little terns breed on the island, together with common and Arctic terns The marshes also support wintering wildfowl and waders, including shelduck, wigeon, teal and curlew. brent geese feed on sea lettuce and <b>eelgrass,</b> preferring the former when both are available. The {{average number of}} pink-footed geese in the five winters to 2009/10 was 22,764, far exceeding the international importance level of 2,700 birds.|$|E
25|$|The grey {{mangroves}} are uniformly of {{the type}} Avicennia marina var. resinifera and cover most of the pre-settlement area, but the surrounding samphire salt flats have been greatly reduced in size by changes in the landform with Tecticornia flabelliformis now listed as threatened in the area. The inlet's deeper sections are dominated by strap or tape weed (Posidonia spp.). <b>Eelgrass</b> (Zostera muelleri) and garweed (Heterozostera tasmanica) dominate the shallows, often being exposed on mudflats at low tide.|$|E
25|$|The little egret, Egretta garzetta, once a rare {{visitor to}} the UK, but is now {{regularly}} seen along {{the shores of the}} Fleet. The scaly cricket, a small insect, is only found at three sites in the UK, including Chesil Beach. Two species of <b>eelgrass</b> are found in the Fleet: Zostera marina and Zostera Noltii. These species both grow submerged in the shallow waters of the mid and upper Fleet, where large quantities die off in the early autumn.|$|E
25|$|NORSPA had {{a shorter}} life, running from 1989 to 1991. It {{was a special}} fund set up in {{response}} to particular concerns about the northern European maritime regions, and provided ECU 16 million in funding for 38 projects. It prioritised conservation of marine life and integrated management of biotopes, with a particular emphasis on international cooperation and coordination. Projects financed included a programme for return of large migratory species such as salmon to the Rhine, which received nearly ECU 5 million, and re-colonisation of <b>eelgrass</b> in shallow coastal waters around Denmark (EU funding of ECU 252,500).|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the marsh}} {{supported}} an extremely diverse wetlands ecosystem, {{with a variety}} of primary productivity plants including pickleweed, <b>eelgrass</b> and giant bulrush (Scirpus californiens). There has also been historically significant fish, mammal, amphibian and avafauna. The marsh is a significant element within the Pacific Flyway providing resting and feeding areas for migratory birds. As of 2006 this ecosystem has been significantly compromised by fill, levee formation, dredging and other development; estimates generally state that 75 percent of the original biological productivity of the marsh has been destroyed. However, it remains a significant habitat and is subject to meaningful wetland restoration activity, that is being actively evaluated as of the 2000-2006 timeframe.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{species in}} the North Sea include species of wrack, among them bladder wrack, knotted wrack, and {{serrated}} wrack. Algae, macroalgal, and kelp, such as oarweed and laminaria hyperboria, and species of maerl are found as well. <b>Eelgrass,</b> formerly common in {{the entirety of the}} Wadden Sea, was nearly wiped out in the 20th century by a disease. Similarly, sea grass used to coat huge tracts of ocean floor, but have been damaged by trawling and dredging have diminished its habitat and prevented its return. Invasive Japanese seaweed has spread along the shores of the sea clogging harbours and inlets and has become a nuisance.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of <b>eelgrass</b> occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E
25|$|In 1832, Jeanne Villepreux-Power, a {{pioneering}} French marine biologist, {{became the first}} person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms. In 1836, soon after his invention of the Wardian case, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals. In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, he soon housed real animals. In 1838, Félix Dujardin noted owning a saltwater aquarium, though he did not use the term. In 1846, Anne Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London. English chemist Robert Warington experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, <b>eelgrass,</b> and snails, creating one of the first stable aquaria. The aquarium principle was fully developed by Warington, explaining that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. He published his findings in 1850 in the Chemical Society's journal.|$|E
25|$|Melucuaq (lit. «small roe») or Elquaq (lit. «seaweed») is herring roe-on-kelp, herring spawn-on-kelp, or herring eggs on kelp. This is the fertilized eggs or roe (qaarsat, meluk, imlauk) of the Pacific herring {{attached}} to <b>eelgrass,</b> seaweed or other submerged vegetation. Herring spawn-on-kelp is a favored food among {{the majority of}} households in Togiak, Manokotak, and Aleknagik. Additional households in Twin Hills, Dillingham, and other communities in Bristol Bay and elsewhere also eat spawn-on-kelp. Harvests of spawn-on-kelp took place between late April and early June. Spawn-on-kelp for subsistence use is generally picked by hand, though rakes are occasionally used. Today, freezing and salting {{are the most common}} methods of preservation. In the past, spawn-on-kelp was preserved by drying and storage in open-weave grass baskets (kuusqun, kuusqulluk). As in the past, people today prefer to eat spawn-on-kelp dipped in seal oil. The product of the harvest is commonly shared with relatives and friends in the harvesters' home community during feats celebrating birthdays or holidays. In all four Nelson Island communities (Tununak, Newtok, Toksook Bay, and Nightmute), much of the roe-on-kelp is consumed soon after it is harvested, but a portion of the harvest is preserved in seal-skin pokes filled with seal oil.|$|E
500|$|Females {{give birth}} to 1ndash&37 young {{annually}} from March and July (most in April or May), {{with the number of}} pups increasing with female size. In Humboldt and San Francisco Bays, females drop their pups in beds of <b>eelgrass</b> that provide both shelter and food. In Catalina Harbor, females give birth on flats in [...] of water, their backs and dorsal fins exposed; the pups stay in even shallower water less than [...] deep. Mating occurs in early summer following birth; the only known observation of this in the wild was in 2004 off La Jolla, amongst nine sharks gathered [...] from shore in water [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|The area {{close to}} the {{waterfront}} is low-lying, with an elevation averaging about , {{but there are many}} hills in and around city, some reaching over [...] [...] Nørresundby, on the northern side of the sound, is also a hilly area. Villages to the south of Aalborg from west to east include Frejlev, Svenstrup, and Gistrup (which contains extensive woodland to the south as well as a golf club). Klarup and Storvorde lie to the southeast along the 595 road, which, flanking a stretch of the Limfjord known as Langerak, leads to the town of Hals. Nibe, with a harbour on the Limfjord, is [...] to the southwest, past the village of Frejlev. The Nibe Broads (Nibe Bredning) in the Limfjord not only has the largest <b>eelgrass</b> belts in Danish waters but is an important sanctuary for thousands of migratory birds. To the north of the city, villages include Vadum, Aabybro, Vestbjerg, Sulsted, Tylstrup, Vodskov, and Hjallerup. There is an extensive plantation, Branths Plantage - Møgelbjerg, immediately north of Vodskov.|$|E
500|$|The SSSI has a {{wide variety}} of habitats, with bare mud, sand and shingle characterising the {{intertidal}} zone along the whole of the coast, although higher areas may have algae or <b>eelgrass</b> that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter. The salt marshes which form on sheltered coasts, in the lee of islands, or behind spits are described in the SSSI notification document as [...] "among the best in Europe" [...] due to their exceptionally diverse flora. Sand dunes occur at several places along the coast, but the best examples are at Holme Dunes, Holkham, Blakeney Point, and Scolt Head Island. The latter two sites are also important for geomorphology research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges. Reed beds are fairly localised, but substantial areas occur at Titchwell Marsh, Brancaster and Cley Marshes. Grassland is represented by grazing pasture reclaimed from former salt marsh, with wetter areas at Cley and Salthouse marshes. Woodland is limited in the SSSI, although a belt of Corsican pine planted at Holkham has provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established.|$|E
500|$|The North Norfolk Coast SSSI {{was created}} in 1986 from prexisting SSSIs at Blakeney Point, Holme Dunes, Cley Marshes, Salthouse Marshes (all {{designated}} in 1954), Morston Saltmarshes, Brancaster Manor (1968), Stiffkey Saltmarshes [...] (1969), Thornham Marshes (1972) and Titchwell Marsh (1973), together with the national nature reserves (NNRs) at Scolt Head Island and Holkham, and substantial formerly undesignated areas. It has {{a wide variety of}} habitats. Bare mud, sand and shingle characterise the intertidal zone along the whole of the coast, although higher areas may have algae or <b>eelgrass</b> that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter. The salt marshes which form on sheltered parts of the coast, in the lee of islands, or behind spits are described in the SSSI notification document as [...] "among the best in Europe...flora is exceptionally diverse".

2500|$|When the mud {{layer is}} exposed at the tidal fringe, mudflats result affording a unique ecotone that affords {{numerous}} shorebird species a safe feeding and resting habitat. [...] Because the muds function much like quicksand, heavier mammalian predators {{not only cannot}} gain traction for pursuit, but would actually become trapped in the sinking muds. The muds are also an important substrate for primary marsh productivity including <b>eelgrass,</b> cordgrass and pickleweed. Furthermore, they are home to a large variety of molluscs and estuarine arthropods. Richardson Bay, for example, exposes one third of its areal extent as mudflat at low tide, which hosts a productive <b>eelgrass</b> expanse and also a large shorebird community.|$|E
2500|$|Flora include {{intertidal}} and upland species. [...] Probably {{the most}} notable feature is the extensive <b>eelgrass</b> population at the tideland perimeter of Richardson Bay. [...] This <b>eelgrass</b> occurrence in Richardson Bay {{is considered one of}} the most sizeable stands in Northern California, and it is being restored, leading to further extent of this habitat. [...] There is an extensive pickleweed habitat at the western end of the bay, where many acres of mudflat areas are exposed to shorebirds at low tide at the efflux of Pickleweed Inlet. [...] Upland plants found at the perimeter of Richardson's Bay include toyon, coast live oak, California bay, and native California bunch grasses.|$|E
2500|$|In Portage Inlet {{there are}} [...] of <b>eelgrass</b> growing under water. Portage Inlet and the Gorge Waterway {{may also be}} home to the largest colony of Pacific oysters on the west coast. Craigflower Creek and Colquitz Creek are [...] {{spawning}} grounds primarily for Coho salmon. Pacific herring also use Portage Inlet and the Gorge Waterway for spawning.|$|E
2500|$|Smooth Island is {{surrounded}} by a low profile reef. A region of gravel or hard sand extends from the reef on the eastern coast towards King George Island and King George Sound. The reef on the western coast {{is surrounded}} by sand and a body of silt approaches the south-west coast of the island. Between Smooth Island and King George Island lies a dense bed of seagrass (Halophila australis) and <b>eelgrass</b> (Zostera tasmanica) approximately 12.5 hectares in size. Studies have found dense populations of South Australian cobbler (Gymnapistes marmoratus) and within this region, as this fish has a preference for patchy beds of <b>eelgrass</b> near Smooth Island. The east coast of Smooth Island has the most dense concentration of Little weed whiting (Neoodax balteatus) in Norfolk Bay. An assessment via a beam-trawl in 1995-1996 revealed that 88% of the fish caught were of two species: Little Rock Whiting (Neoodax balteatus) and Bridled Leatherjacket (Acanthaluteres spilomelanurus). (further information in this link.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Scallops {{are mostly}} {{free-living}} and active, unlike {{the vast majority}} of bivalves, which are mostly slow-moving and infaunal. It is believed that all scallops start out with a byssus, which attaches them to some form of substrate such as <b>eelgrass</b> when they are very young. Most species lose the byssus as they grow larger. A very few species go on to cement themselves to a hard substrate (e.g. Chlamys distorta and Hinnites multirigosus).|$|E
2500|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reintroduce}} oysters and other shellfish because they can filter out toxins and help to clean the water. One oyster can process as much as 50 gallons of water in a day. (The resulting shellfish contain toxins and are not safe to eat.)) The NY/NJ Baykeeper environmental group gives oysters to volunteers who then monitor their health and growth in local waterways. [...] They have helped Katie Mosher-Smith and The Gowanus Community Oyster Garden's Stewards to partner with teachers, students and the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club to install and monitor oyster cages in Gowanus. In 2012, landscape architect Kate Orff proposed a design for a park with a living reef containing oysters, mussels and <b>eelgrass.</b> [...] A pilot project hung ropes off of a pier to attract ribbed mussels.|$|E
2500|$|Chinook {{also need}} healthy ocean habitats. Juvenile salmon grow in clean, {{productive}} estuarine environments and gain the energy for migration. Later, they change physiologically {{to live in}} salt water. They rely on <b>eelgrass</b> and seaweeds for camouflage (protection from predators), shelter, and foraging habitat as {{they make their way}} to the open ocean. Adult fish need a rich, open ocean habitat to acquire the strength needed to travel back upstream, escape predators, and reproduce before dying. In his book King of Fish, David Montgomery writes, [...] "The reserves of fish at sea are important to restocking rivers disturbed by natural catastrophes." [...] Thus, it is vitally important for the fish to be able to reach the oceans (without man-made obstructions such as dams), so they can grow into healthy adult fish to sustain the species.|$|E
2500|$|The runoff and {{pollution}} have many components that help {{contribute to the}} algal bloom, which is mainly fed by phosphorus and nitrogen. [...] This algae prevents sunlight from reaching {{the bottom of the}} Bay while alive and deoxygenates the Bay's water when it dies and rots. [...] The erosion and runoff of sediment into the Bay, exacerbated by devegetation, construction and the prevalence of pavement in urban and suburban areas, also blocks vital sunlight. [...] The resulting loss of aquatic vegetation has depleted the habitat for much of the Bay's animal life. [...] Beds of <b>eelgrass,</b> the dominant variety in the southern Bay, have shrunk by more than half there since the early 1970s. Overharvesting, pollution, sedimentation and disease have turned much of the Bay's bottom into a muddy wasteland.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson Bay {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pristine}} estuaries on the Pacific Coast in spite of its urbanized periphery, since it supports extensive <b>eelgrass</b> areas and sizable undisturbed intertidal habitats. It is a feeding and resting area for a panoply of estuarine and pelagic birds, while its associated marshes and littoral zones support a variety of animal and plant life. [...] Richardson Bay has been designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA), based upon its large number of annual bird visitors and residents, its sightings of California clapper rail and its strategic location in the flyway. The bay's waters are subject to a [...] "no discharge" [...] rule to protect the elaborate and fragile ecosystems present, including a complex fishery, diverse mollusk [...] populations and even marine mammals such as the harbor seal.|$|E
2500|$|Fishery {{characteristics}} of Richardson Bay include a Pacific herring fishery and oyster beds. The herring fishing fleet serving all of San Francisco Bay {{is based in}} Richardson Bay at the Sausalito harbor. [...] This herring fishing is overseen by the California Department of Fish and Game; the herring population is in a downward trend, although not from excessive fishing pressure with the net techniques in use, but rather from ocean environmental factors. [...] Herring {{spend most of their}} lives in the open ocean and come to Richardson Bay and other estuaries for winter spawning in the shallow protected waters. [...] In Richardson Bay their eggs attach to assorted surfaces such as <b>eelgrass,</b> piers or rip rap. [...] After the eggs hatch, the herring larvae consume plankton; before hatching the eggs are subject to predation by gulls at low tide and sturgeon and other assorted estuarine fauna at higher tides.|$|E
2500|$|The Chesapeake Bay is {{also home}} to a diverse flora, both land and aquatic. Common {{submerged}} aquatic vegetation includes <b>eelgrass</b> and widgeon grass. A report in 2011 suggested that information on underwater grasses would be released, because [...] "submerged grasses provide food and habitat for a number of species, adding oxygen to the water and improving water clarity." [...] Other vegetation that makes its home {{in other parts of the}} Bay are wild rice, various trees like the red maple and bald cypress, and spartina grass and phragmites. Invasive plants have taken a significant foothold in the Bay; plants such as Brazilian waterweed, native to South America, have spread to most continents with the help of aquarium owners, who often dump the contents of their aquariums into nearby lakes and streams. It's highly invasive, and has the potential to flourish in the low-salinity tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dense stands of Brazilian waterweed can restrict water movement, trap sediment and affect water quality. Various local K-12 schools in the Maryland and Virginia region often have programs that cultivate native bay grasses and plant them in the Bay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of plankton for food diminishes rapidly with depth. At 1000 metres, {{the biomass of}} plankton is typically about 1 percent of that at the surface, and at 5000 metres about 0.01 percent. Given there is no sunlight, energy enters deep water zones as organic matter. There are three main ways this happens. Firstly, organic matter can move into the zone from the continental landmass, for example, through currents that carry the matter down rivers, then plume along the continental shelf and finally spill down the continental slope. Other matter enters as particulate matter raining down from the overhead water column {{in the form of}} marine snow, or as sinking overhead plant material such as <b>eelgrass,</b> or as [...] "large particles" [...] such as dead fish and whales sinking to the bottom. A third way energy can arrive is through fish, such as vertically migrating mesopelagic fishes that can enter into the demersal zone as they ascend or descend. The demersal fish and invertebrates consume organic matter that does arrive, break it down and recycle it. A consequence of these energy delivery mechanisms is that the abundance of demersal fish and invertebrates gradually decrease as the distance from continental shorelines increases.|$|E
50|$|Invasive {{species have}} been shown to have a {{negative}} effect on <b>eelgrass</b> and associated ecosystems. In Nova Scotia, the invasive exotic green crab (Carcinus maenas) destroys <b>eelgrass</b> when it digs in the substrate for prey items, or by directly eating <b>eelgrass</b> seeds. The decline of <b>eelgrass</b> in Antigonish Harbour has resulted in fewer Canada geese, which feed on the rhizome, and fewer common goldeneye, which eat invertebrates that live in <b>eelgrass</b> meadows.|$|E
