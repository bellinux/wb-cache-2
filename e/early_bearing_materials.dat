Surgical technique was described. 1 st MTCJ hypermobility, severe metatarsus primus varus and previous surgeries failures were the indications for surgery. Immediate ambulation with one crutch and fool weight bearing since the 4 - 5 th week postoperatively were authorized. Results: desired correction of the first metatarsal was achieved during 23 interventions. Arthrodesis had fused in 21 of 23 cases that were followed up. Two cases of non-union did not require reoperation. No infectious complications were noted. 21 patients were discharged the next day after surgery due to painless early postoperative period.

40|$|Lead (Pb) {{containing}} alloys such {{as white}} metals and Cu-Pb-Sn (lining) with Pb-based overlay plating have been extensively used as materials for {{internal combustion engine}} bearings during the last several decades. However, owing to environmental and health concerns, the use of Pb containing materials in automotive engine components is being restricted. In view of this, attempts {{are under way to}} develop and replace Pb-containing <b>materials</b> with Pb–free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> The tribological characteristics of these recently developed Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> have, however, not been fully investigated and only a limited results about their tribological performance are available in open literature. This thesis therefore focuses on investigating the tribological performance of some recently developed Pb-free engine <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> Although engine <b>bearings</b> are designed to operate in full film lubrication conditions yet they also operate in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes where the material properties do affect their tribological performance. There is thus a need to study the tribological behaviour of these new Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> in mixed and boundary lubrication conditions vis a vis that of conventional Pb-containing bearing linings and overlays. This work has therefore aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics such as friction and wear, seizure behaviour, interaction with different oil formulations and embeddability behaviour of some selected Pb-free engine <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> Friction and wear properties of Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> Al-Sn based lining without overlay, bronze lining coated with Polyamide-Imide (PAI) based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite, bronze lining coated with Al-Sn based and PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite, bronze lining coated with Sn-based overlay, and bismuth (Bi) containing bronze lining coated with Sn-based overlay have been studied using a block-on-ring test configuration under unidirectional sliding conditions in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes. The conventional Pb-containing <b>bearing</b> <b>material</b> was also studied as a reference material. Al-Sn based material showed considerably higher friction compared to the other <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> The <b>bearing</b> <b>material</b> with PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite showed superior friction and wear properties compared to all other materials. Sn-based overlay coated materials resulted in comparable friction and wear properties to that of Pbbased overlay. Wear mechanism in Al-Sn based material is mainly adhesive and abrasive in case of Sn based overlay. Seizure behaviour of the <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> were also studied using the block-on-ring test configuration in dry as well as lubricated conditions using pure base oil and a fully formulated engine oil. The PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite showed no sign of seizure even at the highest test load in dry as well as lubricated conditions. Al-Sn based lining without overlay seizes at relatively lower load in dry condition compared to the other <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> Adhesion or wear debris smearing onto the counter surface is the main causes of seizure in dry condition. In lubricated condition, seizure occurred at relatively higher load and the conventional Pb-containing material was found to have better seizure performance compared to the Al-Sn based and Sn-based overlay plated materials. Tribological compatibility of Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> with different oil formulations was studied using a ball-on-bearing specimen test configuration in boundary lubrication under reciprocating sliding conditions. Four different <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> were investigated using different lubricants with and without oil additives. In general, the <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> lubricated with pure PAO base oil showed higher friction compared to those lubricated with oils containing additives. Lubricants containing additives improved wear properties of the <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> except in the case of Al-Sn based lining without overlay. It was also observed that the anti-wear additive level did not significantly influence the wear performance of bearing overlays. The embeddability behaviour of Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> was studied using a fully formulated engine oil contaminated with SiC particles. Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> with Snbased overlay, Bi-based overlay, PAI-based overlay containing MoS 2 and composite overlay containing PAI, Al, PTFE were investigated. Tests at different rotational speeds (i. e. different oil film thickness) and a constant load were carried out using a journal bearing test rig. It was found that <b>material</b> removal from <b>bearing</b> and shaft surfaces due to abrasive wear is influenced by the lubricant film thickness. The steel counter surface showed lower wear in tests using Sn based overlay and a PAI, Al and PTFE containing composite overlay compared to Bi-based overlay and PAI-based overlay containing MoS 2. ...|$|R

Recently, it has been proposed as a promising <b>bearing</b> <b>material</b> for cervical total disc replacement (TDR). A new bearing combination of PEEK-on-PEEK based self-mating articulation has been used, which may overcome current <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> related complications. For ball-on-socket based cervical TDR designs, PEEK based bearing articulation is expected to operate under a boundary lubrication regime regardless of the radial clearance used. The contact stress encountered by the bearing surfaces is insufficient to result in either material yield or fatigue failure. High-cycle fatigue tests were performed on PEEK 450 G specimens via three-point flexural bending. The obtained fatigue results (104. 1 ± 5. 8 MPa) show superiority over the historical polymeric <b>bearing</b> <b>material</b> UHMWPE (31 MPa). Moreover, it demonstrates a good resistance to sterilisation and thermal ageing. Laboratory wear simulation was also conducted, using spine simulators and following ISO 18192 - 1 standard. For PEEK-on-PEEK self-mating articulation, a steady state wear rate of 1. 0 ± 0. 9 mg/million cycles is obtained, which is comparable as the historical bearing combination (UHMWPE against CoCrMo). The results of this work suggest that PEEK-on-PEEK based articulation is a possible alternative for future cervical TDR designs. ...|$|R
40|$|Friction is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} phenomenon accompanying the sliding motion of solid bodies. Friction, vibration, and wear under conditions of contaminated water lubrication are extremely important in many engineering applications such as water-lubricated bearings, water pumps, and braking systems. The aim of this project is to investigate the factors {{that could lead to}} an improvement in the performance of water-lubricated <b>bearings</b> <b>materials.</b> Previous studies have revealed the main factors contributing to power loss are friction-induced vibrations, and wear in water-lubricated bearings. Those factors are the result of contamination of the lubricant (sea water); bearing alignment (parallelism of the shaft and shell); material characteristics; and condition of the contact (sliding) surfaces. The contact mechanics of the water-lubricated bearings as well as the performance characteristics of the bearings components on which friction is exerted also have a substantial influence on the tribological characteristics of water-lubricated <b>bearings</b> <b>materials.</b> Thus, the focus of the present study is on the effect of water contamination on the friction coefficient, vibration, wear and the vibration–wear relationship under varying operational conditions. An experimental program was conducted to develop new methods and investigate the effect of water contamination on the tribological characteristics of pairs of materials under different operational conditions for water-lubricated bearings. A Pin-on-Disk test rig was designed and built to adopt the operational environment of a real water-lubricated bearing. This test rig was used to obtain experimental data regarding the effect of water contamination on the long-term behaviour of the bearing systems, and to investigate the friction, vibration, wear, and vibration-wear characteristics of the materials. The effect of various parameters, such as the friction conditions, damping, and operational environment on the behaviour of the <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> was also investigated. The experiments demonstrated that all three factors, namely contamination, material properties and surface conditions, have a significant influence on the tribological characteristics of water-lubricated bearings. It was also demonstrated that when the operation of the water-lubricated bearing takes place in boundary and mixed regimes, the adhesive and abrasive mechanisms of friction are significant and contribute to the generation of excessive wear and vibration. This is contrary to what is claimed by many manufacturers. It was observed that the wear mechanism in the water-lubricated <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> was associated with low-frequency vibrations and severe contamination of the lubricant. Also, as expected, the vibration–wear relationship of the water-lubricated <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> was significantly affected by the contamination of the lubricant and can be changed by magnetic field damping. The present study identified the primary mechanism responsible for the high friction coefficient, vibration, and wear to be a three-body mechanism caused by the abrasive nature of the water contaminant. It was found that there was {{a significant increase in the}} friction coefficient, vibration, and specific wear rate at the slowest sliding speed of 0. 393 m/s. This is due to the boundary regime of lubrication, the adhesive-abrasive wear mechanism, and specific material properties of NF 22 (Railko) material. It was also explored and reported that for a specific applied load of 8 N, at low and high sliding speeds, and water contamination levels, damping has a strong effect on the vibration–wear relationship which is also dependent on sliding speed and, as a result, on the lubrication regime. The significance of this experimental study is to improve the selection of water-lubricated <b>bearings</b> <b>materials</b> and as a result, improve their performances. The outcomes of this research project are: • Analysis of the existing types of materials, and experimental models and techniques for modelling and simulating the operational conditions of water-lubricated bearings • Identification of the existing problems associated with the contemporary technology of water-lubricated <b>bearings</b> <b>materials</b> • Development of an experimental methodology and technique for the application of a Pin-on-Disk test rig and determination of the main contributing factors • Identification and analysis of various lubrication and operational conditions for water-lubricated <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> and systems and development of further recommendations for future work.

40|$|Engine {{bearings}} are {{amongst the}} most critical components of an internal combustion engine that support and allow smooth rotation of the crankshaft. They are designed to operate under hydrodynamic lubrication condition where the bearing and shaft surface are separated by a thick lubricant film. However, they also occasionally operate under mixed and boundary lubrication conditions particularly during starting, stopping and load, speed and temperature variations. Under these conditions, tribological performance of <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> is crucial for the satisfactory performance of theengine. Traditionally, the most extensively used engine <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> have been Copper-Lead (Cu-Pb) based linings and Pb based overlays because of the friction reducing properties of Pb. However, due to the adverse health and environmental impact of Pb, there is growing emphasis on restricting the usage of Pb in engine bearings. Owing to this, new Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> that provide at least comparable or superior tribological performance to that of Pb containing materials are being developed. Someof these materials have already been introduced in engine bearing applications. There are, however, only few research results in the open literature as to how these new engine <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> would perform in mixed and boundary lubricated conditions. The objective of this work is to evaluate and understand the tribological performance of selected Pb-free engine <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> and compare their performance {{with that of the}} traditional Pb-containing material. To understand the damage mechanisms in thetraditional Pb-containing bearings, a full set of main and connecting rod bearings from field test run in Euro V truck engines in long haulage application with European diesel fuel and with slightly longer oil drainage interval were investigated. Furthermore, laboratory tests on Pb-free engine bearings with different compositions of lining and overlay materials were carried out with a block-on-ring test set up in order to evaluate their tribological performance. For this study, aluminum-tin (Al-Sn) based lining withno overlay; Cu-based linings with overlay of polyamide-imide (PAI) containing MoS, 2 and graphite, Al-Sn based overlay and Sn based overlay were studied. Cu-Pb lining with Pb-based overlay was also studied as a reference. Investigations on a full set of main bearings and connecting rod bearings from field test revealed that the major damage mechanisms were 3 -body abrasive wear leading to exposure of lining material, flaking of overlay material due to surface fatigue, formation of compound layer composed of Sn, Cu and Ni and cavitation damage. Laboratory tests on Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> have shown that Al-Sn based lining with no overlay shows higher friction than the other materials at lower rotational speed. For Al-Sn based lining and Pb-based overlay materials, the decrease in friction is relatively sharp as rotational speed increases compared with the PAI based overlay. Test samples with overlay of PAI containing graphite and MoS 2 exhibited better friction and wear properties than Al-Sn based and Pb-based materials. Under steady-state conditions,Pb-containing <b>bearing</b> <b>material</b> shows higher wear and Al-Sn based material hasshown higher friction. In addition, Sn-based and Pb-based overlays have shownsimilar friction behaviour when rotational speed is varied. For relatively longer test durations, samples with Sn overlay exhibited comparable friction and wear with that of Pb-based overlay material.
