5|$|He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to become}} a {{professional}} wrestler {{at the age of}} twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, Kitase <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> a {{thematic}} {{combination of}} fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed {{to include a}} cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in VII. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E

25|$|George Leslie Norris {{was born}} in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. His parents were George and Mary Jane Norris. Leslie had two younger brothers, Eric and Gordon. His father George worked as a miner, but after First World War became a milkman because of his declining health. Leslie grew up in Wales during the Great Depression. He enjoyed reading books and playing sports as a kid. He {{attended}} Georgetown Primary School from 1926 to 1931. He attended Cyfarthfa Castle Grammar School after that. Throughout school, Norris was involved in sports like football, soccer, and boxing. By age 12, Leslie <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a poet {{and he went to}} listen to acclaimed poets like Dylan Thomas and Vernon Watkins. He published his first poem in 1938 at the age of seventeen. That same year, Norris had {{to drop out of school}} due to financial pressures. He began working as a rates clerk in the Town Hall in Merthyr.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Scream 3 {{began on}} July 6, 1999 {{in and around}} Hollywood, Los Angeles, {{in the areas of}} San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silverlake, with a $40 million budget and wrapped on September 29, 1999. The {{isolated}} home of Campbell's character is situated in Topanga Canyon and Cox's character is introduced in a classroom at UCLA. A scene where Campbell's character is pursued through movie set replicas of locations from Scream was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to revisit the original film in some way, after which they wrote the scene around the set. Due to the constantly changing script used for the film, which would often be usable on the day of filming, the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that, should the script again change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date. In particular, the opening scene had three variants and the three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two-hours of filmed footage. The ending too was refilmed in January 2000, three months after principal photography finished, adding in the character of Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) and having Campbell's character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily. So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey's character, one with him absent, one with his arm in bandages and one with him in a normal condition as they were unsure of what his fate would be.|$|E
500|$|The young Max {{was exposed}} to music early on, {{attending}} Broadway shows weekly {{from the age of}} two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on The Milton Berle Show in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, [...] "I think anybody who wanted to develop a life in rock 'n' roll music had a moment. That was my moment," [...] and Fontana became a major influence on him.|$|E

500|$|As {{his acting}} career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe {{continued}} his education through on-set tutors. He admitted {{he was not}} very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work [...] "really difficult." [...] He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to act and write, {{and that it would be}} difficult to have a normal college experience. [...] "The paparazzi, they'd love it," [...] he told Details magazine in 2007. [...] "If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Seeley's series Hack/Slash through Image Comics, {{publisher}} Eric Stephenson suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested setting a story {{in a small town}} so he could write about the kind of crimes that happen in a place where people prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt The Walking Dead had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for Revival. They pitched the series as Fargo meets The Walking Dead, using the terms [...] "Rural Noir" [...] and [...] "Farm Noir" [...] to describe the hardboiled detective story set in a small town.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his fight}} with Vargas, Trinidad moved up in weight – {{this time to}} {{participate}} in Don King's middleweight unification tournament featuring IBF champion Bernard Hopkins, WBA champion William Joppy, and WBC champion Keith Holmes. Trinidad was matched with Joppy, whom he defeated by technical knockout in the fifth round of a contest that took place on May 12, 2001. Joppy opened the first round on the offensive, but late in the round Trinidad scored a knockdown {{with a combination of}} punches that came close to throwing Joppy underneath the ropes. Trinidad subsequently scored a knockdown in the fourth round, during this stage of the competition he was using combinations of left hooks and right punches to the head. In the fifth round Trinidad scored another knockdown, Joppy attempted to continue the fight, but while he was using the ropes to help him stand, the referee stopped the fight. When the contest was over, Trinidad explained his strategy by stating: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to impose his will, his weight, and I wouldn't let him do it".|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was born}} in Havre de Grace, Maryland, the son of Violet [...] "Vi" [...] Ripken (née Roberta) and Cal Ripken Sr. He has German, English, and Irish ancestry. Though the Ripkens called Aberdeen, Maryland, their home, they were often on the move because of Cal Sr.'s {{coaching}} duties with the Baltimore Orioles organization. Cal Sr., in fact, was in Topeka, Kansas {{with one of his}} teams when his son was born. Cal Jr. grew up around baseball and got started in it at a very young age. He was able to receive instruction from players on his father's teams, notably Doug DeCinces. He also got advice from his father, who once remarked to his mother that his questions were better than the ones reporters had.

[...] Ripken and his brother Billy attended Aberdeen High School. They both played baseball there; Cal also played soccer. He has two other siblings, Ellen and Fred.|$|E
500|$|... "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] {{was created}} for the 2009 musical film Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which Cyrus stars as a famous pop star sent to {{reconnect}} with her Southern roots and family. The film's director, Peter Chelsom, felt the movie needed a big dance-number, similar to the [...] "Macarena" [...] (1995) or the [...] "Funky Chicken" [...] (1950s). Chelsom <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> a song in which Cyrus' character, Miley Stewart, called dance steps that captured Cyrus' [...] "real silliness physically" [...] and her [...] "great abandon". In addition, Chelsom wanted the song to represent the two worlds of Stewart, the main theme of the film, by [...] "combin Miley Stewart’s L.A. hip-hop/pop style with her country roots". Because the song is an instructional dance song, it became an ongoing collaboration between Chelsom, choreographer Jamal Sims, Cyrus, and the song's songwriters, Adam Anders and Nikki Hasman. According to Chelsom, the collaborators referred to the song by the working title [...] "The Project" [...] "for the longest time" [...] before naming it the [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". The song was also nick-named [...] "Miley's Macarena". [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] was first released as a promotional single from [...] on March 10, 2009.|$|E

500|$|For one of {{his side}} projects, Chris Thile <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to form a string quintet {{composed}} of mandolin, violin, banjo, guitar, and bass with childhood friend and fiddler Gabe Witcher, but didn’t know which direction {{he wanted to take}} the band. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Telluride, Colorado, Thile met banjoist Noam Pikelny and later commented that “every note he played was something I wish I’d played”. It was then that Thile realized that he wanted to “put [...] stamp on the traditional bluegrass ensemble”. Thile wanted to get five musicians together for a Nashville jam session in 2005, after he found talented bluegrass musicians that could fill the positions. The bassist Thile was searching for, Greg Garrison, was recommended to Thile by Pikelny, who had performed alongside Garrison in the Cajun jam band Leftover Salmon. The guitar position was filled by Chris Eldridge, from the bluegrass band the Infamous Stringdusters. The five musicians met up in Nashville one day in 2005 and decided that they needed to “do something musical together”. A few nights later, the group met again “just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships”. That night, they came to an agreement and formed a bluegrass band.|$|E
500|$|Kenny voices SpongeBob SquarePants and {{a variety}} of other characters, {{including}} SpongeBob's pet snail Gary and the French narrator. He also physically portrays Patchy the Pirate in live-action segments of most special episodes. Kenny previously worked with Stephen Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life and, when Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he approached Kenny to voice the main character. Kenny originally used the voice of SpongeBob for a minor character on Rocko. He forgot how to perform the voice initially and did not intend to use it afterwards. Hillenburg, however, used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny perform the voice, he immediately <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it for his character. He said to Nickelodeon executives, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] The network insisted on auditioning more actors, but Hillenburg turned them down; in the words of Tom Kenny, [...] "one of the advantages of having a strong creator is that the creator can say, 'No, I like that—I don't care about celebrities.'" [...] While Kenny was developing SpongeBob's voice, the show's casting crew wanted him to have a unique, high-pitched laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E
500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be a writer}} when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting {{in the front seat of}} her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E
