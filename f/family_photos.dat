25|$|The L-shaped {{layout of}} the massive building, {{together}} with adjacent constructions, and the surrounding brick and masonry fence, hides to the local transient the open and greenish interior patio of the residence. The patio can be access through the zaguan, the carport, or directly from the upper level eastern end, using a brick and masonry half-turn with landing staircase. As of 2013 the house was vacant, and thus the small urban courtyard-backyard reflects abandonment. However, there are certain built elements within the area that still warrant further description. Most important {{of these is the}} marble flared stair, identical to the zaguan staircase (but with one less riser) and the iron grilled gate, which replicates also the zaguans iron gate. Many early twentieth century Vives' <b>family</b> <b>photos</b> at the patio, using the staircase as stage, suggest the social importance of the location. A water fountain sits {{at the center of the}} patio, another favorite spot for early 20th century <b>family</b> <b>photos.</b> There are two separate brick and masonry constructions in a precarious state, currently used as construction material storage area. During the 19th century, the buildings were use as residence for the service personnel.|$|E
25|$|In late 2015, Chernykh and Marquez {{were set}} {{to be interviewed by}} {{immigration}} officials. As a result, according to the indictment, Raheel Farook created a fraudulent back-dated lease agreement that claimed the two were living with him and his wife since their marriage. Raheel and Tatiana Farook also allegedly staged <b>family</b> <b>photos</b> of Chernykh and Marquez, and established a joint transaction account for them. Prosecutors allege that on December 3, the day after the Inland Regional Center attack, Tatiana Farook lied to investigators about Chernykh and Marquez's marriage.|$|E
25|$|Family {{folklore}} is {{the branch}} of folkloristics concerned with the study and use of folklore and traditional culture transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes <b>family</b> <b>photos</b> and photo albums in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts {{give way to a}} distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Dennis Boyd (Mark Moses), {{the husband}} of the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Pakistan, breaks into Carrie's apartment and photographs her medication and <b>family</b> <b>photos.</b> Boyd switches her medication with a hallucinogen. She has a delusional episode and attacks a security guard, and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers take her into custody. Lieutenant colonel Aasar Khan (Raza Jaffrey) questions her, but she hallucinates that he is Brody and breaks down crying in his arms. She receives a call from Saul, who has escaped from his captors. She helps him evade the local Taliban, and talks him out of committing suicide when they find him. Ultimately, however, she delivers him to the Taliban so they will spare his life. Later that night, she meets with Khan, who tells her that Boyd {{is working with the}} ISI. Carrie sets a trap for Boyd with his wife's help, and he is taken into custody.|$|E
500|$|The {{timing of}} the leave gave him both Easter and his {{birthday}} at home. There was a large family reunion; to the <b>family</b> <b>photos,</b> he added a sitting for a formal photo wearing his Pour le Mérite. He also tinkered with, and roared about upon, his motorcycle. He thus was out of action during Bloody April, the most intense air fighting of the war, when the Luftstreitkräfte and its aces inflicted heavy losses on the Royal Flying Corps. Richthofen, who had scored 11 victories before Voss began his own tally, achieved 13 victories during his absence. Referring to his [...] "dear friend", Richthofen stated: [...] "He was... my most redoubtable competitor." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{gripping}} {{news story}} of the pre-Code era was the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby {{on the evening of}} 1 March 1932. As the child was already enormously famous before the kidnapping, the event created a media circus, with news coverage more intense than anything since World War I. Newsreels featuring <b>family</b> <b>photos</b> of the child (the first time private pictures had been [...] "conscripted for public service") asked spectators to report any sight of him. On May 12, 1932, the child's body was found less than five miles from the Lindbergh home. Although newsreels covered the most important topics of the day, they also presented human-interest stories (such as the immensely popular coverage of the Dionne quintuplets) and entertainment news, at times in greater detail than more pressing political and social matters.|$|E

500|$|Arrested Development uses several {{elements}} {{which were}} rare {{at the time}} for American live-action sitcoms. It was shot on location and in HD video (at 24 frames per second) with multiple cameras, parodying tactics often employed in documentary film and reality television, straying from the [...] "fixed-set, studio audience, laugh track" [...] style long dominant in comedy production. The show also makes heavy use of cutaway gags, supplementing the narrative with visual punchlines like security camera footage, Bluth <b>family</b> <b>photos,</b> website screenshots, archive films, and flashbacks. An omniscient third-person narrator (producer Ron Howard) ties together the multiple plot threads running through each episode, while humorously undercutting and commenting on the characters. Arrested Development also developed a unique self-referentiality through use of in-jokes that evolved over multiple episodes, which rewarded longtime viewership (and in turn may have discouraged new viewers {{and contributed to the}} show's ratings difficulties).|$|E

On the night of December 14, 1925, Gleason's father disposed of any <b>family</b> <b>photos</b> in which he appeared; just after noon on December 15, he collected his hat, coat, and paycheck and left his family and job at the insurance company permanently. Once it became evident that he was not coming back, Mae went to work as a subway attendant for the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT).|$|E

2500|$|In {{conjunction}} with the 50th anniversary of the Bee Gees (when they started calling themselves [...] "Bee Gees" [...] in 1959), Rhino Records have released two new collections. Mythology is a four-disc collection highlighting each brother, including Andy, with tracks personally selected by Barry, Robin, Maurice's wife Yvonne (with his children Adam and Samantha), and Andy's daughter Peta. Maurice's disc contains two unreleased tracks called [...] "Angel of Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Bridge". Andy's disc contains the unreleased track [...] "Arrow Through The Heart". Mythology also features a scrapbook of <b>family</b> <b>photos,</b> many never-before published, along with tributes from artists such as George Martin, Brian Wilson, Elton John, Graham Nash and the band's longtime manager Robert Stigwood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ubiquity of}} cameras and on-line photos since {{the rise of}} {{cellphone}} cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of <b>family</b> <b>photos</b> and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations. A new family custom, using the technology of today, is {{to put together a}} slideshow or video documenting the story leading up to the current celebration. At this time a folklorist can only speculate on evolving customs of family photography.|$|E
