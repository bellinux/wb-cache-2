50|$|The largest {{recorded}} <b>musky</b> <b>octopus</b> was a {{male with}} a mantle length of 188 mm, a total length of 740 mm and a mass of 1414 g, caught in the Gulf of İzmir (Gulf of Smyrna), in the Aegean Sea. It {{is closely related to}} the horned octopus, Eledone cirrhosa, but can be distinguished by a number of features; for example, E. moschata has smooth skin and smells of musk, while E. cirrhosa has warty skin <b>and</b> no <b>musky</b> odour.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} seasons on lipid and fatty acid {{profiles}} of muscle types (mantle and arm) of Mediterranean octopuses (common octopus-Octopus vulgaris <b>and</b> <b>musky</b> octopus-Eledone moschata) were investigated. The {{results showed that}} lipid levels ranged from 0. 75 % to 1. 60 % in both muscle types of octopuses which were considered as lean. Lipid levels in mantle tissues of both octopus species were higher than lipid levels in their arms. Although these two octopus species contain small amounts of lipid, they are good sources of n- 3 PUFAs content (especially EPA and DHA) for all season regardless of muscle types. The highest levels of EPA were obtained from mantle and arms tissues (18. 23 %) of common octopus in spring. The highest levels of EPA were obtained from mantle (12. 90 %) and arms (12. 67 %) of <b>musky</b> <b>octopus</b> in autumn <b>and</b> winter. The levels of EPA in both of muscle tissues of common octopus {{were found to be}} higher than levels of EPA in both of muscle tissues of <b>musky</b> <b>octopus.</b> The highest DHA levels were obtained from mantle tissue (28. 17 %) of common octopus in summer. There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) in the levels of SFA, MUFA and PUFA in terms of species, season, and muscle types...|$|R

Samples were collected {{on a monthly basis}} by commercial bottom trawls between October 2001 and June 2003. A total of 1552 specimens were analysed (779 males, 764 females, 9 undetermined). The overall sex ratio was close to 1 : 1, but during summer males were dominant. Length-weight relationships calculated for each sex and the whole sample showed negative allometric growth (...|$|R
40|$|<b>Musky</b> <b>octopus,</b> Eledone moschata is {{widespread}} in the Mediterranean on various bottom types. Although it is common in fishery landings its ecology is still poorly known.
