500|$|The ship {{remained}} at Wei Hai Wei {{until the end}} of August when she sailed up the Yangtze River for Hankow. She reached the inland port on 5 September and dispatched armed guards to put down unrest on several British-owned merchant ships. Her primary purpose, though, was to aid the Chinese government's survey of the massive flooding in the area. Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, were also in the city to survey the flooding with their Lockheed Sirius float-plane and they were invited to use the carrier as their base. Unfortunately, their aircraft was <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morning of 2 October by a strong current as it was being hoisted back into the water by Hermess crane. They were quickly rescued by a boat from the carrier, but their aircraft was damaged. Captain MacKinnon offered to take them and their aircraft to Shanghai where it could be repaired and the ship departed the next day. She remained in Shanghai until 2 November, when she sailed for Hong Kong. Hermes received a distress message on 3 November from a Japanese merchantman, SS Ryinjin Maru, that had run aground on the Tan Rocks near the Chinese mainland {{at the mouth of the}} Taiwan Strait. The ship managed to rescue nine crew members before she was relieved by the [...] and could proceed to Hong Kong. She reached the city on 7 November and remained in the area until April 1932.|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E

40|$|A block spin {{renormalization}} group {{approach is}} {{proposed for the}} dynamical triangulation formulation of two-dimensional quantum gravity. The idea is to update link <b>flips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> block lattice in response to link <b>flips</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original lattice. Just as the connectivity of the original lattice {{is meant to be}} a lattice representation of the metric, the block links are determined {{in such a way that}} the connectivity of the block lattice represents a block metric. As an illustration, this approach is applied to the Ising model coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity. The correct critical coupling is reproduced, but the critical exponent is obscured by unusually large finite size effects. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

50|$|An award-nominated {{music video}} {{directed}} by Peter Christopherson {{was made to}} accompany the single. This features no musical performance, other than Cantrell's singing. It begins with a middle-aged man driving a 1972 Dodge Challenger down a Southwestern highway only to find Cantrell standing alone. The man picks up Cantrell, who remains laid back with one foot out the passenger window while turning the car's radio dial. They stop at a truck <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the road, and the concerned driver hurries over to the vehicle for inspection. Cantrell, remaining seated, then takes the wheel and drives off with the man's car as the song's explosive chorus begins. He intentionally drives toward a semi-truck head-on before swerving away and stopping at a gas station.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, she became {{interested}} in out-of-body experiences, mediumship, spiritualism, and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, {{in which she was}} duped by Jay Barham, founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could channel the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal [...] "entities", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the [...] "spirits". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose. Kubler-Ross' friend Deanna Edwards attended a service to ascertain whether allegations against Barham were true.

50|$|Vaughn is {{informed}} {{that one of}} his enforcers have <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operation, presumably because of Eden sending him to a sting. Eden is forced to start packing the girls for the move and is taken to Vaughn's house, where Vaughn informs her they are moving to Dubai. Eden realizes this could be her last chance to escape. While he is in the bathroom, she sprays Vaughn's meth pipe with chemicals that Vaughn inhales, killing him. Eden then cuts the tracking bracelet off her ankle, takes drugs and money from Vaughn's house, and goes to Mario's house. Eden attempts to negotiate Priscilla's freedom; Mario refuses but asks to see her again, which Eden seemingly agrees to. While his back is turned, Eden injects Mario with drugs and kills him. Eden finds Priscilla, telling her her baby was sold, and they both escape the house. Eden finds a pay phone and calls her mother, hearing her voice {{for the first time in}} a year.|$|E
40|$|We report {{detailed}} transport measurements in {{a quantum}} dot in a spin-flip co-tunneling regime, and a quantitative {{comparison of the}} data to microscopic theory. The quantum dot is fabricated by lateral gating of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, and the conductance is measured {{in the presence of}} an in-plane Zeeman field. We focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ratio of the nonlinear conductance values at bias voltages exceeding the Zeeman threshold, a regime that permits a spin <b>flip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dot, to those below the Zeeman threshold, when <b>the</b> spin <b>flip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dot is energetically forbidden. The data obtained in three different odd-occupation dot states show good quantitative agreement with the theory with no adjustable parameters. We also compare the theoretical results to the predictions of a phenomenological form used previously for the analysis of non-linear co-tunneling conductance, specifically the determination of the heterostructure g-factor, and find good agreement between the two.

5000|$|The band's first single, [...] "Dance the Night Away," [...] {{was backed}} with an earlier recording, [...] "Who Knows Why," [...] by Kubiszewski and Nick Capetanakis (who {{performed}} with Kubiszewski in a prior group.) The {{order of the}} songs was accidentally <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record, so the older song appeared as the A side. [...] "Who Knows Why" [...] received moderate local radio play and became a surprise hit in Japan. The band eventually grew to five members. Adams left to do orchestral work, but Mark Best and Frank Vale signed on. Then by 1985, Trent Reznor (who later formed Nine Inch Nails) joined the band on keyboards, programming and backing vocals. Shortly after that, Freer departed the band for the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra {{and was replaced by}} Reznor's roommate, Chris Vrenna who would also later join Reznor in Nine Inch Nails. Still, this was clearly Kubiszewski's band as neither Reznor nor Vrenna wrote any of the songs. By 1988, the band had broken up.|$|E
5000|$|Until the {{appearance}} of the 8-cylinder President in January 1928, all Studebaker cars of the 1920s were sixes. There were three basic models — the Light, the Special and the Big Six, developing , , and [...] respectively at 2000 rpm. The first Commander, in 1927, was a continuation of the mid-range Special Six, with a 226 CID L engine. Their inbuilt durability and toughness gained them great renown under worldwide conditions. The 1928 GB Commander was a descendant of the Big Six, being powered with the proven 354 CID L engine, modified to deliver [...] at 2400 rpm. In October 1928, three Commander sixes lined up at the Atlantic City speedway to challenge the 15000 mi speed record (64.25 mph) held by the much higher-priced Auburn straight-eight Speedster.They not only accomplished that but then went on to establish new records up to 25000 mi. The two sports roadsters averaged better than 65 mph and the sedan, which had <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> icy boards during one of the night runs and had been hurriedly repaired, averaged almost 62 mph. After this, the three cars were closely scrutinised, part by part, and it was established that they were strictly stock automobiles, identical in every respect to those available at any Studebaker showroom.|$|E
