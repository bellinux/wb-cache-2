5|$|In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, {{engineer}} and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, {{which has a}} lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company {{with the intent of}} building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> by 1912.|$|E

5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E
5|$|The French cruiser De Grasse {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Lorient {{shipyard}} in Lorient in November 1938. Work on the unfinished ship stopped following the German conquest of France in May 1940. In 1942, the Kriegsmarine considered several proposals to convert the cruiser into an auxiliary aircraft carrier. The final proposal was completed by August 1942, but work on the conversion did not last long. By February 1943, the project had been abandoned, for several reasons. The shipyard suffered from a shortage of labor and materials, and the design staff had significant concerns over {{the arrangement of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>system.</b> The Allies also posed a serious threat, as Lorient was well within the range of Allied bombers. The ship was eventually retaken by the French Navy {{after the end of the}} war, and launched in 1946. She was ultimately completed in 1956 as an anti-aircraft cruiser.|$|E

25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire <b>engine</b> <b>system,</b> including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E

40|$|The {{world is}} moving towards a cleaner future. With the {{increasingly}} stringent emission regulation in maritime {{field and the}} limitation of marine diesel <b>engine</b> <b>systems,</b> the shipbuilders may start to seek cleaner solutions rather than modifying the currently prevailing internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>systems</b> (ICE). According to previous researches, a tandem fuel cell system power plant, which uses LNG as fuel, {{has a very good}} overall emission performance in comparison to marine LNG based ICE systems, and can achieve an overall efficiency of more than 60 %. To study whether the tandem fuel cell system can be an alternative for marine LNG <b>engine</b> <b>systems,</b> two models are built in this master thesis to study the performance of the system under stationary operation and transients. The first model is built to study the stationary performance of the system, and to verify the result of high efficiency from previous researches. The result shows that indeed an efficiency of almost 60 % can be reproduced. The second model is built to study the transient behaviour of the system, and to compare it with that of marine LNG <b>engine</b> <b>systems.</b> The result shows that the system has a better transient response than the recommended transient response for current marine LNG <b>engine</b> <b>systems.</b> Since the SOFC in the tandem fuel cell system has a slow transient behaviour, a hydrogen tank is added between the SOFC system and the PEMFC system as an energy buffer.

500|$|According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles, Zähringen and {{her sisters}} were to be demilitarized. This would permit the newly reorganized Reichsmarine to retain the vessels for {{auxiliary}} purposes. Zähringen was therefore stricken from the navy list on 11 March 1920 and disarmed.
