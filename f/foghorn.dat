5|$|Residents of Arbroath {{are called}} Arbroathians but often refer to {{themselves}} as Red Lichties after the red lamp that shone from the harbour light and <b>foghorn</b> tower {{at the entrance to}} the harbour as an aid to shipping entering the aforementioned harbour.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A <b>foghorn</b> was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E

25|$|The wind {{gradient}} {{and the temperature}} gradient can also have complex interactions. For example, a <b>foghorn</b> can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, {{but not in a}} sound shadow between them.|$|E
25|$|The red {{band was}} painted in 1907 to help passing ships {{determine}} their location {{and for many}} years a <b>foghorn</b> (locally known as the Boddam Coo or also as the Boddam Bear, prior to reequipping in 1978) was installed, this being officially turned off in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{was made}} without incident until {{the morning of}} 1 August 1917, when fog appeared {{off the coast of}} Nova Scotia. The visibility was reduced to near zero, but Captain William McNeil continued on his course and posted several crew members to listen for the various whistles like buoy bells or <b>foghorn</b> blasts, which warns ships of the dangerous shoals that threaten the entrance to Halifax Harbour.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>foghorns</b> use a {{vibrating}} {{column of}} air {{to create an}} audible tone, but the method of setting up this vibration differs. Some horns, like the Daboll trumpet, used vibrating plates or metal reeds, a similar principle to a modern electric car horn. Others used air forced through holes in a revolving cylinder or disk, {{in the same manner}} as a siren. Semi-automatic operation of <b>foghorns</b> was achieved by using a clockwork mechanism (or [...] "coder") to sequentially open the valves admitting air to the horns; each horn was given its own timing characteristics to help mariners identify them.|$|R
50|$|The <b>foghorns</b> {{remain in}} working order and are sounded on special {{occasions}} throughout the year, most notably during the monthly Engine Room Day, which is held at the lighthouse during the summer months.|$|R

25|$|The mineral {{line was}} built by the Ailsa Craig Granite Company Ltd. in 1909 and ran from the quarry at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher near the south <b>foghorn</b> to the Quarry Pier. This crudely {{constructed}} narrow gauge line was mainly horse drawn, although wagons were also moved by hand or hauled up inclines by winding engines. The mineral railway at the quarry end had a least one siding and a mobile steam crane loaded the larger granite blocks into the wagons that were transported to the stone crusher at the Trammins near the south <b>foghorn,</b> smaller stones being loaded and even moved by hand. Wagons or bogies were winched up to the substantial stone crusher and gravity was used to deliver the different grades of road stone to the waggons below that were then hauled by horses to the Quarry Pier via a line that ran {{in front of the}} lighthouse buildings and took a tight right-angled bend to run up the substantial stone-built incline to the storage area in preparation for delivery via sea to the mainland. Curb stones and stone railway sleepers for sections of the Scotch gauge horse-drawn railway from Ardrossan to Doura were also produced.|$|E
25|$|The trawler {{remained}} in RCN service until being {{paid off in}} 1920. St. Eloi {{was turned over to}} the Department of Marine and Fisheries and, like sister ships , , and , was converted to a lightvessel. This involved placing an electric light at the foremast head and installing a <b>foghorn</b> atop a latticework tower. The ship was re-designated Lightship No. 20 and remained as such until 1940. Returned to the RCN in 1940, St. Eloi became a gate vessel, designated Gate Vessel 12, and spent part of the war at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Handed over to the Department of Transport (the successor department of the Department of Marine and Fisheries) in June 1945, St. Eloi was ultimately disposed of in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Two {{substantial}} foghorns {{with concrete}} housings {{were built in}} 1866, one {{at the north end}} of the island near the Swine Cave reached by 'the Loups' path and the other at East Trammins on the south end. Both were powered by compressed air that was piped from the lighthouse, where a gas powered compressor was housed until 1911 when oil-powered engines were installed. One of the compressed air pipelines can still be seen within 'the Loups' path that was constructed above it. The compressed air cylinders that held the required store of air are still prominent features, especially at the Trammins <b>foghorn.</b> Both foghorns were decommissioned in 1966 and a Tyfon fog signal was used until 1987 when improvements in ship navigation made it also redundant.|$|E
25|$|All {{the towers}} were noisy {{and prone to}} {{vibration}} from the equipment. The relative flexibility of the supports also caused them to shake and sway in response to wind and waves. The frequent and sustained sounding of the platform's <b>foghorns</b> was also an annoyance to the crew.|$|R
50|$|CCG {{operates}} one of {{the largest}} networks of navigational buoys, lighthouses and <b>foghorns</b> in the world. These facilities assist marine navigation on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts as well as selected inland waterways. CCG represents Canada at the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA).|$|R
5000|$|In 1893 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sent 20 or 30 {{students}} {{to live on}} the island, while experiments were made with various types of <b>foghorns</b> in an endeavor to find one that would penetrate the area known as the [...] "Ghost Walk" [...] 6 or 7 mi to the east.|$|R
25|$|Photographs {{taken in}} the late 19th century show the horse-drawn wagons passing {{in front of the}} {{lighthouse}} and portray the substantial railway incline and storage area. At times the production outstripped the storage capacity and a photograph shows at least three piles of different grades of road stone stockpiled in front of the lighthouse enclosure. The track at the crusher had a siding that ran to the crusher and a set of points that led to the Quarry Pier main line. The Ailsa Craig Granite Company was never a financially sound business and effectively closed in 1928. The course of the mineral line is still evident near the quarries as a linear embankment that ends below Kennedy's Nag. Various artefacts of the quarry enterprise remain, including concrete blocks at Kennedy's Nag and steel and concrete remnants of the stone crusher near the south <b>foghorn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the <b>foghorn</b> and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E
500|$|Built by Trinity House in 1906, the <b>foghorn</b> {{building}} is a Grade II listed building. The siren was originally powered by a [...] engine, which gave two blasts in quick succession at two-minute intervals that could be clearly heard by people living on both coasts but for many years following World War II, the <b>foghorn</b> was heard as one long and one short blast and nautical almanac data as at 1965, stated that the interval was 1.5minutes. Volunteers from the Flat Holm Society, {{with help from the}} Prince's Trust, restored the horn and engines in the 1960s. The <b>Foghorn</b> Station was officially reopened by the Welsh Secretary and the Welsh Assembly First Secretary in May 2000 when the <b>foghorn</b> was sounded {{for the first time since}} 1988.|$|E
5000|$|The present lighthouse, a {{concrete}} tower, {{was built in}} 1967 and is situated high atop a bluff. The lighthouse was automated in the 1990s, and a massive array of electronic <b>foghorns</b> erected. The light-keepers house was left vacant for several years, then rented, and then vacant once more. It was burned by vandals in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association was a United Kingdom company {{set up in}} the 19th {{century to}} produce marine signal lights and <b>foghorns.</b> It was founded by Nathaniel John Holmes, a {{telegraph}} engineer from Middlesex; and it passed to his son Joseph R. Holmes. The company was taken over by Albright and Wilson in 1919.|$|R
25|$|Wind {{gradient}} {{can have}} a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as <b>foghorns,</b> thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and {{must be considered in}} the design of noise barriers.|$|R

500|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was fully}} automated in February 1994. The extant optics were kept, but complemented with a three position lampchanger. The <b>foghorn</b> {{was changed to}} an electric model, with a directional 500Hz emitter stack that was installed on the gallery of the lantern room. The active lighthouse has a [...] masonry tower with lantern and gallery. The tower is painted white, with a single wide red horizontal band in the middle. The lighthouse has a white light which occults every ten seconds. There is a continuous red light {{as well as an}} occulting red light which is on for 5.8 seconds and off for 4.2 seconds. In addition, a <b>foghorn</b> emits a blast every twenty seconds.|$|E
500|$|Michigan Audubon {{formed a}} Whitefish Point Committee in 1976 {{to secure a}} license {{for access to the}} U.S. Coast Guard Whitefish Point Light Station except for the {{automated}} light and <b>foghorn.</b> [...] The WPBO was established in 1978 as a non-profit organization supported by membership fees, donations and gifts, voluntary service, and grants from private and government institutions.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{experiments}} {{to develop more}} effective <b>foghorns</b> were carried out by John Tyndall and Lord Rayleigh, amongst others. The latter's ongoing research for Trinity House culminated in a design for a siren with a large trumpet designed to achieve maximum sound propagation (see reference for details of the Trials of Fog Signals), installed in Trevose Head Lighthouse, Cornwall in 1913.|$|R
5000|$|Lamb's radio career peaked with {{presenting}} an eponymous daytime BBC Radio 6 Music show, for {{two years}} from October 2007 to November 2009, before being moved the early weekend mornings for 6 months, then leaving 6 Music in May 2010. [...] His show mixed shock jock banter with his Ministry of Sound DJ co-host, Marc Hughes; Jamaican Patois, dancehall music and loud <b>foghorns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cloch Lighthouse was {{designed}} by Thomas Smith and his son-in-law Robert Stevenson. The building was completed in 1797. There appear to be two generations of keepers' houses, the older now used as stores and the more recent having crow-stepped gables. The short circular-section tower has a corbelled walkway and triangular windows. The <b>foghorns</b> were added between 1895 and 1897.|$|R
