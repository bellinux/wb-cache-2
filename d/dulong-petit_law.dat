25|$|This {{result is}} valid for {{any type of}} {{harmonic}} oscillator, such as a pendulum, a vibrating molecule or a passive electronic oscillator. Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy kBT and hence contributes kB to the system's heat capacity. This {{can be used to}} derive the formula for Johnson–Nyquist noise and the <b>Dulong–Petit</b> <b>law</b> of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the equipartition theorem is {{intertwined}} with that of specific heat capacity, {{both of which were}} studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thérèse Petit discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element. Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights. However, subsequent studies by James Dewar and Heinrich Friedrich Weber showed that this <b>Dulong–Petit</b> <b>law</b> holds only at high temperatures; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as diamond, the specific heat capacity was lower. Read at l'Académie des Sciences on 11 January 1841.|$|E
30|$|In the {{temperature}} range of 100 °C to 200 °C, the observed specific heats were rather {{greater than those}} predicted from <b>Dulong-Petit’s</b> <b>law.</b> It is concluded that the deviation from <b>Dulong-Petit’s</b> <b>law</b> is due to that the atoms more intensively move via the vacancies increased by heating.|$|R
30|$|Specific heats of {{two types}} of lead tellurides, namely p-type Pb 1 -xSn x Te (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) and n-type PbTe doped with y mass% PbI 2 (y = 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0), were {{observed}} in the temperature range of 50 °C to 500 °C using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The specific heat of pure Te is also observed in the same temperature range to confirm the dominance of Te. At lower temperatures below 200 °C, all the observed data were fairly consistent with those predicted {{on the basis of}} <b>Dulong-Petit’s</b> <b>law,</b> while above 200 °C, the observed data showed curious temperature dependences. At high temperatures above 200 °C, DSC analysis, with the aid of the experiment on pure Te, revealed an anomalously large specific heat that can be predicted from the Schottky defects caused by decomposition and sublimation of Te. In the n-type case, the anomaly in specific heats is rather smaller than that in the p-type case, which fact suggested that the dopant PbI 2 may suppress the decomposition and sublimation of Te from lead tellurides.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of Finite-Time Thermodynamics (FTT) a {{simplified}} thermal power plant model (the so-called Novikov engine) is analyzed under economical criteria {{by means of the}} concepts of profit function and the costs involved in the performance of the power plant. In this study, two different heat transfer laws are used, the so called Newton’s law of cooling and the <b>Dulong-Petit’s</b> <b>law</b> of cooling. Two FTT optimization criteria for the performance analysis are used: the maximum power regime (MP) and the so-called ecological criterion. This last criterion leads the engine model towards a mode of performance that appreciably diminishes the engine’s wasted energy. In this work, it is shown that the energy-unit price produced under maximum power conditions is cheaper than that produced under maximum ecological (ME) conditions. This was accomplished by using a typical definition of profits function stemming from economics. The MP-regime produces considerably more wasted energy toward the environment, thus the MP energy-unit price is subsidized by nature. Due to this fact, an ecological tax is proposed, which could be a certain function of the price difference between the MP and ME modes of power production...|$|R
25|$|Waterston's key {{paper was}} written and {{submitted}} in 1845 to the Royal Society. After refusing to publish his work, the Society {{also refused to}} return his manuscript and stored it among its files. The manuscript was discovered in 1891 by Lord Rayleigh, who criticized the original reviewer for failing to recognize the significance of Waterston's work. Waterston managed to publish his ideas in 1851, and therefore has priority over Maxwell for enunciating {{the first version of}} the equipartition theorem. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and rotational energy. In 1876, Ludwig Boltzmann expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system. Boltzmann applied the equipartition theorem to provide a theoretical explanation of the <b>Dulong–Petit</b> <b>law</b> for the specific heat capacities of solids.|$|E
25|$|The equipartition theorem makes {{quantitative}} predictions. Like the virial theorem, {{it gives}} the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's heat capacity can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring. For example, it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)kBT in thermal equilibrium, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the (thermodynamic) temperature. More generally, equipartition {{can be applied to}} any classical system in thermal equilibrium, no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the ideal gas law, and the <b>Dulong–Petit</b> <b>law</b> for the specific heat capacities of solids. The equipartition theorem {{can also be used to}} predict the properties of stars, even white dwarfs and neutron stars, since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered.|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} Novikov {{power plant}} {{model has been}} widely used to represent some actual power plants, such as nuclear electric power generators. In the present work, a thermo-economic study of a Novikov power plant model is presented under three different regimes of performance: maximum power (MP), maximum ecological function (ME) and maximum efficient power (EP). In this study, different heat transfer laws are used: The Newton’s law of cooling, the Stefan–Boltzmann radiation <b>law,</b> the <b>Dulong–Petit’s</b> <b>law</b> and another phenomenological heat transfer law. For the thermoeconomic optimization of power plant models, a benefit function defined as the quotient of an objective function and the total economical costs is commonly employed. Usually, the total costs take into account two contributions: a cost related to the investment and another stemming from the fuel consumption. In this work, a new cost associated {{to the maintenance of}} the power plant is also considered. With these new total costs, it is shown that under the maximum ecological function regime the plant improves its economic and energetic performance in comparison with the other two regimes. The methodology used in this paper is within the context of finite-time thermodynamics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{advanced}} {{model of}} irreversible thermoelectric generator with a generalized heat transfer law is established based on finite time thermodynamics. The generalized heat transfer law represents {{a class of}} heat transfer laws including Newtonian heat transfer law, linear phenomenological heat transfer law, radiative heat transfer <b>law,</b> <b>Dulong-Petit</b> heat transfer <b>law,</b> generalized convective heat transfer law and generalized radiative heat transfer law. The inner effects including Seebeck effect, Fourier effect, Joule effect and Thomson effect, and external heat transfer {{are taken into account}} in the model. The Euler–Lagrange functions at maximum power output and maximum efficiency are established. Applying the model to a practical example in engineering, it is found that the external heat transfer law does affect the characteristics and optimal performance of the thermoelectric device, and the maximum power output and maximum efficiency with Newtonian heat transfer law are the maximum among the several typical heat transfer laws. The results can offer principles for the power and efficiency optimization of practical thermoelectric generators at various external heat transfer conditions...|$|R
