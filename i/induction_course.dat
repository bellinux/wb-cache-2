Trainee Detectives spend {{a minimum of}} six months as a Constable on Trial after completing an intensive Selection and <b>Induction</b> <b>course.</b> During these initial six months {{they are required to}} pass four module based exams before progression to Detective Constable. They are then required to continue studying with another six exam based modules {{as well as a number}} of workplace assessments. Once the Detective Constable has completed all of this they are then required to sit a pre-requisite exam based on all of the exam based modules they have previously sat. If they are successful in passing this they attend the Royal New Zealand Police College where they complete their training with the Detective Qualification course before receiving the final designation of Detective. All of these requirements are expected to be completed within two to three years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhether {{the number}} of {{chemotherapy}} cycles required to obtain a first morphological remission affects {{prognosis of patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains controversial. To clarify how achievement of early remission might influence outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we studied 220 consecutive adults with AML in first morphological remission who underwent transplantation after myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning to investigate how {{the number of}} standard- or high-dose <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> required to achieve remission impacted post-HCT outcome. Three-year estimates of overall survival were 65 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 56 % to 73 %), 56 % (95 % CI, 43 % to 67 %), and 23 % (95 % CI, 6 % to 46 %) for patients requiring 1 course, 2 courses, or > 2 <b>courses</b> of <b>induction</b> therapy; corresponding relapse estimates were 24 % (95 % CI, 17 % to 31 %), 43 % (95 % CI, 31 % to 55 %), and 58 % (95 % CI, 30 % to 78 %), respectively. After covariate adjustment (minimal residual disease status, conditioning, age, cytogenetic disease risk, type of consolidation chemotherapy, pre-HCT karyotype, and pre-HCT peripheral blood count recovery), the hazard ratios for 2 or > 2 <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> versus 1 <b>induction</b> were 1. 16 (95 % CI,. 73 to 1. 85, P = . 53) and 2. 63 (95 % CI, 1. 24 to 5. 57, P = . 011) for overall mortality, and 2. 10 (95 % CI, 1. 27 to 3. 48, P = . 004) and 3. 32 (95 % CI, 1. 42 to 7. 78, P = . 006), respectively, for relapse.

40|$|AbstractA {{prospective}} phase II multicenter {{trial was}} {{performed with the}} aim to obtain less than 25 % nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) consisting of total body irradiation (2 Gy), cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg), and fludarabine (200 mg/m 2). From 2007 to 2009, 79 UCBT recipients were enrolled. Patients who underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR 1) (n = 48) had a higher frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics and secondary AML and required more <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> of chemotherapy to achieve CR 1 compared with the others. The median infused total nucleated cells (TNC) was 3. 4  × 107 /kg, 60 % received double UCBT, 77 % were HLA mismatched (4 / 6), and 40 % had major ABO incompatibility. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 was 87 % and the cumulative incidence of 100 -day acute graft-versus-host disease (II to IV) was 50 %. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse was 20 % and 46 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, major ABO incompatibility (P =. 001) and TNC (< 3. 4  × 107 /kg; P =. 001) were associated with increased NRM, and use of 2 or more <b>induction</b> <b>courses</b> to obtain CR 1 was associated with increased relapse incidence (P =. 04). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years was 35 %, and the only factor associated with decreased LFS was secondary AML (P =. 04). In conclusion, despite the decreased NRM observed, other RIC regimens with higher myelosuppression should be evaluated to decrease relapse in high-risk AML. (EUDRACT 2006 - 005901 - 67) ...|$|R
