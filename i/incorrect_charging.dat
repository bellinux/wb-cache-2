40|$|Traditional process {{monitoring}} methods of off-line analysis involve removing a sample {{from the process}} and taking it to a centralised analytical laboratory. It takes time for the analytical result to be achieved {{and the result is}} used retrospectively to determine the yield or quality of a batch, and not to control the process. This leads to batches being produced that do not meet specifications, so may require re-working, wasting time and money. The process should be monitored to allow control of the batch to ensure it meets specifications first time, and every time. The use of at-line or on-line analysis, such as near infrared spectroscopy, provides quicker process analysis and allows the results to be used to monitor and control the process. These techniques are usually nondestructive so less waste is produced, and are safer as they can be located away from the process environment. Within the analysis of processes, sampling is a key issue. The sample must be representative of the process to ensure the analysis gives a true indication of the batch. This is a problem when the process is heterogeneous as a sample taken from one region of the process may give a different analytical result from a sample taken from another region. Guided microwave spectroscopy (GMS) has been investigated for its use as an on-line process analyser. The GMS has a sample chamber in which a process can be carried out and this whole chamber is analysed. This removes the sampling issue. This method is not well understood or used in process analysis due to the complicated MW spectra. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a tried and tested method of process analysis and many examples of applications exist of its use in industry. The spectra are easy to interpret and relate to the process. The main problem with NIR is that a probe must be used for on-line analysis. This produces sampling issues, and any process variation, such as a process upset, must be {{in the vicinity of the}} probe to be detected. In this work, a new process analysis technique, GMS, has been compared to an established technique, NIR, to determine their effectiveness within process analysis. NIR is used as a reference method for the GMS to aid interpretation of the spectra, and relate it to the process. Various processes have been investigated to determine the effectiveness of NIR and GMS to monitor them. A drying process has been monitored which has a problem of sampling due to huge cakes of several tonnes of material that are dried. The drying process was first simulated by adding solvent to a material to determine if the process can be monitored and the limits of solvent that can be detected. NIR data was collected using a diffuse reflectance probe. The spectra were found to be unrepresentative of the process as it was reliant on the solvent added being in the vicinity of the probe. GMS was used to monitor the process as it provides a representative measurement. Three different systems were analysed: the addition of water to sand, propanol to ascorbic acid and ethanol to salicylic acid. Simple partial least squares (PLS) models were built to predict the amount of solvent present in the solid sample from MW spectra. Various pre-processing techniques were examined to produce the best model. The models were built using auto-scaled followed by Box-Cox logarithmically transformed data, and allow prediction of the amount of water in sand, and the amount of propanol in ascorbic acid down to 1 % w/w with relative errors below 5 %. The calibration models can predict up to 30 % solvent, so the technique was shown to be very useful for monitoring the drying of a solid. The model for the addition of ethanol to salicylic acid gave relative errors of 32 % so seems to be an unsuitable method. However, models built using above 2 % ethanol gave relative errors of only 20 / 0, suggesting the MW spectra are not sensitive to levels of ethanol below this. Propanol was then removed from ascorbic acid by drying to prove that the actual drying method can be monitored. The use of principal component analysis (PCA) scores plotted against time and the residuals (process spectra minus the reference dry spectra) show that the drying process has the possibility of being monitored in a representative way using MW spectroscopy. An esterification reaction has been monitored and various aspects of this process have been investigated. Traditionally calibration models are built using reference concentration spectra. Ideally process samples should be used to build the model which means a reference method such as GC must be used to give concentration data. These methods take time to develop and within this work it was found difficult to get reproducible results. Calibration free techniques have been used to extract the concentration profiles of the reaction to allow the rate constants of the reaction to be determined. A calibration free technique has also been used to determine the endpoint of the process, and also detect process upsets. During these processes, it is desirable to be able to predict the endpoint of a reaction, instead of waiting for it to be reached, which may waste time. It is also advantageous to be able to detect process upsets to allow the batch to be corrected. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) was used to extract the concentration profiles from the MW and NIR spectra, and these profiles used to calculate the rate constants, k of the reaction. The MW and NIR calculated k values do not agree, suggesting the two techniques do not capture the same process variation. The rate constants have also been calculated using GC measurements as a comparison. These values also do not agree with the spectroscopic methods, but it is unknown which method provides the correct determination of the rate constant. However, it has been found that the use of MW and NIR spectroscopy provides a much more reproducible method to monitor esterification reactions than GC. An adaptive algorithm called caterpillar has been used to determine the endpoint of an esterification reaction, and also to detect a variety of process upsets. This allows the reaction to be monitored to ensure it proceeds as expected without the need for building a calibration model. The endpoint was detected reproducibly for MW spectra taken for repeat reactions showing the spectra are suitable for monitoring the reaction. The same endpoint was not detected for corresponding NIR spectra, so this does not appear to be as reproducible a method. MW spectroscopy was found to detect process upsets of addition of incorrect catalyst, addition of water, addition of an interferant and incorrect changing of reactants. The NIR was found to only pick up the addition of water and <b>incorrect</b> <b>charging</b> of reactants. It has been found that the MW spectra are more sensitive to small disturbances in the process variation and it is a better technique for endpoint determination and process upset detection. The NIR spectra does not appear to be as representative of the process, possibly due to the limitations of sampling with the probe used.

40|$|Low-energy collision-induced {{dissociation}} (CID) of peptides in {{a collision}} cell {{has been introduced}} as a fast method for peptide sequencing [1]. The method has been adapted {{to the analysis of}} gel-isolated proteins by the introduction of the nanoESI technology [2]. In the meantime proteins can be identified by search-engine supported interpretation of raw data of peptide MS/MS spectra in correlation to a protein sequence database [e. g. 3]. A triplet of information, consisting of the protease specificity (mostly trypsin), the molecular weight of the precursor peptide, and a series of MS/MS sequence ions usually forms the basic information for search engine-supported protein identification in sequence databases by ESI-MS/MS data. In spite of the success of this approach, in practical work the majority of automatically acquired ESI-MS/MS spectra of tryptic peptides is often left unidentified. Unknown covalent modifications, <b>incorrect</b> assignment of <b>charge</b> states of precursor and fragment ions, the absence of a sufficiently long series of sequence ions, or the selection of non-optimal instrumental conditions are considered to be the main reasons for this situation.

Hence, we have increased the c-factor to overcome the low electron charge density that originated from the vacancy for our case. It is worth to note that, in practice, the c-factor cannot be unlimitedly increased. Thus, the experimental bandgap cannot be always exactly reproduced by increasing the c-factor in {{the current version of}} the mBJ method for every case without considering the electron charge density variation and bonding nature of the case. Indeed, there can be a critical value for the c-factor, as reported in [10]. For larger c values than the critical c value, the bandgap may be drastically decreased to a meaningless value far from the experiment. This shows that the mBJ potential may result in an <b>incorrect</b> electron <b>charge</b> density, if one uses a very large c-factor. The latter point was perfectly demonstrated [10] by calculating the electric field gradient, as an extremely sensitive physical quantity to the shape of the valence electron charge density, versus the c-factor for the Cu 2 O compound. Consequently, the c-factor, as a measure for the electron charge density, should be carefully examined and optimized at least for those cases having low electron charge density. The low charge density may originate from some hollow spaces due to the vacancies, as what existed in the γ-Al 2 O 3 case, or from weak van der Waals bonds, as what existed in the fcc-C 60 fullerite. Therefore, from the above discussion, we would, as a corollary result, anticipate that the c-factor may not be also well produced by the regular mBJ method for the case of fcc-C 60. Thereby, one needs to first optimize the c-factor for this case as well. The latter anticipation needs more elaboration which is out of the scope of this work.|$|R

Substrate specificity along with editing functions of aaRSs act to prevent or remove <b>incorrect</b> amino acids <b>charged</b> onto tRNAs. Editing domains are highly conserved and found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes; knocking out the editing function of an aaRS does not seem to affect cell viability. To determine the biological relevance of the editing domains found on aaRSs, it is essential to determine the contribution of editing to protein fidelity in vivo. Bacillus subtilis serves as an ideal model to study this phenomenon because it possesses a small gene-enocoded, 10 amino acid pheromone peptide, ComX. ComX is processed, modified, and secreted by B. subtilis as a signaling molecule that can easily be purified. The amino acid sequence of ComX can be altered to some degree while maintaining cellular activity enabling different strains that produce variants of ComX pheromone to be compared for levels of mistranslation. Ultimately future experiments will reveal the impact that editing by an aaRS has on the fidelity of protein synthesis in vivo by quantifying the rates of mistranslation in strains of B. subtilis that express an editing-defective tRNA synthetase and comparing it to levels of mistranslation to wild type strains...|$|R
40|$|Screening of a {{strongly}} charged macroion by multivalent counterions is considered. It is shown that counterions form {{a strongly}} correlated liquid {{at the surface}} of the macroion. Cohesive energy of this liquid leads to additional attraction of counterions to the surface which is absent in conventional solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Away from the surface this attraction can be taken into account by a new boundary condition for the concentration of counterions near the surface. Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved with this boundary condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder and a sphere. In all three cases, screening is much stronger than in the conventional approach. At some critical exponentially small concentration of multivalent counterions in the solution they totally neutralize the surface charge at small distances from the surface. At larger concentrations they invert the sign the net macroion charge. Absolute value of the inverted charge density can be as large as 20 % of that of the bare one. In particular, for a cylindrical macroion, it is shown that for screening by multivalent counterions predictions of the Onsager-Manning theory are quantitatively <b>incorrect.</b> The net <b>charge</b> density of the cylinder is smaller than their theory predicts and inverts sign with growing concentration of counterions.

The splitting is diagnostic of some form of seismic anisotropy, although {{the cause of this}} anisotropy has been sometimes disputed. The evidence in this review unquestionably indicates cracks, specifically stress-aligned fluid-saturated microcracks, as the predominant cause of the azimuthally-aligned shear-wave splitting in the crust. Although, in principle, shear-wave splitting is simple in concept and easy to interpret in terms of systems of anisotropic symmetry, in practice there are subtle differences from isotropic propagation that make it easy to make errors in interpretation. Unless authors are aware of these differences, misinterpretations are likely which has led to <b>incorrect</b> conclusions and <b>charges</b> of controversy where only misinterpretations exist. As a consequence, stress-aligned fluid-saturated microcracks as the cause of azimuthally-aligned shear-wave splitting in the crust is still not universally accepted despite there being distinguishing features that directly indicate crack-induced anisotropy. This paper reviews observations and interpretations of crack-induced shear-wave splitting and demonstrates that claims for aligned crystals and other sources of shear-wave splitting are due to fallacies in interpretation. This review shows how previous contrary interpretations are resolved and discusses common fallacies and misinterpretations. It is suggested that this new interpretation of shear-wave splitting has such fundamental implications for almost all solid-earth geoscience that it amounts to a New Geophysics with applications to particularly exploration and earthquake geoscience but also to almost to all other branches of solid Earth geoscience. ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. Thesis. August 2013. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisors: Prodromos Daoutidis and Aditya Bhan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xviii, 210 pages. Complex reaction networks {{are found in}} a variety of engineered and natural chemical systems ranging from petroleum processing to atmospheric chemistry and including biomass conversion, materials synthesis, metabolism, and biological degradation of chemicals. These systems comprise of several thousands of reactions and species inter-related through a highly interconnected network. This thesis presents methods, computational tools, and applications that demonstrate that: (a) any complex network can be constructed automatically from a small set of initial reactants and chemical transformation rules, and (b) a given network can be analyzed in terms of identifying topological information such as reaction pathways, determining thermodynamically feasible routes, evaluating the spectrum of plausible and synthetically feasible compounds, exploring dominant routes to form experimentally observed products, and formulating and solving a rigorous kinetic model. A new computational tool called Rule Input Network Generator, or RING, has been developed to construct and analyze complex reaction networks. Given initial reactants of a reaction system (e. g. the components of the feed to a reactor) and reaction rules that describe the possible chemical transformations that can occur, RING first constructs an exhaustive network of reactions and species consistent with the inputs. Inputs into RING are in the form an English-like domain specific language with syntax involving common chemistry parlance. The language compiler further catches erroneous chemistry rules, such as <b>incorrect</b> <b>charge</b> balance in a reaction rule, and heuristically optimizes user-specified instructions to improve the speed of execution. RING, further, accepts "post-processing" instructions that allow for: (i) lumping, or grouping together isomers {{to reduce the size of}} the reaction network, (ii) "querying" the network to extract information such as reaction pathways and mechanisms that describe how an initial reactant is transformed into a specific product, (iii) calculating thermochemical properties of species and reactions to evaluate thermochemical feasibility of reaction steps, and (iv) formulating and solving rigorous microkinetic models of complex reaction networks. RING, thus, provides a rule-based" framework to assemble and explore a complex reaction network. RING implements several algorithms, methods, and techniques from computer science, cheminformatics, and graph theory. The language has been developed using SILVER, a meta-language for specifying attribute grammars, and COPPER, a parser generator. The language is extensible in that independent additions can be incorporated to the original language to perform additional analysis without syntactical and semantic conflicts with the existing grammar. Algorithms from chemical graph theory and cheminformatics are adopted to (i) represent molecules as strings externally and as graphs internally, (ii) store reaction rules as graph transformation rules, (iii) identify fragments in molecules that can serve as reaction centers through pattern matching, (iv) determine molecular characteristics such as shape (linear, branched, cyclic, etc.) and aromaticity, and (v) identify isomeric lumps through a new molecular hashing technique. Graph traversal algorithms are further employed by the post-processing modules to identify pathways and mechanisms. This thesis presents several case studies of application of RING in elucidating complex networks of reactions. First, when chemistry alone is known about the system, RING can be used to identify plausible mechanisms for product formation consistent with experimental observations; it can further be used to postulate possible experiments to discriminate between the alternative mechanisms. This has been demonstrated with a case study of glycerol and acetone conversion on solid Bronsted acid catalysts. Second, if molecular properties can be evaluated quickly using semi-empirical methods for a large number of species and compounds, RING can be used to identify species in the network that have desired physical properties and thermochemically favorable synthesis routes to form them. A case study on identifying fatty alcohols, in a spectrum of more than 60, 000 compounds, that can potentially be used to make nonionic surfactants with desirable properties and their synthesis routes from biomass-derived oxygenates presents an application of this method. It was found that lauryl alcohol, a fatty alcohol currently used to make surfactants, can be synthesized from biomass-oxygenates using a combination of metal, basic, and acid catalysts. It was also found that some of the intermediate synthesis steps could potentially be coupled to drive the overall reaction forward, or could benefit from using biphasic systems for immediate separation of products from reactants. Third, if activation barriers of each step in the reaction can be reliably predicted using semi-empirical methods, RING can be used to identify dominant reaction mechanisms for converting reactants to experimentally observed products. This was demonstrated by analyzing the energetically favorable mechanisms for glycerol conversion to syn gas or 1, 2 -propane diol on transition metal catalysts such as Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, and Ruthenium. It was found that glycerol would decompose to syn gas on Platinum and Palladium, while a significant selectivity to the diol can be obtained on Rhodium and Ruthenium, thus offering insights for designing catalysts for complex biomass conversion systems. Finally, if kinetic parameters and thermochemistry can be estimated apriori, RING can be used to formulate and solve rigorous microkinetic models to get quantitative information such as yield and selectivity. This feature is demonstrated through a model developed for methanol conversion to hydrocarbons (MTH) on Bronsted acid catalyst HZSM- 5. RING is generic in terms of chemistries it can handle and flexible in terms of the type of analysis that can be performed. This thesis posits that it can be used in conjunction with experimental and computational chemistry data to elucidate systems with complex reaction networks, especially in hydrocarbon processing and biomass conversion...|$|R
40|$|Predicting the {{compositional}} {{phase stability}} of strongly correlated electron materials {{is an outstanding}} challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ the DFT+U formalism to address the effects of local correlations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional phase stability in the prototype phase stable and separating materials LixCoO 2 and olivine LixFePO 4, respectively. We exploit a new spectral decomposition of the DFT+U total energy, revealing the distinct roles of the filling and ordering of the d orbital correlated subspace. The on-site interaction U drives both of these very different materials systems towards phase separation, stemming from enhanced ordering of the d orbital occupancies in the x= 0 and x= 1 species, whereas changes in the overall filling of the d shell contribute negligibly. We show that DFT+U formation energies are qualitatively consistent with experiments for phase stable LixCoO 2, phase separating LixFePO 4, and phase stable LixCoPO 4. However, we find that charge ordering plays {{a critical role in}} the energetics at intermediate x, strongly dampening the tendency for the Hubbard U to drive phase separation. Most relevantly, the phase stability of Li 1 / 2 CoO 2 within DFT+U is qualitatively <b>incorrect</b> without allowing <b>charge</b> ordering, which is problematic given that neither charge ordering nor the band gap that it induces are observed in experiment. We demonstrate that charge ordering arises from the correlated subspace interaction energy as opposed to the double counting. Additionally, we predict the Li order-disorder transition temperature for Li 1 / 2 CoO 2, demonstrating that the unphysical charge ordering within DFT+U renders the method problematic, often producing unrealistically large results. Our findings motivate the need for other advanced techniques, such as DFT+DMFT, for total energies in strongly correlated materials...|$|R
40|$|CONSPECTUS: The {{understanding}} of adsorption and reactions of (large) organic molecules at metal surfaces plays {{an increasingly important}} role in modern surface science and technology. Such hybrid inorganic/organic systems (HIOS) are relevant for many applications in catalysis, light emitting diodes, single-molecule junctions, molecular sensors and switches, and photovoltaics. Obviously, the predictive modeling and {{understanding of}} the structure and stability of such hybrid systems is an essential prerequisite for tuning their electronic properties and functions. At present, density-functional theory (DFT) is the most promising approach to study the structure, stability, and electronic properties of complex systems, because it can be applied to both molecules and solids comprising thousands of atoms. However state-of-the-art approximations to DFT do not provide a consistent and reliable description for HIOS, which is largely due to two issues: (i) the self-interaction of the electrons with themselves arising from the Hartree term of the total energy that is not fully compensated in approximate exchange-correlation functionals, and (ii) the lack of long-range part of the ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The self-interaction errors sometimes lead to <b>incorrect</b> description of <b>charge</b> transfer and electronic level alignment in HIOS, although for molecules adsorbed on metals these effects will often cancel out in total energy differences. Regarding vdW interactions, several promising vdW-inclusive DFT-based methods have been recently demonstrated to yield remarkable accuracy for intermolecular interactions in the gas phase. However, the majority of these approaches neglect the nonlocal collective electron response in the vdW energy tail, an effect that is particularly strong in condensed phases and at interfaces between different materials. Here we show that the recently developed DFT+vdW(surf) method that accurately accounts for the collective electronic response effects enables reliable modeling of structure and stability for a broad class of organic molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. This method was demonstrated to achieve quantitative accuracy for aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and diindenoperylene), C- 60, and sulfur/oxygen-containing molecules (thiophene, NTCDA, and PTCDA) on dose-packed and stepped metal surfaces, leading to an overall accuracy of 0. 1 angstrom in adsorption heights and 0. 1 eV in binding energies with respect to state-of-the-art experiments. An unexpected finding is that vdW interactions contribute more to the binding of strongly bound molecules on transition-metal surfaces than for molecules physisorbed on coinage metals. The accurate inclusion of vdW interactions also significantly improves tilting angles and adsorption heights for all the studied molecules, and can qualitatively change the potential-energy surface for adsorbed molecules with flexible functional groups. Activation barriers for molecular switches and reaction precursors are modified as well...|$|R
