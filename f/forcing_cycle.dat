40|$|The {{generalized}} Swift [...] Hohenberg {{equation is}} used to study the persistence and decay of localized patterns {{in the presence of}} time-periodic parametric forcing in one and two dimensions. A localized state that was stable with constant forcing may begin to breathe under periodic forcing, i. e. grow for part of the <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle</b> via nucleation of new wavelengths of the pattern followed by wavelength annihilation during another part of the cycle. The breathing dynamics occur as the forcing parameter exits the region of stability of the localized pattern on either side and the fronts that define the edges of the state temporarily depin. The parameters of the forcing determine if there will be net growth, a balance, or net decay on average. A novel resonance phenomenon between the forcing period and the time required to nucleate one wavelength of the pattern outside the pinning region is identified. The resonances generate distinct regions in parameter space characterized by the net number of wavelengths gained or lost in one <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle.</b> Canard trajectories, in which the localized state follows an unstable solution branch for some amount of time before quickly jumping to a stable one, appear near the transitions between each region.

This theory leads to predictions that are qualitatively correct and, in some cases, provide quantitative agreement with numerical simulations. The underlying resonance mechanism is a more general phenomenon and is also studied in the context of coupled oscillator systems with a periodically modulated Adler equation as a simple model.

40|$|Predicting extrema of chaotic {{systems in}} high-dimensional phase space remains a challenge. Methods, which give extrema that are valid {{in the long}} term, have thus far been {{restricted}} to models {{of only a few}} variables. Here, a method is presented which treats extrema of chaotic systems as belonging to discretised manifolds of low dimension (low-D) embedded in high-dimensional (high-D) phase space. As a central feature, the method exploits that strange attractor dimension is generally much smaller than parent system phase space dimension. This is important, since the computational cost associated with discretised manifolds depends exponentially on their dimension. Thus, systems that would otherwise be associated with tremendous computational challenges, can be tackled on a laptop. As a test, bounding manifolds are calculated for high-D modifications of the canonical Duffing system. Parameters can be set such that the bounding manifold displays harmonic behaviour even if the underlying system is chaotic.

40|$|Convective {{equilibrium}} is {{a long-standing}} and useful concept for understanding {{many aspects of}} the behaviour of deep moist convection. For example, it is often invoked in developing parameterizations for large-scale models. However, the equilibrium assumption may begin to break down as models are increasingly used with shorter timesteps and finer resolutions. Here we perform idealized cloud-system resolving model simulations of deep convection with imposed time variations in the surface forcing. A range of rapid forcing timescales from 1 − 36 hr are used, in order to induce systematic departures from equilibrium. For the longer forcing timescales, the equilibrium assumption remains valid, in at least the limited sense that cycle-integrated measures of convective activity are very similar from cycle to cycle. For shorter forcing timescales, cycle-integrated convection becomes more variable, with enhanced activity on one cycle being correlated with reduced activity on the next, suggesting a role for convective memory. Further investigation shows that the memory {{does not appear to be}} carried by the domain-mean thermodynamic fields but rather by structures on horizontal scales of 5 − 20 km. Such structures are produced by the convective clouds and can persist beyond the lifetime of the cloud, even through to the next <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Superharmonic {{responses}} {{are characteristic of}} many nonlinear systems undergoing high intensity of excitation. Recent experimental investigation findings of energy harvesting involves nonlinear systems have observed superharmonic dynamics and phenomenological effects which yields superior electrical power relative to that achieved by the fundamental harmonic. Superharmonic response, indicated by dynamics occurring at integer fractions of the fundamental frequency, exhibits a behavior that the response frequency is several times of {{the frequency of the}} excitation. Particularly in an electrostatic power harvester, each oscillation is accompanied by power harvesting. Thus, the superharmonic response leads to doubling, tripling or even more times of the power harvesting cycles than that introduced by the fundamental harmonic which {{is the same as the}} <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle.</b> The most general mechanism of an electrostatic power harvester consists a variable capacitor which could be modeled as a bilinear stiffness oscillator with limiters or stoppers. In particular, we are interested in investigating the superharmonic responses of such models when forced at a frequency much lower than the resonance frequency of the oscillator and large amplitude responses when the forcing is "subcritical", i. e. the forcing amplitude is below the threshold to cause impact as predicted based on the linear theory. It is exemplified by previous investigations that the superharmonic responses at subcritical forcing amplitude are desirable responses of power harvesters when forced at a frequency well-below its resonance frequency. Although a large literature already exists on the studies of impact, it seems that additional experimental investigations focusing on low frequency {{responses are}} still warranted...|$|E
40|$|Idealised {{modelling}} {{studies have}} shown that the melting of ice shelves varies as a quadratic function of ocean temperature. However, this result is the equilibrium response, derived from steady ice— ocean simulations subjected to a fixed ocean forcing. This study considers instead the transient response of melting, using unsteady simulations subjected to forcing conditions that are oscillated with a range of periods. The results show that the residence time of water in the sub-ice cavity offers a critical timescale. When the forcing varies slowly (period of oscillation ≫ residence time), the cavity is fully-flushed with forcing anomalies at all stages of the cycle and melting follows the equilibrium response. When the forcing varies rapidly (period ≤ residence time), multiple cold and warm anomalies coexist in the cavity, cancelling each other in the spatial mean and thus inducing a relatively steady melt rate. This implies that all ice shelves have a maximum frequency of ocean variability that can be manifested in melting. Between these two extremes, an intermediate regime occurs in which melting follows the equilibrium response during the cooling phase of the <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle,</b> but deviates during warming. The results show that ice shelves forced by warm water have high melt rates, high equilibrium sensitivity, and short residence times, hence a short timescale over which the equilibrium sensitivity is manifest. The most rapid melting adjustment is induced by warm anomalies that are also saline. Thus, ice shelves in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, Antarctica, are highly sensitive to ocean chang...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of mixing efficiency on time-varying forcing is studied by {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) of Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability. Time-dependent forcing fields are designed to reproduce a wavelike oscillation by solving the equations of motion in a tilted coordinate frame and allowing the tilt angle to vary in time. Mixing efficiency Gc {{is defined as the}} ratio of potential energy gain to dissipation, both averaged over one <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle</b> and first examined via parameters characterizing waves: the minimum Richardson number Rimin and the normalized frequency of the forcing v/N. The effect of Reynolds number Re 0 and the initial random disturbance amplitude b are also examined. In the experiments presented, Gc varies between 0. 21 and 0. 36 and is controlled by the timing of two events: the emergence of KH billows and the arrival of the deceleration of the mean shear by the wavelike forcing. Here, Gc is higher than a canonical value of 0. 2 when the deceleration phase of the forcing suppresses the less efficient turbulence after breakdown of KH billows. However, when Rimin and v/N are small, KH billows start to develop before Rimin is achieved. Therefore, the forcing accelerates the mean shear and thereby sustains turbulence after the breakdown of KH billows. The canonical value is then reproduced in the DNS. Although larger values of Re 0 and b intensify the development of KH billows and modify Gc, this effect is less significant when forcing fields act to sustain turbulence. The time-averaged Thorpe scale andOzmidov scale are also used to see howmixing is modified by forcing fields and compared with past microstructure measurements. It is found that DNS also corresponds to past observations if the forcing accelerates the mean shear to sustain turbulence. 1...|$|E

40|$|The meridional {{overturning}} circulation (MOC) is {{a large-scale}} circulation throughout the global ocean and plays {{a significant role}} in the complex global climate system. However, our traditional understanding of the processes driving the MOC has been questioned in recent years. In particular, it has been suggested that surface buoyancy forcing plays little energetic role in driving the MOC. Furthermore, doubt has also been cast over the relationship between meridional overturning and meridional density gradients. In this thesis, we revisit these two ideas using a series of equilibrium and transient numerical ocean simulations. We begin by diagnosing the global ocean's gravitational potential energy (GPE) budget at steady state in the coupled atmosphere-ocean model HadCM 3, utilising the available gravitational potential energy (AGPE) framework to distinguish between the effects of adiabatic and diabatic processes on background GPE and the portion available for adiabatic conversion to kinetic energy (AGPE). We show that surface buoyancy forcing plays an active energetic role in diabatically sustaining large-scale ocean circulation, making available background GPE generated by diapycnal mixing. We then carry out a series of transient experiments using a global configuration of the NEMO ocean modelling framework, periodically varying North Atlantic surface buoyancy forcing over a broad range of timescales. It is shown that the ocean exhibits a highly nonlinear, frequency-dependent response to forcing of the same amplitude, which is well predicted by a scaled overturning streamfunction based on twice-integrated density differences at multi-decadal timescales and longer. Finally, we analyse the AGPE generated by surface buoyancy forcing during each <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle,</b> finding a strong relationship between the AGPE power input by surface buoyancy fluxes and the magnitude of the MOC response. We conclude by discussing the remote effect of North Atlantic buoyancy forcing on lower cell overturning in the Southern Ocean, considering regional changes in AGPE generation...|$|E
40|$|Buoyancy-driven {{convection}} {{within a}} cavity, whose sidewalls are heated and cooled, {{is a problem}} of great interest, because it has applications in heat transfer and mixing. Most studies to date have studied one of two cases: the steady-state case or the development of the transient flow as it approaches steady state. Our main concern was to study the response of the cavity to time-varying thermal boundary conditions. We therefore decided to observe the flow phenomena within a convection cavity under sinusoidal thermal forcing of the sidewalls. To map the flow properly, it is necessary to have simultaneous kinematic and thermal information. Therefore, the digital particle image thermometry and velocimetry (DPITV) is used to acquire data. Implementing this technique requires seeding the flow with encapsulated liquid crystal particles and illuminating a cross section of the flow with a sheet of white light. Extraction of the thermal and kinematic content is in two parts. For the first, the liquid crystals will reflect different colors of the visible spectrum, depending on the temperatures to which they are subjected. Therefore, calibrating their color reflection with temperature allows for the extraction of the thermal content. For the second part, the kinematic information is obtained {{through the use of a}} digital cross-correlation particle image velocimetry technique. With the use of DPITV, the flow within a convection cavity is mapped and studied under steady forcing and sinusoidally forced boundary conditions at the Brunt-Väisälä frequency. For the sinusoidally forced case, three cases are studied. In the first, the heating between the two walls is in phase. In the second, the heating between the two walls is 180 ° out of phase. In the third, the heating between the two walls is 90 ° out of phase. For steady forcing, the thermal plots show that the flow develops a linearly stratified profile within the center of the cell. At the sidewalls, however, owing to forcing, hot/cold thermal boundary layers develop at the left/right walls. These hot/cold thermal boundary layers then turn around the upper-left/lower-right corners and develop into intrusion layers that extend across the top and bottom walls. The vorticity and streamlines show that the bulk of the fluid motion is concentrated around the walls, whereas the fluid within the center of the cell remains stationary. For the sinusoidally forced cases, the thermal plots show the existence of many thermal “islands,” or pockets of fluid where the temperature is different with respect to its surroundings. The vorticity plots show that the center of the cell is mostly devoid of vorticity and that the vorticity is mainly confined to the sidewalls, with some vorticity at the top and bottom walls. For the 0 ° forcing, the streamlines show the development of two counterrotating rollers. For the 180 ° forcing, the streamlines show the development of only one roller. Finally, for the 90 ° forcing, the streamlines show the development of both a two-roller and a one-roller system, depending on the position within the <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{influence}} of boundary layer processes and seasonal forcing on baroclinic eddy equilibration is studied {{to understand how the}} baroclinic adjustment is modified when taking into account these two factors. A modified [beta] plane multilevel quasi-geostrophic (QG) model with an interactive stratification and a simplified parameterization of atmospheric boundary layer physics is used as the atmospheric model in this study. Comparisons between experiments with the modified QG model and the traditional QG model with fixed stratification show {{that it is necessary to}} include the interaction between vertical eddy heat flux and stratification to obtain a realistic equilibrated state, i. e. robust isentropic slope. A slab surface model is also coupled with the atmospheric model to provide an interactive surface temperature distribution in some experiments in this study. The effect of boundary layer processes is first studied under the situation with fixed underlying surface temperature. The boundary layer vertical thermal diffusion, along with the surface heat exchange, is found primarily responsible for the limitation of the PV homogenization in the boundary layer. The boundary layer processes can influence the eddy activity in at least two competing ways. First, in the eddy energy budget, all the boundary layer processes act to damp the eddy energy directly. On the other hand, the boundary layer processes also influence the mean flow, which can further influence the eddy behavior. For the boundary layer thermal damping, the indirect effect on the eddy activity becomes dominant. (cont.) Stronger boundary layer thermal forcing results in stronger meridional temperature gradients and eddy heat fluxes. For the frictional dissipation, the resulting changes in the zonal wind and in the location of the critical latitude lead to a meridional variation of the eddy forcing, which can further result in a non-monotonic response of the mean flow. The role of the boundary layer processes in the baroclinic eddy equilibration is further studied using a simple air-sea thermally coupled model. Although in the coupled system, each boundary layer process has more and different ways to influence the equilibrium state, their effect on the lower level PV homogenization is very robust. Surface friction and surface 3 heat flux all act to damp the lower level PV mixing and stronger surface damping prevents the PV homogenization more strongly, but the way in which each boundary layer process affects the PV homogenization is very different. Baroclinic eddy equilibration under seasonal forcing is studied in both the atmospheric model and the coupled model. In the situation with specified seasonal variation of the underlying surface temperature, a Northern-Hemisphere like seasonal variation of the surface temperature is used to act on the atmospheric flow through the boundary layer processes and the radiative-convective heating. (cont.) Under slowly varying seasonal forcing, the eddy and the mean flow behavior is characterized by four clearly divided time intervals: an eddy inactive time interval in the summer, a mainly dynamically determined eddy spinup time interval starting from mid-fall and lasting less than one month, a quasi-equilibrium time interval for the zonal mean flow available potential energy from late fall to late spring and a mainly external forcing determined eddy spindown time interval from late winter to late spring. In spite of the strong seasonality of the eddy activity, a robust PV structure is still observed through all the seasons. It is found that besides baroclinic eddies, the boundary layer thermal forcing as well as the moist convection all can help maintain the lower level PV structure. The sensitivity study of the eddy equilibration to the time scale of the external forcing also indicates that the time scale separation between the baroclinic adjustment and the external forcing in midlatitudes is only visible for external <b>forcing</b> <b>cycle</b> one year and longer. The seasonality study with the coupled model confirms the conclusions obtained in the uncoupled model. by Yang Zhang. Thesis (Ph. D.)
