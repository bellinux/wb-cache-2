To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs {{at the idea of}} such controlled breeding, declaring it will inevitably break down. The crew witness the birth of a baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} <b>DNA,</b> <b>from</b> {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E

40|$|A {{pentanucleotide}} repetitive sequence, (TTAGG) n, {{has been}} isolated from a silkworm genomic library, using cross-hybridization with a (TTNGGG) 5 sequence, which is conserved among most eukaryotic telomeres. Both fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} and Bal 31 exonuclease experiments revealed major clusters of (TTAGG) n at the telomeres of all Bombyx chromosomes. To determine the evolutionary origin of this sequence, two types of telomeric sequence, (TTAGG) 5 and a hexanucleotide repetitive sequence, (TTAGGG) 4, which is conserved mainly among vertebrate and several invertebrate telomeres so far examined, were hybridized to <b>DNAs</b> <b>from</b> {{a wide variety of}} eukaryotic species under highly stringent hybridization conditions. The (TTAGGG) 5 oligonucleotide hybridized to genomic <b>DNAs</b> <b>from</b> vertebrates and several nonvertebrate species, as has been reported so far, but not to any <b>DNAs</b> <b>from</b> insects. On the other hand, the Bombyx type of telomere sequence, (TTAGG) n, hybridized to <b>DNAs</b> <b>from</b> 8 of 11 orders of insect species tested but not to vertebrate DNAs, suggesting that this TTAGG repetitive sequence is conserved widely among insects...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} paternal alleles to the DNA content of olive oil, genetic analyses of olive <b>DNA</b> samples <b>from</b> fruits, leaves, and oil derived from the same tree (cv.

5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>from</b> different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>from</b> Neanderthal bones. The relatively large evolutionary distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E

5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid <b>DNA</b> <b>from</b> one bacterial host to another.

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey.

The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found <b>DNA</b> <b>from</b> nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas.

Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
