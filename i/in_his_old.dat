5|$|Events of {{the later}} years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the {{relatively}} benevolent historian Menander Protector {{felt the need to}} attribute the Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> age.

5|$|Winston Churchill was {{impressed}} by Henson. Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed {{at the time and}} later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the momentary strangeness of being back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue.

Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy.

5|$|However, Rangnath Poudel, finding himself {{unsupported}} by the King, {{resigned from}} the mukhtiyari, which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah; but Puskhar Shah was only a nominal head, and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranjang Pande.

The Pandes were now in full possession of power; they had gained over the King to their side by flattery. The Senior Queen had been a firm supporter of their party; and they endeavored to secure popularity in the army by promises of war and plunder.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E

5|$|The Naradiya Purana narrates that Uttanka {{lived in}} an ashram in Ujjalaka. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> age, he left for a pilgrimage and {{travelled}} to various temples. Once, the sage saw a hunter named Gulika stealing the golden plates of the temple of Vishnu at Sauvira. Gulika tried to kill the sage. Then Uttanka informed Gulika that the sin of murder would be to live through many births to expiate his sin. Hearing this the hunter was penitent and fell dead.

As advised by Vishnu, Uttanka went to Badari, performed tapas and attained Vaikuntha himself.|$|E

5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>old</b> racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813â€“1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618â€“907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Old</b> and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284â€“364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E
