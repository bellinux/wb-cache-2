40|$|The {{possibilities}} for optimization of doped <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>graphites</b> with high thermal conductivity and high I thermal shock resistance are demonstrated at laboratory scale. A mixture of MCMB powder and different carbides (B 4 C, TiC, VC, ZrC and WC) {{was used as}} starting material. VC acts as catalyst of the graphitization at the lowest temperature, and ZrC {{is the most effective}} catalyst of all investigated carbides. A direct proportionality between the mean crystallite height, L-c, and the thermal conductivity at room temperature was found for all materials except for the B 4 C- and the ZrC-doped graphites. With increasing graphitization temperature the open porosity of all doped materials becomes gradually closed, suggesting the existence of a diffusion mechanism responsible for both the catalytic effect and the closing of the open porosity. The addition of carbides does not strongly influence the mechanical properties of pure graphite. A high ratio flexural strength to Young's modulus was achieved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|By {{order of}} The Jet Joint Undertaking, The European Atomic Energy Community, eight high purity <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>graphites</b> and one carbon fibre {{composite}} were investigated {{with regard to}} a number of properties as far as to their thermal shock behaviour.

A number of impurities- including sulfur- were determined. Multi-element analytical methods, such as spark source mass spectrometry and optical atom emission spectrometry with excitation in an inductively coupled plasma, were used rendering the simultanious detection of about 45 elements.

40|$|Carbon based {{materials}} (CBMs) {{are used}} in fusion devices as plasma facing materials for decades. They have been selected due to the inherent advantages of carbon for fusion applications. The main ones are its low atomic number {{and the fact that}} it does not melt but sublimate (above 3000 °C) under the planned working conditions. In addition, graphitic materials retain their mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and their thermal shock resistance is one of the highest, making them suitable for thermal management purpose during long or extremely short heat pulses. Nuclear grade fine grain graphite was the prime form of CBM which was set as a standard but when it comes to large fusion devices created nowadays, thermo-mechanical constraints created during transient heat loads (few GW. m- 2 can be deposited in few ms) are so high that carbon/carbon composites (so-called Carbon Fiber Composites (CFCs)) have to be utilized. CFCs can achieve superior thermal conductivity as well as mechanical properties than fine grain graphite. However, all the thermo-mechanical properties of CFCs are highly dependent on the loading direction as a consequence of the graphite structure. In this work, the background on the anisotropy of the graphitic structures but also on the production of fine grain graphite and CFCs is highlighted, showing the major principles which are relevant for the further understanding of the study. Nine advanced CBMs were then compared in terms of microstructure and thermo-mechanical properties. Among them, two <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>graphites</b> were considered as useful reference materials to allow comparing advantages reached by the developed CFCs. The presented microstructural investigation methods permitted to make statements which can be applied for CFCs presenting similarities in terms of fiber architecture. Determination of the volumetric percentage of the major sub-units of CFCs, i. e. laminates, felt layers or needled fiber groups, lead to a better understanding on how anisotropy can be tailored and on the strategies which were applied for the production of the investigated materials. Textures of fibers and microstructures of matrices were also described. Thermo-physical properties such as thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of some CFCs were studied for different materials’ orientations. For the first time, some off-axis results of thermal conductivity and thermal expansion for fusion related CFCs are displayed. Room temperature bending and tensile loading of CFCs were performed and they allowed relating the microstructural findings to the anisotropic mechanical response. Fiber architecture of CFCs and interfacial shear strength between the fiber and the matrix appeared to be the main parameters which dictate the fracture mechanisms. In addition, the analysis of five batches of one CFC permitted to understand the difficulty of reproducing such advanced material. The differences in terms of needling process were related to the variations of the tensile properties in the various fibrous directions. Finally, fusion-relevant transient heat loads were simulated on the investigated CBMs within various high heat flux facilities, i. e. electron beam, ion beam and plasma gun. Erosion scenarios at different scales were compiled in relation to the CBM properties but also the type of the transient event. The locally preferential erosion and ejection of material from the surface of the CBM are comprehensively described as well as their implications. This ejection of hot particles from the CBM surface (so-called Brittle Destruction (BD) mechanism) was defined, explained and analyzed. An experimental thermal shock resistance criterion based on thermal-shock induced weight loss is presented. After analyzing the anisotropic response of CFCs to transient heat loads in their three orthotropic fiber directions, attempts to reduce BD were done by loading them under off-axis orientations. It partly succeeded and led to the observation of unexpected erosion patterns for penetrating species such as the used 120 keV electrons. The effect of neutron irradiation on CBMs under thermal shock load is presented and a significant defect recovery in the near surface was observed...|$|E

The spectra at the net erosion areas consist of two sharp peaks: the D-peak (1355 cm-') and the G-peak (approximate to 1580 cm(- 1)). The spectra at the net deposition areas were very broad, which are similar to the Raman spectra of amorphous carbon. Fitting analyses of the Raman spectra for the net erosion area exhibit a linear relationship between the G-peak width (FWHMG) and the peak intensity ratio (I-D/I-G).

In addition to the ITER-like W monoblock divertor target, the WEST project involves W coated CuCrZr target and W coated <b>Fine</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>Graphite</b> (FGG) and CFC-N 11 (Carbon Fiber Composite) tiles. Combined Magnetron Sputtering and Ion Implantation (CMSII) technology was developed and applied {{in the framework of}} ITER-like wall (ILW) project at JET for W coating of CFC Dunlop 780 DMS tiles Ruset et al. (2007) [1]. The coating thickness was in the range of 10 – 25 µm depending on the position of the tiles in the wall. The same technology was also used for W coating of more than 1300 FGG tiles for ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.

40|$|Abstract. The {{behavior}} of the surfaces of materials, relevant for ITER divertor plates, was investigated under the heat loads of wide range (0. 5 – 30 MJ/m 2) typical for conditions of current disruptions and ELMs in tokamakreactor. The experiments were carried out with using the powerful plasma streams generated by quasi-steadystate plasma accelerator QSPA Kh- 50, which characterized by essentially longer duration (~ 0. 25 ms) of plasma stream generation in comparison with pulsed plasma guns. The main {{emphasis was placed on}} repetitive loading, typical for ELMs in ITER, when exposing the tungsten, graphite and different combined W-C targets. Onset of vapor shield formation in front of the surface under ELM-like plasma loads was studied. Achievement of evaporation threshold for exposed targets resulted in almost saturation of the surface heat load with further increase of the plasma energy density. For tungsten targets the vapor shield and its influence on plasma energy transfer to the surface become clearly seen when the surface heat load achieved 1. 1 MJ/m. 2 It was shown that the repetitive heat loads (up to 450 cycles) {{led to the formation of}} two types of cracks at the tungsten surface: macro cracks (with mesh size of an order 1 mm) and the net of intergrannular micro cracks (with the mesh of 10 - 20 μm).
