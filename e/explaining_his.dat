5|$|Shortly {{before the}} June 2008 Virginia Democratic primary, Moran {{endorsed}} Senator Barack Obama of Illinois {{for the presidency}} over New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. <b>Explaining</b> <b>his</b> endorsement, he told a local newspaper that the long-term goal of closing Alexandria's coal-fired power plant would be more attainable under Obama than under Clinton. Obama won the Virginia primary, and carried the state {{when he won the}} general election in November.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|A Parliamentary {{debate and}} motion to censure the Labour {{government}} on this {{was set for}} 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings {{into his office and}} suggested a way to solve the problem.

5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned {{with the reality of}} communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of his}} suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E
5|$|Despondent {{over her}} Granny's lack of honesty, Red wanders off alone. Meanwhile, Nicky Flippers {{realizes that the}} one {{commonality}} between all four stories was a bunny named Boingo and concludes {{that he is the}} Goody Bandit. However, Boingo has already sneaked into the home and stolen Granny's recipes. Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station, but the police pursue him in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk manage to locate Boingo as he is <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to add an addictive substance to the stolen recipes and then explode the forest, making way for new real estate for expanding his business.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vigilant}} {{fans would}} have noticed the names years earlier. Hitler-Barassi was photographed in 1993 at the opening night of Madame Butterfly, which was published on 4 April 1993; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack, who later released a book of his own (Campaigning With Grant) in 2000, which was about the American Civil War. The book contains thin references to TISM. In interviews about his book, Minack revealed he was a teacher, his father fought in World War II for the Germans {{and that he is}} fanatical about the Richmond Football Club, <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> stage moniker.|$|E

5|$|Strange {{meanwhile}} {{finds himself}} on the moon where he meets the Watcher Uatu, who tells him that the strange events are due to an anomaly he calls the Forerunner. The Forerunner is from the future and its presence {{in the past has}} disrupted reality to the point of impending annihilation of not only Strange's world but all other universes as well. <b>Explaining</b> <b>his</b> theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen's Earth {{is the result of the}} universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat what he has learned while he is alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} DVD {{contains}} several scenes that were deleted {{from the final}} cut of the episode. These include Kelly annoyingly answering calls with the same response, Dwight contacting CNN, Kelly training the accountants, Creed admitting that he faked his own death for tax reasons, Michael <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> apology to angry business owner Barbara Allen, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kelly arguing, Jim talking to a high school student, and more scenes of Michael filming his apology video.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E

5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> reason for leaving.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli {{published}} {{an account of}} his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise {{was able to put}} forward Vermigli's own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli's Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His Defense Against Gardiner was in reply to Stephen Gardiner's 1552 and 1554 Confutatio Cavillationum, itself a reply to the late Thomas Cranmer's work. At 821 folio pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period.|$|E
5|$|Despite the ruthlessness and {{determination}} of the supporters of the coup, the rebels failed to take any major cities with the critical exception of Seville which provided a landing point for Franco’s African troops. The primarily conservative and Catholic areas of Old Castile and León fell quickly, and in Pamplona they celebrated the uprising {{as if it were}} a festival. The government retained control of Málaga, Jaén and Almería. Cadiz was taken for the rebels with the help of the first troops from the Army of Africa. In Madrid they were hemmed into the Montaña barracks. The barracks fell the next day, with much bloodshed. Republican leader Santiago Casares Quiroga was replaced by José Giral who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and other main cities in the Mediterranean area, but it allowed the anarchists to arm themselves and take control of Barcelona and large swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. In Barcelona, the official government lost control of security, essential services and welfare. However, the anarchists held back from demanding too much political power, which could have had even more serious consequences. General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death, despite broadcasting a message <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> captivity over the radio at the request of the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is <b>explaining</b> <b>his</b> procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
