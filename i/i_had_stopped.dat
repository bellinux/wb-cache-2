6000|$|... "And what seek ye in Aucharn?" [...] said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure, {{him they}} called the Red Fox; for he it was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{sighed and}} shivered a little. [...] "He {{knew we were}} deserting him. His look haunts me. I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> to say good-bye. He will be very lonely without us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! no, no, father. She and Mr. Bulfinch began about it, not meaning me to hear--about a will, I mean--and I {{told them}} I wasn't {{going to have}} you worried, and I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> it altogether.' ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{that good}} {{behaviour}} is something important, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> to compose ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And cast such imputations!' exclaimed Aunt Jane. 'I {{saw what}} the wretch was driving {{at all the}} time of the cross-examination; and if I'd been the judge, would not <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But now I {{begin to}} be tired of writing. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> been tired a great while ago, only <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> to rest pretty often, and {{to look out the}} window, and see what is going by on the canal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose that's true," [...] mumbled Dan Murdock. [...] "But {{they said}} I might win a pile. Oh, I {{was a big}} fool--I know it now, even if I didn't know it then. I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> 'em from leaving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scratch {{out those}} last words," [...] said Mrs. Peagrim irritably. [...] "You really are hopeless, Miss Frisby! Couldn't {{you see that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> dictating and was searching for a phrase? Otie, what is a good phrase for 'I am told'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too well. I felt that. So well that, unless <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> it, I shouldn't {{have been}} able to say a word to you all through dinner. Your {{laughter}} clenched it, and Buonarosci and I will be grateful to you for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seen her? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> {{for a week}} in {{the same}} house. A very nice lodging-house on the Spa front, too. The girl's well enough off. The poverty plea fails. She goes about in good rooms and carries a mother with her." ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2007, he {{announced}} his immediate retirement from all forms of first class cricket. He said of the decision, [...] "This season <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost confidence and belief in my ability despite trying 100%. It is not working for me or for the team and consequently <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> enjoying the game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, I do not know. You see, I am so perplexed that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> smiling, {{and that}} will never do in the world; for should the weather change and cool my wax, I would remain solemn until it warmed up again, and my people would then think me unworthy to be the Queen of Merryland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} understand, Tom, {{this is for}} you alone. If the real thief had an idea that he was being watched, it would make him careful and {{diminish}} my chances. I had rather people thought that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> here from pure pig-headed obstinacy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am. Oh, I am!" [...] said Miss Trevor eagerly. [...] "I {{really would}} have known if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> to think. Well, it's getting late now. I must go back, {{although}} I don't want to. But I'm coming to see you again. Will you be here tomorrow afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fear the}} melancholy {{spirit of the}} day has prevailed upon you," [...] said Betty, half wistfully. [...] "You did not know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> reading, and I do not believe you heard my {{favorite}} poem. I have tried {{to give you a}} pleasant afternoon and have failed." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>stopped</b> {{so often}} already in writing this that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} what <b>I</b> {{was going to}} write about.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Penniman, as <b>I</b> say, <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> short; and {{she stood}} there with her eyes fixed brilliantly on her companion.|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and left}} me. I {{was obliged to}} {{sit down on the}} stair--I trembled so. My own reply frightened me. I tried to find out why <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said Yes. <b>I</b> don't {{remember}} being conscious of meaning anything. It was as if somebody else <b>had</b> said Yes--not <b>I.</b> Perhaps I was provoked, and the word escaped me before I could <b>stop</b> it. Could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> it? <b>I</b> don't know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] he said, {{with a quick}} turn towards me. [...] "This is it. A District Messenger {{brought it}} round the first thing Tuesday morning. He brought it," [...] Minver's brother added, with a certain effectiveness, [...] "from the florist's, where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> to get those Mayflowers. I had left it there." ...|$|E
6000|$|I stood where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{just inside}} the door, trembling, {{scarcely}} breathing, so stunned by the terrible sight of those clothes that I could not move, nor scarcely think. If I had seen his dead body there I should have been shocked, but to see nothing! It was awful {{to such an extent}} that my mind could not deal with it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{very kind}} to say so, my dear, but you can't keep on making {{delightful}} idiots go down with the public. That was what I was thinking when you came in and found me looking so dismal. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> {{in the middle of}} a most exciting scene because I had discovered that I was poking fun at my lovers." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Ehrensvärd {{was interviewed}} by the {{business}} magazine The Next Woman about using the YubiKey for the first FIDO U2F pilot with Google. When {{asked if there was}} anything she wished to share with the community, she revealed: [...] "We women are trained in our DNA to please. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> trying to please everyone, but to instead follow my dreams." ...|$|R
6000|$|Norman shortly {{explained}} the ginger-beer story, and adding, [...] "Cheviot told me I should get nothing but ill-will, and so I have--all those town fellows turn against me now, {{and though they}} {{know as well as}} possible how it was, they won't say a word to right me, just out of spite, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> them from all the mischief I could!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{came down}} to see them {{practise}} a few evenings ago, and Antill asked him," [...] the agent answered. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known earlier <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped.</b> My {{face was}} thrust within a hand's-breadth of his own; I had tossed back my cloak, and my fingers {{clutched}} the hilt of my sword. He became grave. His fine eyes--he had great, sombre, liquid eyes, such as you'll scarcely ever see outside of Spain--considered me thoughtfully a moment. Then he laughed lightly {{and fell back}} a pace.|$|E
60|$|It {{really did}} not seem {{necessary}} to give the matter much thought. Here {{was a place of}} public entertainment, and, as I was one of the public, why should I not be entertained? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> at many a road-side hostelry, and in each one of them I knew I would be welcome to stay as long as I was willing to pay.|$|E
60|$|She now {{wanted me}} to tell her where I had really been and what had {{happened}} to me, and I gave her a sketch of my adventures. Of course I could not enter deeply into particulars, for that would make too long a story, but I told her where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped,</b> and my accounts of the bear and the horse were deeply interesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mad!" [...] she cried; [...] "you do {{not love}} me! No man can know {{what love is}} who talks about doubts and scruples like you do! You are too cold and too selfish to realize what love can be! And to think that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> to reason, to reason with you! Oh! my God! What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done to be humbled like this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Colville laughed. [...] "Crude in looks? <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> said Miss Graham {{was rather}} crude in mind, though I'm not sure <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> at saying young." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose I was drunk. Suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{met some}} {{ordinary}} girl. Suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> really made her marry me. Don't you think <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> being a drunkard {{and have been}} good to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} an accident," [...] urged Mr. Tredgold, humbly. [...] "I’ve had a very {{worrying}} day seeing them off at Biddlecombe, and when I heard you up in the nest I succumbed to sudden temptation. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> to think—if I had had the faintest idea that you would catechise me {{in the way you}} have done—I shouldn’t have dreamt of doing such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|He went. But yet I {{felt more}} and more that his love must be dwindling to make him act as he did. I thought it all over wearily enough and asked myself whether I had done {{everything}} I should to hold my husband's love. I had kept him in at nights. I had cut down his smoking. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> his playing cards. What more was there that I could do? ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the steps}} of the church, there was the stooping figure of a man, who had put down some burden on the smooth snow, to adjust it; my seeing the face, and my seeing him, were simultaneous. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>stopped</b> in my surprise; but, in any case, as I went on, he rose, turned, and came down towards me. I stood face to face with Mr. Peggotty! ...|$|E
3000|$|I was saying, {{this process}} has helped me, when I come to observe now, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> now {{thinking}} about how I would do it and looked at actually what are the children doing, how are they achieving that {{and what is the}} teacher doing to get them to achieve that, instead of thinking, oh that’s nice, I’ll nick that, or I’d do it that way, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> switched it back (Meeting 6) [...]...|$|R
30|$|Teacher P: I was saying, {{this process}} has helped me, when I come to compare, when I come to observe now, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped</b> now {{thinking}} about how I would do it and looked at actually what are the children doing, how are they achieving that {{and what is the}} teacher doing to get them to achieve that [extract from audio recording of Meeting 3].|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't imagine why, but the parting words {{spoken to}} Armadale by that old brute {{of a lawyer}} have come back to my mind! Here they are, as {{reported}} in Mr. Bashwood's letter: 'Some other person's curiosity may go on from {{the point where you}} (and <b>I)</b> <b>have</b> <b>stopped,</b> and some other person's hand may let the broad daylight in yet on Miss Gwilt.' ...|$|R
