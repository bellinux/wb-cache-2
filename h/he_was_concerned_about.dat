5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan {{as a way to}} avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|To address his problems, Cho's {{parents also}} {{took him to}} church. According to a pastor at the Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho was a smart student who {{understood}} the Bible, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> Cho's difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to NBC News, he never heard him say a complete sentence. The pastor also recalled that he told Cho's mother that he speculated Cho was autistic and {{he asked her to}} take him to a hospital, but she declined.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and {{an extension of the}} franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{was taken}} on {{as a member}} of the BBC Wales children's {{department}} in 1985 and given one-day contracts and commissions, such as illustrating for Why Don't You? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; {{he was told that}} the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg left Hawaii on June 7, 1887, booking {{steerage}} class {{passage on}} the steamer Australia. Some reports state {{that he left}} owing to health issues, although others suggest that Rosenberg departed the island because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> political unrest. He left {{three weeks before the}} king signed the June Constitution. Rosenberg returned to San Francisco, but was hospitalized within a month of his return, and died on July 10, 1887. He spoke of King Kalākaua on his deathbed, whispering the king's name with his dying breath. He was buried at the cemetery of Congregation Sherith Israel in the San Francisco Peninsula; brief death notices were published in Hawaii- and San Francisco-based newspapers.|$|E
5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the saffron crocus. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the steady decline in saffron cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> losing their services.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fifth pole position of the season and his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:50.646; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the start. Häkkinen was joined in the front row of the grid by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the Monaco Grand Prix). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team's strong record at the circuit. Button qualified third, and said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher secured fourth position, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap time which pushed Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have had a faster lap time. Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after being caught in traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from a quicker lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported oversteering. Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run onto the grass. Herbert and Barrichello rounded out the top ten drivers, with Barrichello spinning at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick run of the session. Herbert's teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber's Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the chicane and triggering a yellow flag. Salo qualified 18th, ahead of Wurz (who had engine problems and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid, in positions 20 to 22.|$|E
25|$|Though {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Zionism, Goldmann was also {{a strong supporter}} of the idea of a Diaspora as Goldmann felt that a Jewish state would not answer all the needs of the Jewish people. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> Jewish assimilation, and fought to strengthen Jewish education, culture, and institutions outside of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Before departure, Jean Lapierre {{mentioned}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> flying during bad weather. The aircraft left Montreal Saint-Hubert Longueuil Airport in St-Hubert, Quebec at 0931 Eastern Daylight Time and was {{destined for the}} Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport, on Havre aux Maisons island in the Magdalen Islands, also in Quebec. A little over two hours later (1240 Atlantic Daylight Time), the aircraft collided with terrain in Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec, about 2km from Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport, the flight's intended destination.|$|E

Langmuir's hobbies included mountaineering, skiing, piloting his own plane, and classical music. In addition to his professional interest in the politics of atomic energy, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> wilderness conservation.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{has been}} known for {{commanding}} public attention since he first started working for Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, Jackson participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches organized by James Bevel, King and other civil rights leaders in Alabama. Impressed by Jackson's drive and organizational abilities, King soon began giving Jackson a role in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> Jackson's apparent ambition and attention-seeking. When Jackson returned from Selma, he was charged with establishing a frontline office for the SCLC in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Although Sherman was {{planning}} to march east to seize the city of Savannah, Georgia (the campaign that would be known as Sherman's March to the Sea) <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> his lines of communications back to Chattanooga. One particular threat was the cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest, who had long bedeviled Union expeditions with lightning raids into their rear areas. On September 29, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant urged Sherman to dispose of Forrest and Sherman sent Thomas to Nashville, Tennessee, to organize all of the troops in the state. Sherman sent another division, under Brig. Gen. James D. Morgan, to Chattanooga.|$|E

Diana was the Regiment's Colonel-in-Chief from 1992 to 1996. The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby Great Brington, but Lord Spencer said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided that Diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by William, Harry, and other Spencer relatives.|$|E
25|$|By {{that moment}} in time, he was {{publicly}} voicing his concern that Transylvania was a target of expansion for Regency-period Hungary, while cautioning the public against Nazi Germany and its revanchism. Similarly, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the Soviet threat {{and the fate of}} Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the Transnistrian anti-communist refugee Nichita Smochină. Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of Bucharest Radio broadcasts, Sfaturi pe întuneric ("Advice at Dark", soon after published in brochure format). He completed several new volumes, among which were Dovezi despre conștiința originii românilor ("Evidence on the Conscious Origin of the Romanians"), the polemical essay Lupta mea contra prostiei ("My Fight against Stupidity"), and the first two volumes of the long planned Istoria românilor.|$|E

In April 1937 he opposed the Conservative government's proposal for assistance to 'special areas', complaining that it had the deliberate intention of depriving Middlesbrough of the advantages other areas were to have.
