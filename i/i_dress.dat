500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Bad Girl" [...] {{revolve around the}} protagonist's {{addiction}} to shopping, particularly for shoes and handbags. Rihanna sings the lyric [...] "Need no bargain, need no sale/ I want the best, <b>I</b> <b>dress</b> me well," [...] and is joined by Brown {{at the end of}} the song, who raps [...] "She's a walking sto', I'm talking about her clothes/ I just pause, I'm in awe, cause she's a fashion show." [...] The song's producer, Polow da Don, stated in his interview with MTV News that Rihanna's vocal performance was [...] "unique", as well as saying how Brown delivers his rap with a high amount of energy and conviction. Ryan Brockington for the New York Post described Brown's bridge as [...] "bouncy", and wrote that Rihanna's vocals [...] "meshed" [...] perfectly with the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] was {{recorded}} mostly while Gaga was on tour in Europe, but the mixing {{was done by}} Gene Grimaldi at Oasis Mastering in [...] Burbank, California. It is a Hi-NRG song and begins with Gaga singing the line [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>dress</b> cool, my parents put up a fight/ And if I'm a hot shot, Mom will cut my hair at night/ And in the morning I'm short of my identity/ I scream, 'Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I want to be?" [...] As the music grows louder, Gaga sings the sing along chorus of the song, gradually moving towards the breakdown—which is inspired by retro music—talking about the different hairstyles she has had. Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the track as a [...] "fist-pumping, defiant disco track all about having a good time." [...] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone called it a mixture of yearning romantic melodrama of [...] "We Belong" [...] with the hard industrial metal edge of Broken-era Nine Inch Nails. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that Gaga's vocals are Auto-Tuned throughout the song. The lyrics of [...] "Hair" [...] talk about embracing one's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity, hence it ends with Gaga triumphantly declaring [...] "I am my hair!" [...] {{at the end of}} the final chorus.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{term for}} a drag queen is female impersonator. Although this is still used, it is {{sometimes}} regarded as inaccurate, because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to pass as women. Female impersonation has been {{and continues to be}} illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen José Sarria to hand out labels to his friends reading, [...] "I am a boy," [...] so he could not be accused of female impersonation. American drag queen RuPaul once said, [...] "I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?" [...] He also said, [...] "I don't dress like a woman; <b>I</b> <b>dress</b> like a drag queen!".|$|E
