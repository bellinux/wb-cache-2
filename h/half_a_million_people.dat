The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people,</b> roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved.

It was {{attended}} by nearly <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people.</b> They protested {{a variety of issues}} such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E

5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages, the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague, may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people.</b> Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century. Almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597–1609.|$|E
5|$|Mühe {{played a}} leading role in {{organizing}} the demonstrations that took place prior to the reunification of Germany. He often gave public readings from Walter Jenka's essay Schwierigkeiten mit der Wahrheit (Difficulties with the Truth, 1989) at the Deutsches Theater, before the book was permitted to be published in East Germany. On 4 November 1989 shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, in front of <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> during the Alexanderplatz demonstration, he declared the Communists' monopoly on power to be invalid. In the same year he became internationally known after playing, next to Armin Mueller-Stahl and Klaus Maria Brandauer, the leading role in Bernhard Wicki's Das Spinnennetz (The Spider's Web, based on the expressionist, fragmentary novel of the same name by Austrian writer Joseph Roth) right-wing lieutenant Lohse who sleeps and murders his way to professional success in the early Weimar Republic following a near fatal injury during the Wilhelmshaven mutiny of 29 October 1918.|$|E

Calculations based on Hearth Tax returns for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575. This level may have been seriously effected by the famines of the 1690s. The first reliable information available on national population is from the census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755, which showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.|$|E

5|$|Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), a California-based former salesman, {{training}} manager and {{executive in the}} encyclopedia business, created the Erhard Seminars Training (est) course in 1971. est {{was a form of}} Large Group Awareness Training, and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250people at a time. The program was very intensive: each day would contain 15–20hours of instruction. During the training, est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts, and participants had to agree to certain rules that remained in effect {{for the duration of the}} course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes, and were promised a dramatic change in their self-perception. est was controversial.
