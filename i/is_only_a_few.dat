He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E
5|$|Grove Church Cemetery {{is located}} at 1132 46th Street in North Bergen, New Jersey. The {{cemetery}} also fronts Kennedy Boulevard which in the 19thcentury was known as Dallytown Road, or Bergenwood Road. Overlooking into the Secaucus, it starts {{at the top and}} extends onto the middle of the western face of the Hudson Palisades. Grove Church Cemetery is one of several burial sites on the western slope, along with Machpelah Cemetery, Hoboken Cemetery and Weehawken Cemetery, which <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> blocks away from Grove Church along with Palisades Cemetery. These grounds constitute a string of green open spaces in North Hudson County. The gated entrance is across the street, east of the Bergenline Avenue station of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Union City, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the elapsed time on the ship <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} peptides, {{aspartame}} may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids {{under conditions of}} elevated temperature or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as saccharin.|$|E
25|$|Travellers {{touch the}} card on a {{distinctive}} yellow circular reader (a Tri-Reader, developed by Cubic Transportation Systems) on the automated barriers at London Underground stations to 'touch in' and 'touch out' {{at the start}} and end of a journey. Physical contact is not necessary, but {{the range of the}} reader <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> millimeters. Tram stops and buses also have readers on the driver/conductor's ticket machine, and on these modes passengers must touch their card to the reader at the start of their journey only. Most Docklands Light Railway stations and occasionally London Underground stations such as at Waterloo (for the Waterloo & City line) do not have automatic barriers; hence, passengers must touch their card on a reader at both {{the beginning and end of}} their journey if they wish to avoid being charged the maximum fare for an unresolved journey. Such a step is not needed if transferring between trains within a station unless they are run by different operators.|$|E

25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway {{in itself is}} not {{particularly}} known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} worsened when levees on {{four of the}} city's canals were breached. Storm surge was funneled in via the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, which breached {{in multiple}} places. This surge also filled the Industrial Canal which breached either from the surge or the effects of {{being hit by a}} loose barge (the ING 4727). The London Avenue Canal and the 17th Street Canal were breached by the elevated waters of Lake Pontchartrain. Some areas that initially seemed to suffer little from the storm found themselves flooded by rapidly rising water on August 30. As much as 80% of the city—parts of which are below sea level and much of which <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> feet above—was flooded, with water reaching a depth of 25 feet (7.6 m) in some areas. Water levels were {{similar to those of the}} 1909 hurricane; but since many areas that were swamp or farmland in 1909 had become heavily settled, the effects were massively worse. The most recent estimates of the damage from the storm, by several insurance companies, are $10 to 25 billion, while the total economic loss from the disaster has been estimated at $100 billion. Hurricane Katrina surpassed Hurricane Andrew as the costliest hurricane in United States history.|$|E
25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and {{is the most common}} isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E
