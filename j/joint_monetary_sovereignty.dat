40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{political}} economy of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in the post-Bretton Woods era of monetary governance. It examines whether <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> matters for the macroeconomic policy space of contemporary states. It asks further whether <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> ought to matter in the present global age. According to the standard view in the field of Global Political Economy, the current policy space of states is very narrow compared to the Bretton Woods period. In contrast to this position, however, the chartalist Post Keynesians argue that the recent decades in fact have seen a strengthening of the <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of states. Because the chartalists do seem to make an impeccable argument, it appears paradoxical that there nevertheless has been a recent tendency towards homogenous, slow-growth economic policies in the majority of states. This apparent paradox is resolved in thesis by reconciling these contradictory-looking positions: while <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> has generally strengthened, the possibilities of states to exercise it often have not. Given this predicament, a possible way to enable the conduct of experimental macroeconomic policies in the future is proposed. The approach of the study is informed by a realist philosophy of science. Hypotheses of Post Keynesian economics and Global Political Economy are tested and revised in the spirit of iconic modelling. It is suggested that a realist approach provides a solid basis for moving towards a flexible theoretical synthesis capable of illuminating {{the political economy}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> from both explanatory and normative point of views. Several arguments are put forward. First, the Global Political Economy literature on the macroeconomic policy space of contemporary states has largely failed to integrate the core and valid insights of the chartalist economics. The strengthened <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> matters for the ability of many states to conduct progressive economic policies. Second, while the chartalists are correct about the economics of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> several <b>monetary</b> sovereignty-undermining processes and institutional developments of the post-Bretton Woods macroeconomic governance regime often tend to trump the practical potentials and theoretical considerations of Chartalism. Third, because the neo-Gramscian approach helps to illuminate the constitutionalization of the present consensus on macroeconomic policy – a process that is shown to constrain the possibility of many states to exercise their <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> –, it can fruitfully supplement chartalist economics of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> The neo-Gramscian view on the nature of these processes, however, has to be revised and updated to make it consistent with the Post Keynesian framework underpinning chartalism. Fourth, it is argued that the current consensus view of macroeconomic policy has failed and is likely to be replaced by an alternative set of governance ideas in the near future. It is suggested that in order to exercise <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> effectively and in a way that contributes to transformative and cosmopolitan democracy, nation states may not be the optimal entities to exercise <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in the future. A chartalist case for the supranational exercise of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is put forward...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{whether the}} concept of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> evolves under the impact of globalization and financial integration, and provides a framework for assessing what this implies. Thereby, this thesis contributes {{to a better understanding}} of both the contemporary exercise of sovereign powers in monetary and financial matters and of the driving forces behind the evolution of international law in this field. As elaborated in chapter 1, the contemporary concept of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> proposed by this thesis is not static but dynamic in nature. Due to the dual nature of sovereignty as a concept having not only positive but also important normative components, <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> cannot become eroded under the impact of legal and economic constraints. Chapter 2 examines the ongoing hybridization of international monetary law arising from changes in the sources of this complex body of law, from the unsuitability of the categories of ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ law for characterizing all normative evolutions in this field, and from the rise of private and transnational monetary law. Chapter 3 scrutinizes the phenomenon of exchange rate misalignment under monetary and trade law. Intrinsically related, it assesses which aspects of the IMF’s legal framework should be reformed in order to tackle contemporary challenges to the stability of the international monetary system, such as global current account imbalances. Chapter 4 analyses the increasing regionalization of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> It argues that, to the extent that transferring sovereign powers to a monetary union is what provides a state’s population with maximum monetary and financial stability, the underlying transfers are not a surrender of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> but its effective exercise under the form of cooperative sovereignty. Finally, chapter 5 assesses the implications of the contemporary concept of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> proposed herein for the reorganization of the international financial architecture in the wake of the Great Recession.

Countries entering into a monetary union agree to share <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> But abandonment of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> (full or near-dollarization) implies a permanent and irrevocable outsourcing of monetary policy. A currency board also implies outsourcing of monetary policy but without the presumption that it is permanent or irrevocable.

40|$|When {{addressing}} {{issues of}} global finance, we {{are accustomed to}} thinking of money as effectively insular: each currency sovereign within the territorial frontiers of a single state or monetary union. In fact, cross-border currency competition has become increasingly prevalent. Money today is effectively deterritorialized. What {{does this mean for}} national <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty?</b> A strictly territorial currency privileges government in relation to societal actors. Conversely, the benefits of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> are noticeably compromised by currency deterritorialization, which gives the private sector a critical degree of leverage over public policy. So long as governments remain the main source of money, however, the state still retains a significant role. <b>Monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> has been not so much lost as transformed. Where once existed monopoly, we now find oligopoly—a finite number of autonomous suppliers, national governments, all vying ceaselessly to shape and manage demand.

We explore this diagnosis by comparing three countries - Hungary, Latvia and Greece – that received considerable amounts of external assistance under different monetary regimes. The evidence does not suggest that <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> helped Hungary and Latvia to stabilize their economies. Rather, cooperation and external assistance made foreign banks share in the costs of stabilization. By contrast, the provision of liquidity by the ECB inadvertently facilitated the reduction of foreign banks’ exposure to Greece which left the Greek sovereign even more exposed. By viewing the Euro area as a monetary system rather than an incomplete state, we see that what is needed for Euro area stabilization is cooperation over banking union, rather than a fully-fledged federal budget...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} gold standard, which prevailed {{from the}} 1870 s to the First World War, was characterised by fixed exchange rates, free convertibility and perfect capital mobility {{and was considered}} the dominant international monetary system of the time. As trilemma hypothesis suggests, the Ottoman Empire enjoyed fixed exchange rates and foreign capital flows under the golden rule, but lost its <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> However, the extent of this loss was far more apparent than in other core and peripheral countries. As a result, the gold standard in the Ottoman Empire was characterised {{by a set of}} “anomalies” such as the existence of competing monetary authorities, persistence of territorial exchange rates and monetary zones and widely circulating multiple standard and sub-standard coins. This paper analyses these unique features as changing degrees of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> under the golden rule and revisits the evidence.

40|$|In the Republic of Croatia <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was {{established}} in several stages that reflected changes in {{and the growth of}} independent Croatian territory. The rebellion of part of the Croatian citizens of Serb nationality, the aggression of the then Yugoslavia and the occupation of some territories of the Republic of Croatia on which a para-state was proclaimed, the so-called Republic of Srpska Krajna, strongly impacted these activities. Thus Croatian <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> {{was established}} in accordance with these circumstances. First temporary money was introduced on the territory under Croatian authority – the Croatian dinar (December 1991). When economic and monetary conditions were ripe the Croatian dinar was replaced by the permanent national monetary unit – the kuna, and its hundredth part – the lipa (May 1994). The kuna became the legal currency on the territory of the Republic of Croatia under Croatian authority, and after western Slavonia (May 1995) and northern Dalmatia, Lika, Kordun and Banija (August 1995) were liberated, also on these formerly occupied territories. The fourth stage in the establishment of Croatian <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was carried out in September 1997 in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (Croatian Danubian region) as part of their peaceful reintegration into the Republic of Croatia {{with the help of the}} United Nations – the United Nations Transitional Authority in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmuim (UNTAES), when the kuna was introduced as the legal currency in this region before the establishment of complete Croatian rule and the return home of the banished population of this territory. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} focus on the {{challenge}} posed by financial globalization before the traditional Westphalian model of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> claiming that financial globalization of the world's markets leads to new forms of geopolitical rivalry among contemporary governments. Design/methodology/approach – The paper sets the analytical framework for the study of a tripartite foundation of <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in money manager capitalism, consisting of currency associated with the instruments of its manipulation, which are the two largest independent macroeconomic players: the central bank and the state. This raises the issues of dual sovereignty in economy {{and the ways in which}} these entities use their sovereign powers on local and global levels. Findings – Current growing interdependence of financial networks increases the number of choices in monetary issues and forces governments to make ever faster adjustments to the machinery of complex monetary instruments which not only facilitate transactions among very different and distant economies, but also obscure the transparency of decision making. The need to ensure, through the central bank's legislation, an independent status of central bankers with respect to politicians, implies that their work be effectively monitored by the public and the respective parliament. Practical implications – The independence of central banks, which comprises goal independence, instrument independence and personal independence of the decision-making body of a central bank, increases the accountability of central bankers and raises the issue of sanctions for their misbehavior. Originality/value – Financial globalization has definitely raised the issue of redistribution of the authority of governments and non-state agents. A clear hierarchy between currencies at the global level has dual consequences: first, it amplifies the unequal relationship between the leaders and the followers in global monetary circulation; second, global market forces ignore political borders and present a serious challenge for the <b>monetary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of contemporary governments.

To clarify the discussion, a taxonomy of dollarization regimes is drawn up {{in order to make}} an inventory of officially dollarized countries, territories and dependencies. The foundations for adopting complete dollarization are analysed through three elements : an account of the limits to corner solutions, the identification of the economic contexts which are favourable to the adoption of foreign currencies and the reasons behind the legitimacy crisis of national currencies. To determine what is at stake in such decisions, cost advantage analysis mentions, first of all, the expected benefits highlighted by the advocates of complete dollarization. A detailed study of its potential impact will then allow us to evaluate the induced costs of the disappearance of national currencies.
