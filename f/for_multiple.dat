40|$|DE 102008031400 B 3 UPAB: 20100115 NOVELTY - The device has an extrapolating device (110) extrapolating floating-point values (F) {{corresponding}} to image points to be sampled in proximity of predetermined floating-point values for attaining an estimation {{value for the}} predetermined floating-point values. A determining device (120) determines a mantissa-residual value depending on a difference of a mantissa of the estimation value and a mantissa of the predetermined floating-point values. A coding device (130) codes the predetermined floating-point values by coding exponents of the floating-point values and the mantissa-residual value. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a device <b>for</b> decoding <b>multiple</b> coded floating-point values (2) a method <b>for</b> coding <b>multiple</b> floating-point values (3) a method <b>for</b> decoding <b>multiple</b> coded floating-point values (4) a computer program comprising instructions <b>for</b> coding <b>multiple</b> floating-point values or <b>for</b> decoding <b>multiple</b> coded floating-point values. USE - Device <b>for</b> coding <b>multiple</b> floating-point values <b>for</b> compressing of a 3 -channel-high dynamic range image i. e. red blue and green image. Can {{also be used for}} compressing video data and audio data. ADVANTAGE - The device reduces a number of mantissa-residual values, interprets the mantissa-residual values as a new mantissa value of the floating-point values, thus reducing entropy of the mantissa value and efficiently compressing multiple floating-point values...|$|R
