If national policy makers choose support schemes to maximize domestic welfare, then a trade policy motive arises operating independently of any direct benefit of renewable electricity. The model predicts electricity <b>importing</b> (<b>exporting)</b> <b>countries</b> to choose policies which reduce (increase) electricity prices. A narrow pursuit of domestic objectives distorts transmission investment, thereby market integration, below the efficient level.

30|$|Different {{scenarios}} are implemented and discussed where RTA’s initial benefits and losses experience considerable changes following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the <b>importing</b> and <b>exporting</b> member <b>countries.</b> The analysis underlines important redistributions {{of the benefits}} and losses between <b>importing</b> and <b>exporting</b> member <b>countries</b> and between consumers and producers. Also, {{the implications of these}} adjustments for global welfare are found not to be necessarily different in {{the presence or absence of}} regional trading blocs.

30|$|The {{effects of}} trade {{creation}} and trade diversion {{due to the}} development of a trading bloc are extensively discussed in various contexts (Endoh 1999; Pelzman 1977; Wylie 1995). Trade creation occurs when the enactment of a free trade agreement enables the member countries to import goods at a lower cost from other member countries due to tariff elimination or reduction. Hence, the volume of intra-trade is generally increased with the enactment of free trade agreements. From the perspective of <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> the increase in intra-trade flow will improve the economies of scale in production. Overall efficiency will be improved not only in the production efficiency but also shipping connectivity and other trade facilitation arrangements (e.g., capital flow and customs clearance) which are essential for transporting goods from <b>importing</b> to <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R
