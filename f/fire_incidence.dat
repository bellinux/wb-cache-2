50|$|Arguments for a {{national}} park on the Cape Peninsula, centred on Table Mountain, began in earnest in the mid-1930s.

In the mid 1960s, the Cape Town City Council declared nature reserves on Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Signal Hill, and Silvermine. Following high <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> in the 1970s, Douglas Hey was appointed to assess the ecological state of Table Mountain and the southern Peninsula, and he recommended (1978) that all the Peninsula's mountains above 152m should be conserved. This laid the foundations for the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment (CPPNE) area, finally established in 1989. However, environmental management was still bedeviled by the fragmented nature of land ownership on the Peninsula. Following a big fire above the city bowl in 1991, Attorney General Frank Kahn was appointed to reach consensus on a plan for rationalising management of the CPPNE. In 1995, Prof. Brian Huntley recommended that SANParks be appointed to manage the CPPNE, with an agreement signed in April 1998 to transfer around 39,500 acres to SANParks. On 29 May 1998, then-president Nelson Mandela proclaimed the Cape Peninsula National Park. The park was later renamed to the Table Mountain National Park.|$|E

The current study presents the impact of air temperature variation on forest fire occurrences in Central Indian region during 2003 - 2010. The decadal (2001 - 2010) fire events in Central India were analysed in relation to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) and interpolated air temperature data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) to characterise the regional impact of climate on fire occurrences.

40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} {{productivity of}} forests {{is an important}} parameter {{in the evaluation of}} vegetation as a carbon sink. At the same time, potential productivity can be considered as an indicator of growth conditions and also as a measure of available fuel loads, which, in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, are a main factor of regional <b>fire</b> <b>incidence.</b> The present work deals with the relationship between an estimation of forest potential productivity and the <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> registered in peninsular Spain. <b>Fire</b> <b>incidence</b> was characterized by means of several fire regime variables. In order to contrast the patterns obtained, a similar analysis of the relationship between fire regime and human population density was also carried out. The results show that higher <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> was registered in more productive areas. Potential productivity was correlated to variables related to the number of fires and to the area burned, whereas the population density was also correlated to the number of fire variables and to the area burned, but with lower correlation coefficients. Although it is difficult to establish cause-and-effect relationships between complex phenomena that depend on a large number of factors, finding statistically significant relationships between <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> and the estimation of potential forest productivity used over a long time period is considered very relevant. These relationships make it necessary {{to take into account the}} fire regime when evaluating both forests and other terrestrial ecosystems as carbon sinks so as to meet the demands of the Kyoto Protocol...|$|E

Methods Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to study {{the relationship}} between <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> {{and a set of}} environment covariates, which comprise land cover, anthropogenic and climatic variables, over an eight year period (1981 - 1983, 1985 - 1991). GWR was compared to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and the hypothesis that GWR represents no improvement over the global model was tested. Local regression coefficients were mapped, interpreted and related with <b>fire</b> <b>incidence.</b> Analysis was carried out using a 0. 5 x 0. 5 degree grid. Results GWR revealed local patterns in parameter distributions, and also reduced the spatial autocorrelation of model residuals. All the predictors were non-stationary and in terms of goodness of fit the model replicates the data very well (R 2 = 87 %). About 45 % of the local models had an R 2 above 0. 75 and only 26 % had an R 2 below 0. 57 (the global R 2). Herbaceous cover has the most significant relationship with <b>fire</b> <b>incidence,</b> with climate variables being more important than anthropogenic ones in explaining the response variability. Both precipitation seasonality and soil water coefficient estimates exhibit locally different signs, which would have been ignored by a global approach. Main conclusions Results highlighted the need to accommodate for the effects of spatial non-stationarity in fire-environment relationship, which may be hidden in a global model. This study provides an improved understand of spatial fire-environment relationships, indirectly contributing towards the reduction of uncertainties in burned area estimates and to make better predictions of broad-scale fire patterns. GWR is shown to be a valuable complement to global spatial analysis methods, revealing details of <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> patterns and data properties that global methods average out and fail to detect.

Rainfall, vegetation type and geology showed the strongest correlations with <b>fire</b> <b>incidence.</b> Recurrent fire has impacted negatively on forest structure, ground cover biomass and species composition in two forest reserves, but more marked in the wetter Worobong South Forest Reserve than the drier Tain II Forest Reserve. Basal area has reduced from 40 m 2 ha - 1 in least-degraded to < 1 m 2 ha - 1 in heavily-degraded stand in Worobong South Forest Reserve, along with tree density, whereas canopy openness has increased from 6 % in least-degraded to 83 % in heavily-degraded forest. In Tain II Forest Reserve, however, the heavily-degraded forest has lost close to 50 % of its maximum value in terms of basal area, tree density and canopy cover, all in approximately 20 years. Early-burning, with maximum seedling height growth rates of 130 cm yr - 1 and 40 cm yr - 1 for Worobong South and Tain II Forest Reserves respectively, might help control the fires, and restore forest canopy in about 10 to 20 years if regularly maintained, but must be accompanied by green firebreaks. Complete protection from fire (during convalescence), on the other hand, would take between five and 15 years to restore forest canopy, but at huge resource cost.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} three {{environmental issues}} in developing countries. The first essay examines land fires in Indonesia that inflict severe air pollution-related damage on Southeast Asia annually. Conservative estimates of losses in 1997 alone were US$ 667 million for Indonesia (0. 67 % of GDP) {{and an additional}} US$ 12 million for Singapore. <b>Fire</b> <b>incidence</b> on various landholdings is examined using a new author-compiled database on satellite-based fire and rainfall data, land use maps, socioeconomic and geographical information. The essay finds that estates, large-scale industrial plantations that are rapidly expanding in the tropics, raise <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> beyond the 'natural' level (the <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> on conservation areas serves as a benchmark). In contrast, it finds no evidence that small landholdings, which are often blamed for fires, raise <b>fire</b> <b>incidence.</b> The government's ban {{on the use of}} clearance fires, as a result of weak enforcement, did not reduce <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> on estates. Alternative policy-levers that could potentially reduce these fires, such as lengthening the estates' leases to improve their property security, are found to be ineffective. The second essay examines whether education can potentially reduce households' agricultural-related forest clearance by increasing the returns to wage labor. It analyzes a unique survey of 649 indigenous households in protected areas in Bolivia's lowland forests. It finds that an additional year of education among household heads is associated with a reduction of 0. 05 hectares or 4. 3 % of the annual mean household forest clearance, increased returns of 2. 6 % in wage labor and a 21 % increase in days worked in wage labor. Thus the 3 -year average increase in education among the youngest cohorts is associated with potentially significant reduction in forest clearance in the study site, though further work is needed to establish causality. The third essay examines the pollution intensity of the NAFTA-related expansion in USMexican trade using new detailed measures of air, water, metal and toxic pollution intensities and injury rates at the 4 -digit Standard Industrial Classification level. Based on pollution measures at this resolution, it does not find strong evidence of greater growth in the share of US net imports from Mexico in the more polluting or injurious industries. by Shanti Rabindran Gamper.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn Ghana, fire {{incidents}} {{have become}} a regular occurrence, with thousands of lives {{and millions of dollars}} lost every year. Hardly a day passes without news of a fire outbreak in some part of Ghana, causing fear and panic among the people. This generates much discussion centering on rumors relating to politics, sabotage, misfortune, religious differences, etc. This article seeks to discuss the trend of fire incidents occurring in Ghana from 2000 to 2013 and the different ways to prevent these incidents. MethodsThe pattern of <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> in Ghana as a whole as well as in each region is discussed. The study took into consideration the causes, mechanisms, as well as preventive measures against the fire menace. Data were obtained from the head office of Ghana's national fire service. ResultsIt was noticed that in general the rate of <b>fire</b> <b>incidence</b> increased each year. This increase was attributed to several factors: rate of population growth and industrialization, unstable electricity, urbanization, negligence, illegal electrical connection, etc. The cause of fire was categorized into domestic, industrial, vehicular, institutional, electrical, commercial, bush, and others. Among these causes, domestic fire accounted for 41 % {{of the total number of}} fire incidents in the country. ConclusionFinally, this study presents several recommendations to help prevent and mitigate fire incidents in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} for members of any modern military to quickly and reliably discriminate between friendly and enemy vehicles. Otherwise, friendly <b>fire</b> <b>incidences</b> occur, also known as “fratricide. ” During World War II and the Vietnam War, 2 % to 3 % of U. S. casualties were due to fratricide. Forty-five years later, in Operation “Desert Storm, ” the first Iraq war saw rising rates, with overall casualties due to fratricide near 24 % (Koehler, 1992). In fact, fratricide accounted for 77 % of the combat damaged sustained by U. S. armored vehicles during this conflict (Koehler). According to Briggs and Goldberg (1995), the potential for fratricide from inaccurate recognition is immense even under favorable environmental conditions. If inaccurate recognition can lead {{to higher levels of}} false alarms (i. e., what fratricide is when placed in a signal detection framework), then the opposite situation, i. e., that of misses, or mistaking an enemy vehicle for a friendly vehicle, should also be a relevant problem. We will refer to both types of errors in target identification throughout this paper under the global term misidentification. Factors Involved in Misidentification Misidentification may be a result of many different factors: inadequate training...|$|R
40|$|Trashigang, a {{district}} in Eastern Bhutan with 16 gewogs, {{has a population}} of 51, 134 people and a forest cover of 180, 272 hectares. The district has 79 % of the land under forest cover, which has been under constant threat of fires, with 64 forest fires reported between 2001 and 2007. The forest fires, caused largely by human activities, have changed the forest ecosystems of Trashigang endangering its rich biodiversity. 77 % of the forest fires between 2001 and 2007 were reportedly due to unknown causes, whereas 21 % were accidental and 2 % intentional, consuming a total of 154, 692 hectares of the forest. This study revealed that most of the fires that occurred due to the aforementioned reasons were related to agricultural activity. The majority of <b>fire</b> <b>incidences</b> which are termed ‘unknown’ are speculated to be actually anthropogenic in nature. Occurrence of forest fires is intertwined with community awareness. Public knowledge of the forest fire situation in the district is important to generate awareness. The district-level fire management systems and their operation as well as constraints faced by the District Forest Office is discussed. Recommendations for better forest fire management are suggested...|$|R
