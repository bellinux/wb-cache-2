50|$|Parsnips {{were sent}} by special rail-wagon direct to the {{catering}} industry {{in different parts}} of the country. It was highly unusual for this crop to be grown in a heavy clay soil. However, Spencer-Thomas designed his own parsnip lifter and harvester, mounted on a Fordson Major <b>half-track</b> <b>tractor,</b> which could lift the crop out of the soil even under the most difficult wet and frosty conditions.|$|E
50|$|On 18 October 1940, Junkers and Messerschmitt {{were given}} just 14 days {{to submit a}} {{proposal}} for a large transport glider. The emphasis was still very much on the assault role: the ambitious requirement was to be able to carry either an 88 mm gun and its <b>half-track</b> <b>tractor,</b> or a Panzer IV medium tank. The Junkers Ju 322 Mammut reached prototype form but was eventually scrapped due to difficulties in procuring the necessary high-grade timber for its all-wood construction and, as was discovered during the Mammuts only test flight, an unacceptably high degree of instability inherent in the design. The proposed Messerschmitt aircraft was originally designated Me 261w â€” partly borrowing the designation of the long-range Messerschmitt Me 261, then changed to Me 263 (later re-used for Messerschmitts improved rocket fighter design) and eventually became the Me 321. Although the Me 321 saw considerable service in Russia as a transport, it was never used for its intended role as an assault glider.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>half-track</b> <b>tractors</b> {{were used}} in the interwar period and in World War II, {{especially}} by the Wehrmacht. This type of tractor was mostly discontinued in the postwar.|$|R
50|$|Larger German <b>half-track</b> <b>tractors</b> {{were used}} to tow {{anti-tank}} and field artillery pieces. The largest of these were also used by mechanical engineers to retrieve bogged down vehicles or perform repairs such as engine maintenance. Maultier half-tracks used to transport supplies to forward units were essentially civilian trucks which had had their rear axles replaced by Panzer I or Panzer II running gear.|$|R
50|$|The SOMUA MCG was a <b>half-track</b> {{artillery}} <b>tractor</b> {{and recovery}} vehicle of the French forces during World War II.|$|R

50|$|Tiger I tanks {{needed a}} high degree of support. It {{required}} two or sometimes three of the standard German Sd.Kfz. 9 Famo heavy recovery <b>half-track</b> <b>tractors</b> to tow it. Tiger crews often resorted to using another Tiger to tow the damaged vehicle, but this was not recommended as it often caused overheating and engine breakdown. The low-mounted sprocket limited the obstacle clearance height. The tracks also had a tendency to override the rear sprocket, resulting in immobilisation. If a track overrode and jammed, two Tigers were normally needed to tow the tank. The jammed track was also a big problem itself, since due to high tension, it was often impossible to split the track by removing the track pins. The track sometimes had to be blown apart with a small explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|The Linn tractor is a {{heavy duty}} {{civilian}} <b>half-track</b> or crawler <b>tractor</b> invented by Holman Harry Linn. Approximately 2500 units were built in Morris, New York, USA from 1916 to 1952.|$|R
50|$|German forces used <b>half-tracks</b> as {{artillery}} <b>tractors,</b> {{such as the}} Sd.Kfz. 7. Half-tracked tractors {{were not}} commonly used in this role in other nations. Compared to wheeled vehicles they had better off-road capabilities, but were slower on roads and were more prone to breakdowns. However, for Germany horses remained the most common way of towing artillery throughout the war.|$|R
