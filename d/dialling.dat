5|$|BT {{provides}} fixed ADSL enabled (50Mbit/s) telephone lines. The subscriber trunk <b>dialling</b> {{code for}} Northallerton is 01609. TalkTalk and EE are other LLU Operators {{in the town}} as of July 2009. These businesses are regulated by Ofcom.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dialling</b> {{code for}} {{fixed-line}} telephones in Reading is 0118. BT provides fixed-line telephone coverage throughout {{the town and}} ADSL broadband internet connection to most areas. Parts of Reading are cabled by Virgin Media, supplying cable television, telephone and broadband internet connections.|$|E
5|$|The island made {{communication}} history {{again on}} 8 October 2002, by {{becoming one of}} the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection deployed by Cardiff Council as part of the Flat Holm Project. The connection is used for Internet, access to Cardiff Council's data network and VOIP telephony. There are two handsets in the main farmhouse {{that are part of the}} councils own PBX thus having Cardiff <b>dialling</b> codes. 105 years after Marconi, Spencer Pearson an IT Consultant with Cardiff Council made the first telephone call from the island to his office at County Hall, Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff.|$|E

50|$|The <b>DIAL</b> {{protocol}} has two components, <b>DIAL</b> Service Discovery and the <b>DIAL</b> REST Service. The <b>DIAL</b> Service Discovery {{enables a}} <b>DIAL</b> client device to discover <b>DIAL</b> servers on its local network segment and obtain {{access to the}} <b>DIAL</b> REST Service on those devices. The <b>DIAL</b> REST Service enables a <b>DIAL</b> client to query, launch and optionally stop applications on a <b>DIAL</b> Server device.|$|R
50|$|Starting January 1, 2012, fixed lines will {{be allowed}} to <b>dial</b> {{directly}} to other provinces/countries, but still using open <b>dialing</b> plan. To <b>dial</b> to other province, <b>dial</b> area code+phone number (0xx-xxxxxx), and to <b>dial</b> to other countries, <b>dial</b> 00+country code+phone number.|$|R
5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of <b>dialling</b> the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to <b>dialling</b> in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
25|$|In telephony, {{pressing}} 0 {{is often}} used for <b>dialling</b> out of a company network or to a different city or region, and 00 is used for <b>dialling</b> abroad. In some countries, <b>dialling</b> 0 places a call for operator assistance.|$|E
50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF <b>dialing</b> technology. Some manufacturers implemented pulse <b>dialing</b> with push-button keypads {{and even}} Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional <b>dial</b> pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the <b>dialed</b> number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid <b>dialing</b> for the user. Some push button pulse <b>dial</b> phones allow for double-speed pulse <b>dialing.</b> These allow even faster pulse <b>dialing</b> in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>dial</b> of the Grillo phone employs an {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} design challenge of condensing the <b>dial</b> mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. The Grillo phone's <b>dial</b> couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on conventional <b>dial</b> phones, but instead has a button {{within each of the}} <b>dial's</b> number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin through the back of the <b>dial</b> which stops the <b>dial</b> once it's turned to the <b>dial's</b> end position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{international}} <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8~10" [...] - callers <b>dial</b> '8', {{wait for}} a tone, and then <b>dial</b> '10', followed by the country code, area code and number. The long distance <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8" [...] - callers <b>dial</b> '8', {{wait for a}} tone, and then <b>dial</b> the area code and number.|$|R
25|$|In 1669 Leybourn {{authored}} The Art of <b>Dialling,</b> {{a book on}} the use of sun-dials and astrolabes {{in determining}} the position of vessels at sea. The contemporary expansion of the Royal Navy and Merchant Marines created a significant demand for such manuals, and The Art of <b>Dialling</b> was well written, easy to understand and cheaply produced.|$|E
25|$|In France, many {{telephone}} exchanges were closed at night {{but it was}} still possible to make emergency calls. An operator had to connect the emergency calls only. In 1913, an automatic system was set up. It made provision for calling the police by <b>dialling</b> 17 and the fire brigade by <b>dialling</b> 18. As more manual {{telephone exchanges}} were converted to dial operation, more and more subscribers had access to these special numbers. The service was not widespread until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dialling</b> code is 01547 (the Knighton area code) {{followed}} by 530 (the Bucknell exchange) {{for the majority}} of the settlement, or 540 (the Leintwardine exchange) for Broadward Barn and Broadward Bridge.|$|E
40|$|Seventy-five male college {{students}} and twenty$ve human engineering psychologists were given a question-naire presenting diagrams consisting of three concentrically ganged knobs and three <b>dials</b> which they were told the knobs operate. They were asked which <b>dial</b> they thought should be operated by {{each of the three}} knobs. Knobdial associations were ob taiued with <b>dials</b> in horizontal and vertical arrays above, below, to the left OX and {{to the right of the}} knobs, and wiih <b>dials</b> differing in size, shape and distance from the knob axis. Knob-dial associations were found to be influenced by all of thpse factors except <b>dial</b> shape. Associations which were both strong and relatively unrivaled were found for <b>dial</b> position in a horizontal array (except when the array is to the lefi of the knobs), and for <b>dial</b> size. Subjects associated the spatial knob progression, front knob to back knob with tlze spatial <b>dial</b> progression, left <b>dial</b> to right <b>dial</b> and with the <b>dial</b> size progression, smallest <b>dial</b> to largest <b>dial.</b> Strong, but strongly rivaled, associations were found for <b>dial</b> position in a vertical array and for <b>dial</b> distance from the knob axis...|$|R

25|$|International Direct <b>Dialling</b> (IDD) is provided, and Gibraltar was {{allocated}} {{the access}} code +350 by the International Telecommunication Union. This has been universally valid since 10 February 2007, when the telecom dispute was resolved.|$|E
25|$|Where, 92 is the ISD {{code for}} Pakistan and is {{required}} when <b>dialling</b> outside the country, 303 and 304 were prefixes for Paktel once AMPS and GSM customers respectively allocated by Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. Omitting +92 would require 0 instead to represent local call, hence 0303 and 0304 were the general prefixes and N1N2N3N4N5N6N7 was the subscriber number.|$|E

50|$|To <b>dial</b> {{from one}} {{dependent}} exchange {{to another one}} first <b>dialled</b> 9 to access the GSC then <b>dialled</b> the local code to the destination exchange. Thus a caller from Machen to Magor would <b>dial</b> 947 before the subscriber's number and a caller from Risca to Cwmbran would <b>dial</b> 93. A caller to a Newport number in the linked numbering scheme would simply <b>dial</b> 9.|$|R
50|$|The Radium <b>Dial</b> Company, {{was one of}} a few {{now defunct}} United States {{companies}} along with the United States Radium Corporation, involved in the painting of clocks, watches and other instrument <b>dials</b> using radioluminescent paint containing radium. The resulting <b>dials</b> are now collectively known as radium <b>dials.</b> The luminous paint used on the <b>dials</b> contained a mixture of phosphorus and radium, a product that the Radium <b>Dial</b> Company named Luna. However, unlike the US Radium Corporation, Radium <b>Dial</b> Company was specifically set up to only paint <b>dials,</b> no other radium processing took place at the premises.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>dialing</b> on landlines, calls made within {{cities are}} {{considered}} local calls {{and you just}} <b>dial</b> the local number. Calls to other cities (e.g. Karachi to Lahore) are considered long distance calls, e.g., when <b>dialing</b> to Lahore from Karachi you have to <b>dial</b> the code for Lahore then followed {{by the number of}} the destination, therefore you <b>dial</b> 042-XXXX-XXXX. For international calls, you <b>dial</b> [...] "00" [...] followed by the country code, e.g., for calls to the UK from Pakistan you <b>dial</b> 00 - 44 - XXXXXX.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 1969, Australia did {{not have}} a {{national}} number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services possessed many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the Postmaster General (PMG) introduced the Triple Zero (000) number in major population centres and {{near the end of the}} 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number Triple Zero (000) was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the <b>dialling</b> system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus <b>dialling</b> 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones, so it was easy to dial in darkness.|$|E
25|$|The city civic {{body has}} started a 24x7 call centre, {{the first of its}} kind in Gujarat and the second in the country to take care of all {{complaints}} relating to civic management. Citizens can now get all their complaints registered with the Rajkot Municipal Corporation by <b>dialling</b> a single number with an assurance that the problem would be addressed within 72 hours.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the {{majority}} of lines in rural, and regional areas (particularly in Scotland and Wales) were still manually switched. This inhibited growth, and caused bottlenecks in the network, {{as well as being}} labour and cost-intensive. The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching, and replaced all of its 6,000 exchanges. Subscriber Trunk <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was also added from 1958, which allowed subscribers to dial their own long-distance calls.|$|E
50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> tone after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital <b>dial</b> phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> tone and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then <b>dial</b> the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for the <b>dial</b> tone, <b>dial</b> another 0 to access international line, then <b>dial</b> 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.|$|R
50|$|The {{associated}} <b>dial</b> plan {{requires that}} all numbers, even for local calls, must be <b>dialed</b> with the assigned NDC, {{in contrast to}} previous plans. When <b>dialing</b> from within the country, a prefix 0 must be <b>dialed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sundials are {{sometimes}} combined into multiple <b>dials.</b> If {{two or more}} <b>dials</b> that operate on different principles — say, such as an analemmatic <b>dial</b> and a horizontal or vertical <b>dial</b> — are combined, the resulting multiple <b>dial</b> becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both <b>dials</b> need to output both time and declination. In other words, the direction of true North need not be determined; the <b>dials</b> are oriented correctly when they read {{the same time and}} declination. However, the most common forms combine <b>dials</b> are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning.|$|R
25|$|When Title III was {{established}} telecommunications {{was in its}} infancy and since that time many advances in communications technology have been made. This made it necessary to update the law {{to take into account}} these new developments. Thus the ECPA was passed, and extended Title III to also protect wire, oral and electronic communications while in transit, as well as protecting stored electronic communications. The ECPA also extended the prohibition of the use of pen register and/or trap and trace devices to record <b>dialling</b> information used in the process of transmitting wire or electronic communications without a search warrant.|$|E
25|$|Ballydung Manor may {{be reached}} by <b>dialling</b> Ballydung 666 from a telephone. In the {{earliest}} seasons of the show, the brothers' shared bedroom was {{the only part of}} the manor shown, but in later years, their kitchen was also used. This remained largely the case during the follow-up series The Podge and Rodge Show, although the living room was featured in the Bogmannay special on New Year's Eve 2006. The underground dungeon of Ballydung Manor was also shown in an episode of the chatshow when Podge and Rodge invited guest Sheana Keane to partake in a gruesome game of Operation!.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} José, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out {{for coffee and}} asks if she's dating anyone, {{specifically}} José. Ana replies {{that she is not}} dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk <b>dialling</b> Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and José attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals {{that he would like to}} have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill out paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.|$|E
50|$|Vertical declining <b>dials</b> are sundials that {{indicate}} local apparent time. Vertical south <b>dials</b> are a special case: as are vertical north, vertical east and vertical west <b>dials.</b> The word declining {{means that the}} wall is offset from one of these 4 cardinal points. There are <b>dials</b> that are not vertical, and these are called reclining <b>dials.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>dial</b> tone is a <b>dial</b> tone-like sound {{presented to}} the caller after a call {{has been set up}} to prompt for additional digits to be <b>dialed.</b> Secondary <b>dial</b> tones are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.|$|R
50|$|Direct {{distance}} <b>dialing</b> (DDD) is a {{telecommunication service}} feature {{in which a}} caller may, without operator assistance, call any other user outside the local calling area. Direct <b>dialing</b> by subscribers typically requires extra digits to be <b>dialed</b> as prefixes than for <b>dialing</b> within the local area or within an area code. DDD also extends {{beyond the boundaries of}} national public telephone network, in which case it is called international direct <b>dialing</b> or international direct distance <b>dialing</b> (IDDD).|$|R
