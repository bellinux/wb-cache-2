2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Noise induced {{hearing loss}} {{is a subject}} of growing concern. Over the past 15 years, several {{well-documented}} studies have been completed which express the relationships between industrial noise exposure and damage to normal and pathological ears. This research has provided knowledge of considerable importance to developing successful hearing conservation programs. Many studies have presented the necessity of proper use of personal <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> However, the accuracy of procedures for testing <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> remains questionable. The {{purpose of this study}} was to document a need for increased research on hearing conservation and offer additional information which may help in developing more accurate testing procedures for personal <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> The question investigated in this study was: Can the attenuation factors of personal <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> be measured with probe-ear microphone measurement instruments, with the same accuracy as the present accepted method ANSI standard (ANSI S 3. 19 - 1974) ? The test procedure used three insert type personal <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> on 15 human subjects (30 ears), ages 18 - 41. Each subject was tested with both the subjective test method and the objective test method for each of the three types of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> used. Data collected for each test method was then compared with group mean, as well as the manufacturer's published specifications, to compare accuracy between test methods. This study determined that the present ANSI S 3 - 1974, subjective test method, provided results which were closer to the manufacturer's published attenuation factors than that data which was recorded using the objective probe-ear microphone instrument. It was noted, even though the mean attenuation factors for the objective test method, that were considerably lower than that of the subjective method, that the overall consistency of data appeared to be more accurate using the objective method. It is recommended that further studies be conducted to provide a better procedure for using the probe-ear microphone evaluation for measuring the attenuation factors of personal <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{requires}} that all hearing protection devices be labeled with their associated noise reduction rating (NRR).

[...] To determine the amount of noise reduction afforded by a <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> OSHA recommends that 7 db be subtracted from the NRR. The NRR is generally given in a C-weighted format, so to obtain the A-weighted reduction, one must subtract 7 db.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006, using a random sample of 2, 429 workers, aged between 18 and 65 years old, from residential sub-areas in Salvador, BA, Northeastern Brazil. Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational, and {{health-related data}}. Workers who reported that they worked in places where they needed to shout in order to be heard were considered to be exposed to noise. Exposed workers were asked whether they used <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> and if so, how frequently. Analyses were conducted according to gender, with estimates made about prevalence of the use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> prevalence ratios, and their respective 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS Twelve percent (12. 3 %) of study subjects reported that they were exposed to noise while working. Prevalence of the use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> was 59. 3 % for men and 21. 4 % for women. Men from higher socioeconomic levels (PR = 1. 47; 95 %CI 1. 14; 1. 90) and who had previous audiometric tests (PR = 1. 47; 95 %CI 1. 15; 1. 88) were more likely to use <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> For women, greater perceived safety was {{associated with the use of}} <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> (PR = 2. 92; 95 %CI 1. 34; 6. 34). This perception was specifically related to the presence of supervisors committed to safety (PR = 2. 09; 95 %CI 1. 04; 4. 21), the existence of clear rules to prevent workplace injuries (PR = 2. 81; 95 %CI 1. 41; 5. 59), and whether they were informed about workplace safety (PR = 2. 42; 95 %CI 1. 23; 4. 76).

40|$|Abstract: This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated noise annoyance, awareness and practice among {{the workers in}} two steel factories in UAE. The study involving 468 steel workers randomly selected. Noise exposure was estimated using the integrated sound level meter. A structured interview questionnaire {{was used to assess}} the noise annoyance, awareness and practice of workers towards the noise. The results showed that about 89 % of the workers exposed to a daily Leq above the permissible level which is 85 dB (A) and 45 % of them had never used any <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> About 58 % of the workers experienced a moderate or high degree of noise annoyance. Only 4. 1 % and 1. 9 % of the workers aware about the health effects of noise and the methods of prevention respectively and awareness was positively associated with noise exposure. Few workers (13. 2 %) used the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> during the working time. Thus workers within both factories are at high risk of developing noise annoyance, and other related ailments due to excessive occupational expo-sure to noise, and non-use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> There was an association between noise annoyance and noise level and any one of them could influence the workers to use the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> There is a need to have a hearing conservation program in both factories one of its main components is education to raise the awareness of workers about noise hazards and methods of prevention.

50|$|During {{the amount}} of time an {{individual}} wears earmuffs, the device can be jostled and displaced from the proper position that allows for the highest attenuation. This can be common in the workplace, as many individuals are in motion during the time they are wearing the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> Moving the jaw while chewing or talking and perspiration are examples of ways in which readjustment can occur, causing the seal to be broken between the earcup and skin and allowing sound to leak in.|$|E
5000|$|Motivational {{techniques}} {{can be implemented}} to promote hearing conservation program compliance {{and the use of}} hearing protection.

If the results are normal and the inspection of the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> is good, praise can be given for following protocol. If there is a shift in their hearing, instruction can be given again about the proper use of hearing protection and the importance of wearing them. Audiograms can be very useful in showing workers how noise can affect their hearing. One specific {{way to do this is}} to perform two hearing test on an employee on two different days. [...] One day the hearing test will be after wearing hearing protection all day and the other will be after not wearing hearing protection for the day. The difference can then be discussed with the worker and he/she has a tangible way to see how noise affects hearing. Another technique is using [...] "internal triggers" [...] to motivate employees to comply to the hearing conservation program. [...] If the individual already suffers from tinnitus and/or hearing loss they are probably more likely to use hearing protection because he/she does not want that problem to progress with noise exposure. Finally, the hearing protection offered should be comfortable so the worker will wear it. It is suggested that workers have a variety of hearing protection devices available to them, including at least one type of earmuff and two different forms of earplugs, to fit the individual needs and wants of the workers.|$|E

50|$|Workers with {{hearing loss}} face {{additional}} risk factors {{on the job}} site such as an inability to hear warning signals or alarms, an increased difficulty to tell where sounds are coming from, and increased difficulty communicating with co-workers. This occurs due to the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (HPD) attenuating the signals/noises below the level that the worker is able to hear. OSHA regulations require individuals to wear HPD regardless of their amount of hearing loss, {{even if they have}} a severe to profound hearing loss. Workers that have sustained a standard threshold shift are required by OSHA to wear HPD at a 85 dB TWA. There are special considerations to take into account when fitting HPD on workers with a hearing loss. These factors include comfort, degree and configuration of the worker's hearing loss, the necessary communication demands in the workplace (verbal vs. nonverbal), the ease of communication, and the noise exposure levels of the worker.|$|E

The objectives of this study were to investigate the noise levels produced during abrasive blasting, attempt to further quantify total noise exposure to the abrasive blast operator, and calculate combined attenuation provided by the abrasive blasting helmets and hearing protection devices. The attenuation provided by the helmets alone was directly measured during abrasive blasting operations through personal dosimetry. The attenuation provided by the helmets when used in combination with hearing protection devices was determined by applying measured attenuation data from the helmets to the attenuation data provided by <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers.

40|$|Among {{published}} {{interventions to}} increase farmers’ <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (HPD) use several methodological issues are of concern: use of theory, concepts, reliability of measures of self-report, and gender-related differences in predictors of HPD use. Three papers {{were prepared to}} better understand use of HPDs among this group of workers and guide subsequent interventions: (a) a critical review of theory implementation in HPD use interventions among farmers, (b) a literature review and examination of the evidence of reliability of self-report as a measurement method, and (c) an examination of gender-related differences in predictors of HPD use among farm operators. Theory examination identified five interventions and six theories (health belief model, transtheoretical model of change, health promotion model, social cognitive theory, PRECEDE-PROCEED, and theory of self-efficacy). While the studies employed health behavior theories to varying degrees, all intervention resulted in increased HPD use. 	Kappa, correlations, sensitivity/specificity, positive/negative predictive validity, correlations, and logistic regression {{were used to assess}} concordance between self-report and non self-report methods. Kappa scores ranged from. 01 to. 89; sensitivity/specificity scores were 92 % and 61 % respectively; Pearson’s r, Spearman’s rho, and Kendall tau-b were. 89,. 84, and. 69 respectively; and odds ratios ranged from 1. 4 to 19. 42. Concordance increased with use of daily activity cards, short time intervals between performance of the behavior and reporting, and limiting recall efforts to five days. The Farmers’ Predictors of <b>Hearing</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Device</b> Use Model was used to examine gender-related differences in predictors of HPD use.

40|$|Introduction: Grass {{trimming}} workers {{work every}} day in a noisy environment as they carry the grass trimming machine on their back, such daily exposure for many years may contribute to {{noise induced hearing loss}}. Objective: To assess the hearing status of the grass trimming workers in KB and the nearby areas and to determine the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among them. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross sectional study. The source population were from grass trimming worker works under USM Health Campus, Majlis Perbandaran Kota Bharu (MPKB), Majlis Daerah Pasir Puteh, Bachok, Ketereh and Tumpat. The data was collected at HUSM /ORL-HNS outpatient clinic to fill the Proforma, otoscopic examination and hearing tests. Hearing tests consist of pure tone audiometry, tympanogram and distortion product otoacoustic emission. Results: A total of 77 grass trimming workers participate in this study. All of them were male with age range from 20 - 53 years old with majority of them fall in age group of 40 - 50 years old. Two of the subjects were excluded as they have history of working in noisy job before and for at least 10 years. None of them use any protecting hearing device. Duration of work of grass trimmers were in between 1 to 33 years. The daily work was 4 - 5 hours with time of rest in between we found that 62 out 75 grass (82. 7 %) trimming worker have noise induced hearing loss with characteristic notch at 6 kHz, 4 kHz and 3 kHz. The noise induced hearing loss occurred in workers exposed to noise as early as two years in this job. The intensity of the noise from the machine is in between 91. 3 to 100. 7 dB in a fluctuant manner. The left ear was the predominant side that was affected by hearing loss. All of the subjects was having mild hearing loss. Conclusion: The study showed that grass trimming job have occupational hazards of noise induced hearing loss. It occurs with one to two years working without any <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> The dip at 6 kHz is a significant early sign for noise exposure.

40|$|The {{attenuation}} {{provided by}} a <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (HPD) {{in the field is}} usually estimated by applying a derating factor to the laboratory-determined noise reduction rating (NRR) of the HPD. However, attenuation is highly dependent on individual-specific HPD fit. Prediction of an individual’s attenuation depends on the accuracy of the measurement system and the variability of attenuation over time (e. g. after HPD refitting). Variability in attenuation and attenuation test systems has not been adequately characterized to allow for such an assessment. This study compared attenuation measurements made with two systems, Real-Ear-at-Threshold (REAT) and Microphone-in-Real-Ear (MIRE), on 20 workers using two earplugs (foam and custom-molded). Workers ’ perceptions of the earplugs were also evaluated. Individuals ’ attenuation results were summarized as personal attenuation ratings (PARs, similar to NRRs). Variability in PARs from between-subject, within-subject and within-day (i. e. repeated tests on a subject without earplug refitting) differences was assessed and used to present the lower confidence limit, or uncertainty factor (UF), of an average individual’s attenuation.

This device could measure the noise level in the workplace, detect the regularity of worker in the usage of IHPD and indicate the high noise area. Meanwhile, the IHPD is required {{to connect with the}} Dosiwatch and the Integrated Noise Exposure Software (INES) to improve its functionalities. The Dosiwatch is an electronic device to display the noise level and indicate the risky area, where it helps the workers to perceive the risk of noise in a workplace. The INES receives the noise data wirelessly, plots the instantaneous noise charts and supervises the regularity of workers in using the IHPD. By the way, the technical procedure development and the typical function of electronic gadgets are significant in this invention. A prototyping model was developed to ensure the technical procedure development meets the conceptual design of IHPD, dosiwatch and INES...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLevel-dependent <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> {{protect the}} ear against harmful noise exposure, like impulse noise with high peak {{pressure}} levels, but allow unaltered {{perception of the}} quiet acoustic environment. Using this type of protection, speech communication is possible. For these <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> (HPDs) two principles exist: 1) passive systems (like nonlinear earplugs) and 2) active systems (talk-through systems) using electronics for the reproduction of the acoustic environment. The goal {{of this study is}} to quantify the degradation of spatial perception when these protections are worn. To which level is the localization still possible? Tests are realized in order to estimate the localization errors of sound in space with and without wearing level-dependent HPDs. Different kinds of protectors have been used. These tests show that the use of one of these HPDs impedes on the spatial perception: confusions between top-down as well as between in front-back perception...|$|R
40|$|An {{inflight}} {{evaluation of}} four aural protectors is presented. The <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> studied were ear muffs, plastic ear plugs, rubber ear plugs, and wax ear plugs. It is concluded that ear plugs are satisfactory for providing adequate sound attenuation in general aviation aircraft. However, two problems {{were found in}} the use of ear plugs; comfort and interference with cabin communications...|$|R
40|$|Workers at a {{soft drink}} {{production}} plant were interviewed about their hearing health, {{exposure to noise}} and use of occupational <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> While 24 % of the 209 workers reported always using <b>hearing</b> <b>protection,</b> 39 % stated they never used any form of device. Worker responses were analysed and their stated reasons for the non use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> were summarised. Responses were compared to Australian and overseas industry findings. The need to conduct such survey research on an industry-by industry basis is emphasised and the implications for hearing conservation programs outlined. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
