5000|$|Cheetahs {{have been}} known to exist in India for a very long time, but hunting led to their {{extinction}} in the country in the late 1940s. The Indian government planned to reintroduce cheetahs to India. The IUCN's Species Survival Commission has approved a feasibility study, stressing to follow the IUCN guidelines on reintroduction and introducing the same subspecies, if and when the reasons for extinction have been removed.Then Minister of Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh, told the Rajya Sabha on 7 July 2009 that [...] "The cheetah is the only animal that has been described extinct in India in the last 100 years. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> from abroad to repopulate the species." [...] He was responding to a notice from the Bharatiya Janata Party.

5000|$|Hamsters - In this show, the Hamsters {{are shown}} to be human size. The Zebra Brothers get the Hamster King to attack Big Green as they told him that they harm {{children}}, and Hamster King loves children (he {{has a lot of}} his own children). Mighty Ray was baby-sitting the baby Turtles during the assault, so he took them out to help the rest of First Squad fight Hamster King. At the same time, the Zebra Brothers and Hamster King's children came to join the fight. When Hamster King saw his children fighting the baby Turtles, he was unhappy as he did not want his children to follow in his footsteps. Lin Chung suggested that to stop the baby Turtles fighting Hamster King's children, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to act friendly. So Lin Chung and Hamster King shook hands and the baby Turtles and Hamster King's children started shaking hands with each other.

5000|$|... "On {{the morning}} of the 22d I found myself once more at Bonneville in Faucigny; but a {{considerable}} change had taken place in the aspect of affairs since I had left it less than a month before. From every house, and almost every window of every house, waved French flags. The hotel, which had formerly been the headquarters of the anti-French party, and where I had dined with the members of the Committee, was tricked out in all the splendors of red, white, and blue. The booksellers shop, where I had heard sentiments strongly hostile to France, now displayed a gigantic banner; but, more remarkable than all, the house of the candidate who had contested Bonneville three weeks before on the Swiss interest, as opposed to the French, was now decorated with French flags. My old friends were nowhere to be found; the Committee had evaporated, and throughout the town where party feeling had recently run so high, and anti-French annexation was rampant and openly expressed, there was not a syllable to be heard against it. A little shopkeeper, whom I knew formerly as a furious anti-Frenchman, was now with difficulty dug out of his backshop, and owned to having just voted in favor of France as an act of self-preservation. 'What could I do?' said he; 'the concierge de la ville brought me two tickets this morning, with a message from the intendant that if I didn't vote them it would be the worse for me. He also asked where my French flag was, and advised me, if I valued my liberty, to show one without delay. There is the flag, and here is the other voting-ticket; a similar one I have just voted, but this I present to you.""My informant went on to tell me that every voter had received his ticket from the police authorities, and he smiled when I asked him where I could procure a non ticket. 'No printing-house here would venture to print one,' he said; 'you would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> from Geneva.' The addition of the word [...] "Zone" [...] struck me as curious, and I asked the object of its insertion in the voting-ticket. The device was ingenious. The authorities, fearing that though the people had not the courage to vote non they might be bold enough to abstain from voting at all, gave it to be understood that such a course would not prevent their being annexed, but that they would thereby lose their commercial zone or free frontier with Switzerland, upon which their future prosperity would depend; in other words, by voting they would be annexed and get their zone, by abstaining they would be equally annexed, but ruined. By a recent French circular I perceive it stated that the desire of the Emperor to carry out the conditions of neutrality, as laid down in the ninety-second article of the Treaty, has induced him to grant the Zone. It was originally invented as an election 'dodge', and served its purpose admirably, being used either as a bribe or as a threat." ...|$|E

40|$|We examine “subjective {{weathering}} ” among females entering adulthood, {{using three}} waves {{of a national}} study. Subjective weathering is a social psychological component of aging {{that is associated with}} “physical weathering ” previously observed in research on physical health. We examine the influence of stressors from childhood and adolescence on subjective weathering and depressive symp-toms in emerging adulthood. Childhood abuse is associated with early menar-che, as anticipated in research on physical weathering. Early menarche and child abuse are in turn associated with intimate partner violence exposure in adolescence. Both early menarche and intimate partner violence are associated with early parenthood and diminish the likelihood of high school graduation. These experiences culminate in subjective weathering associated with depres-sive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Our findings connect physical and sub-jective weathering within the stress process paradigm. 162 “I’m nineteen going on twenty, and I feel like I am fifty, ” she said. “I’m just so tired.
