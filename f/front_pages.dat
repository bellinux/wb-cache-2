This photograph was quickly reproduced on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E

5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of newspapers, because they {{went beyond the}} war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup {{may have been the}} most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E

The {{call for a}} £10 an hour minimum wage, the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> explains through a second quote, {{was inspired by the}} 'historic victory of the $15 minimum wage in Seattle.' On 24 September 2014 the <b>front</b> <b>page,</b> carrying the slogan 'We need £10 an hour now!' states that 'As a result of a Bakers' Union motion, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) adopted the £10 demand at its recent conference.' ...|$|R

News of the attack made <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> throughout the world, including The Times of London, The New York Times, and the Montreal Gazette.

5|$|Protesters {{continued}} {{to delay the}} destruction of the tree. Solicitors for the campaign had even argued in court that receipt of a letter addressed to the tree itself gave it the status of a legal dwelling, causing a further delay,. In the early morning of 7 December 1993, several hundred police arrived to evict the protesters, which took ten hours to carry out. Protesters made numerous complaints against the police; police, in turn, denied these allegations, attributing any misbehaviour to the protesters. Media attention started to increase regarding the protest, with several daily newspapers putting pictures of the tree on their <b>front</b> <b>pages.</b>|$|E

The Army's low-altitude photographs were featured {{the next day}} on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of hundreds of newspapers. Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States, also planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident.

However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of major accidents. The conclusion was that private sorrow {{was not to be}} covered in the media and since the media has had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E

After returning to Hollywood, Monroe hired famous attorney Jerry Giesler and announced in October 1954 that she was filing for divorce.

5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2.

Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper <b>front</b> <b>pages.</b> The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of the raid. The enthusiasm over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The raid was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as the raid of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, the raid of Bilibid Prison on February4, and the raid at Los Baños on February23.|$|E
