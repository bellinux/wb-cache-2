5|$|When it opened, the listed seating {{capacity}} was 42,865 people and between 1995 and 2001 the team sold out 455 consecutive regular-season games. Modifications {{over the years}} resulted in several moderate changes to the capacity, peaking at 45,569 in 2010. After the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the facility was renovated in two phases, which upgraded and reconfigured several areas {{of the park and}} reduced {{seating capacity}}. As of 2017, seating capacity is listed at 35,051 people, though additional <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> be accommodated through standing room areas and temporary seating.|$|E
5|$|After 1995 the white-red-white flag {{is used as}} {{a symbol}} of the {{opposition}} to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist Siarhei Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of Vitsebsk. The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by force-feeding on 16 January 2012.|$|E

Lisa promises to stop increasing the family's phone bill, but continues to make calls to the hotline from such places as Dr. Hibbert's office and a telephone at Springfield Elementary. After Principal Skinner catches her, Marge suggests that Lisa try to go until midnight without calling the hotline; if she can do so, she will have conquered her addiction. Although tempted {{throughout the rest of the}} day, Lisa beats her addiction.|$|E

5|$|The current club {{ownership}} {{have stated}} that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United. Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> only enter the ground via the Fulham Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations. The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home, but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks. In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders. In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, {{with a view to}} developing the site into a new stadium, but lost out to a Malaysian consortium. The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium.|$|E
5|$|There are 24 vending {{stands in}} the {{corridor}} area behind the stands, with a selection of different snacks, light meals, and beverages. Other facilities include exhibition space, 330 toilets for men, 120 for women, and six for the disabled. Pre-match and half-time activities take place behind the terracing of the Northern Stand. This area is called Ståplatstorget ("The terracing square"), and includes eight vending stands and MFF Support's supporter centre. At the supporter centre, <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> buy souvenirs, and tickets to away matches. The square also contains publicly accessible benches and tables. Access between the {{different areas of the}} stadium was limited by a system of security gates {{until the end of the}} 2011 season, when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely, except for the areas occupied by away supporters. This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere, and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches. To further motivate spectators to come early, pre-match activities are often held at Ståplatstorget.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the club}} has run its own social media {{websites}} since 2009. Official sites run by the club include Twitter, Facebook and Flickr pages which <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> join.

40|$|Abstract: The {{impeller}} is {{the important}} pneumatic part of centrifugal fan, and its structure performances are key factors which affect the whole performances of fan. The CAD module of centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>can</b> realize the automation of aerodynamic force calculation. According to demands, computer can automatically complete aerodynamic force calculation and further determine major geometric parameters of impeller of fan. Speed coefficient and diametral quotient are two important parameters reflecting the character of ventilating fan. The relation curve between the speed coefficient and diametral quotient of various fans is plotted in this paper. The CAD module of impeller of centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>can</b> realize such functions as aerodynamic design and parameterization drawing of impeller, and can accomplish rapid response from receiving design parameters to profiled impeller of fan, {{so that it can}} improve the quality of drawing...|$|R

50|$|Reloading the BMP-2's 30 mm cannon can be {{somewhat}} problematic, {{and can take}} up to two hours, even if the ammunition is prepared.

25|$|The studies note that—win or lose—Eagles <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> {{be counted}} on to pack their stadium. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 {{consecutive}} games, and 70,000 were on the team's waiting list for season tickets. Despite finishing with a 6–10 record in the 2005–2006 season, the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened.|$|E

25|$|Most corals must {{attach to}} a hard surface {{in order to}} begin growing but sea <b>fans</b> <b>can</b> also live on soft sediments. They are often found growing along {{bathymetric}} highs such as seamounts, ridges, pinnacles and mounds, on hard surfaces. Corals are sedentary, so they must live near nutrient-rich water currents. Deep-water corals feed on zooplankton and rely on ocean currents to bring food. The currents also aid in cleaning the corals.|$|E
50|$|Earth cooling {{tubes are}} not cost {{effective}} in hot humid tropical environments where the ambient Earth temperature approaches human temperature comfort zone. A solar chimney or photovoltaic-powered <b>fan</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} exhaust undesired heat and draw in cooler, dehumidified air that has passed by ambient Earth temperature surfaces. Control of humidity and condensation are important design issues.|$|R

25|$|The {{scheme is}} said to be run by a mafia.

40|$|Custom Angle Ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} {{regulate}} air flow only into areas where we need air flow, by changing the angles. (i. e.) both swiveling and tilting of the ceiling fan down-rod. The reason for the innovation of this mechanism is that, we found several areas, where the ceiling fans were installed at the wrong locations on the ceiling. Normally, the rooms are designed, according to personal wish, only after concreting the roof slab. Therefore, the hooks for hooking up the ceiling fan are to be placed during the concreting process of roof slab. But, {{they might not be}} in the correct position to blow air into all areas of the room. This is the case where, Custom angle ceiling <b>fan</b> <b>can</b> be used. The relevance of this mechanism lies in, reducing the power wastage in conditions like, fans blowing air, where it is not required...|$|R
