25|$|Because of the terse {{and often}} {{incomplete}} {{wording of the}} historical sources for the large shogi variants, except for chu shogi {{and to a lesser}} extent dai shogi (which were at some points of time the most prestigious forms of shogi being played), the historical rules of tenjiku shogi are not clear. Different sources often differ significantly in the moves attributed to the pieces. The descriptions listed <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> likely reconstruction based on chu shogi, the primary basis of tenjiku shogi, but not all contemporary players follow these historically-based rules.

Their legal status is peculiar to Indian relations.

They are a protected autonomy, with the title of original territory vested in them.

25|$|The {{numbers in}} the upper row mean {{accentuation}} types. For the third type the additional information is given in dictionaries. The mark 3 without the letter added, is for words, stressed in the next-to-last syllable. The letter after is for polysyllabic words and says what type of stress the syllable has in those cases where the stress falls on the stem (other cases receive it on the ending) and how distant from the ending the syllable stressed is. The letter a is for a start-firm (tvirtapradė priegaidė) accent and the letter b – for an end-firm (tvirtagalė priegaidė) and short stressed vowel. The single digit with a letter means that the stress falls on the third syllable from the ending; if the stress falls on the fourth syllable from the ending, the mark is 34a or 34b, there are also nouns having stress in the fifth (35a, 35b) and sixth (36b) syllable from the ending. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few examples of the nouns of the third accentuation pattern, the singular nominative and the plural dative and accusative cases: akmuõ, akmenìms, ãkmenis; áugalas, augaláms, áugalus; žándas, žandáms, žándus. The first declension also include nouns stressed in the more distant from the ending syllable than the next-to-last, but their stress is steady through the cases and is always clear from the nominative singular.|$|E

However, the game still provides a difficult challenge for experienced players, {{and the introduction of}} the Expert+ difficulty for drums and the Drum Over mode were seen as good additions.

[...] NME writer John Doran wrote, [...] "sure enough <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm-hearted, Neil Young-like intensity. Those wanting clangour and dissonance will be disappointed, but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Grayson Currin deemed it a [...] "motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers" [...] but that [...] "Ranaldo's opportunity {{to step out of the}} Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity." [...] Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as: [...] "while it may be traditional in structure, Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance. The playing may draw on jazz, country, rock and Ranaldo's own avant-garde catalogue." [...] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes found it [...] "great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out. But it's also a reminder of their irreplaceable magic." ...|$|E
500|$|In later life, he {{was known}} for his blunt and {{critical}} comments towards modern players, believing the cricket in earlier times to be superior. After Steve Waugh's team set a world record of consecutive Test victories, Harvey named three Australian teams that he thought to be superiors, saying [...] "no, far from it" [...] in response to the suggestion that Waugh's men were the best team in history. He attributed the wins to weak opponents, stating [...] "No I don't think they're up to the world standard they were years ago" [...] and that the 1980s West Indies team were far superior. He also criticised the Australian team for publicly praising the skills of their opponents, believing that they did so to aggrandise their statistical performances against teams he considered to be weak. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century and criticised modern day batsmen, noting that players in earlier eras had to play on sticky wickets saying [...] "these guys who play out <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> little bit spoilt in my opinion. They play on flat wickets all the time and they grizzle if ... the ball does a little bit off the pitch, and whatever ... But we {{had to put up with}} that" [...] and going to assert his opinion that the current players would be no match.|$|E
