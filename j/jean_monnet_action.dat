40|$|From the introduction]. Much {{attention}} {{has recently been}} given to European Community lobbying. The reason is no doubt the proliferation of lobbyists gravitating around EC institutions, especially since the mid 1980 s, when a new "relaunch" of the EC was clearly under way. Lobbying {{is not a new}} phenomenon in the EC. If one accepts a rather broad definition of the term, then actors involved in lobbying EC institutions since 1957 have included a constellation of national associations and European federations for agriculture, industry, labor, business, finance, and commerce. Yet the growing number of professional lobbyists (including lawyers and accounting firms), European special interest groups, and representatives of multinational firms, countries, counties and cities, is a relatively more recent development. Although publications on lobbying in the EC are numerous, {{there is a lack of}} systematic study in this field. Who lobbies whom or where and for what specific reasons? The interests of the various groups range from those lobbyists who try to lobby the Commission on highly technical matters, or to obtain a specific grant or project, to those who attempt to influence the future shape of the EC by drawing attention to issues such as enlargement and its implications for the institutions of the EC, subsidiarity, or "how better to communicate EC information to Community citizens. " The Action Committee for Europe, which is the successor to <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet's</b> <b>Action</b> Committee for the United States of Europe, belongs to this last category...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{analysing}} {{one of the}} most dynamic fields of EU studies, the Economic Studies, which is, in the same time, a classic and a permanently new and changeable domain, offering a comprehensive coverage of European economic integration. This assertion is also confirmed {{by the fact that the}} EU Economic Studies come in second position in point of projects funded by <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> <b>Action.</b> The study takes into consideration three subfields of EU Economic Studies: European Economy, European Management, and Europe and Global Economy, tracing their evolution in twelve European countries. The curricular database of these subfields has been the support needed to seize the development of curricula in EU Economic Studies through internal elements contributing to its development - the dynamics of specializations, the role of mobility in various ways for crossing the disciplinary/transdisciplinary and national /transnational borders, or the role of NTIC in developing the curricula. Finally, it is the same curricular database that has helped us follow the EU Economic Studies curricula development depending on external stimuli: evolution of curricula according to the European agenda and its level of knowledge, and the impact of Jean Monnet Programme in developing the European Studies curricula in the field...|$|E

First, we will take into consideration the perspective that each curriculum from the four domains has in the ensemble of European and/or EU Studies, the new domains, at the three levels of study, Bachelor, Master and PhD in the twelve countries that made the object of our research, emphasizing the nuances from a country to another. Secondly, we will trace the evolution of each curriculum in relation with the internal drivers (the dynamics of the study programmes/specializations where European Studies are taught), we will stress the role of mobility in various ways for crossing the disciplinary (transdisciplinarity) and national (transnational) borders and we will follow the application of ICT in the development of European studies curricula in the mentioned field. Afterwards, we will stress the evolution of each curriculum in function of the external drivers: the evolution of each curriculum depending on the European Agenda, how much the curriculum is adapted to the changes of the European Labour Market and the impact of the <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> <b>Action</b> {{in the development of the}} curricula in European Studies in each field of study. ...|$|E
40|$|The book {{explores the}} {{promotion}} of Europeanness, which aims to arouse feelings {{of belonging to the}} European Union. It demonstrates that {{the promotion of}} Europeanness at the EU level does not constitute an overarching identity policy that imposes a homogenous interpretation of European identity. Rather, it is a process of negotiation in which various entrepreneurs of Europeanness within and outside the EU institutions invent and communicate representations of Europe. Both the negotiation and the multilayered representations of Europe that it produces are investigated through three case studies: the academia and the historians, European heritage, and the iconography of the euro. 1.

40|$|This eBook {{has been}} {{published}} by the European University Institute, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, European Union Democracy Observatory - EUDO. It contains the contributions from the 2011 EUDO Dissemination Conference on Inclusive Democracy in Europe, and the EUDO Online Forum Debate on National Voting Rights for EU Citizens Residing in Other Member StatesIn this publication, academics, policy-makers, and representatives of civil society explore the history and nature of migrant political participation in Europe and consider policy options for remedying the democratic deficit {{in light of the}} political realities of modern Europe. The contributors provide a comprehensive discussion of inclusive democracy in the European Union, considering principles of democracy, conceptions of national and EU citizenship, and the political and institutional practicalities of national and European policy change. The first section brings together contributions from the 2011 Dissemination Conference organised by the European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO, www. eudo. eu) and co-funded by the European Commission (Lifelong Learning Programme, <b>Jean</b> <b>Monnet</b> <b>action)</b> on Inclusive Democracy in Europe. The second section of the eBook exhibits the EUDO CITIZENSHIP Forum Debate on the voting rights of second-country nationals in the European Union. Contributors to the debate examine the contradictory nature of two of the fundamental rights of EU citizenship: the right to free movement and the right to participate in the political life of one’s country of residence. Those who exercise their right to free movement sometimes forfeit their right to vote in national elections in their country of origin but are also disenfranchised in their country of residence.
