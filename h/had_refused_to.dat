5|$|In 1977, the {{government}} offered al-Jamri {{the opportunity to}} serve as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain (Shia branch). Al-Jamri agreed after Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei issued him with a religious permit to do so. The decision was controversial within Bahrain, as many Shia clerics <b>had</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> participate in {{the government}}-run judiciary ever since its foundation in the 1920s.

5|$|Issues of Gallicanism were {{prominent}} in the 1689 conclave that had elected Alexander VIII. Alexander's predecessor, Innocent XI, <b>had</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> confirm new French bishops {{to the point where}} thirty-five dioceses lacked a bishop confirmed by Rome in 1688. Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the unconfirmed French bishops.

5|$|Two {{groups were}} excluded. Roman Catholics who {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} Pope would not be tolerated. They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope <b>had</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. Roman Catholics were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their church or their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.|$|E

5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. <b>had</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
