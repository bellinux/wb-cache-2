5|$|Similar solar-heating-driven jets of gaseous {{carbon dioxide}} are {{believed}} to erupt from the south polar cap of Mars each spring. Although these eruptions {{have not yet been}} directly observed, they leave evidence in the form of dark spots and lighter fans atop the <b>dry</b> <b>ice,</b> representing sand and dust carried aloft by the eruptions, and a spider-like pattern of grooves created below the ice by the out-rushing gas.|$|E
5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of <b>dry</b> <b>ice,</b> or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
50|$|A neenish tart (or neenish cake) is a tart {{made with}} a pastry base and a filling {{consisting}} of sweet gelatine-set cream, mock cream, icing sugar paste, or lemon and sweetened condensed milk mixture, with <b>dried</b> <b>icing</b> {{on the top of}} the tart in two colours. The addition of a layer of raspberry jam is a common recipe variation. The colours used for the icing are usually some combination of brown, white, and pink. They are almost exclusively sized as individual servings, 60-80 mm in diameter. The tart was originally created in Australia and is mainly found there and in New Zealand.|$|R

5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>dry</b> <b>ice,</b> {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
5|$|The series {{consists}} of four role-playing games and one social card game. Each game typically features a third-person camera. The player controls the player character in a combination of combat and puzzle game elements to achieve goals and complete the story. Hotroit Stories is the only installment to feature an overhead perspective, while Daibouken Monsters is played as a card game, with no character movement. All games in the series feature a battle mode. During battles, player command a single human ally. To fight enemies in the main game, players use magical abilities or familiars; in Hotroit Stories, players attack using items such as <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> for similar effects, while Daibouken Monsters limits players to using familiars only. The battle mode in Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom is on an open battlefield, allowing players to freely roam around the area, while Dominion of the Dark Djinn employs a grid layout, whereby players can create formations to avoid attacks.|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as rotten ice, lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and dark nilas, fast ice, icefoot, ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, thaw holes, rotten <b>ice,</b> <b>ice</b> islands, <b>dried</b> <b>ice</b> puddles, hummocked ice, and leads...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} and internal architecture of seismostratigraphic sequences observed on the Antarctic continental slope and rise are results of sediment transport and deposition by bottom currents and ice sheets. Low energy input of detritus via a palaeo-delta originating {{in an area}} of the Amundsen Sea shelf and deposition of this material on the continental rise under sea ice coverage (60 - 21 Ma) was followed by glacial erosion in the hinterland of this part of West Antarctica (21 - 14. 1 Ma), resulting in a larger depocentre and an increase in mass transport deposits. A higher sediment supply along a broad front with a focus via two palaeo-ice stream troughs resulted from a polythermal ice sheet. In the eastern Amundsen Sea rise the glaciogenic debris was shaped into levee-drifts by a re-circulating bottom current. A reduced sediment accumulation in the deep-sea subsequent indicates a reduced sediment supply probably in response to a colder and <b>drier</b> <b>ice</b> sheet (14. 1 - 4 Ma). A dynamic ice sheet since 4 Ma delivered material offshore mainly via Abbott Trough and Pine Island Trough West. Interaction of this glaciogenic detritus with a west-setting bottom current resulted in the continued formation of levee-drifts in the eastern and central Amundsen Sea...|$|R

5|$|Triton's {{surface is}} covered with a {{transparent}} layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, but it is possible that it is entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (<b>dry</b> <b>ice)</b> the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton's surface area is 23millionkm2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. Triton's reddish colour is thought {{to be the result of}} methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|Governor of Rhode Island Dennis J. Roberts {{declared}} {{martial law}} for the state after Carol caused heavy damage. In Massachusetts, the National Guard were deployed to six towns to prevent looting. National Guardsmen flew a plane of <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> from Newark, New Jersey to Boston to assist the widespread areas without power and refrigeration. Widespread areas were without power for days, and in some areas {{for up to a}} week, until crews could repair downed lines. Spoiled food due to lack of refrigeration resulted in about $1million in losses. Power crews from elsewhere in the United States arrived to assist in the restoration. Workers quickly removed trees from highways. Damaged factories in Rhode Island prevented employees from working for three weeks after the storm. The steeple of the Old North Church in Boston was rebuilt in 1955, after residents throughout the country provided $150,000 in donations. Governor of Maine Burton M. Cross {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. The Small Business Administration declared six counties in Maine as disaster areas. In the days after the storm, President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower declared Massachusetts and Rhode Island as federal disaster areas. The federal government provided financial aid, amounting to $1.5million in Massachusetts. The president ordered for troops to assist in the aftermath. The American Red Cross quickly deployed teams to the most affected areas, feeding hundreds of families. About 12days after Carol struck New England, Hurricane Edna struck eastern Massachusetts, causing an additional $40million in damage and 20deaths. More disaster aid was provided after the second hurricane.|$|E
5|$|President Bush also {{declared}} Washington, D.C., as {{a disaster}} area {{two days after}} Isabel passed through the area. The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure those who lost food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of Employment Services created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost their work as a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to provide more than 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E

5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
25|$|When <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> {{is placed}} in water, {{sublimation}} is accelerated, and low-sinking, dense clouds of smoke-like fog are created. This is used in fog machines, at theaters, haunted house attractions, and nightclubs for dramatic effects. Unlike most artificial fog machines, in which fog rises like smoke, fog from <b>dry</b> <b>ice</b> hovers near the ground. <b>Dry</b> <b>ice</b> is useful in theater productions that require dense fog effects.

40|$|Road surface {{conditions}} {{vary with}} snow, <b>ice,</b> wet and <b>dry</b> {{during the four}} seasons in Korea. The change of the road surface conditions can have significant influence on {{the safety of a}} running vehicle on the road. Nowadays, {{there are a lot of}} CCTVs that are installed to observe the road surface with the unaided eye, and it is common for an administrator to determine the road surface conditions after confirming visually. However, there is a limitation to quickly determine the road surface conditions manually. Thus there is a need for developing a technology that can automatically determine the road surface based on images. In this paper, a recognition algorithm was proposed to extract the state of road surface conditions based on images obtained by a vision camera, and empirical experiment was conducted. The road surface conditions were classified using histogram and wavelet filter based on the proposed algorithm. In order to verify the recognition algorithm, the asphalt road was recorded and a variety of road surface conditions such as <b>dry,</b> snow, <b>ice</b> and wet was utilized as the input data. First, the road surface condition was distinguished into dry and wet using polarization coefficient, and then the dry condition was distinguished into <b>dry</b> and <b>ice</b> using wavelet and frequency characteristic. As a result of experiment, the possibility of vision-based recognition algorithm of the road surface conditions was demonstrated. In the future, it is expected that a way of road surface control through CCTVs would change from manual to automati...|$|R
