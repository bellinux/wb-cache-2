25|$|The {{concentration}} of {{salt in the}} sample is a factor {{that needs to be}} considered when preparing a MALDI sample as well. Salts can aid a MALDI spectra by preventing aggregation or precipitation while stabilizing the sample. However, interfering signals can be observed due to side reactions of the matrix with the sample, such {{as in the case of}} the matrix interacting with alkali metal ions which can impair the analysis of the spectra. Typically the amount of salt in the matrix only becomes a problem in very high concentrations, such as 1 molar. The problem of having too high a {{concentration of}} salt in the sample can be solved by first running the solution through liquid chromatography to help purify the sample, but this method is time consuming and results in the loss of some of the sample to be analyzed. Another method is focused on purification once the sample solution is deposited onto the sample probe. Many sample probes can be designed to have a membrane on the surface that can selectively bind the sample in question to the probe surface. The surface can then be rinsed off to remove all unnecessary salts or background molecules. The matrix of appropriate salt concentration can then be deposited directly onto the sample on the probe surface and crystallized there. Despite these negative effects of salt concentration, a separate <b>desalting</b> step is usually not necessary in the case of proteins, because the selection of appropriate buffer salts prevents the occurrence of this problem.|$|E
500|$|... (1) Most often, 5'-DMT {{group is}} removed {{at the end}} of the {{oligonucleotide}} chain assembly. The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by <b>desalting.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A major {{application}} for ESI is {{the field of}} protein mass spectrometry. Here, the MS {{is used for the}} identification and sizing of proteins. The identification of a protein sample can be done in an ESI-MS by de novo peptide sequencing (using tandem mass spectrometry) or peptide mass fingerprinting. Both methods require the previous digestion of proteins to peptides, mostly accomplished enzymatically using proteases. As well for the digestion in solution as for the in-gel digestion buffered solutions are needed, whose content in salts is too high and in analyte is too low for a successful ESI-MS measurement. Therefore, a combined <b>desalting</b> and concentration step is performed. Usually a reversed phase liquid chromatography is used, in which the peptides stay bound to the chromatography matrix whereas the salts are removed by washing. The peptides can be eluted from the matrix by the use of a small volume of a solution containing a large portion of organic solvent, which results in the reduction of the final volume of the analyte. In LC-MS the desalting/concentration is realised with a pre-column, in off-line measurements reversed phase micro columns are used, which can be used directly with [...] microliter pipettes. Here, the peptides are eluted with the spray solution containing an appropriate portion of organic solvent. The resulting solution (usually a few microliters)is enriched with the analyte and, after transfer to the spray capillary, can be directly used in the MS.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} <b>desalted</b> seminal plasma (SP) added to semen {{extender}} on hyperactivated motility and protein tyrosine-phosphorylation (PTP) of bull spermatozoa. The SP was harvested by centrifugation and <b>desalted</b> using Sephadex G- 25 columns {{in order to be}} added to semen extender at 0 (control), 2. 5, 12. 5 and 25 mg/ml. Frozen-thawed spermatozoa were incubated with a cellpermeable cyclic AMP (cAMP) analog (cBiMPS) and examined subjectively for hyperactivated motility and for PTP by Western blotting. Although, the added SP sustains sperm motility at all incubation times especially in the presence of cBiMPS but without significant difference from the control samples. Moreover, total sperm motility of 12. 5 and 25 mg/ml in the presence of cBiMPS at 60, 120 and 180 min were similar (P ≥ 0. 05). Surprisingly, cBiMPS-incubated spermatozoa in the presence of <b>desalted</b> SP were capable of exhibiting hyperactivated motility. Addition of SP increased and prolonged intracellular cAMP-induced PTP and in total 21 phosphorylated proteins with molecular weight ranging from 10 to ＞ 230 kDa were detected. The most prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (TPPs) were of 32, 38, 74 and 80 kDa which were more predominant in fertile bulls than subfertile bull. Furthermore, TPPs of 45 and 48 kDa were cBiMPS-dependent in fertile bulls whereas, in subfertile bull the latter was barely detectable and the former was cBiMPS-independent at only 0 min. This increase in PTP not only emphasizing the beneficial roles of <b>desalted</b> SP but excluding any detrimental effect of it on sperm cell functions during storage as well...|$|R

50|$|To {{eliminate}} sample dilution and the {{collecting and}} monitoring of fractions, centrifuge column or plate -based gel filtration, {{also referred to}} as spin <b>desalting,</b> methods are commonly used. Spin <b>desalting</b> is unique in that a centrifuge is used to first clear the void volume of liquid in the resin, followed by sample addition and centrifugation. After centrifugation, the macromolecules in the sample have moved through the column in approximately the same initial volume, but the small molecules have been forced into the pores of the resin and replaced by the buffer that was used to pre-equilibrate the gel-filtration matrix. Spin columns and plates eliminate the need to wait for samples to emerge by gravity flow and require no chromatography system, allowing for multiple-sample processing simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{physicochemical}} and sensorial qualities of salmon, tuna and <b>desalted</b> >bacalao>, thinly sliced as carpaccios, {{and subjected to}} 15 -min of continuous pressure and pulsed pressure in three 5 -min steps (200 - 300  MPa at 7  °C). Pressurization of salmon and tuna gave rise {{to an increase in}} the shear strength of carpaccios, a reduction of the water and lipid binding properties and an increase in the total colour difference. Though these changes were also detected by the sensory panel, the resulting pressurized products obtained high scores for acceptability. <b>Desalted</b> >bacalao> carpaccio was more stable under high pressure and sensory analysis revealed that in most treatments the raw attributes had been retained. The results obtained by applying pressure in one or three consecutive cycles were, in general, the same. High-pressure treatment was shown to be an adequate tool for obtaining high-quality <b>desalted</b> >bacalao> carpaccio, whereas salmon and tuna suffered a loss of raw attributes. However the resulting products acquired new sensory features which were highly accepted by the sensory panel. Industrial relevance: Nowadays, there is a growing interest in consuming raw or minimally processed foods and among fishery products, carpaccio are becoming increasingly popular. The present work deals with the effect of high pressure on the physico-chemical and sensory attributes of carpaccios made from salmon, tuna, and <b>desalted</b> >bacalao>. High pressure may be an adequate tool to obtain high quality carpaccio or carpaccio-like products, as the products acquired new sensory features which were highly accepted by the sensory panel. From the industry viewpoint the application of high pressure to fish carpaccios may be appealing in a two way: firstly, the resulting carpaccio are presumably free of parasites and present a better microbiological quality, thereby increasing the shelf-life. Secondly, products may acquire new sensory attributes that can be very appreciated by consumers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
