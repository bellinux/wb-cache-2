Because unauthorized access may cause serious problems, security and privacy with MCC have become significant issues. This paper addresses the secrecy dimming capacity of secure transmission in MCC over visible light communication (VLC) channels. By obtaining the entropy-maximizing symbol probability of multiple light emitting diode- (LED-) based pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), mathematical analysis of the secrecy dimming capacity of VLC was derived. Simulation results show that the secure transmission ability of multi-LED-based VLC is determined according to the number of activated LEDs and target <b>dimming</b> <b>level.</b> This can be a guideline for practical VLC-based mobile network designers intending to secure wireless transmission and to decide on the number of activated LEDs at target <b>dimming</b> <b>level</b> to operate...|$|E

Currently, PCs and OSs provide color selection windows that can obtain the RGB or HSL color coordinates of a user’s selection. Mixed light sources are usually composed of LEDs in the primary colors, with LEDs in auxiliary colors such as white and yellow used in a few cases. When using auxiliary color LEDs, the number of LED inputs, the <b>dimming</b> <b>levels,</b> is larger than the number of elements in the color coordinate, which causes an under-determined problem.

However, {{most of the research}} efforts in this area only consider scenarios where the light emitted from the transmitters is constant. This is not true when Smart Lighting, a technology designed for more comfortable and energy efficient buildings by adjusting the illumination of fixtures based on ambient light availability, is involved. Under the smart lighting, the changes of fixtures’ illumination affect the communication links significantly. Therefore, new methods must be proposed for a revolutionary co-design of smart lighting and communication for the visible light networks. This project proposes SmartVLC, a system that can optimize the through- put (benefit communication) while maintaining the LEDs’ primary illumin- ation function (benefit smart lighting). A new modulation scheme Adaptive Multiple Pulse Position Modulation (AMPPM) is proposed to support fine- grained dimming levels and optimize the throughput under each <b>dimming</b> <b>level</b> via pattern multiplexing. An algorithm is also designed to adjust the LEDs’ <b>dimming</b> <b>level</b> smoothly. The proposed AMPPM and the LEDs’ il- lumination adaptation algorithm are implemented into a low-cost platform.

The current version of SmartVLC supports a communication dis- tance of 3. 6 m and a throughput of 107 Kbps in an indoor environment.
