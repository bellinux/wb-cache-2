40|$|Humans {{have been}} {{sheltering}} {{themselves from the}} harsh elements of their surroundings to maintain comfort since {{the discovery of the}} hearth. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution came innovations that made mitigating external conditions convenient and easy. The standard 70 degree Fahrenheit, with 30 -candle-feet of illumination, 30 - 50 % humidity, and ventilation became the norm and is replicated and placed regardless of existing conditions, creating homogeneous environments. Our conventional conception of the relationship between architecture and the environment is based on <b>false</b> <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> reside comfortably in the standard air-conditioned 70 degrees, effectively producing desensitizing spaces. For a body to understand and experience space, it is important for these environments to have an atmospheric affect that is absorbed through the senses. Architecture is then seen as a stimulus by provoking and challenging the body and creating a consciousness of body and environment. This thesis states that the sensorial appreciation in architecture can be explored through sequenced and curated experiences of architecture to use, amplify and appease the senses. This creates new atmospheric conditions conceived of relative sequencing and juxtapositions, rather than appeasing and mediating the existing environment. This idea is explored through three interventions on the Harvard Bridge in Boston, Massachusetts that seeks to engage the hostile environmental conditions. by Rena Yang. Thesis: M.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of {{internal and external}} validity, developed by Norman Campbell, are widely used to structure methodological thinking about social research. This article points to ambiguities {{in the interpretation of}} those terms, both as regards the relationships they refer to as well as the sort of object that is held to be capable of internal and external validity. In addition, it is suggested that the distinction between these types of validity is fundamentally misleading because it reflects a failure to distinguish relations between events and relations between variables. It also rests on the <b>false</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can separate the discovery of causal relationships from the question of whether these apply to other cases than the ones studied. In the final section, an alternative conceptualisation of validity is sketched, one that avoids the problems identified...|$|R

5000|$|G. Stolzenberg {{responded to}} Keisler's Notices criticisms of Bishop's review in a letter, also {{published}} in The Notices. Stolzenberg {{points out that}} the criticism of Bishop's review of Keisler's calculus book is based on the <b>false</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> they were made in a constructivist mindset, whereas, since it was obvious that it was a contribution to classical mathematics, Bishop read it as it of course was meant to be read: in a classical mindset. Keisler et al's claim that Bishop read his book in a constructivist mindset is simply false. And his insistence in The Notices that, because of this, Bishop should not have been permitted to review his book (inviting a teetotaler to judge wine) is simply slander. Indeed, all this vituperative criticism of Bishop is based on a <b>false</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> Bishop could not and did not review Keisler's book with a classical mathematics mindset.|$|R

50|$|Cliometrics has had sharp critics. Boldizzoni {{summarized}} {{a common}} critique {{by arguing that}} cliometrics {{is based on the}} <b>false</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the laws of neo-classical economics always apply to human activity. Those laws, he says, are based on rational choice and maximization as they operate in well-developed markets, and do not apply to economies other than those of the capitalist West in the modern era. Instead, Boldizzoni argues that the workings of economies are determined by social, political and cultural conditions specific to each society and time period.|$|R

40|$|Both Kymlicka and Patten {{argue that}} the equal {{treatment}} of different national groups require that the state officially recognize the right of each to create its own autonomous government. After carefully examining their arguments, I show that they both make the <b>false</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that,</b> in a multinational state, the state belongs only to the majority group but not the minority, and that a multination state can never treat minority groups equally. Both claims are inherently anti-pluralistic. Thus, the equal treatment of different national cultures does not require that each be granted the right to self-government...|$|R
