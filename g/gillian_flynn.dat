The novel's author <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> was engaged to write the screenplay. Witherspoon produced the film version along with Leslie Dixon, Bruna Papandrea, and Ceán Chaffin. Witherspoon {{was drawn to the}} script because of its strong female character and its use of multiple perspectives and non-linear structure. In May 2013, it was announced that David Fincher was brought on as director, with Ben Affleck cast as Nick and Rosamund Pike in the role of Amy. New Regency and Fox agreed to co-finance the film. The film was released October 3, 2014.|$|E
500|$|As for the {{mainstream}} media, the reviews {{for the pilot}} were mixed. <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly commented that, given that the case was about a serial killer, the pilot did not show the math in an original way. John Leonard of the New York Magazine called the cast [...] "superb" [...] but criticized the pilot for being too busy. Melanie McFarland, the Seattle Post-Intelligencers TV critic, asserts that the pilot's storyline was an [...] "unfortunate choice" [...] for the pilot episode. Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that the pilot's storyline was unoriginal. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, stated that the pilot and the cast were excellent but that the math was uninteresting.|$|E

500|$|Later reviews {{analyzed}} {{the departure of}} Diane Chambers {{and the end of}} her relationship with Sam Malone. <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> from Entertainment Weekly called Sam and Diane's breakup in this episode one of the [...] "all-time best breakup scenes" [...] in history. David Hofstede in the guide 5000 Episodes and No Commercials and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk found Diane's departure poorly done. Jane Boursaw from Huffington Post and Amy K. Bredemeyer from The Talking Box blog called the wedding of Sam and Diane one of their favorite [...] "weddings that [...] happen". IGN placed it as number one of the top ten Cheers episodes. UGO.com called Sam and Diane's breakup from this episode one of [...] "the most horrible [...] breakups." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics, however, did {{not respond}} well to the episode. Andrew Billen of The Times thought that the episode was [...] "not as stylish, {{intelligent}} or classy as it hopes" [...] and [...] "about as subtle as Times Square". He called Close's performance [...] "not remotely credible but impressive in a Norma Desmond way" [...] and labeled Byrne as [...] "particularly unstriking". Brian Lowry gave the pilot a lukewarm review for Variety. He praised the [...] "solid cast" [...] and [...] "smart dialogue", but felt that [...] "the template feels a little too familiar ... moreover, it's fuzzy how long the show's mystery will persist". Entertainment Weeklys <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> graded the episode as a C, criticizing the characters' lack of logic and the [...] "many ludicrous scenes". She thought the storylines to be overcomplicated and called Byrne [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "inexpressive".|$|E
500|$|In 2007 and 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel {{short series}} As the Bell Rings. Lovato auditioned for the channel's {{television}} film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles. Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock. The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9million viewers. Its soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, {{the music was}} considered less current than that of High School Musical. <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and she [...] "has the knee-jerk smile {{of someone who is}} often told she has a great smile". Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including [...] "We Rock" [...] and [...] "This Is Me". That summer, she began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut album and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly named Arrested Development {{the best}} {{television}} show of 2005 {{and said in}} her review that [...] "As oddball as Arrested is, it's also humane. A flawless cast—from Will Arnett's breathy, bombastic Gob to Jessica Walter's boozy Lucille—grounds it, aided by Ron Howard's affable narration. Of course, the center of sensibility is good son Michael (Jason Bateman) and his even better son, George Michael (Michael Cera). Bateman and Cera give the best reacts around—the former all weary exasperation, the latter adorably bunny-stunned. Together, they're the sweetest, awkwardest straight men on the smartest, most shockingly funny series on TV...which is likely canceled, despite six Emmy wins. It's a perversion not even the Bluths deserve." [...] In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at No. 2 in the [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years", praising its [...] "fast, delirious, interlocking jokes that don't pander to the masses; winky gags (e.g. fake preview scenes for the following week's episode); and a cast of absurd characters".|$|E
500|$|He starred as {{psychiatrist}} Craig [...] "Huff" [...] Huffstodt in the Showtime {{drama series}} Huff, which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes. Azaria {{served as an}} executive producer {{on the show and}} directed an episode of its second season. After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff's friend Russell Tupper. Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it [...] "was tough to marry our visions all the time, [...] we both cared so much about it that neither of us were willing to let go." [...] <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria [...] "impressively subtle" [...] in the role, while John Leonard of New York magazine said he was a [...] "shrewd bit of casting." [...] The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.|$|E
500|$|The show debuted on August 29, 2005 to an {{estimated}} audience of 10.5 million viewers. Fox had not seen such success for summertime Monday numbers since Melrose Place and Ally McBeal aired in September 1998. The premiere was ranked first in both the 18–49 and 18–34 demographics. The strong debut performance was also matched by various positive reviews. According to The New York Times, Prison Break was [...] "more intriguing {{than most of the}} new network series, and it certainly {{is one of the most}} original", complimenting its ability to create a [...] "suspenseful thriller" [...] and its [...] "authentic look". <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it as one of the best new shows of 2005. On the other hand, The Washington Post criticized the show for its [...] "somber pretentiousness" [...] and [...] "uniformly overwrought" [...] performances. Due to its ratings success, Fox decided to extend Prison Break by an extra nine episodes, making it the first new series in the 2005–2006 television season to receive a full season order of 22 episodes. The series averaged 9.2 million viewers per week in its first season.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} of the show {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics, with <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly ranking it the greatest television season of 2007-2008. In his review of the season, Robert Canning of IGN said that this season was [...] "smart, funny and thoroughly entertaining". He also praised many of the guest stars who appeared throughout the season. Regarding the main cast, Canning wrote that [...] "the regulars all seemed to up their game in this second season", particularly praising Fey's portrayal of Liz Lemon, calling her [...] "the heart of the show." [...] Canning ranked the season 8.9 out of 10. John Kubicek of BuddyTV felt that the series had [...] "learned from its mistakes and now knows {{what works and what}} doesn't". He praised the main cast, and also thought that the supporting cast had been refined. Kubicek enjoyed Tracy's pairing with Kenneth, and Jenna's subplot, as he felt actress Krakowski was the weakest link from the first season. Alistair Harkness of The Scotsman described the season as [...] "hilarious and absurd", and wrote that [...] "each character's personality is to the forefront in a way not seen since the heyday of Seinfeld". Harkness said the writing was sharp and the jokes were magnificent, [...] "with plenty of quotable dialogue", but felt [...] "what's truly heartening is that it's the regular cast that carries the comedy".

500|$|... "Casino Night" [...] {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from television critics. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad stated that [...] "This episode, the season finale, was, in a word, brilliant. You could {{not ask for}} {{a better way to}} tie up story lines that occurred {{over the course of a}} season while opening up new ones at the same time." [...] Sciannamea went on to praise Carell's writing, as well as the progression of the relationship arcs in the show. Brian Zoromski of IGN said that [...] "'Casino Night,' was full of great character development, awkward situations and laugh-out-loud moments." [...] Zoromski enjoyed the unfolding of the Jim-Pam relationship during the latter half of season two, and the climax of it in the season finale. [...] He also enjoyed and praised the development of two minor characters, Kevin Malone and Creed Bratton, the latter played by the actor of the same name. He ultimately awarded the episode a ten out of ten, denoting a [...] "Masterpiece". Jacob Cliffton of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an [...] "A". <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly noted that, unlike other shows that featured resolved sexual tension, The Office was in no worry of being cancelled. She based this deduction on the fact that the show [...] "isn't based entirely on the endearing flirtation between" [...] Jim and Pam. In a 2011 poll conducted by fansite OfficeTally, fans voted [...] "Casino Night" [...] as their favorite of all Office episodes that had been aired at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{critical}} {{reception of}} Don was mixed. [...] <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly said that Morrow’s performance was “with full CSI-inspired stoicism”. [...] Melanie McFarland, TV {{critic for the}} Seattle Post-Intelligencer, stated that Don was not an original character as of the pilot. [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, called Morrow, as Don, “likable”. [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that, although Don did not come across as an obvious choice of role for Morrow, Morrow was excellent as Don.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> is {{a former}} writer for Entertainment Weekly who wrote two popular novels prior to Gone Girl — Sharp Objects and Dark Places. [...] Gone Girl is her best selling book to date. Her other two books were about people {{incapable}} of making commitments, but in this novel, she tried to depict the ultimate commitment, marriage: [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} marriage told as a he-said, she-said story, and told by two narrators who were perhaps not to be trusted." [...] Flynn has also described marriage as [...] "the ultimate mystery." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the second}} season, {{critical}} reception warmed. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post and noted critic Alan Sepinwall remained ambivalent towards the show; otherwise critics were uniformly positive. In particular, several critics noted improvements from season one. <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "Big Love has dropped {{the last vestiges of}} its ostentatious quirkiness and fashioned {{itself into a}} rich and grounded family drama," [...] and Diane Werts of Newsday said that [...] "'Big Love' does more this year than you might expect, and more richly, more provocatively, more dramatically and amusingly, too." [...] The second season was cited among the best shows of 2007 by numerous publications, including PopMatters, the San Francisco Chronicle, Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly and NPR.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times likens <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> to {{acclaimed}} suspense novelist Patricia Highsmith. Gone Girl, the Times {{goes on to}} say, is Flynn's [...] "dazzling breakthrough," [...] {{adding that}} the novel is [...] "wily, mercurial, subtly layered and populated by characters so well imagined that they’re hard to part with." [...] A USA Today review focuses on bookseller enthusiasm for the book, quoting a Jackson, Mississippi store manager saying, [...] "It will make your head spin off." [...] People Magazines review found the novel [...] "a delectable summer read" [...] that burrows [...] "deep into the murkiest corners of the human psyche." [...] A Chatelaine review commends the novel's suspense, its intricately detailed plot {{and the way it}} keeps the reader [...] "unnervingly off balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Bianco from USA Today {{considered}} Frasier Crane masculine in {{the days}} of [...] "Fred Astaire and William Powell" [...] instead of recent [...] "beer-belching" [...] days of the reality show, Survivor. Bianco found series of Frasier's love life repetitive and [...] "tiring". <b>Gillian</b> <b>Flynn</b> from Entertainment Weekly considered Frasier Crane's [...] "diction" [...] an inspiration of Fringes Walter Bishop (John Noble), who has an addition of [...] "daffiness" [...] of roles portrayed by actor Christopher Lloyd. Joe Sixpack, a pseudonymous name for writer Don Russell, called Frasier an [...] "insufferable twerp". An internet user from Ken Levine's blog considered Frasier a successor to more prestigious, experienced Bostonian medical doctor and surgeon Charles Winchester (David Ogden Stiers) from the television series M*A*S*H. However, Levine did not acknowledge it when Frasier was the new character in Cheers in 1984. (Coincidentally, in the Frasier episode [...] "Fathers and Son" [...] (2003), actor Stiers, portrayer of Winchester, appears as Hester Crane's former lab assistant Leland Barton, who is suspected as Frasier and Niles' biological father.) ...|$|E
