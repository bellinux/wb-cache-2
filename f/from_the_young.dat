5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Chris Engen began portraying Adam as an adult. After {{a year in}} the role, Engen {{announced}} his exit <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> and the Restless because of objections over his storyline, and Michael Muhney was recast in the role. Controversy arose two weeks after Muhney's debut when Adam seduced male character Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman). The media accused Engen of homophobia, but the actor dispelled these rumors, saying he was unhappy with his storyline long before the homosexuality plot twist was aired. In 2013, Muhney was fired from the role and made his last appearance on January 30, 2014; later that year, Justin Hartley was cast as Adam, who portrayed Adam for an additional two years before vacating the role on September 1, 2016.|$|E

5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a number of {{commercial}} and public art galleries; including the newly expanded Whitechapel Gallery. The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern British art, including the White Cube gallery, with many artists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> British Artists movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with many former residents now driven out by higher property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|E
5|$|The cast was rounded out by W. Earl Brown, {{who played}} Gale Weather's {{cameraman}} Kenny; Joseph Whipp, who portrayed Sheriff Burke; Lawrence Hecht as Neil Prescott (Sidney's father); and C.W. Morgan as Hank Loomis (Billy's father). Liev Schreiber {{appeared in a}} minor role as Cotton Weary, the framed killer of Sidney's mother and Linda Blair made a brief cameo as a TV reporter outside the school. Henry Winkler appeared as Principal Himbry, an aggressive school principal. He remained uncredited so as to not draw attention away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> main cast.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept was}} based on an {{imaginary}} friend Spielberg created after his parents' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled sci-fi horror film project Night Skies. It was filmed from September to December 1981 in California on a budget of US$10.5 million. Unlike most films, it was shot in rough chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> cast.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark for {{the emergence of a new}} Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Newman is {{a fictional}} {{character}} <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network. Created by William J. Bell, {{she is currently}} portrayed by Amelia Heinle. Victoria was born onscreen in 1982 and was portrayed by child actress Ashley Nicole Millan for her first eight years. Having been rapidly aged to a teenager, Victoria returned to the soap opera and was portrayed by Heather Tom. Tom portrayed the character into her early adult years and remained in the role for twelve years. Due to creative differences, Tom left the soap opera in 2003 and Heinle, who took over on March 21, 2005, was cast in the role.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans {{exhibit a}} number of larval forms, of which the {{earliest}} and most characteristic is the nauplius. This has three pairs of appendages, all emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the zoea (pl. zoeæ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed {{it to be a}} separate species. It follows the nauplius stage and precedes the post-larva. Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic appendages, as opposed to nauplii, which use cephalic appendages, and megalopa, which use abdominal appendages for swimming. It often has spikes on its carapace, which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming. In many decapods, due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.|$|E

5|$|Mario and Princess Peach {{are walking}} {{together}} when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to help, Bowser Jr. appears, {{sneaking up on}} the Princess from behind and kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches {{up to them and}} confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Koopa's clutches. At {{the end of the first}} world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{was elected}} Bishop of Bath in late April 1173, and was consecrated 23 June 1174. However, Henry the Young King {{challenged}} the election, {{on the grounds}} of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174 with Walter Map alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois wrote him a letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Newman is {{a fictional}} {{character}} <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network, currently portrayed by Sharon Case. Created by William J. Bell as a love interest for Nicholas Newman, the character debuted on March 24, 1994. Before Case {{took over in}} September 1994, the character was portrayed briefly by Monica Potter and then by Heidi Mark. When first introduced, Sharon {{was a young girl}} from the poor side of town. Nick and Sharon married, had a son named Noah, and later won custody of Cassie, the child a teenaged Sharon had given up for adoption. Their marriage faced a number of problems, including infidelity on both sides. Following Cassie's death in an automobile accident, Nick cheated on Sharon with Phyllis Summers, resulting in a pregnancy which ended their 11-year marriage.|$|E

5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulation}} included 3,500 Canadian Army members, representing all of Winnipeg's units, {{making it}} the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point. The defending forces were commanded by Colonels E. A. Pridham and D. S. McKay. Troops were drawn from the 18th (Manitoba) Armoured Car Regiment, No. 10 District Engineers and Signals, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, the Winnipeg Grenadiers, the Winnipeg Light Infantry, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, Veteran's Guard of Canada (including over 300 veterans of the First World War), {{and a number of}} reserve and civilian groups. The 'Nazi' troops were volunteers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Men's Board of Trade, using uniforms rented from Hollywood and with painted sabre scars on their faces. They were commanded by Erich von Neurenberg. Approximately $3,000 was spent on the event.|$|E
