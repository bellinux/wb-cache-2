60|$|Hodder {{had lost}} his way, yet a hand had been held out to him, and he seized it. With {{a sense of being}} led, psychically as well as physically, he {{followed}} Mr. Bentley into a large bedroom, where a high, four-posted bed lifted a pleated canopy toward the ceiling. And after he had washed his hands they entered a dining-room looking out upon a little yard in the rear, which had been transformed into a garden. Roses, morning glories, and nasturtiums were growing against the walls; a <b>hose</b> <b>lay</b> coiled upon the path; the bricks, baked during the day, were splashed with water; the leaves and petals were wet, and the acrid odour of moist earth, mingling with perfumes, penetrated the room. Hodder paused in the window.|$|E
60|$|After the smashing of the City Hall and Post-Office, {{the white}} flag had been hoisted from {{a tower of}} the old Park Row building, and thither had gone Mayor O'Hagen, urged thither indeed by the terror-stricken {{property}} owners of lower New York, to negotiate the capitulation with Von Winterfeld. The Vaterland, having dropped the secretary by a rope ladder, remained hovering, circling very slowly above the great buildings, old and new, that clustered round City Hall Park, while the Helmholz, which had done the fighting there, rose overhead to a height of perhaps two thousand feet. So Bert had a near view of all that occurred in that central place. The City Hall and Court House, the Post-Office and a mass of buildings {{on the west side}} of Broadway, had been badly damaged, and the three former were a heap of blackened ruins. In the case of the first two the loss of life had not been considerable, but a great multitude of workers, including many girls and women, had been caught in the destruction of the Post-Office, and a little army of volunteers with white badges entered behind the firemen, bringing out the often still living bodies, for the most part frightfully charred, and carrying them into the big Monson building close at hand. Everywhere the busy firemen were directing their bright streams of water upon the smouldering masses: their <b>hose</b> <b>lay</b> about the square, and long cordons of police held back the gathering black masses of people, chiefly from the east side, from these central activities.|$|E

At the starting signal, competitors must run a distance of about 25 ft to the dressing area where they must don firefighter's gear. After they are all dressed, they then must complete a task together in their gear such as a <b>hose</b> <b>lay</b> (see above) or simply run to a finish line, or the [...] "firetruck".

50|$|Depending {{on where}} the engine is stationed, it may carry as much as twice the {{national}} standard in fire hose. In areas where there is rugged terrain that keeps engines from driving directly to the fire, large <b>hose</b> <b>lays</b> are installed to transport water to the fire area. In desert areas with moderate terrain, less hose is used as {{it is easier to}} access the fire. Often the technique of pump-and-roll is used where the vehicle drives with the pump engaged while a firefighter uses a hose to spray water on the fire. This technique allows a team of two to flank the perimeter of a fire.|$|R

60|$|The {{first time}} I ever saw David {{was on the}} sward behind the Baby's Walk. He was a missel-thrush, {{attracted}} thither that hot day by a <b>hose</b> which <b>lay</b> on the ground sending forth a gay trickle of water, and David was {{on his back in}} the water, kicking up his legs. He used to enjoy being told of this, having forgotten all about it, and gradually it all came back to him, with a number of other incidents that had escaped my memory, though I remember that he was eventually caught by the leg with a long string and a cunning arrangement of twigs near the Round Pond. He never tires of this story, but I notice that it is now he who tells it to me rather than I to him, and when we come to the string he rubs his little leg as if it still smarted.|$|R
5000|$|After planting, {{placing a}} {{circumference}} of mulch surrounding plants functions to lessen evaporation. To do this, firmly press {{two to four}} inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents water runoff. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary. Additionally, to conserve {{the maximum amount of}} water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation. Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system. Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period. These systems use 30 - 50% less water than conventional methods. Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%. [...] They connect to a garden <b>hose</b> and <b>lay</b> along the row of plants under a layer of mulch. A layer of organic material added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with compost.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Movement Studies)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Fire {{fighting}} {{is a dangerous}} occupation {{that is associated with}} a large amount of physical fitness, education, nutrition and overall wellness. Volunteer fire fighters participate in fire occupation at less frequent intervals and require more physical activity to be able to perform fire related tasks such as <b>hose</b> <b>lays,</b> ladder placement, patient rescue, efficiently. Physical activity plays a vital role in achieving the fitness required to perform fire related tasks and using behavioral modification is used promote increased time being physically active. This was an experimental single subject research design that used exercise logs, implementation worksheets to log activity and inactivity minutes {{over the course of a}} 12 week period of time. Subjects were screened for health risks using the ACSM physical activity readiness questionnaire. Information recorded on exercise logs and implementation intention worksheets were used in order to establish how much time the subjects were spending being active or inactive. Activity was classified using the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) and any exercise that was 3. 5 - 10 MET was classified as appropriate exercise that could be recorded. To help classify exercise further, a compendium of exercise containing MET examples was given to both of the study participants. There were two volunteer fire fighter subjects in the study and both completed the 12 week experimental period. The major finding of this study was that using preintentional motivation, a behavioral modification technique; one could increase the amount of activity and reduce the amount of inactivity that a volunteer fire fighter participated in over the course of experimentation. There were two types of preintentional movtivation used in this study. Treatment B required the usage of implementation intention worksheets in conjunction with an exercise log to keep track of minutes being active or inactive. Treatment C required the usage of implementation intention worksheets, exercise logs and meeting with an exercise professional two times during that experimental phase. Treatment B showed to be more effective when increasing activity minutes and reducing inactivity minutes. With more subjects to test the program and usage of physiological markers such as body fat analysis or weight loss/gain or VO 2 max testing to assess true physiological gain, more validity to results may more clearly be identified.

50|$|The Motorized {{version of}} these events are very similar, except that the racing trucks begin from a {{starting}} line {{at the head of}} the track, loaded with all the racing team members. After racing down the track a specific distance, the truck either stops at the hydrant (for the Class-B event Motor Pump) to hook up and pump from the hydrant, as other team members run down the track with the nozzle, or (in the case of Class-B and Class-C racers) slows to let off team members to hook up one end of the hose to the hydrant, then races down the track, <b>laying</b> <b>hose</b> as it goes, until it reaches a point where it has to stop again to let off the nozzlemen who continue to hook up the nozzle, then wait for water so that they can hit the target.|$|R
25|$|Workers plan to pump {{water into}} turbine condensers, but need to pump {{water out of}} them first. Work to {{transfer}} water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are <b>laying</b> <b>hoses</b> to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.|$|R
