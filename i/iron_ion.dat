25|$|Rubredoxin is an electron-carrier {{found in}} sulfur-metabolizing {{bacteria}} and archaea. The active site contains an <b>iron</b> <b>ion</b> coordinated by the sulfur atoms of four cysteine residues forming an almost regular tetrahedron. Rubredoxins perform one-electron transfer processes. The oxidation {{state of the}} iron atom changes between the +2 and +3 states. In both oxidation states the metal is high spin, which helps to minimize structural changes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>iron</b> <b>ion</b> may {{be either}} in the Fe2+ or in the Fe3+ state, but ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin) (Fe3+) cannot bind oxygen. In binding, oxygen {{temporarily}} and reversibly oxidizes (Fe2+) to (Fe3+) while oxygen temporarily turns into the superoxide ion, thus iron must exist in the +2 oxidation state to bind oxygen. If superoxide ion associated to Fe3+ is protonated, the hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and incapable of binding oxygen. In such cases, the enzyme methemoglobin reductase {{will be able to}} eventually reactivate methemoglobin by reducing the iron center.|$|E
2500|$|A {{heme group}} {{consists}} of an iron (Fe) ion (charged atom) held in a heterocyclic ring, known as a porphyrin. This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules cyclically linked together (by methine bridges) with the <b>iron</b> <b>ion</b> bound in the center. The <b>iron</b> <b>ion,</b> which {{is the site of}} oxygen binding, coordinates with the four nitrogen atoms {{in the center of the}} ring, which all lie in one plane. The iron is bound strongly (covalently) to the globular protein via the N atoms of the imidazole ring of F8 histidine residue (also known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, completing the octahedral group of six ligands. Oxygen binds in an [...] "end-on bent" [...] geometry where one oxygen atom binds to Fe and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.|$|E

40|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>ions</b> are {{essential}} components of numerous cell processes. Their utilisation is strictly regulated, since any impairment can have devastating {{effect on the}} cell. In living organisms, <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> are bound to proteins, for storage, transportation, or as {{a vital part of}} catalytic centers of enzymes. Transportation of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> between different compartments is important for the correct function of the cell. It was recently shown on yeast, how a mitochondrial transporter of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> is essential for the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters of enzymes. This work aims to describe the localization and function of a homologous protein of a parasitical organism Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. This parasite is entirely dependent on uptake of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> from its host and therefore the utilization of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> is studied as a potential therapeutic target. This work is focused on the characterization of protein Mcp 17, which is assumed to function as a transporter of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> into the mitochondria of T. brucei. Utilizing expression of marked Mcp 17, the transporter was confirmed to be localized on the mitochondrial membrane of the cell. Measuring of enzyme activity of selected enzymes indicated that cells with inhibited expression of the gene mcp 17 [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} {{spectra of}} iron observed using a Grimm-type glow discharge in argon, argon with 0. 3 % v/v hydrogen and neon were studied to identify major excitation and ionization processes of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> in the plasma. Transition rate diagrams are given for <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> in those discharges. These are particularly useful for describing {{situations in which}} the rate of radiative decay of excited states is comparable to or exceeds the rate of their collisional de-excitation. Relationships between transition rate diagrams and Boltzmann plots are discussed. The following processes were identified {{to be responsible for}} excitation of Fe II glow discharge spectra: charge transfer from argon/neon ions to ground state- and metastable iron atoms, Penning excitation of ground state- and metastable <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> by argon metastables and collisional excitation by electrons of metastable <b>iron</b> <b>ions.</b> No evidence was found that local thermodynamic equilibrium exists for <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> in a glow discharge plasma in any interval of excitation energies.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} the effect of saturating starches from different botanical origins with <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> on selected physicochemical properties of the resulting modified starch. Native and modified starches were determined for amylose, protein, fat, and phosphorus content as well as water binding capacity and solubility in water. In addition, the number of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> was assayed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The thermal properties of samples were also examined using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Flow curves were plotted and described using the Ostwald de Waele model, {{and the degree of}} paste structure recovery was determined. Samples enriched with <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> were treated thermally and radical generation in the starch structure was assayed by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). AAS analysis proved the presence of <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> in the investigated modified starch preparations. The results achieved established that enriching starch with <b>iron</b> <b>ions</b> affected the rheological and thermal properties of starch preparations. However, the extent and nature of these changes depended on the botanical origin of the starch.
