[...] Believing it inevitable that they would break up, Will turns her down, as her superstar status would mean he could never really escape the pain of losing her, and having it happen a third time would crush him.

She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has {{a lot of things going}} on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again.

500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'" [...] In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that [...] "We just celebrated the fourth of July, which <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Puppo's {{belief that}} there is no {{anatomical}} relationship between the vagina and clitoris is contrasted by the general belief among researchers that vaginal orgasms are the result of clitoral stimulation; they maintain that clitoral tissue extends, or is at least likely stimulated by the clitoral bulbs, even in the area most commonly reported to be the G-spot. [...] "My view is that the G-spot <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> the extension of the clitoris {{on the inside of the}} vagina, analogous to the base of the male penis," [...] said researcher Amichai Kilchevsky. Because female fetal development is the [...] "default" [...] direction of fetal development in the absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore the penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones, Kilchevsky believes {{that there is no}} evolutionary reason why females would have two separate structures capable of producing orgasms and blames the porn industry and [...] "G-spot promoters" [...] for [...] "encouraging the myth" [...] of a distinct G-spot.|$|E

The original Japanese version of the cipher uses the syllable-based kana system of writing where each symbol represents a combination of [...] "consonant + vowel" [...] or simply a vowel. Certain keywords are not translated into Al Bhed in the game, to give the impression of use of loanwords compared to modern foreign languages. Most keywords are proper nouns, but some common nouns also are not translated, such as [...] "fiend" [...] (e.g. Y fiend! Eh risyh teckieca! [...] ). Alexander Smith, decided to [...] "map common phonemes in English to common phonemes in Welsh" [...] and gave preference to Welsh pronunciations, but had to work with new diphthongs to maintain consistency in the Al Bhed language.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Rohit Bhatnagar {{writing for}} Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, {{and thought that}} the film was [...] "definitely a one time watch", and concluded, that the film deserves a watch but [...] "only for amazing {{performances}} and nothing else". A reviewer for Bollywood Hungama giving the same rating to the film commented that Dear Zindagi was [...] "a slow-paced cerebral and contemporary slice of life tale about the challenges today's generation of girls face in a rapidly shifting landscape". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times rated the film 2 out of 5 stars, and wrote, [...] "There {{is a lot of}} banter in the film that is supposed to be deep and philosophical but <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> plain, hollow banter", and concluded, that the film [...] "could-have-been-amazing". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave it a negative review and summed up her review by writing that the [...] "film could have been a solid drama with emotional heft but despite great performances by the two stars, the feature remains strictly boiler-plate".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and was {{directed}} by The Mentalist veteran David M. Barrett. Guest actor Giancarlo Esposito made his second appearance in the series as Magic Mirror/Sidney Glass. Meghan Ory returned as Ruby/Red Riding Hood, while Scott Heindl made his only appearance for the series as Bartholomew. Leading up to the episode broadcast, Kitsis and Horowitz noted that [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] would feature consequences of events {{that occurred in the}} previous episode. Horowitz explained, [...] "Emma is in a raw emotional place, trying {{to come to terms with}} her feelings about what she discovered about Graham. Graham is also in a very raw emotional place because he's clearly conflicted and it's this cauldron of emotions that leads to the kiss." [...] Kitsis added that, [...] "We're really excited that the kiss that you've seen <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> the jumping off point of the story we're telling. It's not like it ends with the kiss, it starts with that and it takes us somewhere that we're excited to show you." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{stressed}} that {{a knowledge of}} Macbeth was not necessary to enjoy the episode. [...] "Knowing the text", suggested Jack Seale of Radio Times, [...] "will take you only halfway and, in any case, the clever plot <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> a vehicle for characters sketched fully {{in only a few}} lines, and a torrent of fruity luvvie gags about jealousy, superstition and stage-hogging hams." [...] Dessau agreed, saying that [...] "ou don't need to be a literary scholar to get the gags". Critic Jane Simon, writing in the Daily Mirror, suggested that [...] "even a hazy knowledge of the Scottish play will tip you the wink what might lie ahead". David Chater in The Times and an anonymous reviewer in the Sunday Herald both praised the plot's divergence from Shakespeare, with the latter saying that [...] "the script cleverly offers parallels with The Scottish Play, just to whip them away again". Dessau felt that the complex plot meant that the guest stars did [...] "not get quite as much screen time as they deserve", but that this was no complaint, as it was [...] "very much Pemberton and Shearsmith's instalment and they are both brilliant".|$|E

500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> a mental trick to block out the [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E

2500|$|In the DS {{version of}} the game, AI {{problems}} were again mentioned, the player's allies [...] " [...] around like a Hobbit with its head cut off".

2500|$|Stevan Harnad {{argues that}} Searle's [...] "Strong AI" [...] <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>just</b> {{another name for}} {{functionalism}} and computationalism, and that these positions are the real targets of his critique. Functionalists argue that consciousness {{can be defined as}} a set of informational processes inside the brain. It follows that anything that carries out the same informational processes as a human is also conscious. Thus, if we wrote a computer program that was conscious, we could run that computer program on, say, a system of ping-pong balls and beer cups and the system would be equally conscious, because it was running the same information processes.|$|E
