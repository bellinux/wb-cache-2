Among those who have played in 100 career games in NFL history, no player <b>has</b> <b>averaged</b> more receiving yards per game than Johnson. Johnson's average of 86.1 receiving yards per game is 8.7 yards better than the next-closest player on that list, Torry Holt.

5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run <b>has</b> <b>averaged</b> about 5,300.|$|E
