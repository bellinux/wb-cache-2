25|$|Discharge of an {{electric}} organ begins with central command from a medullary pacemaker that determines the frequency and rhythm of EODs. These two characteristics (frequency and rhythm) of EODs are {{also referred to as}} SPI- sequence of pulse intervals. The command from medullary pacemaker is then passed on by spinal <b>electromotor</b> neurons to electrocytes forming the electric organ, which determine the waveform of the EODs based on its morphophysiological properties. As command from pacemaker reaches electric organ, it opens up all the sodium channels, causing net sodium ion flux in one direction. The direction will either be towards or away from the head, and brings simultaneous depolarization of all electroycytes {{on the same side of}} cell. The result is a positive polarity at the fish's head relative to the tail, or vice versa: a dipole system. The polarity built up by the electric organ therefore sets up an electrostatic field in the water.|$|E

Electric organ of Apternotids is derived from neurons; more specifically, they are formed from the axons of spinal <b>electromotor</b> neurons. Such structure eliminates one [...] between spinal <b>electromotor</b> neuron and the myogenic electrocytes, which might contribute to Apternotids' highest EOD frequency (>2000Hz) among electric fishes.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{seen when}} there is a cross of {{electrical}} reflexes as a muscle is stimulated. [...] <b>Electromotor</b> allochiria has been observed in the face, lower limbs, and upper limbs. [...] In these cases, a stimulus presented on the affected side caused contraction of the opposite facial muscles with a current so weak that the healthy facial did not react. [...] Another example is that pressure on one forearm caused movement of the opposite forearm. [...] The central fact is that an electrical stimulus may manifest its effect at a distant part of the nervous system. This distant part may be {{on the same side of}} the body or on the opposite side, naturally it is more often on the opposite side because the representation of corresponding contralateral limbs in the spinal cord are nearer to each other than homolateral limbs. This has nothing to do with the confusion of the two sides that occurs in the patients mind when allochiria is present.|$|E

The bright spark at the <b>electromotor,</b> and {{the shock}} in the arms, {{appeared}} evidently {{to be due}} to one current in the long wire, divided into two parts by the double channel afforded through the body and through the electromotor; for that the spark was evolved at the place of disjunction with the <b>electromotor,</b> not by any direct action of the latter, but by a force immediately exerted in the wire of communication, seemed to be without doubt (1070.). It followed, therefore, that by using a better conductor in place of the human body, the whole of this extra current might be made to pass at that place; and thus be separated from that which the <b>electromotor</b> could produce by its immediate action, and its direction be examined apart from any interference of the original and originating current. This was found to be true; for on connecting the ends of the principal wire together by a cross wire two or three feet in length, applied just where the hands had felt the shock, the whole of the extra current passed by the new channel, and then no better spark than one producible by a short wire was obtained on disjunction at the <b>electromotor.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 1049. The inquiry arose {{out of a}} fact {{communicated to}} me by Mr. Jenkin, which is as follows. If an {{ordinary}} wire of short length {{be used as the}} medium of communication between the two plates of an <b>electromotor</b> consisting of a single pair of metals, no management will enable the experimenter to obtain an electric shock from this wire; but if the wire which surrounds an electro-magnet be used, a shock is felt each time the contact with the <b>electromotor</b> is broken, provided the ends of the wire be grasped one in each hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 1060. The {{peculiar}} {{effects are}} best {{shown by the}} electro-magnet (1056.). When {{it was used to}} complete the communication at the <b>electromotor,</b> there was no sensible spark on making contact, but on breaking contact there was a very large and bright spark, with considerable combustion of the mercury. Then, again, with respect to the shock: if the hands were moistened in salt and water, and good contact between them and the wires retained, no shock could be felt upon making contact at the <b>electromotor,</b> but a powerful one on breaking contact.|$|E

40|$|Proposed the {{frequency}} of method to assessing the dynamic uncertainty of measurement devices which allows to investigate the accuracy {{of changes in the}} dynamic operation conditions in {{the frequency}} domain, estimate the amplitude dynamic uncertainty based on frequency characteristic and the spectral function of the input signal.

On the basis of the calculations that the relative dynamic uncertainty of device measuring is 5. 38 % and the measuring range from 0. 1 to 8 N m, and in the range measuring of dynamic torque of <b>electromotors</b> from 0. 1 to 30 N m its value is 5. 33 %. The proposed approach to the evaluation of the dynamic uncertainty can be used for measuring instruments that have dynamic elements of any type. First proposed a theoretical approach to the assessment the characteristics dynamic of the uncertainty of measuring instruments, working in dynamic modes of operation that meets international standards for presentation of the characteristics of quality and accuracy of electrical products.

6000|$|... 1086. I {{found it}} {{difficult}} to obtain the chemical effects with the simple helices and wires, in consequence of the diminished inductive power of these arrangements, and because of the passage of a strong constant current at x whenever a very active <b>electromotor</b> was used (1082).|$|E
6000|$|... 1090. The {{double helix}} (1053.) was {{arranged}} {{so that it}} should form the connecting wire between the plates of the <b>electromotor,</b> in being out of the current, and its ends unconnected. In this condition it acted very well, and gave a good spark {{at the time and}} place of disjunction. The opposite ends of ii were then connected together so as to form an endless wire, i remaining unchanged: but now no spark, or one scarcely sensible, could be obtained from the latter at the place of disjunction. Then, again, the ends of ii were held so nearly together that any current running round that helix should be rendered visible as a spark; and in this manner a spark was obtained from ii when the junction of i with the <b>electromotor</b> was broken, in place of appearing at the disjoined extremity of i itself.|$|E
6000|$|... 1052. The <b>electromotor</b> used {{consisted}} of a cylinder of zinc introduced between the two parts of a double cylinder of copper, and preserved from metallic contact in the usual way by corks. The zinc cylinder was eight inches high and four inches in diameter. Both it and the copper cylinder were supplied with stiff wires, surmounted by cups containing mercury; {{and it was at}} these cups that the contacts of wires, helices, or electro-magnets, used to complete the circuit, were made or broken. These cups I will call G and E throughout the rest of this paper (1079.).|$|E

6000|$|... 1070. The {{action is}} evidently {{dependent}} upon the wire {{which serves as a}} conductor; for it varies as that wire varies in its length or arrangement. The shortest wire may be considered as exhibiting the full effect of spark or shock which the <b>electromotor</b> can produce by its own direct power; all the additional force which the arrangements described can excite being due to some affection of the current, either permanent or momentary, in the wire itself. That it is a momentary effect, produced only at the instant of breaking contact, will be fully proved (1089. 1100.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1084. Chemical {{decomposition}} {{was next}} effected by the cross-wire current, an electro-magnet being used at D, and a decomposing apparatus, with solution of iodide of potassium in paper (1079.), employed at x. The conducting {{power of the}} connecting system A B D was sufficient to carry all the primary current, and consequently no chemical action took place at x during the continuance of contact at G and E; but when contact was broken, there was instantly decomposition at x. The iodine appeared against the wire N, and not against the wire P; thus demonstrating that the current through the cross-wires, when contact was broken, was in the reverse direction to that marked by the arrow, or that which the <b>electromotor</b> would have sent through it.|$|E
6000|$|... 1102. The {{electro-magnet}} {{was arranged}} with an electrolyzing apparatus at x, as before described (1084.), {{except that the}} intensity of the chemical action at the <b>electromotor</b> was increased until the electric current was just able to produce the feeblest signs of decomposition whilst contact was continued at G and E (1079.); (the iodine of course appearing against the end of the cross wire P;) the wire N was also separated from A at r, so that contact there could be made or broken at pleasure. Under these circumstances the following set of actions was repeated several times: contact was broken at r, then broken at G, next made at r, and lastly renewed at G; thus any current from N to P due to breaking of contact was avoided, but any additional force to the current from P to N due to making contact could be observed. In this way it was found, that a much greater decomposing effect (causing the evolution of iodine against P) could be obtained by a few completions of contact than by the current which could pass in a much longer time if the contact was continued. This I attribute to the act of induction in the wire ABD at the moment of contact rendering that wire a worse conductor, or rather retarding the passage of the electricity through it for the instant, and so throwing a greater quantity of the electricity which the <b>electromotor</b> could produce, through the cross wire passage NP. The instant the induction ceased, ABD resumed its full power of carrying a constant current of electricity, and could have it highly increased, as we know by the former experiments (1060.) by the opposite inductive action brought into activity at the moment contact at Z or C was broken.|$|E

6000|$|... 1072. That {{the quality}} of {{intensity}} belonging to the constant current did not vary with the circumstances favouring the peculiar results under consideration, so as to yield an explanation of those results, was ascertained in the following manner. The current excited by an <b>electromotor</b> was passed through short wires, and its intensity tried by subjecting different substances to its electrolyzing power (912. 966. &c.); it was then passed through the wires of the powerful electro-magnet (1056.), and again examined with respect to its intensity by the same means and found unchanged. Again, the constancy of the quantity passed in the above experiment (1071.) adds further proof that the intensity could not have varied; for had it been increased upon {{the introduction of the}} soft iron, {{there is every reason to}} believe that the quantity passed in a given time would also have increased.|$|E

A dilute sulphuric acid, made {{by adding}} about one part by measure of {{oil of vitriol}} to thirty parts of water, will act energetically upon a piece of zinc plate in its {{ordinary}} and simple state: but, as Mr. Sturgeon has shown[A], not at all, or scarcely so, if {{the surface of the}} metal has in the first instance been amalgamated; yet the amalgamated zinc will act powerfully with platina as an <b>electromotor,</b> hydrogen being evolved {{on the surface of the}} latter metal, as the zinc is oxidized and dissolved. The amalgamation is best effected by sprinkling a few drops of mercury upon the surface of the zinc, the latter being moistened with the dilute acid, and rubbing with the fingers or two so as to extend the liquid metal over the whole of the surface. Any mercury in excess, forming liquid drops upon the zinc, should be wiped off[B].|$|E
6000|$|... 1080. The {{spark of}} the cross-wire current could be {{produced}} at x {{in the following}} manner: D was made an electro-magnet; the metallic extremities at x were held close together, or rubbed lightly against each other, whilst contact was broken at G or E. When the communication was perfect at x, little or no spark appeared at G or E. When the condition of vicinity at x was favourable for the result required, a bright spark would pass there {{at the moment of}} disjunction, none occurring at G and E: this spark was the luminous passage of the extra current through the cross-wires. When there was no contact or passage of current at x, then the spark appeared at G or E, the extra current forcing its way through the <b>electromotor</b> itself. The same results were obtained by the use of the helix or the extended wire at D in place of the electro-magnet.|$|E

6000|$|... 1087. The most {{instructive}} set {{of results}} was obtained, however, when the galvanometer was introduced at x. Using an electro-magnet at D, and continuing contact, a current was then {{indicated by the}} deflection, proceeding from P to N, {{in the direction of}} the arrow; the cross-wire serving to carry one part of the electricity excited by the <b>electromotor,</b> and that part of the arrangement marked A B D, the other and far greater part, as indicated by the arrows. The magnetic needle was then forced back, by pins applied upon opposite sides of its two extremities, to its natural position when uninfluenced by a current; after which, contact being broken at G or E, it was deflected strongly in the opposite direction; thus showing, in accordance with the chemical effects (1084), that the extra current followed a course in the cross-wires contrary to that indicated by the arrow, i. e. contrary to the one produced by the direct action of the electromotor[A].|$|E
6000|$|... 1098. I {{was able}} to prove the points by other expedients. Two short thick wires were {{selected}} to serve as terminations, by which contact could be made or broken with the <b>electromotor.</b> The compound helix, consisting of i and ii (1053.), was adjusted so that the extremities of the two helices could be placed in communication with the two terminal wires, {{in such a manner}} that the current moving through the thick wires should be divided into two equal portions in the two helices, these portions travelling, according to the mode of connexion, either in the same direction or in contrary directions at pleasure. In this manner two streams could be obtained, both of which could be stopped simultaneously, because the disjunction could be broken at G or F by removing a single wire. When the helices were in contrary directions, there was scarcely a sensible spark at the place of disjunction; but when they were in accordance there was a very bright one.|$|E
6000|$|... 1101. As an {{electric}} current acts by induction with equal energy {{at the moment}} of its commencement as {{at the moment of}} its cessation (10. 26.), but in a contrary direction, the reference of the effects under examination to an inductive action, would lead to the conclusion that corresponding effects of an opposite nature must occur in a long wire, a helix, or an electro-magnet, every time that contact is made with the <b>electromotor.</b> These effects will tend to establish a resistance for the first moment in the long conductor, producing a result equivalent to the reverse of a shock or a spark. Now {{it is very difficult to}} devise means fit for the recognition of such negative results; but as it is probable that some positive effect is produced at the time, if we knew what to expect, I think the few facts bearing upon this subject with which I am acquainted are worth recording.|$|E
