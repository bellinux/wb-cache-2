5|$|Daniel Tack for Game Informer {{rated the}} game with an 8/10, {{comparing}} it to games such as Dwarf Fortress and Towns, but more accessible and with improved graphics. IGN 's Rowan Kaiser awarded an 8.3/10 score, noting that Banished suffered when the gameplay <b>difficulty</b> was lower, while also making the same comparison to Dwarf Fortress as Game Informer. Kaiser praised Banished for creating <b>difficulty</b> through {{the lack of a}} money resource, rather than using money as the primary source of <b>difficulty.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this short oral communication, is to investigate developmental differences between pupils with and without <b>difficulties</b> in mathematics and/or reading, and to investigate {{the manner in which}} these differences are reflected in their level of performance on different tasks in mathematics. In research which is primarily concerned with reading, <b>difficulties</b> in mathematics are often seen merely as a result of reading <b>difficulties</b> (Miles & Miles, 1992). However, this cannot be the whole truth since approximately half of the pupils with <b>difficulties</b> in mathematics do not have additional <b>difficulties</b> in reading (Ostad, 1998). Reading ability seems to influence growth in mathematical achievement (Jordan, Hanich, & Kaplan, 2003).

5|$|Devil Summoner was {{the first}} Megami Tensei title to be {{released}} on a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console, and the first Megami Tensei game to feature 3D graphics. The latter presented a new challenge for the development team: while they found adjusting to the new specifications a challenge, they also greatly enjoyed working with the Sega Saturn, the which was unlike anything previously experienced by the team. Among the design staff were Katsura Hashino, who focused on combat, and Shogo Isogai, who focused on coordination between gameplay events. The demon conversation system was conceived by Okada based on experiences with the multiple accents encountered in the Kansai region of Japan. Using this as a base, he created the response system to give demon negotiation a more realistic feeling than previous Megami Tensei games. It was also a means of equalizing the relationship between demons and the player party, which had previously been more akin to master and servant than equal partners. The Zoma demons, which could be freely tailored into different demon types, was created while the team was balancing out the game's <b>difficulty.</b> The gameplay <b>difficulty,</b> which by later standards would be considered quite high, was toned down from the <b>difficulty</b> of earlier Megami Tensei titles {{to appeal to a}} wider audience. This necessitated balancing a more forgiving <b>difficulty</b> with keeping traditional Megami Tensei gameplay elements.|$|E

The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|E
