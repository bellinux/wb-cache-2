After what {{seems to have been a}} somewhat cursory examination the ship was granted pratique and passengers allowed to disembark. [...] " [...] Talune's captain told the medical officer, Doctor Atkinson, that nothing was serious, but that [...] "'One old reverend told me he had been sick back in Auckland, but he seems <b>fine</b> <b>now.</b> Two Samoan kids, Tau and Faleolo, had headaches yesterday but are up and around again today.'" [...] The doctor [...] "questioned the pastor and two boys as they went by", but no one complained of being ill. Two hours later the yellow flag was lowered. The Talune had a clean bill of health." ...|$|E

Desperate for Yi-ru to accept his love for her he uses their business relationship and signs up for cooking class with her father just to be able to have a chance to see her. He even ask for her boss's help to better understand Yi-ru's personality, but Yi-ru remains unfazed by all that he has done and tells him to stop wasting his time on her. She even rejects his offering to start all over and be friends so that they can get to know each other better.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was <b>fine.</b> <b>Now</b> half your body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E

They rowed by turns; all were fairly expert at the exercise, for in those days the Thames was at once the great highway and playground of London.

The explanation of this sudden uprising was this. The city and the little garrison, so long hopeless and afraid, had gone wild over Joan's coming, and could no longer restrain their desire {{to get at the}} enemy; so, without orders from anybody, a few hundred soldiers and citizens had plunged out at the Burgundy gate on a sudden impulse and made a charge on one of Lord Talbot's most formidable fortressesSt. Loupand were getting the worst of it. The news of this had swept through the city and started this new crowd that we were with.|$|E

The thing was true, and true too was my uncle's {{proposition}} that {{the quickest way to}} get wealth is to sell the cheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle. He was frightfully right after all. Pecunnia non olet,--a Roman emperor said that. Perhaps my great heroes in Plutarch were no more than such men, <b>fine</b> <b>now</b> only because they are distant; perhaps after all this Socialism to which I had been drawn was only a foolish dream, only the more foolish because all its promises were conditionally true. Morris and these others played with it wittingly; it gave a zest, a touch of substance, to their aesthetic pleasures. Never would there be good faith enough to bring such things about. They knew it; every one, except a few young fools, knew it. As I crossed the corner of St. James's Park wrapped in thought, I dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys. A stout, common-looking woman, very magnificently dressed, regarded me from the carriage with a scornful eye. [...] "No doubt," [...] thought I, [...] "a pill-vendor's wife...." ...|$|E
6000|$|Worcester {{was capable}} of making a stout defence, but seeing that no help {{was likely to be}} forthcoming, and fearing the utter ruin of the town should it be taken by storm, the council, after sitting many hours in deliberation, {{determined}} to raise the money required to pay the fine inflicted by the prince. The bolder sort were greatly averse to this decision, especially as a letter had been received, signed [...] "Cuthbert, Earl of Evesham," [...] offering, should the townspeople decide to resist the unjust demands of Prince John, to enter the town with 150 archers to take part in its defence. With this force, as the more ardent spirits urged, the defeat of any attempt to carry it by storm would be assured. But the graver men argued that even if defeated for the first time, further attempts would be made, and as it was likely that King Richard would not return for a long time, and that Prince John might become Sovereign of England, sooner or later the town must be taken, and, in any case, its trade would for a long time be destroyed, and great suffering inflicted upon all; therefore, that it was better to pay the <b>fine</b> <b>now</b> than to risk all these evils, and perhaps the infliction of a heavier impost upon them.|$|E

You will have to make shoes for nobody, but some one will have to make a great many for you. You will have to dig ground for nobody, but some one will have to dig through every summer's hot day for you. You will build houses and make clothes for no one, but many a rough hand must knead clay, and many an elbow be crooked to the stitch, to keep that body of yours warm and <b>fine.</b> <b>Now</b> remember, whatever you and your work may be worth, the less your keep costs, the better. It does not cost money only. It costs degradation. You do not merely employ these people. You also tread upon them. It cannot be helped;--you have your place, and they have theirs; but see that you tread as lightly as possible, and on as few as possible. What food, and clothes, and lodging, you honestly need, for your health and peace, you may righteously take. See that you take the plainest you can serve yourself with--that you waste or wear nothing vainly--and that you employ no man in furnishing you with any useless luxury." ...|$|E
