50|$|The <b>final</b> <b>recipients,</b> {{otherwise}} known as beneficiaries (e.g. citizens), must be, for the most part, low-income families. HUD has designed a general formula for which all governments must comply with when providing HOME funds to citizens, {{which is that the}} incomes of families receiving HOME assistance or funds in a specific area (city, county, etc.) must not exceed 80 percent of the area’s family income median or average. In other words, if say HUD determines that a local area’s median income is $25,000, then the HOME funds awarded in that area should only benefit those families with incomes less than, or equal to, 80% of $25,000 (or $20,000). HUD publishes the area median incomes plus the 80% income limits every year in its website.|$|E

5000|$|In {{some cases}} the {{borrowing}} process can be more complicated and the words might move through different languages before {{coming back to the}} originating language.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of harvest, seeds show high {{nitrogen}} contents, but some remains in leaves, providing a nitrogen-rich straw {{which can be used}} for animal feeding or as fertilizer, if the plant material is incorporated into the soil. In one season, 67 kg N/ha were taken up by roots and seeds. This nitrogen is mainly provided by the inoculation with efficient bacterial strains. The P. ahipa plant is therefore able to form an efficient symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, and is able to fix 58-80 kg nitrogen per hectare. No further supply of nitrogen fertilizer is needed. [...] If the vegetative aboveground parts are left in the field, a substantial amount of the fixed nitrogen is returned to the soil, about 12-80 kg N/ha. The enrichment is very important if a sustainable land-use system is desired. During nodulation, an increased phosphorus supply is advantageous, because nodulation can be improved. Further, it promotes the root and seed yield in P. ahipa plants. The <b>final</b> <b>recipients</b> of P are the pod shells, as well as the seeds. In total, about 7-9.6 kg P/ha were extracted from the soil. At harvest, the highest potassium contents can be found in pod shells and the roots. The removal of K at harvest was about 20.2 kg K/ha.|$|E
30|$|Shifting the {{transport}} of goods from road to rail and inland waterways is a major goal of European transport policy. Current research often focuses {{on the distribution of}} maritime containers by using combined transport or more specifically, on the usage of rail or inland waterways to serve hinterland terminals and the subsequent distribution of containers to recipients by truck. Very little research has considered using rail for the distribution of containers right up to the <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> In Switzerland, however, SBB Cargo still distributes a large number of containers directly to their <b>final</b> <b>recipients</b> by using the Swiss Split service. The research presented here aims at developing ideas that might help to improve the competitiveness of container distribution by rail. It presents a holistic approach that covers the entire transport chain. Many of these ideas will be implemented in an improved service called New Swiss Split as soon as the new Basel-Nord intermodal terminal will have been opened in 2019.|$|E
40|$|When {{there are}} {{externalities}} across households, governments can improve economic outcomes by equitably subsidizing education. But this chain of causality works only if (1) allocated resources reach the <b>final</b> <b>recipients,</b> and (2) equity in public subsidies translates directly into equity in total educational expenditures, including private spending at the household level. Using a unique data set from Zambia, the author shows that whether these conditions are met {{depends on the}} specific schemes used to allocate resources {{as well as the}} exact form of the subsidies. First, subsidies allocated through clear guidelines and legislated rules reached the <b>final</b> <b>recipients,</b> but those allocated at the discretion of province and educational offices did not. Second, even those components of subsidies that were progressive (in that the share of total subsidies for the poor was greater than the share for the non-poor) had no effect on inequality in total educational expenditures due to the crowding-out of household spending...|$|E

50|$|Governments may reimburse {{taxpayers in}} several ways. A tax refund reduces the net tax paid, such as income tax, {{potentially}} to zero. Taxpayers may receive complete reimbursement for other taxes, such as for Value-added tax due to low income, subsequent export {{of the goods}} sold, or not being the <b>final</b> <b>recipient.</b> A local government may use reimbursement to reduce property taxes for a favored organization or low-income individual.|$|R
30|$|In our case, {{the sender}} is the C&C node, and the <b>final</b> <b>recipient</b> {{is always the}} IRC node. The sole purpose of the mix-net is thus to hide the {{identity}} of the C&C node from the IRC node. Naturally, this only makes sense if there are multiple C&C nodes in the system as a whole. In the protocol descriptions, we will use the notation mix(…) to indicate that a message is sent through the mix-net.|$|R
40|$|Standard {{messaging}} middleware guarantees {{the delivery of}} messages to intermediary destinations like message queues, but does not guarantee the receipt or the processing of a message by <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> Conditional messaging is an extension to standard {{messaging middleware}} that addresses this shortcoming by allowing an application to define, monitor, and evaluate various conditions on messages, such as time constraints on the receipt or the processing of a message {{by a set of}} <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> In this paper, we introduce the notion of conditional messaging, and present the design and implementation of a flexible and reliable system that supports conditional messaging for use in Java 2 Enterprise Edition and message queuing environments. Our solution uniquely shifts the responsibilities for implementing the management of conditions on messages from the application to the middleware. We further discuss the grouping of multiple conditional messages into atomic units-of-work, which can also integrate requests to transactional resources like distributed objects using object middleware. Conditional messaging serves to implement various kinds of backward dependencies for distributed object transactions that integrate messaging...|$|E
