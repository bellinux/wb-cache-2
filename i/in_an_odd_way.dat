5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be {{in direct contact with}} Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes... For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> he looks forward {{to it as the}} only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} {{how many people}} are ignorant about the Mormon church and think that the Mormon church actually does condone polygamy. So <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> the show is sort of beneficial in drawing that distinction.|$|E
6000|$|The stout {{man looked}} at the other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> His face seemed to broaden and redden, and he merely closed {{his eyes as he}} {{promptly}} answered:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's rather <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> fellow"--thought Zack as {{he pursued}} his own road--"and {{we have got}} acquainted with each other <b>in</b> rather <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> I shall {{certainly}} go and see him though, on Thursday; something may come of it, one of these days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{mean that}} it is a result of general carelessness,' said Lily; 'I know I have been <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> idle <b>way</b> for some time; I have often resolved, but I seem to have no power over myself.' ...|$|R
500|$|Robert Kerr's {{novel of}} 1879, The Ambassador Extraordinary, {{involves}} an architect Georgius Oldhousen, whom Crook {{considers to be}} based on Burges; he is [...] "not exactly young in years but is <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> youthful in appearance and in manners Georgius can never grow old... His strong point is a disdain for Common Sense... His vocation is Art... matter of Uncommon Sense." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Gamp {{looked at}} him <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> without {{returning}} any answer, but appeared to understand the question too.|$|E
6000|$|Fledgeby {{had dropped}} into a chair, in the {{attitude}} of one waiting wearily. 'I suppose he will be back soon,' he replied; 'he has cut out and left me expecting him back, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> Haven't I seen you before?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say,' {{he said to}} her one evening, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd,</b> unthinking, {{uncertain}} <b>way,</b> 'won't {{you stay}} to dinner tonight? I wish you would.' ...|$|R
60|$|When the boy {{and girl}} stopped before Mr. Presto Digi's mound, he began waving one of his thin, scraggy paws {{and at the same}} time made a gurgling noise that was deep down in his throat. And his eyes rolled and twisted around <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
25|$|Right at the Nassau castle's gateway arch building, {{standing}} over KÃ¶nig-Adolf-Platz, is the Town Hall (Rathaus) from 1698, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> over the passage {{that separates the}} Old Town from the castle. Also worth mentioning is the carillon (Glockenspiel). A rockslide from the crags destroyed the Town Hall in 1928, but it was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934.|$|R
6000|$|As usual, Dr. Lesage was sulky in {{his manner}} and very short in his answers. To Terence's demand, [...] "She {{seems to be}} better?" [...] he replied, looking at him <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> [...] "She has a chance of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we {{have only}} a few more things to get," [...] said Foster Portney, [...] "the most {{important}} of the whole outfit;" [...] and as Randy and Earl looked at him blankly, he smiled <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> [...] "What could three gold hunters do without picks, shovels, and pans?" ...|$|E
60|$|Several times Mr. Sabin {{caught her}} {{watching}} him <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> {{as though she}} desired to attract his attention, but Mr. Watson, who for once had seemed to desert the smoking-room, remained by her side like a shadow. Mr. Sabin felt that his presence was ominous. The tea was made and handed round.|$|E
60|$|But when Mr. Podgers saw Lord Arthur's hand he grew curiously pale, {{and said}} nothing. A shudder seemed {{to pass through}} him, and his great bushy eyebrows twitched convulsively, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd,</b> irritating <b>way</b> they had when he was puzzled. Then some huge beads of {{perspiration}} broke out on his yellow forehead, like a poisonous dew, and his fat fingers grew cold and clammy.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} section from SR 69 to US 79 is unfinished {{and under}} construction. When finished, the route {{will make a}} complete bypass around Paris. It is signed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> from SR 69 to its first junction with US 79 the southbound lane is signed as it is going north and the northbound lane is signed as it is going south {{on the west side}} of Paris.|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} known exactly <b>in</b> how <b>odd</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> this <b>odd</b> old man {{affected}} me. I only know that for some reason or other he so affected me that I was, within <b>a</b> few minutes, <b>in</b> the street outside.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little group}} of people then began to move off in the same {{direction}} as the stout black figure. Looked at <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> by people who made no effort to join them, they moved with one exception slowly and consciously towards the stairs. Mrs. Flushing was the exception. She came running downstairs, strode across the hall, joined the procession much out of breath, demanding of Mrs. Thornbury in an agitated whisper, [...] "Where, where?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{had made}} up my mind to gainsay Sihamba, not that I could find any fault with her plan, but because if such {{arrangements}} are to be made, I like to make them myself, as is the business of the head of the house. I think Sihamba guessed this; at any rate she answered me before I spoke, and that <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> namely, by looking first at the swallow's nest, then at the blooming bough of the peach tree, and lastly into the far distances of air.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I did," [...] she answered, [...] "it {{was very}} foolish. Friends means the giving and taking of confidences, and I have none to give. I {{am going to}} do strange things, and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> and I have no {{explanations}} to offer. If I had friends, they would think that I had taken leave of my senses, and they would want me to explain. That is just what I cannot do. That is why I am sure {{it would be better if}} you would let me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-day!" [...] said Pearse; [...] "fine weather! I've {{been up to}} ask Pasiance to {{come for}} a sail. Wednesday we thought, weather permitting; this gentleman's coming. Perhaps you'll come too, Mr. Treffry. You've never seen my place. I'll give you lunch, and show you my father. He's worth a couple of hours' sail any day." [...] It was said <b>in</b> such <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> that one couldn't resent his impudence. John Ford was seized with a fit of wheezing, and seemed {{on the eve of}} an explosion; he glanced at me, and checked himself.|$|R
6000|$|Walkirk sailed a boat very well, {{but he did}} it <b>in</b> rather <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> as if he {{had learned}} it all out of a book, and never had handled a tiller before. I am not a bad amateur sailor myself, but I gave no {{consideration}} to the management of our craft. Walkirk had said that he knew where he was going, and was able to sail there, and I left the matter entirely to him; and whether or not this were his first essay in sailing, in due time we ran upon a low beach, and he exclaimed:-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{grew up and}} {{was helped}} out in life. That waggery of fate which started Clive as a writing clerk, Gay as a linen-draper, Keats as a surgeon, and <b>a</b> {{thousand}} others <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thousand other <b>odd</b> <b>ways,</b> banished the wild and ascetic heath lad to a trade whose sole concern was with the especial symbols of self-indulgence and vainglory.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{women and}} three men were at supper when he entered, and silently made room {{for him to}} sit down by them. When he had eaten he began to look about him, and was {{surprised}} to see an animal sitting by the fire different from anything he had ever noticed before. It was grey in colour, and not very big; but its eyes were large and very bright, and it seemed to be singing <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> quite unlike any animal in the forest. 'What is the name of that strange little creature?' asked he. And they answered, 'We call it a cat.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{an elegant}} man in very plain evening dress; tall, {{but with an}} air of not taking up much room; one felt that he could have slid along like a shadow where many smaller men would have been obvious and obstructive. His face, now flung back in the lamplight, was swarthy and vivacious, the face of a foreigner. His figure was good, his manners good humoured and confident; a critic could only say that his black coat was a shade below his figure and manners, and even bulged and bagged <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> The moment he caught sight of Brown's black {{silhouette}} against the sunset, he tossed down a scrap of paper with a number and called out with amiable authority: [...] "I want my hat and coat, please; I find I have to go away at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "it must be {{such things}} as those that make your eyes sparkle! But of course it warms your heart to give her {{delicate}} eating when she first comes to you, {{and to have a}} fine pair of horses for her to drive behind. If your face beams as it does now while she is away, it will serve as an electric light when she comes back. Good fortune! Oh, yes, of course, you consider that you have it in full measure. But we are sometimes apt to look on our friends' good fortune <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> Now, if I had wanted you to go to Boston to get rich, and instead of that you had insisted on going to Nantucket, and had become rich there, I suppose that I should have been satisfied as long as you were prosperous, but I do not believe I would have been; at least, not entirely so. In this world we do want people to do what we think they ought to do." ...|$|E
60|$|The Duchess, who duly {{arrived a}} few moments later, brought with her into the room a {{different}} and essentially a more cosmopolitan atmosphere. She was a tall, fair woman, attractive <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> sort of <b>way,</b> with large features, a delightful smile, and a habit of rapid speech. She exchanged hasty greetings with every one present and then turned back towards {{the man who had}} followed her into the room.|$|R
60|$|With a {{buoyancy}} and hopefulness and a gaiety {{that hardly}} ever flagged, Richard had <b>a</b> carelessness <b>in</b> his character that quite perplexed me, principally because he mistook it, <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> for prudence. It entered into all his calculations about money <b>in</b> <b>a</b> singular manner which I don't think I can better explain than by reverting {{for a moment}} to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.|$|R
40|$|The electroweak {{interactions}} {{are based on}} {{an extension of the}} electromagnetic (Maxwell) interactions, realized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> so that the symmetries of the theory are not immediately obvious. This "broken" theory {{has been the subject of}} intense investigation at LEP, and has passed all tests with flying colours. These lectures are meant to complement the many excellent presentations of the standard SU(2) /sub L/*U(1) /sub Y/ electroweak interactions in three main ways: first to clarify the physical meaning of symmetries in particle physics, second, to summarize the recent tests of the standard model using LEP data, and finally to look at possible roles of gravity in understanding mass.

6000|$|... "Upon China Aster's stating his case, his trusted {{friend was}} silent for a time; then, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> said that he would not crowd China Aster, but still his (Orchis') necessities were urgent. Could not China Aster {{mortgage}} the candlery? He was honest, and must have moneyed friends; and could he not press his sales of candles? Could not the market be forced a little in that particular? The profits on candles must be very great. Seeing, now, that Orchis had the notion that the candle-making business was a very profitable one, and knowing sorely enough what an error was here, China Aster tried to undeceive him. But he could not drive the truth into Orchis--Orchis being very obtuse here, and, at the same time, strange to say, very melancholy. Finally, Orchis glanced off from so unpleasing a subject into the most unexpected reflections, taken from a religious point of view, upon the unstableness and deceitfulness of the human heart. But having, as he thought, experienced something of that sort of thing, China Aster did not take exception to his friend's observations, but still refrained from so doing, almost as much for the sake of sympathetic sociality as anything else. Presently, Orchis, without much ceremony, rose, and saying he must write a letter to his wife, bade his friend good-bye, but without warmly shaking him by the hand as of old.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{her son was}} the companion of Venetia, both in her pastimes and studies. The education of Lord Cadurcis had received no further assistance than was afforded by the little grammar-school at Morpeth, where he had passed {{three or four years}} as a day-scholar, and where his mother had invariably taken his part on every occasion that he had incurred the displeasure of his master. There he had obtained some imperfect knowledge of Latin; yet the boy was fond of reading, and had picked up, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way,</b> more knowledge than might have been supposed. He had read 'Baker's Chronicle,' and 'The Old Universal History,' and 'Plutarch;' and had turned over, in the book room of an old gentleman at Morpeth, who had been attracted by his intelligence, not a few curious old folios, from which he had gleaned no contemptible store of curious instances of human nature. His guardian, whom he had never seen, and who was a great nobleman and lived in London, had signified to Mrs. Cadurcis his intention of sending his ward to Eton; but that time had not yet arrived, and Mrs. Cadurcis, who dreaded parting with her son, determined to postpone it by every maternal artifice in her power. At present it would have seemed that her son's intellect was to be left utterly uncultivated, for there was no school in the neighbourhood which he could attend, and no occasional assistance which could be obtained; and to the constant presence of a tutor in the house Mrs. Cadurcis was not less opposed than his lordship could have been himself.|$|E

5000|$|One notable {{exception}} was Pauline Kael, who praised {{the film in}} her last collection, Movie Love. Kael wrote: [...] "Debra Winger {{is one of the}} two or three finest screen actresses we've got. For <b>a</b> brief period <b>in</b> the late sixties and early seventies, moviegoers seemed willing to be guided through a movie by their intuition and imagination; if this slyly funny picture about the spread of corruption had been released then, it might have been considered a minor classic. It's satirical <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd,</b> halucinatory <b>way.</b> There are fresh, often startling scenes. The picture is a classically constructed detective story, with a mysterious woman who lures the fact-oriented man into something that ramifies in every direction and is way over his head." ...|$|R
5000|$|Knight {{felt that}} [...] "Crowley's journey {{on the show}} has been a bold and ambitious one". On the Season 9 subplot of Crowley's human blood addiction, he wrote that it was [...] "one of the most {{interesting}} and unexpected subplots of the season...and it left a lasting (and often amusing) impression on viewers." [...] Carver, too, enjoys the character, stating, [...] "He's pure evil, but, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> sort of <b>way,</b> we find him likeable. He's so much fun to write." ...|$|R
5000|$|Years {{after the}} movie's release, when GÃ¶sta Ekman {{went down to}} Budapest on vacation, he found that people looked at him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>way.</b> He {{eventually}} understood why when a local {{asked him if he}} were Picasso, to which GÃ¶sta replied, [...] "If you mean that I played Picasso <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movie than, yeah, that's right." [...] He later found out that the film was <b>a</b> great success <b>in</b> Hungary, where it has been playing on a Budapest cinema every year since its release, and even had been turned into a stage play. Hans Alfredson, who wrote the script along with Tage Danielsson and also starred as Pablo's father, has seen the play and liked it. He commented that [...] "It was very faithful to the film." ...|$|R
