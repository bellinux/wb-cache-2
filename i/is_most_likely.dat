5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} subunit of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα. Cβ is found abundantly in the brain and in lower levels in other tissues, while Cγ <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> expressed in the testis.|$|E

5|$|Pallas's surface <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The sceptre, a {{symbolic}} ornamental rod {{held by the}} monarch at a coronation, <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> derived from the shepherd's staff, via the crozier of a bishop; it may, however, be a remnant of the ceremonial spear that was presented to kings and queens at coronations {{in different parts of}} the world in early history.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> extinct, and {{may already have}} been close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.|$|E

5|$|This {{model was}} able to explain {{observations}} of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to be observed.|$|E
5|$|While Georgian and Classical {{evidence}} {{makes the}} contemporaneous Kartlian {{links with the}} Seleucids plausible (Toumanoff has even implied that the kings of Kartli might have aided the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia in check), Pharnavaz's alleged reform of the eristavi fiefdoms <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> a back-projection of the medieval pattern of subdivision to the remote past.|$|E

5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of}} the acne lesion.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: {{a mixture of}} rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E

5|$|Collybia cirrhata <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to occur if the nest is high in a tree {{and there is a}} good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
