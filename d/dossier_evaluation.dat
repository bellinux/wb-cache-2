30|$|To {{verify the}} quality and {{compliance}} of registrations, REACH introduced the instrument of <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> is an important task of ECHA. One element of <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> is the examination of testing proposals (TPE) received with the registration dossiers. A dossier containing a testing proposal is automatically considered for <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The other element of the <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> is the compliance check with the possible outcomes: no administrative action needed, decisions, draft decisions for comments, and quality observation letters to inform the registrant about deficiencies of the dossier and to consider updating of the registration.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reform in}} Japanese higher {{education}} requires an appropriate evaluation framework for educational activities undertaken by each faculty. Even though {{a number of}} universities in Japan have already implemented evaluative systems for this purpose, Nagasaki University has as yet to clarify its assessment policy of educational engagement. The authors, therefore, looked to the evaluation process of educational activities in U. S. universities and sought to find implications from their well-established practice of assessing faculty performance. Three universities around Los Angeles (UCLA, USC, and CSULA) were visited in February, 2013, {{and the results of}} the hearings are hereby presented. At each university, assessment of educational activities was found to be being conducted {{on the basis of the}} faculty-provided <b>dossier,</b> and the <b>evaluation</b> practice seemed to be pursued in more of a qualitative, integrative fashion, rather than relying on objective, quantitative ratings on specified criteria. Implications pertinent to faculty evaluation at Nagasaki University are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the German health care reform in January 2011, an early benefit assessment (EBA) is required for all new medicines. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have to submit a benefit <b>dossier</b> for <b>evaluation</b> by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). A final decision is made by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). The aim of this investigation was to analyse the outcomes 18 months after introduction of the new legislation and to identify critical areas requiring further discussion and development. All EBAs commenced prior to June 2012 were included. The G-BA website was used to obtain manufacturers' benefit dossiers, IQWiG assessments, and G-BA decisions. Four areas of interest were analysed: levels of additional benefit, appropriate comparative therapy (ACT), patient-relevant endpoints, and adverse events. Twenty-seven EBAs were analysed. IQWiG stated a benefit in 50 % of EBAs, whereas G-BA stated a benefit in 63 %, but only in 50 % of identified subgroups and 40 % of patients involved. In 12 EBAs, the ACT suggested by G-BA differed from the comparator used in phase III trials. The G-BA reported no benefits on health-related quality of life. Discrepancies arose in morbidity outcomes such as 'progression-free survival' and 'sustained virological response'. Categorisation and balancing of adverse events was conducted within various assessments. Considerable variance was observed in the levels of additional benefit reported by pharmaceutical manufacturers, IQWiG and G-BA. The areas of disagreement included ACT selection, definition of subgroups and patient-relevant endpoints, and classification and balancing of adverse events...|$|R

Now it covers also environmental issues...|$|E
30|$|In {{the period}} between 01.06. 2008 and 31.07. 2012 ECHA {{received}} 563 dossiers with testing proposals [18]. 439 of the testing proposals included proposals for testing vertebrate animals. To assure that the German standards for assessing chemicals risk are completely transfered in the community procedures, the German authorities are aiming at taking an active part and commenting on the testing proposal examination (TPE), and the other elements of <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation.</b>|$|E
30|$|The first {{results of}} the {{evaluation}} processes show that some exposure scenarios and risk management measures from the first registrations may be very schematic, incomplete, inadequate, and/or overprotective and may not respect the hierarchy of risk management measures. ECHA's current approach in <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> shifts to a targeted approach, namely selecting specific points of concern. Considering occupational health and safety, it is desirable to enhance the emphasis on exposure and risk management in the future.|$|E
30|$|The REACH Regulation {{includes}} both {{the evaluation of}} submitted registration dossiers by ECHA and substance evaluations led by the individual EU member states. First limited experiences {{are available from the}} <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> in 2011 / 2012, but it seems too early and not really helpful to make general statements on the quality of registration dossiers already at the present stage. As is stated in REACH recital 21, the information yielded on substances through evaluation should be used in the first place by manufacturers and importers to manage the risks related to their substances.|$|E
30|$|The {{task for}} {{authorities}} is to prioritise substances for regulatory activities. For ECHA {{this is the}} <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation,</b> for Member States authorities the substance evaluation and for all authorities elaborating proposals to identify substances of very high concern (SVHC), and candidates for authorisation and restrictions. Some of these tasks {{are already in the}} beginning (e.g. substance evaluation), others are ongoing, (e.g. the identification of SVHC). By September, 1 st, 84 SVHC are included in the candidate list, and 14 substances are included in Annex XIV and therefore will be subject for authorisation in future. To elaborate the proposals and to agree the measures in the Member State Committee was not an easy task – and therefore we congratulate also the Member States authorities, and especially ECHA.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{an outcome of}} the Nordic {{workshop}} on priority setting {{within the context of}} the new working fields under the REACH and CLP regulations. The workshop was arranged by the Nordic Risk Assessment Project (NORAP) and the report written by the Swedish Chemicals Agency, based on funding from the Nordic Chemicals Group (NKG) of the Nordic Council of Ministers (NMR). The workshop addressed priority setting for the processes which form the main part of the work of Member State Competent Authorities in relation to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and its Committees. The relevant processes were: substance and <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation,</b> harmonised classification, identification of substances of very high concern (SVHC) and their subsequent risk management through authorisation requirements, as well as proposals for restrictions on marketing and use. The outcome of the workshop is intended primarily for use by the Nordic countries in national priority setting, but could be used as well for national input in contribution to further developments in these processes under ECHA's responsibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Academic Administration {{internship}} Program is to enlarge the number and {{to improve the quality}} of persons available to fill key positions in academic administration. The program was designed to meet the following objectives: (1) to identity qualified people; (2) to select the most promising among those identified; and (3) to provide the selectees with experiences that would develop their potential to perform effectively in administrative positions directly related to academic areas. After briefly discussing the results of prior research on nomination, evaluation and selection, this report: deals mainly with the results of the Career Status Followup Study, which included the sending of a Career Status (CSQ) to 10 b former Fellows and 106 former nominees who did not receive the internship. In addition, the CSQ was sent to 83 participants in the ACE Academic Deans ' Institutes in 1967 and 1968. The results indicated that there was a high intrinsic correlation between selection and experience as a Fellow and early attainment of a career position as an academic administrator. Some findings were also made regarding: (1) the nomination stage, (2) the <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> stage, (3) the interview stage, and (4) the internship experience. (AF...|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{the authors}} have {{evaluated}} the development, challenges, and limitations to implementation of REACH in the occupational setting {{in order to examine}} to what extent the REACH ‘ideals’ can be achieved. In some respects, this has proven challenging because of the current ‘state of the art’ with REACH as well as knowledge and experience of those implementing the legislation. There is clearly ambiguity in the minds of some regarding the application of REACH in their business aspects, and concerns that the legislation is placing a disproportionate burden on industry. The regulation is still at an early stage of implementation after 6 years and not all of the tools have fully been used or exploited to their full potential. Quality control processes like <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation,</b> substance evaluation and regulatory processes like SVHC identification, authorisation and restriction have just started. Some inherent legal aspects of the process may hinder to reach the objectives in relation to health and safety at work, especially competing objectives and those provisions that narrow the scope of REACH. By the establishment of raised awareness, good work practices, improved communication, further guidelines, and decisions of the national enforcement authorities as well as the European Court of Justice compliance problems will be reduced. Therefore, the authors are confident that with more routine experience of the REACH processes and with support from all parties involved, improvements in workplace health and safety standards can be achieved although the outlined ‘ideal REACH world’ cannot be achieved.|$|E
30|$|Guidance is {{also being}} {{improved}} based on knowledge from the workplace assessment of exposure and this is being triggered by on-going evaluation processes performed by ECHA and the member states. Evaluation is one instrument that will reveal and reduce data gaps and should reduce legal non-compliance of the type outlined in Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4 (columns 3, respectively). When a registration dossier is submitted to ECHA, it generally passes only an IT-supported accordance check which might not reveal incorrect information. A {{closer look at the}} registration dossiers is then carried out by ECHA on 5 % of the registrations via a formal <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The focus so far has been on the evaluation of toxicological assessment and environmental questions. ECHA's current approach shifts to a targeted approach, namely selecting specific points of concern. Considering occupational health and safety, it is desirable to enhance the emphasis on exposure and risk management in the future. However, the evaluation of exposure scenarios is difficult at the moment and in most cases has to be done manually. Exposure scenarios are submitted in the CSR in PDF format and {{are not part of the}} registration dossier that is submitted in a structured and IT-searchable format (IUCLID) [36]. ECHA provides an IT-application named CHESAR [37] that is linked with IUCLID and able to generate the CSR and exposure scenarios for communication in the eSDS in a structured, harmonised and efficient way.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the initial {{hazard and risk}} assessment process for new substances at the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM) in the Netherlands. This assessment pertains to both man and the environment and is performed {{within the framework of}} the European Community (EC) Directive 79 / 831 /EEC and the ensuing Dutch Chemical Substances Act. The report is restricted to the assessment of substances on the basis of the tests required at a market or production volume up to 100 tonnes per year or 500 tonnes cumulative. It has been written as a reference guide for those involved in the hazard and risk assessment process at RIVM in the first place, but also for the risk managers responsible for the regulation and the overall <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> of new substances, and for others interested in this subject, e. g. industry, non-governmental organizations and the public at large. Step by step the essential elements of the hazard and risk assessment process are discussed: organizational aspects, data requirements, the determination of the acceptability of the data received, the scientific evaluation of the test methods and results, the exposure assessment, the comparison of exposure and toxicity data, and the uncertainty analysis. The report also discusses requirements for further testing following the initial assessment and concludes with a summary of recent and relevant developments in the European Community within the field of the assessment of new substances. ...|$|E
30|$|On 1 June 2007, the {{legislation}} on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) came into force. REACH shall ensure the safe manufacturing, placing {{on the market}} and use of chemicals in the European Union. Registration aims to deliver data on hazards as well as descriptions of appropriate risk management measures (RMM). Evaluation comprises dossier and substance evaluation to ensure high quality of the registrations, and to remove data gaps and identify risks which need further regulation. Where risks are not being properly controlled, REACH provides two risk management measures: authorisation and restriction. To date (status May 2013), approximately 28, 000 registration dossiers for substances were submitted and processed. The <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> is ongoing and 427 dossiers have been checked for compliance by the end of 2012 [1]. The substance evaluation has only started in 2012 and the first draft decisions on information requirements have been submitted to the registrants. Subsequent conclusions on the necessity of further risk management measures are still pending for most substances. The inclusion of substances in the candidate list for authorisation by identification as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) has made good progress. Twenty-two substances are included into Annex XIV, and for 11 substances (status December 2013), the latest application date has already expired. The first restrictions proposed by Member States have been adopted and Annex XVII has been amended [2 – 4]. Deeper insight into the aforementioned instruments of REACH and their legal background can be found elsewhere [5] and will therefore not be discussed herein.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{is intended to}} be used as guidance in the REACH exposure evaluation (MSauthorities and ECHA) such as completeness and consistency checks in the substance evaluationand <b>dossier</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. The checklist is not necessarily complete; there may also beother relevant issues {{to be taken into account}} during substance evaluation and dossier compliancechecks. This checklist will be updated when necessary, based on the experience gained. The{{document is}} focusing mainly on human health issues (workers and consumers), but it may also beutilized, for general issues, in the environmental exposure checks. The exposure scenario is a new concept in the REACH regulation and is one of the key elements in REACH for ensuring a high level of protection of human health and environment. REACH defines exposure scenarios as a set of conditions that describe how the substance is manufactured or used during its life-cycle and how the manufacturer or importer controls, or recommends others to control exposures of humans and the environment. Exposure scenario has to be established forsubstances which are manufactured or imported in quantities over 10 tons per year and which are classified as dangerous or as PBT/vPvB. In addition, exposure scenario is needed also in caseswhere exposure information is used as a basis for waiving certain animal tests specified in REACH. The first REACH exposure scenarios were developed by registrants during the 1 st registration phase in 2010. So far, some experience of exposure scenarios has been gained from dossier compliance checks (ES in CSR), substance evaluations (ES in CSR) as well as from the downstream user sites, when they receive extended safety data sheets (eSDS). The experience gained indicates clearly that there is room for improvement both in the exposure scenarios in the chemical safetyreports and in the annexes of the SDSs. Guidance documents, various IT tools and ES formats have been developed by ECHA and industrialassociations such as CEFIC. However, these may be considered rather complicated, and thus notalways helpful enough. The specific aims of this project were: To learn more about the format and content of ESs, including the use descriptor system. To check to what extent ECHA’s guidance has been exploited in the building of ESs. To obtain experience of the quality /challenges in ESs. To identify strengths and weaknesses in building of ESs (e. g. the usability and effectiveness ofrisk management measures). To develop instructions or recommendations for authorities to be used eg. in the substanceevaluation process. To make the check list available to ECHA and authorities and other relevant stakeholders...|$|E
