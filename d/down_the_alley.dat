5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{witnessing}} {{a young woman}} being robbed and murdered {{by a group of}} men, but she is too frozen in fear to protest. A black man walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> also sees the incident and runs to help the woman, but the murderers flee just as the police arrive. The police mistakenly suspect the black man of being the killer and arrest him. The real murderers give a threatening look towards Madonna and leave. She flees the crime scene and escapes to a church. There she sees a caged statue of saint who resembles the black man on the street. As the song starts, she utters a prayer in front of the statue which appears to be crying.|$|E

Augustine, with {{his blue eyes}} and golden hair, his ethereally {{flexible}} form and vivacious features; and Alfred, dark-eyed, with haughty Roman profile, firmly-knit limbs, and decided bearing. They were always abusing each other's opinions and practices, and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each other's society; in fact, the very contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet.|$|R
2500|$|Patrolmen Joseph McMannamon and Chester Szukalski {{were among}} the first uniformed {{officers}} to arrive at Beulah Avenue, approaching from the south on E. 123rd Street. The time of their arrival has been estimated as 8:30 PM. As they pulled in front of the tow truck, gunfire struck their vehicle from the south. As the men tried to escape out the driver's side door, Szukalski was hit. Severely injured, he crawled about [...] toward a home and waited for help. McMannamon was lightly injured by bullet fragments. As more marked police cars arrived, the gunmen ran east—moving across Lakeview Road into a narrow alley that is something of an extension of Beulah Avenue. As the gunment fled, they exchanged gunfire with other police who had just arrived, then turned south <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> to get behind 1395 Lakeview Road. Sources differ as to what happened next. Cleveland police claim the gunmen burst into the house, and occupied the second floor. Mrs. Beatrice Flagg and her children, living in the apartment on the first floor, fell to the ground to avoid being hit when police fired into the building. As the police pumped tear gas canisters into the home, the family fled. The police also claimed that the gunmen surprised Rev. Henry L. Perryman's wife, who fled with their nine-month-old son as the armed men seized her second-floor apartment. The police then occupied the first floor of 1391 Lakeview Road {{to use it as a}} base from which they could fire at the gunment at 1395 Lakeview. But Mrs. Perryman denied that any gunmen burst in on her. She and Mrs. Flagg claimed they received no warning before police began firing guns at their homes and launching tear gas through the windows. A later press report gave a third version of events, saying the police ordered the apartments evacuated. After the Flaggs and Perrymans fled, the gunmen burst into the building and occupied the second floor.|$|E
2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} reexamined displacement {{as originally}} formulated by Murray and Berkun. Similarity {{to the goal}} and spatial placement of <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> were manipulated with an additional variable of brightness (black) and texture (hardware cloth floor) preference in rats. It was found that 5 s traveled least <b>down</b> <b>the</b> white smooth-floor <b>alleys,</b> midway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> gray screen-floor <b>alleys,</b> and farthest <b>down</b> <b>the</b> black hardware cloth-floor alleys. This occurred regardless of the spatial arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> or <b>the</b> color of <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> in which 5 s received the initial approach-avoidance training. Furthermore, 5 s trained in <b>the</b> nonpreferred (white) <b>alleys</b> took {{a greater number of}} trials to recover from approach-avoidance conflict than Ss trained in <b>the</b> preferred (black) <b>alleys.</b> <b>The</b> importance of a preference variable in studies of conflict behavior is stressed. A three-dimensional model predicting recovery from approach-avoidance (AP-AV) conflict was formulated and tested by Murray and Berkun (19 SS). Rats were given an AP-AV conflict in one alley and then allowed to enter adjoining alleys which differed in similarity (color and width) from <b>the</b> original <b>alley.</b> They found that the rats ran least <b>down</b> <b>the</b> original <b>alley,</b> part way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> most similar <b>alley,</b> and farthest <b>down</b> <b>the</b> least similar <b>alley.</b> These results confirmed the predictions of the model which combined Miller's (1944) AP-AV gradients of nearness to a goal and similarity to a goal. However, more recent studies have pointed out that the similarity variable was confounded with a spatial variable in the Murray and Berkun study (Elder, 1962; Elder, Noblin, & Maher, 1961). That is, <b>the</b> least similar <b>alley</b> was also <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> farthest from <b>the</b> original <b>alley.</b> When similarity and spatial arrangement were manipulated parametrically, it appeared that the spatial variable, rather than the similarity variable, determined displacement. A more complete description of this issue can be found in Maher (1966, pp. 154 - 156). A variable which has not been directly examined in much of the AP-AV literature is the a priori preference of the animals used...|$|R

60|$|We {{had little}} time to look about us to see Stratford in the sunshine.
