5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E
5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned {{so as not to}} damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W.

According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, {{but the lack of}} adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E

However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E

The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36million viewers, and the finale was the second most watched television broadcast of the year, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of Friends and Frasier, media critics speculated {{about the fate of}} the sitcom genre. Expressed opinions varied between a signaling {{of the end of the}} sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.|$|E
