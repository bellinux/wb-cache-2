5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and <b>digital</b> <b>communication</b> systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{digital data}} system {{designers}} have formidable future design challenges {{in order to provide}} the mobile user with a quality of service comparable to that of a wireline system in such metrics as responsiveness, quality, and throughput. The goal of this thesis is to address the throughput component of a mobile wireless <b>digital</b> data <b>communication</b> system with a novel design approach. This thesis explores the incorporation of simple software agents into a mobile wireless <b>digital</b> data <b>communication</b> system. The receiving software agent monitors the quality of the wireless channel and the retransmission statistics of the communication system. Based on these observable states from the channel and the recommendations of the software agent's knowledge bases, the agent takes the appropriate actions in the expectation of realizing the greatest possible throughput for the wireless <b>digital</b> data <b>communication</b> system. This thesis utilizes the GSM standard mobile wireless <b>digital</b> data <b>communication</b> platform model. Within the context of this model, the construction and integration of necessary components, such as error-control algorithms and software agent entities, are described in detail.

The Electra communications package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. The system consists of a very large (...) antenna, which is used to transmit data through the Deep Space Network via X-band frequencies at 8GHz, and it demonstrates the use of the [...] at 32GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band amplifiers (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt Ka-band amplifier, and two Small Deep Space Transponders (SDSTs).|$|E

2500|$|The old {{version of}} DAB uses {{punctured}} convolutional coding for its ECC. The coding scheme uses {{unequal error protection}} (UEP), which means that parts of the audio bit-stream that {{are more susceptible to}} errors causing audible disturbances are provided with more protection (i.e. a lower code rate) and vice versa. However, the UEP scheme used on DAB results in there being a grey area in between the user experiencing good reception quality and no reception at all, as opposed to the situation with most other wireless <b>digital</b> <b>communication</b> systems that have a sharp [...] "digital cliff", where the signal rapidly becomes unusable if the signal strength drops below a certain threshold. When DAB listeners receive a signal in this intermediate strength area they experience a [...] "burbling" [...] sound which interrupts the playback of the audio.|$|E

An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards. On May 24, 2017, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer. Ethan Anderton of /Film enjoyed both trailers, stating Homecoming [...] "has {{the potential to be}} the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right". TechCrunch's Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, [...] "You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it’s still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory." [...] Ana Dumaraog for ScreenRant said the second trailer [...] "arguably showed too much of the movie’s overarching narrative", but the third [...] "perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers. Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details, but enjoyed them overall, especially the [...] "vlogging" [...] aspect. Collider's Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha. After the trailers' release, comScore and its PreAct service noted Homecoming was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.|$|E
