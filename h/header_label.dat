In {{the last ten}} years much attention has been focused on transporting packets directly over the optical transport networks. Researches in this area range from simple electronic and optical switching/routing methods to hybrid and more complicated all-optical packet switching systems. However, major bottleneck in all these methods is designing fast, reliable and inexpensive optical routing/switching devices. In this thesis, a method for optical routing usmg fiber Bragg gratings is proposed. In this method, electronic interface is used only for routing information (routing table) update cycle while packet header extraction and switching is done in optical domain. Routing is performed optically by controlling the refractive index change in fiber gratings. Four bits of <b>header</b> (<b>label)</b> information is used for routing packets to three different output routes. The network is simulated and its performance is evaluated by special software of Virtual Photonics...|$|E
40|$|We study a discrete-time {{deterministic}} server queue with infinite buffer {{and with}} packet arrivals {{that depend on}} a multidimensional Markov process. Using the generating functions approach we give a means for obtaining the boundary conditions vector for the case where the value zero is a multiple eigenvalue of the problem. We also derive recursive form expressions for the direct determination of the moments of the queue length. These expressions do not require {{the knowledge of the}} steady state probabilities of the combined source-queue process. Finally our method is applied to two queueing problems related to data transmission through an ATM switch with a queue of infinite length. Closed form expressions for the first two moments of the corresponding queue lengths are obtained. I. INTRODUCTION. During the last years, special interest is deployed on B-ISDNs, due to their ability to simultaneously transfer data, voice and image. B-ISDNs are mainly implemented through Asynchronous Trasfer Mode (ATM) whose basic characteristics are the use of fixed-cize packets called “cells ” as transfer units, and the identification of each communication unit by a cell <b>header</b> <b>label</b> [1], [2].

40|$|Observations of teleseismic {{events at}} remote sites necessitated the develop-ment of a {{portable}} digital recorder that {{is capable of}} continuously recording the output of a three-component set of long-period transducers. A PC is used as a file management facility, operating in an intermittant or "sleeper mode. " Each of the three components are digitized and stored in separate, intelligent A to D cards. When 28 K samples have been generated, a trigger is initiated, and on the transition of the next real time second the real time is latched and power is applied to the PC. The sample count between the trigger and the latched acknowledgment of the trigger provides an absolute time correlation. After the PC has powered up, the data are down-loaded from the three acquisition cards to a PC hard disk and the latched real time forms the <b>header</b> <b>label</b> of the data file. Power is then removed from the PC. Sampling at about 15 samples per second, the PC is switched on every 33, 45 minutes. Boot-up and data down-loading uses approximately 5 watts average power. The associated long-period transducers (Guralp CMG 3) consume about 3 watts and the remain-ing electronics 2 watts. All the electronics are housed in a steel cabinet, and the system uses four solar panels charging two 1 OSAH batteries.

Incompatibility of attributes in terms of measurement rates or <b>header</b> <b>labeling</b> between datasets results in outliers, leading to an inconsistent result from an application. The attributes of consistency are as follow. ① Header frame consistency: consistency of the header frame of the device. This could be categorized into: persistence of PMU header that states whether the PMU header structure is consistent over time, and persistence of PDC header that states whether the PDC header structure is consistent over time. ② Data frame consistency: consistency of data frames of the device. This could be categorized into: persistence of PMU data frame that states whether the PMU data frame structure is consistent over time, and persistence of the PDC data frame that states whether the PDC data frame structure is consistent over time. ③ Order consistency of data frames: whether {{the order in which}} the data frames are recorded is consistent in the device. ④ Consistency in compliance to standards recommended for PMU and all the devices associated with it. ⑤ Consistency of reporting rate: whether data reporting rate is consistent across all devices.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{reporting of}} alcohol consumption, we manipulated the contexts of questions in ways designed to induce social desirability bias. METHOD: We undertook a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomized trial at an Australian public university. Students were recruited by email to a web-based "Research Project on Student Health Behavior. " Respondents answered nine {{questions about their}} physical activity, diet, and smoking. They were unknowingly randomized to a group presented with either (A) three questions about their alcohol consumption or (B) seven questions about their alcohol dependence and problems (under a prominent <b>header</b> <b>labeled</b> "Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test"), followed by the same three alcohol consumption questions from (A). RESULTS: A total of 3, 594 students (mean age = 27, SD = 10) responded and were randomized: 1, 778 to Group A and 1, 816 to Group B. Outcome measures were {{the number of days}} they drank alcohol, the typical number of drinks they consumed per drinking day, and the number of days they consumed six or more drinks. The primary analysis included participants with any alcohol consumption in the preceding 4 weeks (1, 304 in Group A; 1, 340 in Group B) using between-group, two-tailed t tests. RESULTS: In Groups A and B, respectively, means (and SDs) of the number of days drinking were 5. 89 (5. 92) versus 6. 06 (6. 12), p =. 49; typical number of drinks per drinking day: 4. 02 (3. 87) versus 3. 82 (3. 76), p =. 17; and number of days consuming six or more drinks: 1. 69 (2. 94) versus 1. 67 (3. 25), p =. 56.

30|$|To {{enable the}} proper {{management}} of the traffic related to different nodes/applications, packets related to the same content, e.g., different packets carrying parts of the same file or of the same audio/video stream, are grouped into a given traffic flow. MANET and FiWi data planes are able to detect that different packets {{belong to the same}} application flow by exploiting a flow identifier. To this purpose, packets dispatched by the MANET overlay network are managed by the Real Ad-hoc Multi-hop Peer-to-peer (RAMP) middleware and tagged with specific flow ids at the application layer, i.e., exploiting a RAMP packet header field (additional details in [7]). Instead, the FiWi data plane exploits the IPv 6 Flow <b>Label</b> <b>header</b> field to identify packets related to the same flow. Mobile nodes equipped with cellular capabilities managing traversing traffic between FiWi and MANET domains are in charge of modifying packets to maintain flow id information, i.e., forging IPv 6 packets with the appropriate Flow Label in case of traffic from the MANET to the FiWi and specifying the appropriate application layer flow id in RAMP packets for traffic from the FiWi to the MANET domain.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the legislative response in the United States and the European Union to spam proliferation, and their prospects for a successful antispam campaign. The legal regimes {{on both sides of}} the Antlantic try to balance the conflicting interests of spam senders and recepients without much success, to the displeasure of both antispam and prospam campaigners. With both sides employing privacy and free speech rights to rally their cause, maintaining an even balance between the two conflicting interests is nigh impossible, and remains the greatest challenge to both the CAN-SPAM Act and the E-Privacy Directive. The failure of regulation in this respect, the article notes, is symptomatic of the intractable nature of cyberspace, and the obvious limitations of regulatory regime in Internet governance. Using analogous case law, this Article argues that it is unlikely that the U. S. and the European courts would hold accurate <b>header</b> information and <b>labeling</b> provisions unconstitutional or violative of freedom of expression, as canvassed by some observers. This article also highlights the obvious differences between U. S. and E.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms have been introduced for routers supporting TCP dataflows to assist the TCP congestion control mechanism to perform satisfactorily in all circumstances. However, today the Internet is expected to provide a distinctly different service to different users based on the value and content accessed, etc. The most popular AQM algorithm, Random Early Detection (RED), {{is famous for its}} fairness-addressed characteristic, which makes Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation impossible for it, and many other RED-based algorithms, while working on their own. The introduction of the IPv 6 <b>header</b> flow <b>labelling</b> ability will allow new AQM algorithms which can provide differentiated levels of QoS based on user demands to be developed. This thesis aims to develop a methodology for the AQM algorithms to work in conjunction with the IPv 6 flow labelling ability, so as to provide acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) according to the end users' dynamically varying QoS requirements. We aim to offer a simple and generic process, which is adequately adoptable in Differentiated Services (DiffServ) TCP/IPv 6 environments. The contribution of this thesis is four-fold. Firstly it develops a novel approach to allow AQM routers to track the QoS status of the dataflow and provide a differentiated QoS according to user requirement. Secondly, an AQM algorithm is developed from the classic Proportional Integral controller with the ability to support different QoS requirements with a faster response time. Thirdly, we have developed a mechanism to aid the AQM algorithm in predicting the queue length and improving system performance. Finally, we have proposed schemes to provide service differentiation for flows with different priorities in DiffServ Networks. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms through simulations in Network Simulator 2 (NS 2). The proposed methodologies are shown to exhibit many desirable properties, such as providing differentiated throughputs and fast system response. Compared with traditional AQM techniques, they offer significant improvements in guaranteeing different levels of QoS in TCPIIPv 6 networks according to user requirements and the priority of the dataflows...|$|R

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1998). All Rights Reserved. This document describes the Provider Architecture for Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering (PASTE) for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Providing differentiated services in ISPs is a challenge because the scaling problems presented by {{the sheer number of}} flows present in large ISPs makes the cost of maintaining per-flow state unacceptable. Coupled with this, large ISPs need the ability to perform traffic engineering by directing aggregated flows of traffic along specific paths. PASTE addresses these issues by using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [1] and the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [2] to create a scalable traffic management architecture that supports differentiated services. This document assumes that the reader has at least some familiarity with both of these technologies. 2. 0 Terminology In common usage, a packet flow, or a flow, refers to a unidirectional stream of packets, distributed over time. Typically a flow has very fine granularity and reflects a single interchange between hosts, such as a TCP connection. An aggregated flow is a number of flows that share forwarding state and a single resource reservation along a sequence of routers. Li & Rekhter Informational [Page 1] RFC 2430 PASTE October 1998 One mechanism for supporting aggregated flows is Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). In MPLS, packets are tunneled by wrapping them in a minimal header [3]. Each such <b>header</b> contains a <b>label,</b> that carries both forwarding and resource reservation semantics. MPLS defines mechanisms to install label-based forwarding information along a series of Label Switching Routers (LSRs) to construct a Label Switched Path (LSP). LSPs can also be associated with resource reservation information. One protocol for constructing such LSPs is the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [4]. When used with the Explicit Route Object (ERO) [5], RSVP can be used to construct an LSP along an explicit rout...|$|R
40|$|Large {{air-cooled}} {{heat exchangers}} (ACHEs) are most popularly {{implemented in the}} petrochemical and power industries at arid locations. They operate on a simple concept of convective heat transfer, whereby air in the surrounding atmosphere is caused to flow across a tube bundle, which in turn transports a process fluid. The distribution {{and direction of the}} process fluid flow may furthermore be guided via a set of appropriately located header boxes, which essentially consist of a collection of welded flat plates and nozzle attachments. Perforations on one of the faces of these boxes serve as an interface to the tube bundle. The overall design and construction of an ACHE is commonly regulated by an American Petroleum Institute (API) standard, which is required to be used in conjunction with acceptable design codes. In spite of this, the design of certain header box configurations remains of prominent concern. It is the focus of the present study to investigate the approach adopted for a <b>header</b> box variant <b>labelled</b> as the removable cover type. In this configuration, one of the plates used to construct the header box is fastened and sealed by a collection of bolted joints and a gasket, allowing it to be removed. One appropriate design code for the header box equipment is the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) boiler and pressure vessel code. However, it provides no specific approach pertaining to the removable cover design. Instead it has been commonplace in industry for a number of aspects from this code to be synthesized, together with a collection of assumptions surrounding the header box behaviour, into an all encompassing design by rule approach. In this approach, the header box behaviour is accepted as being planar, whilst circumstances such as nozzle attachments and associated loading would suggest that a more comprehensive approach should be undertaken. The aim of the present study is therefore to critically evaluate the current practice, and establish its adequacy. To do so, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of an example header box design is developed. Subsequent comparisons with the stress distribution predicted via current practice show that the existing analytical model gives inaccurate and, in cases, overly conservative results. A new analytical approach developed from rigid frame theory is demonstrated to provide improved correlation with FEM. The linear elastic design by analysis approach, presented in the ASME code, is also utilised as a method for establishing design adequacy. Results obtained via design by analysis incorporating the finite element method are shown to be less conservative than those arising from design by rule methods. The design by analysis approach is also used to conduct a more detailed investigation of nozzle placement and external loading. In general, the effect of including a nozzle did not result in a significant increase in side plate stress, with failure more likely to occur within the nozzle wall.
