2500|$|SIP, then Italy's {{national}} telephone company, was exceedingly inefficient {{on numerous}} occasions related with Moro's detainment. In particular, after the assault at via Fani, all the phone communications in the area were inoperative. Other cases included when, on 14 April, journalists of Rome's newspaper Il Messaggero were waiting for {{a phone call from}} the terrorists. The six phone lines in the newspaper's office had been connected to police central but, when the call arrived, DIGOS reported that all of them had been cut, with the result that the caller could not be identified. On 15 March 1978, the day before the capture of Moro, SIP had been alerted. However, after Moro had been kidnapped, an inspection of the telephone lines in the area of via Fani showed that they were all out of order. This prevented any possible witness contact with the police before the ambush. The commander of DIGOS during the kidnapping days described SIP as [...] "totally un-cooperative", and stated that [...] "in no occasion <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>find</b> the origin of the kidnappers' calls", concluding by noting that Michele Principe, then general director of STET, the company owning SIP, was a member of P2.|$|E
