40|$|Water flowing on a {{sprinkled}} {{tube bundle}} forms three basic modes: the Droplet mode (the liquid drips from one tube to another), the Jet mode (with an increasing flow rate, the droplets merge into a column) and the Membrane (Sheet) mode (with a further {{increase in the}} flow rate of the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> liquid, the <b>columns</b> merge and create sheets between the tubes. With a sufficient flow rate, the sheets merge at this stage, and the tube bundle is completely covered by a thin liquid film). There are several factors influencing both the individual modes and the heat transfer. Beside the above-mentioned <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> liquid flow rate, these are for instance the tube diameters, the tube pitches in the tube bundle, or the physical conditions of the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> liquid. This paper presents a summary of data measured at atmospheric pressure, with a tube bundle consisting of copper tubes of 12 millimetres in diameter, and with a studied tube length of one meter. The tubes are situated horizontally one above another at a pitch of 15 to 30 mm, {{and there is a}} distribution tube placed above them with water flowing through apertures of 1. 0 mm in diameter at a 9. 2 mm span. Two thermal conditions have been tested with all pitches: 15 °C to 40 °C and 15 °C to 45 °C. The temperature of the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> liquid, which was heated during the flow through the exchanger, was 15 °C at the distribution tube input.

40|$|The {{complexities}} of two-phase flow and evaporation on a tube bundle present important {{problems in the}} design of heat exchangers and the understanding of the physical phenomena taking place. The development of structured surfaces to enhance boiling heat transfer and thus reduce the size of evaporators adds another level of complexity to the modeling of such heat exchangers. Horizontal <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporators have the potential to be widely used in large refrigeration systems and heat pumps, in the petrochemical industry and for sea water desalination units, but {{there is a need to}} improve the understanding of <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation mechanisms to provide accurate thermal design methods. The characterization of the effect of enhanced surfaces on the boiling phenomena occurring in <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporators is thus expected to increase and optimize the performance of a tube bundle. In this work, the existing LTCM <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> facility was modified and instrumented to perform <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation measurements on single tube row and a small tube bundle. Four types of tubes were tested including: a plain tube, an enhanced condensing tube (Gewa-C+LW) and two enhanced boiling tubes (Turbo-EDE 2 and Gewa-B 4) to extend the existing database. The current investigation includes results for two refrigerants, R 134 a and R 236 fa, at a saturation temperature of Tsat = 5  °C, liquid film Reynolds numbers ranging from 0 to 3000, at heat fluxes between 20 and 60 kW/m 2 in pool boiling and <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> configurations. Measurements of the local heat transfer coefficient were obtained and utilized to improve the current prediction methods. Finally, the understanding of the physical phenomena governing the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation of liquid refrigerants has been improved.

40|$|In <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> {{evaporation}} process {{the heat is}} transferred from the condensing fluid to the liquid flowing over it. Falling film types of evaporators are widely used in refrigeration, desalination, petroleum refining, chemical industries, etc. Compared to flooded type evaporators, <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporators need less amount of refrigerant and will give higher heat transfer rates even at lower heat fluxes. Tube geometry and tube size {{have an important role}} on the performance of the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporators. Geometry of the tube can be varied by heat transfer enhancing techniques and also by changing the shape of the tube. Thermal spray metal coating is a heat transfer enhancement technique which is done by spraying molten metal on any heat transfer surface. Vertical plate with sinusoidal corrugation is a surface enhancement technique which can be cheaper, compact and lighter for <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation compared to shell and tube configuration. This paper presents a two dimensional CFD study of water <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation on a thermal spray metal coated vertical corrugated conduits. Two-phase flow simulation is done by using a finite volume method based commercial software, with turbulence modeling which is done by k-Â two equations with shear stress transport (SST). Sinusoidal corrugations with different porosity have been selected for the study. Evaporation and heat transfer during <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation are included through user defined functions (UDFs).

40|$|Abstract Falling film heat {{exchanger}} {{is widely used}} in the industry, because of its high heat transfer coefficient, low liquid quantity and lower fouling factor. The {{heat exchanger}} considered here is a <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> one. It consists of a unique feeding tube, supply liquid such as pure water over seven parallel horizontal tubes which are heated internally. Convection heat transfer takes place outside the tubes surface and it is experimentally investigated. The <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> over the test tubes {{may be in the}} form of a droplet, jet or sheet. A combination of these forms is also possible. The tested tubes are made of copper and have 28. 5 mm outer diameter and 300 mm length, each. They are arranged in series so that heated water enters each tube with the same flow rate, from bottom to top. The temperatures at the entrance and exit of the hot water flow and the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> liquid are recorded. Also, the average surface temperature at one test tube is measured using five impeded thermocouples. An infrared camera is used to show the temperature distribution on the test tubes surfaces. The flow rates of each liquid path are controlled and monitored. The effects of different <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> forms and hot water flow rate, on the heat transfer coefficient are studied. Initial results show that changing the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> forms and internal flow rate has a significant effect on the heat transfer coefficient. They also show that jet mode <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> has the best heat transfer coefficient...|$|R

40|$|China Scholarship CouncilMicroalgae, {{one of the}} {{important}} biofuel producers, have received considerable attention recently. Dewatering is one of the bottlenecks for its industrialization due to the dilute nature of the suspensions and the small cell size. Traditional liquid-solid separation processes are not efficient for dewatering of microalgae suspensions. In this study, <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation was employed for dewatering of microalgae suspension, which is a popular process for concentrating heat sensitive materials. The heat transfer coefficient was as high as 9414. 20 W/m(2) K with mass flow rate of 0. 233 kg/s, Delta T of 1. 21 degrees C, and microalgae concentration of 60 g/L. The <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation process can be made highly energy efficient if it is coupled with Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) or Thermal Vapor Recompression (TVR) system. Heat and mass transfer characteristics of <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation of microalgae suspension have been investigated here. This will provide the fundamentals for future feasibility study of utilizing the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation in the microalgal industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{with this}} master`s thesis {{project was to}} examine what effect {{structured}} heating surfaces have on the mass and heat transfer properties of <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation. Based on a literature study, some alternative surface structures that could be of interest for <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation of black liquor were selected for further investigation. A new structure was also selected to be tested. Tubes of copper and PVC were utilized {{as a basis for}} the experimental investigation. Five different copper test tubes were studied: one smooth, two equipped with dimples located in a row or diagonal towards each other, one spirally threaded and one spirally winded with a copper thread. Two test tubes of PVC were studied: one smooth and one equipped with the new structure. The tests were carried out by attaching the different test tubes one by one to the lower edge of a vertically placed <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> tube. Ordinary tap water was utilized as the testing fluid. A divider placed {{at the top of the}} <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> tube allowed an evenly distributed film to be formed that flowed therafter down over the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> tube wall and the test tube. Since the test tubes were not provided with a heating element, the mass transport was measured from the test tubes to the <b>falling</b> <b>film.</b> This result was then used to estimate the heat transfer through calculations. As mass transport medium benzoic acid was chosen which was applied on the test tubes dissolved in a small amount of acetone. The mixture of dissolved benzoic aid in acetone was sprayed with a spurt bottle on the test tube surface, where the acetone was evaporated and left behind a relatively even layer of benzoic acid. For each test run, four samples of the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> were taken out at fixed time points after that the <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> had passed over the benzoic acid covered test tube. The mass concentration of benzoic acid was then determined with the help of spectrophotometry. The different test tubes mass flux were determined from the measured mass concentrations and utilized film flow after that the benzoic acid covered surfaces had been calculated for each trial run. These mass fluxes were then divided by the solubility of benzoic acid in water to estimate the mass transport coefficients which were in turn used to estimate the heat transport coefficients (heat transition number) based on the Chilton-Colburn analogy. The results indicate that all the tested surface modifications should be able to enhance the mass and heat transport in a <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> of water comperad to a smooth surface. The new structure and the spirally threaded structure achived the highest enhancements (113 and 114 %) of the estimated heat transport coefficients compared to the reference smooth tube structure. The heat transport coefficient enhancements for the other structures tested were 69 % (structure with dimples located diagonally towards each other), 65 % (structure with a spirally winded copper thread), and 44 % for the structure with dimples located in a row towards each other...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model is developed to investigate fundamental flow physics and transport phenomena of evaporating wavy-laminar <b>falling</b> liquid <b>films</b> {{of water and}} black liquor. The {{computational model}} is formulated from first principles based on the conservation laws for mass, momentum, energy and species {{in addition to a}} phase transport equation for capturing interface deformation and evolution. Free surface waves are generated by monochromatic perturbation of velocity. Continuum models for interfacial evaporation define source terms for liquid vaporization and species enrichment in the conservation laws. A phenomenological crystallization model is derived to account for species depletion due to salt precipitation during black liquor <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> evaporation. Using highly resolved numerical grids on parallel computers, the computational model is implemented to analyze the dynamics of capillary separation eddies in low Reynolds number <b>falling</b> <b>films,</b> investigate the dominant mechanisms of heat transfer enhancement in <b>falling</b> <b>films</b> at moderately high Reynolds numbers and study the fundamental wave structures and wave induced transport in black liquor <b>falling</b> <b>films</b> on flat and cylindrical walls. From simulation results, a theory based on the dynamics of wavefront streamwise pressure gradient is proposed to explain interfacial waves interaction that give rise to multiple backflow regions in films dominated by solitary-capillary waves. The study shows that the mechanism of heat transfer enhancement in moderately high Reynolds number films follows from relatively lower conduction thermal resistance and higher crosswise convective transport at newly formed intermediate wavefronts. Interfacial phenomena such as wave-breaking and vapor entrainment observed in black liquor <b>falling</b> <b>films</b> is explained in terms of a mechanistic theory based on evolution of secondary instabilities and large amplitude wave force imbalances.

The main aim with the project has been to study how the {{heat transfer coefficient}} {{is influenced by the}} additional mass transfer resistance that is introduced when a mixture is used instead of a pure refrigerant.

This indicates that the additional mass transfer resistance when a mixture is used is small in a <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> at such conditions. This is probably due to the small film thickness.

40|$|In pure heat transfer, {{specifications}} of effectiveness, fluid properties, {{and flows}} enable {{calculation of the}} heat exchanger area.

The exchange of mass across the liquid-vapor interface involves the generation of heat.

The <b>falling</b> <b>film</b> flow rate coupled to the physical properties of kinematic viscosity and surface tension govern the flow regime of a vertical <b>falling</b> <b>film.</b> Wavy-laminar, roll-wave laminar, and turbulent flows will develop convective contributions that can enhance the transfer of mass into the film.
