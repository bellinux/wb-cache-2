40|$|Abstract: Head {{injury is}} one of the most common cause of deaths in car-to-pedestrian collisions. To reduce the {{severity}} of such injuries, many international safety committees have performed headform impact test for pedestrian protection. In this paper, an adult <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> model is developed based on the finite element (FE) method and validated through the numerical simulation. The skin material of <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> is known as polyvinyl chloride skin (PVC) and its material was assumed as viscoelastic. The viscoelastic parameters of headform skin are identified by a series of trial and error methods. The new developed FE adult <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> is verified by the drop test and FE JARI adul...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{pedestrian}} safety during an impact with a vehicle, subsystem tests have been defined to evaluate the aggressiveness of the front-end of cars. These subsystems tests have to be reproducible and {{are representative of the}} three decomposed impacts of the pedestrian with the car: lower leg on the bumper, upper leg on the hood, head on the hood or the windscreen. The velocity, angle and mass of the adult <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> and its impact area are invariable parameters. Upper legform impactor parameters are determined by vehicle characteristics. Lower legform impactor parameters are invariable (velocity and positioning). Nevertheless, these decoupled tests d...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the mechanical behavior of windshield laminated glass {{in the case of a}} pedestrian's head impact. Windshield FE models were set up using different combinations for the modeling of glass and PVB, with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm and 10 mm). Each windshield model was impacted with a standard adult <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> in an LS-DYNA simulation environment, and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results indicated that the behavior of the windshield model with a double-layered shell of glass and PVB and a tied element connection support test results from previous studies. Furthermore, the influence of glass fracture stress on the same windshield model was investigated, and the cracked area and the peak value of the headform's linear acceleration were determined by the critical fracture stress. It was observed that a 50 -MPa fracture stress in the glass best p...|$|E

Ten head impacts between {{pedestrians}} {{and cars}} were reconstructed {{to compare the}} head injuries sustained by pedestrians {{with the results of}} reconstruction tests using the <b>headform</b> <b>impactors</b> designated by the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) Working Group 10 for assessing pedestrian head protection. The methodology of this study included at-scene accident investigation, computer simulation, and physical reconstruction in a laboratory of the head impacts that occurred in the accident cases that were investigated. The main finding was that the results from using the EEVC <b>headform</b> <b>impactors</b> test correlate well with the severity of any head injury, as measured by the Abbreviated Injury Scale, in actual pedestrian accidents. Head impacts that exceeded a HIC value of 1000 were positively associated with head injuries that were AIS 3 or above.

40|$|A pop-up hood {{system has}} been {{developed}} to reduce the severity of head injuries to pedestrians in pedestrian-to-automobile accidents. The system employs sensors located on the bumper to detect impact with a pedestrian. If an impact occurs, a signal is sent to an actuator to raise the rear portion of the engine hood approximately 100 mm. This provides a space between the engine and other hard components and the hood, resulting in reduced pedestrian head injuries. Previous studies have mainly employed <b>headform</b> <b>impactors</b> to evaluate the head injury criteria (HIC) values for pop-up hoods. This report describes studies {{of the effect of}} the pop-up hood on injury parameters and kinematics using the POLAR pedestrian dummy. The effectiveness of the pop-up hood system was confirmed by the significant reduction of HIC values in impact tests using the POLAR dummy...|$|R
40|$|Consumer and {{regulatory}} tests for improvement in pedestrian protection are now firmly established. A {{change in the}} vehicle frontal stiffness profiles {{as a result of}} these tests is less well established. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge base on the vehicle frontal stiffness in pedestrian impacts. Using data recorded as part of the European New Car Assessment Programme, a series of 139 impact tests using <b>headform</b> and legform <b>impactors</b> were used to calculate the vehicle frontal stiffness profile of eight cars manufactured between 2006 and 2010. To account for one of the limitations of the legform as a device for measuring the stiffness of a surface, a methodology for determining a correction factor using the multi-body modelling software MADYMO is presented. Comparison with previous published work showed that the stiffness of the windscreen was unchanged, but that the stiffnesses of the bonnet and front bumper were reduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the effects of pedestrian gait, vehicle-front geometry and impact velocity on the dynamic responses of the head. The multi-body dynamic (MBD) models were used to simulate the head responses in vehicle to pedestrian collisions with different vehicle types in terms of head-impact point measured with Wrap Around Distance (WAD), head relative velocity and impact angle. Furthermore, the distribution of the head contact point on the vehicle fronts is analysed for a comparison of the contact point with the testing areas in the EEVC <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> test procedures. A simulation matrix is established using five vehicle types, two mathematical models of the pedestrians represented a 50 th male adult and a 6 -year-old child as well as seven pedestrian gaits based on typical postures in pedestrian accidents. In order to simulate a large range of impact conditions, four vehicle velocities (30 km/h, 40 km/h, 50 km/h and 60 km/h) are considered for each pedestrian position and vehicle type. The results indicated that the pedestrian gait and vehicle-impact velocity strongly influence head-impact condition. It is obvious that due to different vehicle-front geometry, the head-impact velocity, impact angle and head-impact point could be varied as well. This study provides suggestions for different head-impact conditions of subsystem test to the front part of different passenger vehicles...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the headform was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{analysis}} of predicted injuries to the lower leg and head of pedestrians in vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions through finite element (FE) simulations were analyzed. Today, pedestrian regulatory tests consist of subsystem tests using impactors that are made to hit the vehicle; there is no use of any pedestrian crash test dummy. Hence, the kinematics of the impactors used in the testing procedure can be questioned. An alternative way to assess vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction and injury risks is {{through the use of}} a FE-Human Body Model (HBM). This thesis presents a comparison of injuries predicted by simulated regulatory tests and injuries predicted by a modified Total Human Body Model for Safety (THUMS), with KTH head and neck model, when impacting an advanced FE-model of a sedan passenger car. The injuries in focus are those sustained to the lower extremities, mainly to the knee ligaments and tibia bone fracture, and the head. Further, real-life vehicle-to-pedestrian accidents were reconstructed with the modified THUMS to indicate the power of accident reconstructions using FE simulations. The modified THUMS and the leg impactor did not predict similar risk of leg injuries. THUMS predicted lower ligament elongation and higher tibia bending moments than the impactor. The ligament elongation difference between THUMS and impactor is not comparable. For tibia bending moments, THUMS predicted 18 % higher bending moments than impactor for impact point P 3 and tibia- 2 cross-section for small passenger vehicle-to-pedestrian collision, on average it was 60 % higher for Flex-PLI positioning 75 mm above ground and 42 % higher when Flex-PLI is positioned according to THUMS walking stance. For tibia injury risk as predicted with modified THUMS, vehicle velocity and pedestrian impact location along the width of the energy absorber were significant. Moreover, presence of a femur fracture influenced the tibia bending moment; femure fracture varied as a function of impact location and vehicle velocity. The injuries to the head as predicted by the modified THUMS, with Rigid KTH head and neck model, and <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> were found to have similar head impact kinematics with similar head impact duration and behavior of acceleration curve. Predicted head injuries, using the injury measures HIC 15 and BRIC, were influenced by the head impact location on the vehicle, vehicle height in relation to THUMS and vehicle velocity. In the accident reconstructions modified THUMS model predicted high HIC 15 values, representing high risk of head injuries as compared to the head injury reported in the two cases that were reconstructed. The difference is qualitative only, no quantitative difference conclusion can be drawn from the results. This deviation in results could be explained due to the fact of non-availability of head impact locations in the database cases, not including the vehicle deceleration which may be present during actual accident and non-inclusion of road and weather conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} head impact dynamics and to establish risk functions for head injuries by mathematical reconstructions of real-world car-to-pedestrian accidents. Furthermore, an attempt was made to develop an approach for the design and evaluation of head-protective devices. Child and adult pedestrian accidents from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database were analyzed and selected for reconstruction. These accident cases contained detailed information concerning the car, pedestrian and environment in the pre-crash, crash and post-crash phases. Two approaches, multibody system (MBS) dynamics, implemented by the MADYMO program; and the finite element method (FEM), implemented by the LS-DYNA program, were used for this study. The child pedestrian accidents were reconstructed using corresponding MBS pedestrian and car models. The GEBOD program was used to generate the mass/inertial properties and characteristic dimensions of various body segments, based upon anthropometric data of the victims. The MBS car models were developed according to the geometry of the cars involved in the accidents. The contact properties of the car structures were obtained from impactor tests. Initial conditions in the reconstruction, such as car impact speed, pedestrian position and posture, were set up according to accident information. The adult pedestrian accidents were first reconstructed using the MBS approach to reproduce pedestrian kinematics. A validated finite element (FE) head model with detailed anatomy structure was then used to reconstruct the head-to-windshield impacts. The initial impact conditions â including head impact velocity, head impact location, and head orientation â were defined according to the results from the MBS reconstructions. Brain injury parameters, such as intracranial stress and pressure, were calculated and correlated with the injury outcomes using a logistic regression model. An FE dummy model was developed as a substitute for a mechanical pedestrian dummy, and was validated on both component and full-scale levels across an extensive range of tests. The FE dummy model was used for the design and optimization of a pedestrian airbag system. The accident analysis demonstrated that the head was the most vulnerable body region in pedestrian accidents. Its injury severity depends on car impact speed and head impact location. In child pedestrian accidents, head impact locations were mainly on the hood top. In adult pedestrian accidents, the MAIS 2 head injuries were frequently caused by impacts with the windshield centre, while impacts with the windshield edge and A-pillar were associated with a higher risk of AIS 3 + head injuries. The accident reconstructions using MBS models showed that head impact conditions depend on the shape and stiffness of the car front, car impact speed, and pedestrian stature. In general, the head impact speed is proportional to the car impact speed and is lower than the maximum head speed. The head impact angle could be influenced by several factors, such as pedestrian height, hood edge height, hood angle and car impact speed. The head impact timing increases as a function of pedestrian height and is inversely proportional to car impact speed. The HIC is an important criterion in predicting head injury risk in pedestrian accidents, with a tolerance level that could vary considerably among individuals. At a HIC value of 700, the corresponding AIS 2 + head injury risk of a child pedestrian varies between 40 % and 68 %. The calculated brain injury parameters using the FE head model show a good correlation with brain injury severity. Critical values of the parameters were determined for AIS 3 + brain injuries, which are 256 kPa of coup pressure, 152 kPa of countercoup pressure, 14. 8 kPa of Von Mises stress, and 7. 9 kPa of shear stress. Compared with <b>headform</b> <b>impactors,</b> a pedestrian dummy could render a more biofidelic response as to head impact kinematics. The optimized airbag system could reduce the HIC value of the FE dummy head from 2, 960 to 602 at the car impact speed of 40 km/h. The results also indicate that the protection performance could be influenced by design parameters such as ignition timing and the presence of a vent hole on the airbag. This study demonstrates that accident reconstructions could help to promote knowledge of head injury mechanisms in pedestrian accidents. This knowledge could be utilized, with proper mathematical tools such as the FE pedestrian dummy model, to develop safety countermeasures and thereby enhance pedestrian head protection...|$|R
