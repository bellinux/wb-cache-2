40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown robust {{associations}} between morality and cleanliness. However, {{it is not}} known whether this association is equally consequential for everyone. I predicted that individuals high (versus low) in god-belief {{would be more likely to}} draw upon feelings <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> to represent their moral concerns. To test this hypothesis, I used a two week daily sampling protocol. In an initial session, I measured participants’ (N = 135) level of god-belief. I then measured participants’ levels <b>of</b> daily <b>cleanliness,</b> neuroticism, impulsivity, and prosocial behaviors every evening. Daily feelings <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> predicted lower levels of neuroticism, but only for those high in god-belief. Daily impulsive behaviors predicted lower feelings <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> and daily prosocial behaviors predicted higher feelings <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> God-belief moderated these effects such that they were stronger for those higher, than lower, in god-belief. In closing, I discuss potential reasons for these moderation effects and other theoretical considerations...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{bathroom}} reflects Western {{ideas on}} the handling of bodily wastes, and consequently ideas <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> Taking a historical study as the point of departure, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to understand the extent to which the idea <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> influences the possibility of converting the water closet to a more sustainable technology. An examination of historical changes demonstrates that our present ideas on cleanliness are distinct in their own way. It also demonstrates that our present ideas <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> represent a drawing together of several loose ends, development towards which having been incoherent. Great variation has been apparent in practices surrounding, and the social importance <b>of,</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> People have lived in different ways and have had different ideas about how to behave. The Roman culture thought of bathing and relieving oneself as social duties. In the Middle Ages, uncleanliness ruled the day as people had a very natural and relaxed attitude to bodily waste. Following the urbanisation process, <b>cleanliness</b> was thought <b>of</b> as a step towards progress and a sanitational cure for epidemics in the cities. In more recent times, cleanliness became a project of orderliness and became institutionalised in society. The water closet is inextricably linked with our present ideas <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> This could impede a future conversion of the water closet, these ideas in several ways conflicting with the more sustainable toilet system. Nevertheless, it is also a point of this paper to illustrate that our present ideas <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> are not self-evident. On the contrary, our ideas are contextually bound and might thus change, for instance, due to a strengthening of e. g. the environmental discourse...|$|R

Cleanliness is an important virtue, and maintaining the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> a body is not an individual but a controlled common social duty. In the tradition of the Udmurts, the sauna was and still is {{a very important part of}} daily and ritual life. It is understood that in the sauna one is cleaned physically and spiritually. The act of bathing in the sauna means also purifying morally. Special cleansing and purifying regulations are required before calendrical and commemorative rituals.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{acquisition and}} utilization of piece parts and assemblies for contamination sensitive applications requires application <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> acceptance criteria. Contamination {{can be classified}} using many different schemes. One common scheme is classification as organic, ionic and particulate contaminants. These may be present in and {{on the surface of}} solid components and assemblies or may be dispersed in various gaseous or liquid media. This discussion will focus on insoluble particle contamination on the surface of piece parts and assemblies. <b>Cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> parts can be controlled using two strategies, referred to as gross cleanliness and precision cleanliness. Under a gross cleanliness strategy acceptance is based on visual cleanliness. This approach introduces a number of concerns that render it unsuitable for controlling <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> high technology products. Under the precision cleanliness strategy, subjective, visual assessment <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> is replaced by objective measurement <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness.</b> When a precision cleanliness strategy is adopted there naturally arises the question: How clean is clean enough?

40|$|For {{semiconductor}} components, {{the demand}} {{to improve performance}} and velocity as well as energy consumption is met through miniaturization. The continuing trend to miniaturize semiconductor structures can be observed since several decades and requires, among other things, sophisticated cleanliness technology. Cleanliness technology {{in this context is}} to be understood as the chain of all activities taken to control and reduce all contamination harmful to the product. Because of the very challenging particulate and outgassing contamination levels, semiconductor industry still claims technological and economic leadership in terms <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> technology. But no longer only semiconductor industry is relying on cleanliness technology as the following case studies graphically demonstrate: In life science industries, mainly microbiological contamination is controlled to prevent users and patients from severe health issues caused by poor hygiene or <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> the highly effective pharmaceuticals or very innovative medical devices. Space exploration combines nowadays the challenging <b>cleanliness</b> requirements <b>of</b> semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry to be in compliance with the planetary protection program, the guiding principle to preserve planetary and terrestrial conditions for future generations. And even automotive industry discovered the benefit <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> technology almost ten years ago: Metallic micro sized particles (> 50 µm) were identified as critical contamination because they can cause malfunctions in fluidic and electronic vehicle systems such as antiblocking systems. By having a closer look on these three case studies, the increasing importance and on-going diversification <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> technology can be shown and also the challenging future requirements <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> technology {{over the next few years}} can be derived...|$|R
