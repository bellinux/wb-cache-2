50|$|Stacey and Sanjay find a {{dilapidated}} shack and enter cautiously. They see Brian {{in a chair}} {{with his back to}} them and approach him quietly, only to realize that he's dead. The pig people arrive at the shack and barricade the door. One of them breaks through the wall, but Sanjay hits him in the arm with an axe. The shack catches fire; Stacey and Sanjay flee into the woods. They discover Melody hanging upside down in the bone tree. They run, and the crazed, deformed clan chases them. They hide behind a tree, letting the killers pass without seeing them, but the <b>killers</b> <b>wind</b> up finding them and force them to continue running. They soon bump into the Pig Bitch, who knocks them out and captures them.|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins in}} the bayou itself, as a family of {{alligators}} frolic in the water {{to the tune of}} the Cajun classic “Iko Iko". The story then sets off on an historical exploration of how New Orleans rose up hundreds of years ago out of an untamed swampland - and went on to become celebrated around the world as “The Big Easy", a place where a feeling of joyful freedom permeated the music, the food and the city’s inimitable talent for turning “good times” into an art form. Here, a spicy gumbo of African, Native American, Cajun, Creole and Southern influences forged a completely unique culture. Louisiana’s coastal location (the state contains 40% of all the coastal wetlands in the continental U.S. according to the National Wetlands Research Center) was both a boon and a bane to the city. New Orleans evolved into the busiest port in the U.S., but after engineers diverted the Mississippi River, depleting the wetlands, the city became increasingly vulnerable to the <b>killer</b> <b>winds</b> and rising waters of seasonal hurricanes.|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} later, Kitty's husband {{is set to}} present an award at a Dutch Music awards show. Before the awards show, Kitty is {{introduced}} to 'Pamela' - the woman she suspected was sleeping with her husband, but who is actually a Belgian businesswoman he was doing business with. Kitty frantically tries to call off the planned killing - which will happen with a bomb planted in the appropriate awards envelope - not knowing that there actually IS a Pamela her husband has been sleeping with. The murderer, chased by security guards around the parking lot, steals a truck and tries to make his escape. Kitty runs on stage and throws the bomb away just in time. However, the <b>killer</b> <b>winds</b> up driving the truck through a back wall, running over not only Kitty's husband, but Pamela as well, who had run up to him just before. Now happy {{that her husband was}} killed for an actual adultery, she kisses the killer. A few seconds later, he vanishes before the police can apprehend him. One year later, the three widows are seen enjoying life on the boat of their late husbands - along with the killer, who has had plastic surgery done to make him look more handsome.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1998 piece L. Brent Bozell III (the {{head of the}} {{conservative}} watchdog Media Research Center) took issue with Miller's politics while dismissing his 1996 {{claim to be a}} [...] "conservative libertarian" [...] saying Miller [...] "hasn't a clue about the meaning of either term." [...] To advance his argument he pointed to Miller's quote [...] "When it comes to paranoia, most folks more concerned with the federal government... but I'm made more paranoid by corporations. Car companies that lie about their safety records; chemical firms selling toxic weed <b>killers</b> that <b>wind</b> up in our food... Let's face it, the idiots in Washington, D.C. can't even investigate a conspiracy, much less create one." [...] Bozell held that it was impossible for a true libertarian to fear the private sector more than the public sector. As late as July 11, 2000, Bozell stated that while Miller's jabs against Hillary Clinton proved he was no Democrat, reviewing his statements on his HBO program [...] "there's not an impartial bone in his body". Bozell complained that in 1992 Miller [...] "likened Pat Buchanan to a Nazi". He said Miller told [...] "slimy barbs" [...] and [...] "vicious 'jokes'" [...] in late 1994 about Newt Gingrich, such as [...] "text Contract with America about his political vision for the future of America be available through the Mein Kampf of the Month Club." [...] Bozell also took issue with Miller defining moderate Republican as [...] "someone who refers to blacks as 'coloreds.'" [...] Bozell complained of Miller's jokes against Trent Lott's opposition to legalizing homosexuality, his satire of the NRA's uncompromising political position, and his suggestion that the GOP was insincere in their desire to end teen pregnancy because its prevalence granted them the votes of social conservatives. Bozell also took issue with Miller's describing Rush Limbaugh's show as one that [...] "barely educates also reinforces the narrow-minded prejudices of both the host and the listener." [...] He concluded that Miller being hired by ABC for Monday Night Football was proof that the network was biased, and the lack of public outcry over this bias was a proof of the decline of popular culture.|$|R
5000|$|Dominic Cuthbert of Starburst rated it 7/10 {{stars and}} wrote, [...] "Clown may be formulaic and filled {{up to the}} guts with {{familiar}} tropes, but it is tremendous fun and an effective body horror." [...] Howard Gorman of Scream magazine rated it 5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "With Clown the filmmakers have created an all-new monster of demonic proportions and it's a concept that certainly deserves to spawn a sequel or two as the sky really is the limit." [...] Jeremy Aspinall of the Radio Times rated it 2/5 stars and described it as [...] "efficiently put together if a little sedate in pace". Anton Bitel of Little White Lies wrote that the film doubles as an equally harrowing story of [...] "a family man's losing struggle with his own paedophiliac impulses". [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Even though it's mostly a bore, there's still some really cool and fun stuff scattered throughout." [...] Keri O'Shea of Brutal as Hell wrote, [...] "Neither frightening nor funny, here's another lesson to prove that fake trailers are often fine just as they are." [...] Joel Harley of HorrorTalk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, [...] "What could {{have been one of}} the few great <b>killer</b> clown movies <b>winds</b> up as yet another disappointment, being too uneven in tone and pace to be considered a success." [...] Clown currently has 48% on Rotten Tomatoes.|$|R
