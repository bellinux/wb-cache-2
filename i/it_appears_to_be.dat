5|$|S. g. robinsoni {{is found}} on the Atherton Tableland in northeastern Queensland. First {{described}} by Gregory Mathews in 1912, it is combined with magnirostris by some authors. Little researched, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smaller than other subspecies.|$|E
5|$|A {{hologram}}, used on {{the note}} which appears to see the hologram image change between the value and a window or doorway, but in the background, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rainbow-coloured concentric circles of micro-letters moving from the centre {{to the edges of}} the patch.|$|E
5|$|A. r. scottii, {{described}} by George Sennett in 1888, is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a darker gray than A. r. eremoeca and has narrower and darker rufous streaks on its breast.|$|E

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although the dome {{was thought to be}} formed by the older Comondú volcanics, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a product of La Reforma activity.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, aperture, whorl contour, umbilical region, and color pattern. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the case that many species have a stable color pattern, while other species seem to vary tremendously. Adequate unselected field samples will enable {{a better understanding of}} the relative stability or variability of particular species in single localities.|$|E

5|$|Takalik Abaj Monument23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period, and is found in Takalik Abaj, an {{important}} city {{in the foothills of}} the Guatemalan Pacific coast, in the modern department of Retalhuleu. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture. If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns {{in the opposite direction}} to that which is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the species}} in this family have coiled shells that are planispiral, in other words, the shells {{are more or less}} coiled flat, rather than having an {{elevated}} spire {{as is the case in}} most gastropod shells. Although they carry their shell in a way that makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dextral, the shell of coiled planorbids is in fact sinistral in coiling, but is carried upside down, which makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dextral.|$|R
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon {{in patients who}} receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Found in open woodland, {{parks and}} gardens, the blue-faced honeyeater {{is common in}} {{northern}} and eastern Australia and southern New Guinea. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sedentary in parts of its range and locally nomadic in other parts; however, the species has been little studied. Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates, supplemented with nectar and fruit. They often take over and renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs.|$|E
5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E

5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is an {{important}} part of the desert ecosystem. It has been found at population densities of up to 480,000 individuals per hectare, which is equivalent to a biomass of 19.2kg/ha; in comparison, desert mammals are estimated to have a combined biomass of 39.9kg/ha. The main predator of H. reaumuri is the scorpion Scorpio maurus, and it may compose up to 70% of the scorpion's diet. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vulnerable to attack only on the surface; no predators are known to attack H. reaumuri in its underground burrows.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, {{the four}} are {{once more the}} only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is {{mourning}} Kochanski, lost to him out of an airlock some time previously. A chance {{to get back to}} Earth through a dimension warp presents itself; although it is not quite what <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> it gives Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under no real threat.|$|E
