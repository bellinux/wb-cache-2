500|$|Instead {{of trying}} to contact his agent, Lane asked an Australian staff member to hand-deliver the script to Geoffrey Rush's house, not far away from hers in Melbourne. Unwin reports that he {{received}} a four-page e-mail from Rush's manager admonishing them for the breach of etiquette, but ending with an invitation to discuss the project further. Iain Canning from See-Saw Films became involved and, in Gareth Unwin's words: [...] "We worked with ex-chair of BAFTA Richard Price, and started turning this story about two grumpy men sitting in a room into something bigger." [...] Hooper liked the story, but thought that the original ending needed to be changed to reflect events more closely: [...] "Originally, it had a Hollywood ending... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the real speech, he's clearly coping with his stammer. But it's not a perfect performance. He's managing it." ...|$|E

He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity." [...] At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, race relations, politics and the [...] "hero/martyr". In late 1997, the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-led course entitled [...] "History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1971 {{interview}} with Dick Cavett, Knievel {{stated that he}} was uninsurable following the Caesars' crash. [...] Knievel said he was turned down 37 times from Lloyd's of London, stating, [...] "I have trouble getting life insurance, accident insurance, hospitalization and even insurance for my automobile...Lloyd's of London has rejected me 37 times so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the rumor that they insure anybody, don't pay {{too much attention to}} it." [...] Four years later, a clause in Knievel's contract to jump 14 buses at Kings Island required a one-day $1 million liability insurance to the amusement park. [...] Lloyd's of London offered the liability insurance for what was called a [...] "laughable $17,500". [...] Knievel eventually paid $2,500 to a U.S.-based insurance company.|$|E
