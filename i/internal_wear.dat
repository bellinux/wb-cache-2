Accurate wear prediction is difficult as random and uncertain characteristics must be factored into the estimation.

The performance degradation model is described by the Wiener process to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the pump. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is performed by utilizing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the initial parameters of the Wiener process while recursive estimation is conducted utilizing the Kalman filter method to estimate the drift coefficient of the Wiener process. The RUL of the pump is then calculated according to the performance degradation model based on the Wiener process. Experimental results indicate that the return oil flow is a suitable characteristic for reflecting the <b>internal</b> <b>wear</b> status of the axial piston pump, and thus the Wiener process-based method may effectively predicate the RUL of the pump...|$|E

Designing a pump which has acceptable vibration characteristics when new is not sufficient. As various publications indicate, it is mainly wear of internal pump annular seals which lead to vibration problems of originally smooth running units [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The calculation of pump vibrational behavior is {{an important element in}} establishing maintenance intervals to ensure reliable operation. While the mechanical rotor system and boundary conditions at journal bearings can be modelled quite accurately, interaction forces within the hydraulic part of the pump are not well known. Impeller interaction is one important influence on rotordynamics. However, these forces are not sensitive to <b>internal</b> <b>wear.</b> Impeller interaction is treated by several authors [7, 8, 9]. Reliable dynamic modelling of annular seals is established within centrifugal pumps. Measured results of a full scale test machine are presented and used to conform the newly developed, improved model. The overall influence of a change in seal design from smooth to serrated is shown. Additionally, it is demonstrated why the effect of wear deteriorates vibrational behavior and leads to the requirement of periodic internal seal replacement...|$|E

Normal ranges and limitations for calculated head and efficiency are provided to assist users in determining if the field data are realistic. Methods to estimate both mechanical and seal losses are demonstrated. Since original design condition almost never match actual operating conditions, the author demonstrates how to compare actual field data with design data, using nondimensional head and efficiency.

Compared to typical industry pump performance, run lengths were shorter, and cost per installed was higher. The application requires pumps capable of withstanding significant catalyst fines. Several wear resistant products {{have been used}} in pumps. However, all are limited {{due to the nature of}} the technologies. Thermal spray coatings and weld overlays can be used in ?line of sight? applications, but not for small interior surfaces. Thermal sprays suffer from failures of the mechanical bond. There is preferential erosion of the soft matrix between the hard particles in weld overlays. Hard diffusion coatings (boronizing) are very thin and can be punctured by large abrasive particles. Infiltration brazed tungsten carbide cladding (IBTCC) solves many of these issues. IBTCC was developed for extreme wear applications with difficult geometries such as downhole drilling tools and coal fired power plants. IBTCC combines a true metallurgical bond and a dense, uniform distribution of tungsten carbide particles throughout the coating, to create excellent erosion resistance and toughness in complex geometries. After 13 months in service, an IBTCC cycle oil pump showed no significant signs of internal erosion. This technology has also been applied to FCCU fractionator bottoms and debutanizer reboiler services, with no signs to date of increased vibration or loss of hydraulic performance.

This study explores and compares the suitability of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques for imaging six different commercial metallic soap-based greases and two novel biopolymer-based formulations. Pros and cons of both techniques and the effect of sample preparation protocol were analysed. The results revealed a wide variety of morphological characteristics depending on composition. Thus, the four anhydrous calcium-based greases demonstrated two clearly distinct microstructures (fibrous and granular) determined by the type of base oil employed. With regard to the lithium complex greases, the typically reported microstructure characterized by well-defined entangled and fibrous network was observed in both AFM and SEM techniques. As for the two biopolymer-based greases, fibre networks were also encountered. Besides this, selected greases were subjected to different tribological tests, and the effect of high-shear frictional working treatments on their microstructure was also analysed. As a result of the friction and <b>internal</b> <b>wear,</b> the AFM results evidenced microstructural changes which depended on grease composition.

Stress of <b>internal</b> wall <b>worn</b> casing string must be analyzed to ensure strength of casing string. In the paper, wear form of casing string is assumed as a crescent-shape, and a half finite element model (FEM) of worn casing string, cement-loop and earth combined system is established using the symmetry. Geometry relationships of wear ratio (or wear depth) and the centre of drill pipe are established. Effects of variables such as wear ratio of casing string, magnification factor of wellbore, elastic modulus of cement-loop and working conditions on casing string stress are discussed respectively. Some conclusions are drawn: maximum stress in casing string increases with increased wear ratio of casing string, and ultimately exceeds the yield limit. Increase of magnification factor of wellbore will improve bearing capacity of casing string, but maximum stress in casing string decreases slower and slower with further increase in magnification factor of casing string, at the same time, stress decreases more in casing string than in cement-loop. Minimum stress in cement-loop increases and maximum stress in cement-loop fluctuates with increased elastic modulus of cement-loop, while both minimum and maximum stress in casing string first increases then decreases, the turning point is related to elastic modulus of casing string and earth, as well as the geometry relationships among them.

40|$|Lecturepg. 41 Monitoring {{vibration}} as a {{predictive maintenance}} tool will not consistently prevent catastrophic damage and/or fluid release from sealess pumps. When vibration readings are taken periodically, a pump may be destroyed between monitoring schedules. Using acceleration {{to monitor the}} internal rotor of a sealess pump does not {{work as well as}} it does on a sealed pump configuration. There are several reasons for this. First, the internal rotor mass is relatively low when compared {{to the rest of the}} pump. The external mass dampens the vibration signal and a clear interpretation is not always possible. Second, vibration generated by inconsistent fluid flow during abnormal operating conditions can create confusing vibration amplitudes. Thirds, sealess pumps are relatively new and experience with vibration interpretation is limited. Monitoring sealess pumps by means other than vibration are generally reactionary, such as indicating the presence of liquid where none should be or detecting the conditions that will result in internal rotor damage. Also, some devices that monitor internal rotor condition create an additional leak path from the pump to atmosphere. Internal rotor monitoring methods generally rely on ?wearing through something? to create a signal that is detectable outside of the pump. The signal is representative of the remaining bearing life. These methods are not effective unless the <b>internal</b> pump <b>wear</b> is uniform over time. This uniformity is often lacking, because the process fluid cools and lubricates the inside of the pump and periods to reach wear limits often vary.
