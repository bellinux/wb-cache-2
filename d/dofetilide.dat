40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{test whether}} <b>dofetilide</b> has some {{potential}} {{for use in the}} treatment of heart failure. <b>Dofetilide</b> at {{less than or equal to}} 3 x 10 (- 5) m had no effect on the quiescent Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat aorta, mesenteric and intralobar arteries, or the spontaneous contractions of the WKY rat portal vein. <b>Dofetilide</b> at 10 (- 6) to 3 x 10 (- 5) m relaxed the KCl-contracted aorta. <b>Dofetilide</b> at 10 (- 9) - 10 (- 7) m augmented the force of contraction of left ventricle strips from 12 - and 18 -month-old WKY rats at 2 Hz. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at 12 and 17 - 21 months of age are models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure, respectively. The augmentation of force at 2 Hz with <b>dofetilide</b> was similar on 12 - and 18 -month-old WKY rats and 12 -month-old SHRs but reduced on the 18 -month-old SHR left ventricle. At a higher more physiological frequency, 4 Hz, the threshold concentration of <b>dofetilide</b> required to augment the force responses of 21 -month-old SHR left ventricles was markedly increased and the maximum augmenting effect was decreased. <b>Dofetilide</b> at 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 5) m reduced the rate of the 17 -month-old WKY rat right atrium, and had a similar effect on age-matched SHR right atrium. In summary, <b>dofetilide</b> is a positive inotrope and negative chronotrope in the rat.

Aim of the study In a double-blind randomized crossover design, the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of oral <b>dofetilide</b> or oral sotalol were compared in 135 patients with ischaemic heart disease and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. Methods The inducibility of ventricular tachycardia was determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation at baseline. Patients were then blindly randomized to receive either oral <b>dofetilide</b> 500 mug twice daily or oral sotalot 160 mg twice daily, for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the drug was then assessed by programmed elect ro physiological stimulation. After a wash-out period of at least 2 - 5 days. the patients received the alternative treatment for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the alternate drug was again determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. Selection of long-term treatment was allocated blindly according to programmed electrophysiological stimulation results. Results During the acute phase, 128 patients received both <b>dofetilide</b> and sotalol. Sixty-seven patients were responders to either drug. Forty-six patients (35 (.) 9 %) were responders to <b>dofetilide</b> compared with 43 (33 (.) 6 %) to sotalol (P=ns). Only 23 patients responded to both <b>dofetilide</b> and sotalol. Adverse events, deemed to be treatment related, were seen in 2 (.) 3 % of patients receiving <b>dofetilide</b> and 8 (.) 6 % of patients receiving sotalol (P= 0 (.) 016). Three patients on <b>dofetilide</b> had torsade de pointes. Two patients receiving sotalol died during the acute phase (one was arrhythmic death, and the other was due to heart failure). During the long-term phase, two of 42 patients (4 (.) 8 %) receiving <b>dofetilide</b> and three of 27 patients (11 (.) 1 %) receiving sotalol withdrew from treatment due to lack of efficacy.

40|$|Background Drugs are {{screened}} for delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kr) blockade to predict long QT syndrome prolongation and arrhythmogenesis. However, single-cell {{studies have shown}} that chronic (hours) exposure to some I-Kr blockers (eg, <b>dofetilide)</b> prolongs repolarization additionally by increasing late sodium current (INa-L) via inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase. We hypothesized that chronic <b>dofetilide</b> administration to intact dogs prolongs repolarization by blocking I-Kr and increasing INa-L. Methods and Results We continuously infused <b>dofetilide</b> (6 - 9 g/kg bolus+ 6 - 9 g/kg per hour IV infusion) into anesthetized dogs for 7 hours, maintaining plasma levels within the therapeutic range. In separate experiments, myocardial biopsies were taken before and during 6 -hour intravenous dofetide infusion, and the level of phospho-Akt was determined. Acute and chronic <b>dofetilide</b> effects on action potential duration (APD) were studied in canine left ventricular subendocardial slabs using microelectrode techniques. <b>Dofetilide</b> monotonically increased QTc and APD throughout 6. 5 -hour exposure. <b>Dofetilide</b> infusion during 210 minutes inhibited Akt phosphorylation. INa-L block with lidocaine shortened QTc and APD more at 6. 5 hours than at 50 minutes (QTc) or 30 minutes (APD) <b>dofetilide</b> administration. In comparison, moxifloxacin, an I-Kr blocker with no effects on phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and INa-L prolonged APD acutely but no additional prolongation occurred on chronic superfusion.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) randomly assigned to the QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic <b>dofetilide</b> or placebo. BACKGROUNDDrug-related torsade de pointes (TdP) is usually recognized within days of initiating therapy, but its incidence during long-term therapy is unknown. METHODSWe assessed the frequency of TdP and ICD electrograms compatible with TdP in a multicenter study that randomized ICD patients to placebo (n = 87) or <b>dofetilide</b> (n = 87). As reported elsewhere, {{the number of patients}} with a primary trial end point (ICD intervention for VT or ventricular fibrillation) was similar in the two groups. For this analysis, a qualifying event was TdP (on electrocardiogram) or an intracardiac electrogram showing pause-dependent PVT. RESULTSA total of 620 electrograms obtained in 131 patients were analyzed blindly by prospectively defined criteria for episodes of pause-dependent polymorphic VT. These were identified in 15 / 87 (17 %) patients receiving <b>dofetilide</b> and 5 / 87 (6 %) patients on placebo (p < 0. 05). Five of these episodes were early (< 3 days), all of which were TdP on <b>dofetilide.</b> There were 15 late events, 10 on <b>dofetilide</b> and five on placebo (p = 0. 29). The median time to a late event was 22 days (range 6 to 107 days) for <b>dofetilide</b> and 99 days (range 34 to 207 days) for placebo. CONCLUSIONSPause-dependent PVT was more common among patients receiving <b>dofetilide,</b> although total VT incidence was similar in the two groups. These data suggest that in ICD patients either long-term <b>dofetilide</b> therapy is associated with an increased risk of TdP or the drug alters VT morphology...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{a common}} cardiac arrhythmia, {{and has been a}} significant financial burden. Class III antiarrhythmics such as <b>dofetilide,</b> ibutilide, and amiodarone are indicated for rhythm control. Magnesium may possess intrinsic antiarrhythmic properties, and may potentially increase the efficacy of class III antiarrhythmics when used concomitantly. Objective: The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the literature on the efficacy of magnesium in addition to Class III antiarrhythmics, specifically amidarone, ibutilide, and <b>dofetilide</b> for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Methods: Databases Pubmed and CINAHL are utilized along with the search terms amiodarone, <b>dofetilide,</b> ibutlide, magnesium, atrial fibrillation, conversion, rhythm control, and cardioversion. Results: One study on <b>dofetilide</b> and 5 studies on ibutilide were identified. No studies were found on amiodarone. Patients with atrial fibrillation who received <b>dofetilide</b> and magnesium had higher rates of successful cardioversion as compared to those who only received <b>dofetilide.</b> Conversion rates were similar between the 2 treatment groups for patients with atrial flutter. As for ibutilide, 4 studies have shown that the addition of magnesium significantly increases conversion rates for patients with atrial fibrillation or typical atrial flutter. Conversion rates were similar for patients with atypical atrial flutter. One study showed that addition of magnesium did not improve efficacy of ibutilide. Higher doses of magnesium (4 g) were associated with improved outcomes. Adverse effects of magnesium were mild and included flushing, tingling, and dizziness. Patients who received magnesium had shorter corrected QT intervals and smaller increase in corrected QT interval from baseline. Compare to previous studies, studies included in this review had higher conversion rates for <b>dofetilide</b> and ibutilide as well as <b>dofetilide</b> and magnesium or ibutilide and magnesium combination therapies. However, only 2 ibutilide studies and 1 <b>dofetilide</b> study reported baseline characteristics such as left atrial size, history of heart failure, and duration of atrial fibrillation, which are significant predictors of successful cardioversion. Therefore, differences in baseline demographics may have influenced the results. Conclusion: Magnesium may be used as adjunct for <b>dofetilide</b> and ibutilide due to potential improved efficacy and minimal toxicity. Dose ranging studies should be conducted in the future to establish the optimal dose and duration of therapy as well as the optimal serum magnesium concentration in order for the clinician to manage and monitor patients appropriately...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dofetilide</b> {{is widely}} used in the United States for rhythm control in {{patients}} with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter. It is a Vaughan Williams class III anti-arrhythmic that causes a dose-dependent increase in both the atrial and ventricular refractory periods by selectively blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potas-sium channel (Ikr) and increasing late sodium current (INa-L) in cardiac cells, thus prolonging the action potential in cardiac myocytes. 1 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved it in 1999 for converting to and maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with highly symptomatic AF and flutter of more than 1 -week duration who were capable of being cardio-verted.
