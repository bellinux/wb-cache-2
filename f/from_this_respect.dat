Anti-urbanism appeared sporadically everywhere, as a continuous tradition, it emerged at two remote corners of the world: in United States and Germany. Hungarian anti-urbanism of the interwar period had been motivated by the shock of the disintegration of the “Historical Greater Hungary”.

The basin entropy provides an efficient method to probe the behavior of a system when different parameters are varied. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of fractal basin boundaries: when the basin entropy of the boundaries is larger than 2, the basin is fractal.

Apart from a few notable studies analysing the main whispered vowels and some quite general estimations of whispered speech characteristics, a classic vowel space determination has been lacking for whispers.

The method of local labour systems (LLS), the method of labour market areas (LMA) – called as EURO method – and the CURDS measure are introduced, applied and compared. The results of the calculations clearly demonstrate the different characters of the methods. The results of the LLS method are characterized by major disparities with an extremely extended Budapest LLS district. The EURO method results in a less extending central region around Budapest, however, the CURDS measure causes the most moderate inequalities among the functional regions with the smallest number of units. The differing character of the methods can be discovered in the centres as well. LLS centres indicate the polarizing character of the method preferring the largest centres, at the same time it gives possibility to the smaller centres to be delimited.
