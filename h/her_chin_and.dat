500|$|Fey has a scar a {{few inches}} long {{on the left side}} of <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> cheek, the cause of which {{remained}} unexplained to the public until a 2008 Vanity Fair profile by Maureen Dowd, and subsequently in her autobiographical book, where she revealed that [...] "during the spring semester of kindergarten, I was slashed in the face by a stranger in the alley behind my house." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E

6000|$|LESBIA [widening {{her eyes}} <b>and</b> lifting <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> haughtily] <b>And</b> pray {{how does that}} prevent me from knowing as much about men and women as {{people who have no}} self-control? ...|$|R
60|$|Maud stopped. <b>Her</b> <b>chin</b> was tilted, <b>and</b> she was wasting a baleful glare on the darkness.|$|R
60|$|Then Kitty put up <b>her</b> little <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> said irreverent {{things about}} precedence, and Commissioners, and matrimony. Mr. Beighton rubbed {{the top of}} his head; for he was an easy-going man.|$|R
6000|$|Roxana dropped <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> {{told her}} son to leave her alone--she must think this matter out. Presently she said impressively: ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{regarded}} it attentively {{for some}} moments, her finger resting lightly against <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I {{have given up}} the idea of a Greek court.' ...|$|E
50|$|After the wedding, Youngmi is {{continually}} educated by Euna on classical music and manners. Despite {{being treated like}} a dress-up doll or a pupil, {{she is trying to}} keep <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> up, <b>and</b> loves <b>her</b> new husband a lot.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>chin</b> {{certainly}} trembled. <b>And</b> she {{was looking}} at me with extreme attention. I made a step nearer to her chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I go with you, Mary?" [...] whispered Letty--a most {{inconvenient}} child, {{who listened}} to everything. But she was made exultant by having <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> pinched <b>and</b> <b>her</b> cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother--an incident which she narrated {{to her mother and}} father.|$|R
6000|$|Thyme raised <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and,</b> {{looking at}} him through half-closed eyes, said: [...] "Well, I do think, of all the {{conceited}} persons I ever met you're the worst." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You're more to {{be relied}} upon than silver and gold.' As she said it, Miss Wren {{suddenly}} broke off, screwed up her eyes and <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> looked prodigiously knowing. 'Aha! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be anxious, Kitty; I {{have quite}} other {{thoughts}} about my life. I shall never marry again," [...] said Dorothea, touching <b>her</b> sister's <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> looking at <b>her</b> with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her baby, and Dorothea {{had come to}} say good-night to her.|$|R
5000|$|The French novelist, , who {{was also}} an inmate at Ravensbrück, said of her, [...] "She always kept <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> up … <b>and</b> all of us liked the little Scotswoman, Mees Young".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Cap'en Cuttle, Cap'en Cuttle!' said Mrs MacStinger, making <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> rigid, <b>and</b> shaking it {{in unison}} with what, {{but for the}} {{weakness}} of her sex, {{might be described as}} her fist. 'Oh, Cap'en Cuttle, Cap'en Cuttle, do you dare to look me in the face, and not be struck down in the berth!' ...|$|R
60|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> with {{a patient}} smile she seemed to beg of Francesco that he would suffer her to humour this mood of Gonzaga's. In quick {{obedience}} Francesco inclined his head.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon me,' said Mrs Wilfer, {{after the}} first salutations, {{and as soon as}} she had {{adjusted}} the handkerchief under <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> waved her gloved hands, 'to what am I indebted for this honour?' ...|$|E
60|$|Saxon {{sat with}} the {{blankets}} drawn closely under <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> admired his courage. He had not even taken the hatchet, {{and he was going}} in the direction in which the disturbance had died away.|$|E
60|$|This sub-Amanda was {{perceptible}} {{next morning}} again, flitting {{about in the}} background of a glad and loving adventuress, a pre-occupied Amanda who had put her head down while the real Amanda flung <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> up <b>and</b> contemplated things on the Asiatic scale, and who was apparently engaged in disentangling something obscure connected with Mr. Rathbone-Sanders that ought never to have been entangled....|$|R
50|$|Dinoire's {{injuries}} affected <b>her</b> nose, lips, <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> cheeks. She wore {{a surgical}} mask {{to cover the}} injuries on {{the lower part of}} her face, as the upper face was not affected.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her then, sidelong. The curve of <b>her</b> cheek <b>and</b> <b>chin</b> looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Right!' exclaimed Miss Wren {{with another}} chop. 'You have changed me wiser, godmother.--Not,' she added with the quaint hitch of <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> eyes, 'that you need {{be a very}} {{wonderful}} godmother to do that deed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll make you," [...] he said. So {{different}} was {{the voice}} now that another man might have spoken. Then he bent her backward, and, freeing one hand, brought it under <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> tried to lift her face.|$|E
60|$|She saw Crumb {{take the}} knife and feel of the blade, running his thumb along it. She saw him stoop, his eyes turned down upon hers. He grasped <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> forced it upward and back, the better to expose her throat.|$|E
60|$|She {{glared at}} him defiantly. He glared back at her. Then his sense of humour came to his rescue.
