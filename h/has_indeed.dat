5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army. The degree of admiration and acceptance varies, but the overall tendency to accentuate the positive lives on, or <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> grown stronger.|$|E
5|$|Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo {{arrive at}} {{the banks of the}} Propontis, where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> become hideously ugly, but Candide {{nevertheless}} buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cunégonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Giroflée—having squandered their three thousand piastres—are reconciled with Candide on a small farm (une petite métairie) which he just bought with the last of his finances.|$|E
5|$|During his patrol, Spider-Man stops a {{group of}} thieves who are {{breaking}} into a bakery. Simultaneously, Spider-Man takes pictures {{to give to the}} Daily Bugle. He happily leaves and returns home before his curfew. However, upon reviewing the photos, he discovers they are unfortunately unusable. Meanwhile, Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with an experimental serum, in an attempt to regrow his missing arm, before going to bed. Later, he awakens to discover his arm <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> regrown. His wife, Martha, is furious that he experimented on himself without her knowledge, but softens upon seeing their son's reaction.|$|E

5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip {{the washing machine}} but fail to do so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grand Slam commences, and {{it turns}} out that Leiter <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been {{captured}} by Goldfinger, who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D-loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including the pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus), Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis) and the Javan slow loris (N.javanicus)) were shown to be genetically distinct, the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from selected individuals of Sunda slow loris (N.coucang) and Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) shared a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than {{with other members of}} their own respective species. The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N.bengalensis and N.coucang, and suggested that there <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> been gene flow between the two species.|$|E

25|$|The Sixteenth Amendment {{removed the}} {{requirement}} for those income taxes deemed to be direct in substance (such as taxes on income from property) to be apportioned among the states according to population.

25|$|Strychnine <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> {{rarely been}} {{discovered}} mixed with LSD {{and other drugs}} in a few samples recovered by law enforcement agencies, but these were all found in murder or attempted murder investigations where someone was being specifically targeted for poisoning, and not associated with recreational LSD use.|$|E
25|$|But Christ <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> {{been raised}} from the dead, the firstfruits {{of those who}} have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate between}} {{politicians}} and economists {{over the role}} of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality. Economists such as Paul Krugman, Peter Orszag, and Emmanuel Saez have argued that tax policy in the post World War II era <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> increased income inequality by enabling the wealthiest Americans far greater access to capital than lower-income ones.|$|E
25|$|Surviving {{knowledge}} of the Yuan opera, such as through written scripts, allows some insight. Yuan opera was a type of opera, or more specifically Chinese opera, which as a theatrical art form allowed for {{a large amount of}} poetic material to be integrated into it, in various ways; although, as the tradition no longer exists in its historical form, most of the knowledge thereof relies upon literary sources: however, this sourcing <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> favored the survival of the incorporated poetry involved in these performances.|$|E
25|$|Like Japan and South Korea before it, {{for nearly}} 30 years China <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> been growing, {{thrusting}} its citizens into prosperity and its goods across the world. Between 1978 and 2005, China's per capita GDP had grown from $153 to $1284, while its current account surplus had increased over twelve-fold between 1982 and 2004, from $5.7 billion to $71 billion. During this time, China had also become an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like {{clothing and footwear}} to the increasingly sophisticated production of computers, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles.|$|E

25|$|Discussion {{around the}} Law and its wording {{constantly}} reappears on {{private and public}} agendas in Israel and in the Diaspora. The Knesset has repeatedly debated proposals to amend the Law of Return, and it <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> been amended {{a number of times}} over the years. These modifications reflect the changes that have taken place in Israeli society, the shifts that have taken place in political dialogue both inside Israel itself, and the political discourse between Israel and the Diaspora. The present law constitutes an expression of permanent trends {{as well as of the}} Israeli legislative system's ability to adapt itself to changing circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Fallmerayer's anti-Russian sentiments {{were not}} yet fully developed, and upon his return to Munich in 1842, he was befriended by the Russian poet and diplomat Fyodor Tyutchev. This latter had been {{entrusted}} by Karl Nesselrode and Alexander von Benckendorff {{to find a new}} spokesperson for Russian interests in Germany. Fallmerayer's Greek thesis had aroused interest in Russian circles, and it was perhaps for this reason that Tyutchev approached Fallmerayer and proposed that he should serve as a journalistic mouthpiece for Czarist policy. Fallmerayer declined, and it <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> been suggested that his growing opposition to Russian expansionism was provoked by this encounter.|$|E
25|$|Though {{normally}} {{loved by}} most of his countrymen, Storm P. has also been criticised for being too toothless, cosy and petit bourgeois. In spite of his social background and interest of poor milieus, he very seldom shows deeper social criticism or revolutionary opinions; the dramatic age in which he lived left rather small stamps on his work. On the other hand he was no staunch giggler; many of his paintings deal with death, sorrow and macabre themes. Though not a revolutionary, he <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> painted the victims of social injustice and misery, often with a strong touch of compassion. Melancholy and fear are not unknown to him, but his official appearance was an optimistic one.|$|E

25|$|Although {{individual}} experiments, {{such as the}} set {{of solar}} neutrino experiments, are consistent with non-oscillatory mechanisms of neutrino flavor conversion, taken altogether, neutrino experiments imply the existence of neutrino oscillations. Especially relevant in this context are the reactor experiment KamLAND and the accelerator experiments such as MINOS. The KamLAND experiment <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> identified oscillations as the neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved in the solar electron neutrinos. Similarly MINOS confirms the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos and gives a better determination of the mass squared splitting. Takaaki Kajita of Japan and Arthur B. McDonald of Canada received the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics for their landmark finding, theoretical and experimental, that neutrinos can change flavors.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} the company <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> seen its ship-related {{workload}} increase slightly. Whilst Harland & Wolff has no involvement in any shipbuilding projects for the foreseeable future, the company is increasingly involved in overhaul, re-fitting and ship repair, {{as well as the}} construction and repair of off-shore equipment such as oil platforms. On 1 February 2011 it was announced that Harland & Wolff had won the contract to refurbish , effectively rekindling its nearly 150-year association with the White Star Line. Structural steel work on the ship began on 10 February 2011 and was completed in time for the 2012 Belfast Titanic Festival. In July 2012 Harland & Wolff was to carry out the dry docking and service of the Husky Oil SeaRose FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) vessel.|$|E
25|$|No {{applications}} for dissolution {{may be made}} within one year {{of the formation of}} the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership <b>has</b> <b>indeed</b> broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.|$|E
