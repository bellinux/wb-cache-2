[...] Since the advent of Internet banking, an Internet connection is commonly used to manage positions. Using the Internet, specialized software, and a personal computer, stock speculators/investors make use of technical and fundamental analysis to help them in making decisions. They may use several information resources, {{some of which are}} strictly technical. Using the pivot points calculated from a previous day's trading, they attempt to predict the buy and sell points of the current day's trading session. These points give a cue to speculators, as to where prices will head for the day, prompting each speculator where to enter his trade, and where to exit.

There is criticism on the validity of using these technical indicators in analysis, and many professional stock speculators do not use them. Many full-time stock speculators and stock investors, as well as most other people in finance, traditionally have a formal education and training in fields such as economics, finance, mathematics and computer science, which may be particularly relevant to this occupation – since stock trading is not an exact science, stock prices have in general a random or chaotic behaviour and there is no proven technique for trading stocks profitably, the degree of knowledge in those fields is ultimately neglectable.|$|E

30|$|The {{dynamically}} changing correlation network of individual financial returns {{has been recognized}} an important topic. There are many research works studied in this regard; however, many of them adopted static correlation measures calculated over a sample period. Intertemporal analysis was often based on a time series of such static correlations calculated by rolling sample periods, which {{may lead to a}} biased estimate of correlation as discussed in Isogai (2016). The large number of financial assets causes another technical difficulty when dealing with the correlation network, while the existing sector classification is not reliable for <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks.</b> Thus, an efficient and reliable method for dimensionality reduction is required for an extended research of correlation network. Dimensionality reduction of a time series of conditional correlation network was another difficult issue for intertemporal comparative analysis. The proposed analytical framework of dynamic correlation network with non-sector based <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> returns can handle these issues in a systematically organized way.|$|R

As price changes of large stocks can have a disproportionate effect on capitalization weighted stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the NYSE Composite Index, and the NASDAQ Composite index, it can be useful to know how broadly this movement extends into the larger universe of smaller stocks. Since market indexes represent a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> they do not present the whole picture of the trading day {{and the performance of}} the market during this day.

The most commonly known index fund, the S&P 500 Index Fund, {{is based on the}} rules established by S&P Dow Jones Indices for their S&P 500 Index. Equity index funds would include groups of stocks with similar characteristics such as the size, value, profitability and/or the geographic location of the companies. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> may include companies from the United States, Non-US Developed, emerging markets or Frontier Market countries. Additional index funds within these geographic markets may include indexes of companies that include rules based on company characteristics or factors, such as companies that are small, mid-sized, large, small value, large value, small growth, large growth, the level of gross profitability or investment capital, real estate, or indexes based on commodities and fixed-income. Companies are purchased and held within the index fund when they meet the specific index rules or parameters and are sold when they move outside of those rules or parameters. Think of an index fund as an investment utilizing rules-based investing. Some index providers announce changes of the companies in their index before the change date and other index providers do not make such announcements.|$|E
5000|$|Quantitative {{cumulative}} value analysis: This method is also {{commonly referred to}} as fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysts consider past records of assets, earnings, sales, products, management, and markets in predicting future trends in these indicators and how they may affect a company’s future success or failure. By appraising a firm’s prospects, these analysts determine a stock’s intrinsic value and assess whether a particular stock or <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> is undervalued or overvalued at the current market price. If the intrinsic value is more than the current share price, then this stock would appear to be undervalued and a possible candidate for investment. While there are several different methods for determining intrinsic value, the underlying premise is that a company is worth the sum of its discounted cash flows (DCF). The DCF is the value of future expected cash receipts and expenditures at a common date, which is calculated using net present value or internal rate of return. This means a company is worth the combined sum of its future profits, {{while at the same time}} being discounted in consideration of the time value of money. This value, as determined by the discounted cash flow analysis or its equivalents, consists of two components: ...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the recent {{literature}} surrounding market efficiency identifies two families of pervasive regularities: the underreaction of stock prices to new information events, such as earnings announcements or warnings, and the overreaction of stock prices {{to a series of}} negative or positive news. This study provides an empirical analysis of the market's stock price response to earnings warning announcements. Traditional event study methodology is employed to examine the stock price response of a sample of 372 companies issuing earnings warning announcements over a two-year period (1998 to 1999). The study finds evidence of a systematic stock price underreaction to the news content of an earnings warning announcement resulting in negative post-event 'drift' over the short to medium term for the majority of companies in the sample. The exception to this general finding is the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> that have experienced the worst performance in the year leading up to the earnings warning announcement.

40|$|ABSTRACTAnalysis of risk metrics in share {{portfolio}} optimizationMarkowitz and Sharpe’s studies {{formed the}} basis of the so-called Modern Portfolio Theory. Over the years, their papers were reviewed and alternative measures for portfolios optimization were presented. In view of this fact, {{there is a need to}} evaluate what are the differences between these measures. According to Roman and Mitra, this problem constitutes a new phase of studies, called Post-Modern Portfolio Theory. The purpose of this article is to compare the optimization models using risk measures such as standard deviation (SD), lower partial moment (LPM) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to study their different forms of allocations in portfolios comprised of stocks traded on the BM&FBovespa. The article is divided into two stages: the first begun with the selection of risk measures and the definition of the analysis period; in the second stage, there was the division of assets according to the shape of the probability distribution of returns, with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> with returns normally distributed and another <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> with returns without normal distribution. As for risk measures, tests showed similar characteristics between models; as for the returns, the models that minimized LPM and CVaR showed superior results compared to the SD. Such results are relevant because they oppose the studies according to which there are no significant differences between the models...|$|E
