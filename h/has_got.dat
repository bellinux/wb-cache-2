5|$|The {{doubling}} of lane rate and increasing of data lanes from 3 to 4, raises the effective bandwidth to 48 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3). On using DSC, it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> a maximum compression of 3:1 and this effectively increases the bandwidth to 144 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3 * 3). This much bandwidth {{can be used}} for sending up to 10K/60 Hz video in 4:4:4 format with 24-bit color (i.e. 4K/60Hz * 4 * 16/9). Using a different chroma sub-sampling format (4:2:2 or 4:2:0) enables to use even higher refresh rates (e.g. 10K/120 Hz in 4:2:0 format) or higher color depths (e.g. 30/36/48-bit).|$|E
