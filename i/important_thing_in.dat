25|$|The {{difference}} between Europeans and New Englanders {{manifests itself in}} particular in the expression of feelings and emotions, which are very sensitive for the former: love {{is more important than}} money. Moreover, American people are more straitlaced and they have closer links with tradition. The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> life for those living in the 'New World' is, ironically, respecting old traditions and accepting the rules of a good morality. Mr Wentworth is profoundly surprised and fascinated by Eugenia's marriage experience as well as Robert Acton's; in the Americans' eyes, Eugenia is a perplexing woman.|$|E
25|$|Her work as {{a singer}} and pianist with such maestros as Lecuona, Jorge Anckermann, Delfín, Sánchez de Fuentes and Gonzalo Roig was {{successful}} and immensely respectable, as befitted a middle-class married woman of those times. Gradually, however, a change began as she became fully adult. She performed in popular, but slightly vulgar theater (zarzuela; bufo); traveled to other countries and became a recording star. It became clear that performing in public was the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> her life, and this was hardly compatible with {{her role as a}} bourgeois wife and mother. The first signs of change came in 1926, a year which started conventionally enough.|$|E

25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put family policy {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in the past had got it wrong. He stated families should be the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child. Tax schemes to support families, freezing fuel duty, cutting income tax. David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E

Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women.

[...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album.

Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular was the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world that Homer told him.

It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started.
