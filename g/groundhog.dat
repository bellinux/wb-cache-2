40|$|Between May 1, and September 15, 1964, {{neutralizing}} antibody to Powassan {{virus was}} detected in sera from 163 of 464 forest mammals {{captured in the}} Powassan—North Bay area of northern Ontario. These included 159 of 358 <b>groundhogs</b> and four of 43 red squirrels. Acquisition of antibody by juvenile <b>groundhogs</b> occurred principally during July and August. Powassan virus strains were isolated from tick pools containing two to 15 Ixodes cookei per pool which were removed from eight of 91 <b>groundhogs</b> in three townships during May, July and August. Virus was also recovered from blood of two <b>groundhogs</b> during May. Powassan virus was re-isolated from five of six tick pools and two blood clots by inoculation of swine kidney tissue cultures. These findings strongly suggest that during 1964 Powassan virus was maintained in nature by a cycle involving <b>groundhogs</b> and I. cookei ticks...|$|R

5|$|In a Monthly Weather Review paper {{published}} in 1934, the U.S. Weather Bureau recognized Key West and Pensacola {{as the most}} hurricane-prone cities in the state; Key West experiences both storms developing from the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, while Pensacola has received hurricanes crossing the state as well as storms recurving in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The earliest storm to affect the state was the 1952 <b>Groundhog</b> Day Tropical Storm, and the latest storm to impact the state was a hurricane making landfall on December1, 1925.|$|E
5|$|The 1952 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the last}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}} to name tropical cyclones using the phonetic alphabet. It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it was the least active since 1946. The season officially started on June15; however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on <b>Groundhog</b> Day, becoming the only storm on record {{in the month of}} February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, the first of which formed on August18. The final storm of the season dissipated on October28, {{two and a half weeks}} before the season officially ended on November15.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 <b>Groundhog</b> Day tornado {{outbreak}} was a localized but devastating tornado {{event that}} took place in central Florida early on February 2, 2007. Early morning temperatures had risen well above average for the season; combined with increased moisture and a powerful jet stream, this created enough instability and wind shear for thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. Due to the conditions, a long-tracked supercell formed and produced three tornadoes over one hour and seventeen minutes. The supercell resulted in a 70-mile (110-kilometer) trail of damage.|$|E
50|$|It {{would have}} been around 1992 or 1993 that all three, one by one, joined/rejoined The <b>Groundhogs,</b> now and then gigging in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and {{elsewhere}} in Europe, apart from the regular UK circuit. They can be heard backing Tony McPhee on the <b>Groundhogs</b> album Lost Tapes II, recorded live in Milan in June 1994 {{although it was not}} released until several years later. Again both bands were on the go {{at the same time and}} several occasions saw Egypt doing an opening set at a <b>Groundhogs</b> gig.|$|R
50|$|McPhee put {{together}} a new band in 2007, with long-time <b>Groundhogs</b> bassist Dave Anderson (ex-Hawkwind) and Marco Anderson on drums. This trio toured England in 2008 with Focus and Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash. The 2009 line-up of Tony McPhee's <b>Groundhogs</b> comprised McPhee, Anderson and previous long-term drummer Mick Jones. The <b>Groundhogs</b> Rhythm Section's latest recruits, Bob Bowles (guitar, vocals) and Jon Buckett (guitars, keyboards, vocals), joined Ken Pustelnik and Pete Cruickshank in February 2011. As of 2011, the new Groundhogs' lineup consisted of McPhee, Anderson, Joanna Deacon (vocals), and Carl Stokes (drums) from the death rock band 'Cancer'. Due to McPhee's ongoing health issues relating to a stroke in 2009, Tony McPhee & The <b>Groundhogs</b> retired in January 2014 although Tony McPhee & Carl Stokes have since worked with David Tibet's 'Current '93.|$|R

5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as <b>groundhog,</b> badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, <b>groundhog,</b> Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit. Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, flying squirrel, chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E
5|$|On February2, <b>Groundhog</b> Day, a {{disturbance}} was first {{observed in the}} western Caribbean Sea. Winds were estimated at around 35mph (55km/h), and it tracked rapidly northward, initially to the north-northwest. After passing near Cancún along the Yucatan Peninsula, it turned northeastward and brushed the northwest coast of Cuba. Early on February3 the storm approached Key West, and shortly thereafter moved ashore near Cape Sable, Florida. It quickly crossed the state, passing near Miami before emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68mph (110km/h), as well as sustained tropical storm force winds for about four hours; the station also recorded a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (29.66inHg).|$|E

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} 1952 <b>Groundhog</b> Day Storm was {{the only}} Atlantic tropical cyclone on record {{in the month of}} February. First observed in the western Caribbean Sea on February2 as a non-frontal low, it moved rapidly throughout its duration and struck southwestern Florida early the next day as a gale-force storm. In the state, the winds damaged some crops and power lines, but no serious damage was reported. The system became a tropical storm after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean before quickly transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on February4. Strong winds and waves washed a freighter ashore, but no injuries were related to the event. Subsequently, the storm brushed eastern New England, causing minor power outages, before it moved inland near Maine. There were no reported fatalities related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Including the two disqualifications, ten drivers {{failed to}} finish the race, six of them because of {{accidents}} including Kubica. Four of them gearbox failures. Several cars were damaged during the race: Wurz's rear wing was damaged in the incident that took out Speed, while Davidson hit a <b>groundhog</b> on the racetrack. This meant that the safety car had to be deployed on four occasions. At the final restart on lap sixty, all of the remaining twelve cars {{were on the same}} lap creating some close racing and a lot of overtaking. Hamilton sustained his consistent pace throughout all of the incidents and pulled clear of Heidfeld in the closing stages, taking his first race win relatively comfortably. Barrichello dropped ten places on his final pit stop. Hamilton's championship lead was strengthened when Sato overtook the reigning world champion to move into sixth place around the outside of the final chicane, having switched to the harder tyres on his final stop.|$|E
5|$|On lap 37, Trulli and Nico Rosberg were {{battling for}} {{position}} going into turn 1. Both span {{off the track}} in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap Anthony Davidson made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a beaver had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it {{more likely to have}} been a <b>groundhog.</b> One lap later David Coulthard was forced to retire due to a gearbox problem. Ralf Schumacher also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Räikkönen had his second pit stop on lap 52 at the same time as Alonso. The latter was able to pass him just after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into 5th.|$|E

50|$|Bachman {{mentioned}} {{that when the}} young <b>groundhogs</b> are a few months old, they prepare for separation, digging a number of holes {{in the area of}} their early home. Some of these holes were only a few feet deep and never occupied but the numerous burrows gave the impression that <b>groundhogs</b> live in communities.|$|R
40|$|Powassan {{virus was}} {{isolated}} from seven pools of Ixodes cookei ticks removed from <b>groundhogs</b> (Marmota monax) collected near North Bay, Ontario, between May and August 1965, including five pools obtained during spring. Tick pools, each comprising one to nine ticks, contained 2. 0 to 5. 5 log 10 TCD 50 of virus upon titration in monolayer cultures of primary swine kidney cells. Powassan virus neutralizing antibody prevalence in sera {{of the current}} season's <b>groundhogs</b> increased steadily from zero during May to 25 % during August but remained relatively unchanged (42 % to 58 %) in the previous season's <b>groundhogs,</b> thereby confirming that active infection had occurred particularly amongst juvenile <b>groundhogs</b> mainly during spring 1965. Isolation of one strain of Silverwater virus from Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris ticks and detection of neutralizing antibody in three of nine snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) confirmed the active spread of this agent during 1965...|$|R
5|$|Storms {{were most}} likely to occur in May, {{followed}} by December. Out of all recorded storms in the database, only one cyclone was reported in the month of March; the 1908 March hurricane, as well as one tropical storm in February, which was the 1952 <b>Groundhog</b> Day Storm. In addition, only three tropical or subtropical cyclones formed in April ndash& a subtropical storm in 1992, Tropical Storm Ana of 2003, and Tropical Storm Arlene of 2017. A hurricane in 1938, a tropical storm in 1951, a subtropical storm in 1978, and Hurricane Alex of 2016 occurred in January. Of all cyclones during the off-season, Hurricane Lili in 1984 lasted the longest, for a total of 12 days. Hurricane Epsilon, which formed in November, maintained hurricane status for five days in December 2005, longer than any other storm in December; the previous record was two and a half days, set by Hurricane Lili in 1984. Additionally, Hurricane Alice in 1954–1955 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–2006 were the only recorded cyclones to have spanned two calendar years.|$|E

25|$|<b>Groundhog</b> Day (Canadian French: Jour de la Marmotte; Pennsylvania German: Grundsaudaag, Murmeltiertag) is a {{traditional}} holiday originating in the United States that is celebrated on February 2. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a <b>groundhog</b> emerges from its burrow on this day, then the spring season will arrive early, some time before the vernal equinox; if it is sunny, the <b>groundhog</b> will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its den, and winter weather will persist for six more weeks.|$|E
