5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect <b>ionising</b> radiation.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of the pion in 1947, the search for new elementary particles became a popular research topic. By operating fast ionization chambers within a cloud chamber, Herbert showed that the bursts of ionization they recorded were primarily produced by relatively low energy cosmic rays, whose nuclear interactions typically involve the ejection of several heavily <b>ionising</b> nuclear fragments. On the basis of this effect, he and Rossi demonstrated that the behaviour of these interactions {{is similar to that of}} penetrating showers.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} <b>ionising</b> radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{surrounding}} environmental temperature and density either partially <b>ionised</b> or fully <b>ionised</b> forms of plasma may be produced. Partially <b>ionised</b> plasma is popularly understood, for example, as bright neon signs or lightning storms, while more fully <b>ionised</b> plasma {{is associated with}} the interior of the Sun, the solar corona, and stars.|$|R
5|$|Plasma and <b>ionised</b> gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, partially <b>ionised</b> or fully <b>ionised</b> forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially <b>ionised</b> plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully <b>ionised</b> plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|R
40|$|Plasma calcium (<b>ionised</b> and total) and albumin {{concentrations}} and pH {{were measured}} in preterm infants and in healthy adults and patients dependent on respirators. Plasma <b>ionised</b> calcium and total calcium values fell {{during the first}} week after birth and subsequently rose. Plasma <b>ionised</b> calcium concentrations in preterm infants were higher than those found in both healthy and sick adults. This difference was only partially explained by the lower blood pH in the infant population. There was no correlation between plasma <b>ionised</b> calcium or the ratio of <b>ionised</b> calcium to total calcium and total bilirubin concentrations. These results suggest that the metabolic control of plasma <b>ionised</b> calcium in preterm infants is different from that in adults...|$|R
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases {{that can be}} made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the same way}} and has often been used as an <b>ionising</b> solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of <b>ionising</b> it in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of <b>ionising</b> this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} serum {{adjusted}} <b>ionised</b> calcium and parathyroid hormone (FH) were prospectively studied in 32 patients with isolated tibial fractures, freated conserva-tively. We measured serum albumin, adjusted total calcium, phosphate, pH, adjusted <b>ionised</b> calcium and PTH at intervals until the fractures had healed. The mean <b>ionised</b> calcium adjusted for pH fell within 24 hours of injury, and then {{rose to a}} peak at between four and six weeks. These changes cannot be explained by changes in serum pH or PTH. The restoration of normal <b>ionised</b> calcium levels after fracture coincided with the period when the callus was being calcified. Analysis {{of the changes in}} <b>ionised</b> calcium, phosphate and PTH suggests that PTH levels alter in response to changes in <b>ionised</b> calcium levels. PTH is highest immediately after fracture and lowest, often not recordable, at six weeks. The cause of the changes in the <b>ionised</b> calcium level has yet to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated to Prof. Dr. Dr. J. B ttner on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday Summary: <b>Ionised</b> and total magnesium concentrations were determined in the serum of different groups of patients suffering from renal or hepatic diseases. <b>Ionised</b> magnesium was measured by Microlyte 6 (KONE, Espoo, Finland) and total magnesium by atomic absorption spectrometry. In renal insufficiency <b>ionised</b> and total magnesium concentrations were almost equally increased. In proteinuria with a normal glomerular filtration rate, "pseudohypomagnesaemia " was observed, i. e. decreased total magnesium concentration in parallel with a decreased albumin concentration with no significant change in the concentration of <b>ionised</b> magnesium. Hypermagnesaemia occurred in liver diseases combined with renal insufficiency, whereas "pseudohypomagnesae-mia " was most often found in the absence of renal failure. Also treatment with an aldosterone antagonist was associated with a normal <b>ionised</b> magnesium concentration, but the total magnesium concentration was decreased; when additional magnesium was administered, the total magnesium concentration approached a normal value, while <b>ionised</b> magnesium slightly exceeded reference values. Only during cyclosporin treatment did both <b>ionised</b> and total magnesium concentrations become lowered. However, the decrease of total magnesium exceeded that of <b>ionised</b> magnesium due to concomitant hypoalbuminaemia with reduction of the protein-bound fraction. It is conclude...|$|R

25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and many other things. In the measurement of gamma rays or other <b>ionising</b> radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'.

40|$|A {{response}} equation for conductivity detection in {{ion chromatography}} has been derived. This equation is applicable to non-suppressed ion chromatography using both fully <b>ionised</b> and partially <b>ionised</b> eluents. A prime assumption of this equation {{is that when}} partially <b>ionised</b> eluents are used (such as benzoic acid), both the <b>ionised</b> and neutral components of the eluent species contribute to the detector response of anionic analytes. Experimental evidence is provided to support this assumption in that pH changes accompanying the elution of an analyte have been measured. These pH changes are proportional to the concentration of analyte injected onto the column, in accordance with predictions from the response equation. Furthermore, it is shown that protonated eluents (such as benzoic acid) give more sensitive detection than equivalent <b>ionised</b> eluents (such as potassium benzoate) and the signal enhancement achieved using a protonated eluent species is in accordance with theory...|$|R

25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to <b>ionising</b> radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E
25|$|The fMRI {{technique}} can complement or supplement {{other techniques}} {{because of its}} unique strengths and gaps. It can noninvasively record brain signals without risks of <b>ionising</b> radiation inherent in other scanning methods, such as CT or PET scans. It can also record signal from all regions of the brain, unlike EEG/MEG, which are biased toward the cortical surface. But fMRI temporal resolution is poorer than that of EEG since the HDR takes tens of seconds to climb to its peak. Combining EEG with fMRI is hence potentially powerful because the two have complementary strengths—EEG has high temporal resolution, and fMRI high spatial resolution. But simultaneous acquisition needs {{to account for the}} EEG signal from varying blood flow triggered by the fMRI gradient field, and the EEG signal from the static field.

25|$|Liquid ammonia is {{the best-known}} and most widely studied nonaqueous <b>ionising</b> solvent. Its most {{conspicuous}} property {{is its ability}} to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing solvated electrons. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH3 with those of water shows NH3 has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, viscosity, dielectric constant and electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH3 and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH3 molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H2O molecule. The ionic self-dissociation constant of liquid NH3 at −50°C is about 10−33 mol2·l−2.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} negative ionisation of inspired air on bronchial reactivity, 11 asthmatic children were challenged twice by exercise and 10 were challenged twice by histamine inhalation. The children breathed negatively <b>ionised</b> air (4 X 10 (5) - 10 X 10 (5) ions/cm 3) or control room air in random order in a double-blind fashion. All challenges were matched in terms of basal lung function and the exercise tests were matched in terms of ventilation and respiratory heat loss. Exercise-induced asthma was significantly attenuated by exposure to negatively <b>ionised</b> air, the mean postexercise fall in one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) being 29 % (SE 5 %) of the initial value after the control and 21 % (3 %) after the <b>ionised</b> air test (p less than 0. 02). Ten of the 11 subjects developed less exercise-induced asthma while breathing <b>ionised</b> air.
