50|$|Robert Netting began anthropological {{research}} with the Kofyar in the early 1960s. In the Kofyar homeland population densities were high, approaching 500/km² in many areas. Netting's primary focus was on the Kofyar ecological adaptations, including the highly intensive agriculture being practiced and also the social institutions that were instrumental to sustainability. Much of the land was in annual cultivation, with animal herds providing dung compost for fertilizer, and steep hillsides were intricately terraced. Netting's Hill Farmers of Nigeria, a classic book {{in the field of}} cultural ecology, showed how social institutions such as household form and land tenure had adjusted to the intensive cultivation system. Netting compared adaptations of Kofyar and their neighbors to demonstrate Ester Boserup's thesis that agricultural intensification relates to the growth of increasingly dense population and decreasing per capita land area. Kofyar families farmed most intensively close to their homesteads while using less intensive bush and <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> systems, which required less investment, on more distant fields. Netting also observed that the Kofyar demonstrated a reversion to less labor-intensive long-fallow systems when land became available on the plains south of their traditional region. He further developed these ideas and placed the Kofyar within a much broader comparative context in his Smallholders, Householders.|$|E

The forest area admeasures about 400 ha.Prior to 1960, the forest area was reasonably rich in tree and grasses {{to the extent}} that it could fulfill the requirements of small size timber for farm implements, fuel wood for cooking, grasses and fodder for cattle, then village population, as told by the village elders living in the village. With the availability of this natural resource and farm grown fodder the villagers practiced animal husbandry and kept milch cattle like cows and buffaloes. The agriculture was irrigated from dug out wells which later on shifted to tube wells.The locality of Lamkani receives average annual rainfall of 400 mm. and therefore falls in the category of ‘‘Drought Prone Area as defined by the District Administration. However, during last five decades there has been gradual and perceptible erratic rainfall pattern in this locality as experienced by the villagers. This is reported to affect crop yields adversely and so was the impact on the vegetation around that included the forest area. So also with increase in human population from sixties to nineties coupled with cattle population, the biotic pressure on the forest gradually increased which caused the degradation of tree growth and loss of grasses. The heavy grazing by the cattle resulted stoppage of regeneration of new grasses due to no seeding of seeds and trampling of new grasses. The ecological conditions of the village deteriorated over period of time. The number of cattle slowly reduced due to lesser fodder and grass availability. The dairying profession was reduced and finally had to be completely abandoned.The water levels in the wells dropped creating shortage of water for villagers and their cattle which necessitated villagers to search for deeper sources that came from handy in the form of tube wells; thanks to the drilling technology. During 1997-2000, the village saw drilling of about 200 tube wells to augment the water requirements. So also the villagers saw deeper drilling to reach water table that dropped from average of 350 feet to 950 feet.The water scarcity however could not improve. The village was required to be supplied water by tanker from other places. That was perhaps the worst point of time - the year 2000, in the ecological history of the village.

40|$|With {{tropical}} deforestation {{a major contributor}} to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, the land-use decisions of small-scale farmers at the forest margins have important implications for the global environment. Farmers’ incentives for maintaining <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> in a shifting cultivation agricultural system depend upon the market and non-market services it provides to them. This study estimates the value of those services, including hydrological externalities that may affect other farms downstream. The analysis uses cross-sectional farm-level survey data from the Zona Bragantina in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon to assess the value of <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> to farmers and test whether it provides local externalities. I estimate production functions for crops and forest products to determine the contributions of on-farm and off-farm <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> to income from these two activities. Instrumental variables and spatial econometric approaches help address issues of endogeneity and variation in unobservable factors over space. I use geographic information on the location of farms to obtain data on external <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> and to model the hydrological externality as an upstream-to-downstream process. The results indicate that fallow does contribute significantly to productivity both on-farm and downstream, boosting income from both crops and forest products. In addition, most farms appear to allocate sufficient land to fallow, accounting for both the value of hydrological spillovers and the opportunity cost of land left out of cultivation. These results suggest that farming communities may have some self-interest in preserving forest cover locally—a finding that may bolster policy efforts aimed at conserving tropical forests.

40|$|The {{detection}} of secondary growth stages {{is fundamental to}} understanding the dynamics of forest loss and recovery at broad geographic scales. This study combines three remote-sensing techniques: vegetation indices, principal components analysis, and texture analysis, to distinguish forest successional stage and <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> length in a landscape of smallholder shifting cultivation (milpa) in the Central Yucatán Peninsula.

40|$|Abstract The role of {{secondary}} vegetation in restoring soil fertility during shifting cultivation {{in the tropics}} is well known. Yet the effect {{of secondary}} succession on the spatial patterns of soil properties has received little attention. To determine whether changes in the plant commu-nity {{as a result of}} shifting cultivation affect the scale of spatial dependence for biologically important soil nutrients, we sampled three dry tropical forest stands in Campeche, Mexico. These stands represented a gradient of cultivation history: one mature forest stand, a <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> that had undergone one cultivation-fallow cycle, and a <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> that had undergone two cultivation-fallow cycles. We used an analysis of semivariance to quantify the scale and magnitude of spatial dependence for organic matter content (OM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and alu-minum (Al) in each stand. The scale of spatial dependence varied with cultivation history, but the degree of spatial dependence did not differ among stands. In the mature forest P and K were autocorrelated over distances> 7. 5 m. In the forest fallows 48 – 88 % of the variation in soil P and K was autocorrelated over distances up to 1. 1 – 5. 1 m. In contrast, the range of autocorrela-tion for Al (~ 2. 5 m) did not differ among stands. We conclude that shifting cultivation changes the range of autocorrelation for biologically impor-tant soil nutrients at a scale that may influence plant growth. The finer scaled pattern of soil nutrients in forest fallows is likely to persist with continued shifting cultivation, since fallows are cleared every 3 – 15 years...|$|E

This paper discusses the opportunities and constraints to farmers' regeneration and management of secondary forests. The analysis generalizes findings from case studies of new and old settlement areas in Peru, Brazil and Nicaragua, to derive generic management principles. In each country diagnostic farm surveys, multi-resource forest inventories and farmer-participatory research were carried out. Results show that about 25 % of farm area remains under secondary forest even after a century of settlement. Secondary forests are the only significant forest resource available to the rural poor in older settlement areas. Secondary forests consist primarily of secondary <b>forest</b> <b>fallows.</b> Small areas are also maintained more permanently. Results show that an integrated resource management approach will be required, with management of secondary forests complemented by policy reforms and management of soils and residual forests. Different management strategies will be required for new and older settlement areas.

For newer areas, policies and technologies for slowing down the conversion of residual forest to agriculture and secondary forest would result in more biodiversity conservation and less, but more productive, secondary forest at later stages of frontier development.

Population explosion has rooted deforestation at different altitudes to bring more area under cultivation leading to fallow lands. Objective of this study was to assess the impact of altitude on electro-chemical properties and enzymatic activities of <b>forest</b> and <b>fallow</b> land soils of Almora district of Central Himalaya. Seventy soil samples were collected from different altitudes of <b>forest</b> and <b>fallow</b> lands of Almora. Electro-chemical properties, soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), β-glucosidase, dehydrogenase and phosphatase activities were determined following the standard procedures. Both <b>forest</b> and <b>fallow</b> land soils were acidic in nature. Content of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium were high in range and increased with altitudes. Average content of total nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in forest lands was 2115. 39, 111. 89 and 2189. 36 kg ha 1, respectively. Similarly for the fallow lands the corresponding values were 1491. 27, 80. 26 and 2650. 75 kg ha- 1, respectively.

In this ecological approach contains of analyse floristic of the primary forest of different altitude, secondary <b>forest</b> (<b>fallow</b> system of different ages), transition zone (zone ecotone), home garden, villages, protection area and sacred sites. The result indicated that the degradation of environment in the Baliem Valley, principally caused by agricultural activity and exploitation of natural resources. The traditional agricultural activities of Dani–Baliem society influence on decreasing of genetic resources on wild plant (wild species). On the contrary, these activities in the intraspecific diversity level, increase the number of cultivated plants. Further, Dani–Baliem people activities also influence the ecological diversity. This can be seen from different unit of environment existence like secondary forest, agricultural area, protection zone, sacred site, habitation areas etc.), where every unit have a specific use and a specific plant diversity...|$|E
40|$|Effects of fallow type, sucker {{sanitation}} (hot-water treatment, HWT) {{and fertilizer}} application on yield, root and corm health of two plantain cultivars were investigated. Most yield parameters were strongest affected by fallow type with more producing plants, higher bunch mass and yield after forest clearing than in bush/grass fallow. The {{second most important}} factor was HWT with more producing plants (52. 3 %) than in control (35. 8 %, p 5 0. 0001). Fertilizer application increased the proportion of producing plants by 9 %, p 5 0. 018 and yield from 4. 08 – 5. 79 Mg ha 71. Combined HWT and fertilizer had strong synergistic effects. Cultivar interacted with fallow and HWT: in bush/grass fallow yield did not differ between cultivars (2. 17 Mg ha 71); in <b>forest</b> <b>fallow</b> Essong produced 57 % (9. 4 Mg ha 71) more than Ebang (6. 0 Mg ha 71, p 5 0. 001). Essong yielded 65 % more after HWT than Ebang (8. 0 versus 4. 9 Mg ha 71, p 5 0. 001), yet not when untreated. A limited sink capacity of Ebang is likely to constrain yield increases. HWT improved root and corm health and was better in forest than in bush/grass land. In bush/grass fallow no treatment attained yields as high as in forest even when untreated and not fertilized. Soil chemical properties {{were not correlated with}} yield. Peer Revie...|$|E

30|$|The Framework law on {{pastoralism}} (Loi d’orientation relative au pastoralisme LORP 2009 - 034) {{was adopted}} in 2002. This {{is the first}} framework law on pastoralism ever voted in Burkina Faso. The implementing decrees of this act were adopted {{five years after the}} law was passed. Several types of pastoral areas (village grazing land, <b>forests,</b> <b>fallow</b> fields, fields after harvest, stock routes, etc.) and rights of access to water and crop residues are guaranteed by the state and by the local community who are held responsible for the protection of these resources. Herd mobility is also recognized by the law. However, it is channelled in stock routes and hindered by a compulsory transhumance certificate. In practice, the law is not applied. The state fails to protect rangelands and regional stock routes from the extension of cropland by surrounding farmers or migrants, which jeopardizes the mobile herders’ territorialities as confirmed by two pieces of evidence we collected during our field survey.|$|R
40|$|The species richness, {{number of}} plants, biomass, and species {{composition}} of holo- and hemi-epiphytes {{were recorded in}} fifty-six 0. 04 -ha plots, distributed over <b>forest</b> <b>fallows</b> of 2 - 30 y old and mature forests in lowland Amazonia (Amacayacu National Park, Colombia). A total of 9190 epiphytic plants representing 162 species were recorded on 4277 phorophytes. Seventy species were classified as holo-epiphyte and 85 as hemi-epiphyte. Aroids were most diverse (58 species) and represented 76 % of the total recorded biomass. Anemochory was more dominant among holo-epiphytes and zoochory among hemi-epiphytes. The species richness, density and biomass of both holo and hemi-epiphytes increased significantly from young fallows to old <b>fallows</b> and mature <b>forests.</b> Hemi-epiphytes had greater density and biomass than holo-epiphytes. In canonical ordination, forest age did not relate to the species composition of holo-epiphytes. However, for hemi-epiphytes, the age effect was significant, suggesting that species turnover {{takes place in the}} ageing fallows...|$|R
