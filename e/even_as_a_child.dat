25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E

He graduated from the school in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, and later earned a master's degree in 2003 from the school in special education. After several years he was generally acknowledged as the best decathlete to date. At this time Dan O'Brien appeared on the scene and began to provide Dave with his first real competition. O'Brien and Johnson became good friends and consistently placed first and second in most events. O'Brien eventually began to be considered the best overall decathlete, but Johnson earned the recognition as the best ever at 2nd day events. Johnson {{was a member of the}} 1988 U.S. Olympic team.|$|E

Accounts tell of his youthful optimism and of {{his vision of the}} abbey being restored. [...] While still a boy, Dunstan was stricken with a near-fatal illness and effected a seemingly miraculous recovery. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> he was noted for his devotion to learning and for his mastery of many kinds of artistic craftsmanship. With his parents' consent he was tonsured, received minor orders and served in the ancient church of St Mary. He became so well known for his devotion to learning that he {{is said to have been}} summoned by his uncle Athelm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to enter his service.

500|$|Themistocles {{was born}} in Athens around 524BC, the son of Neocles, who was, {{in the words of}} Plutarch [...] "no very {{conspicuous}} man". His mother is more obscure; according to Plutarch, she was either a Thracian woman called Abrotonon, or Euterpe, a Carian from Halicarnassus. Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father. Plutarch considers this to be false. Plutarch indicates that, on account of his mother's background, Themistocles was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of Athens, Cynosarges, outside the city walls. However, in an early example of his cunning, Themistocles persuaded [...] "well-born" [...] children to exercise with him in Cynosarges, thus breaking down the distinction between [...] "alien and legitimate". Plutarch further reports that Themistocles was preoccupied, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> with preparing for public life. His teacher is said to have told him: [...] "My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, but definitely something great, either for good or evil." ...|$|E

2500|$|Collins {{says she}} drew {{inspiration}} for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of inspiration is the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, in which, as a punishment for past crimes, Minos forces Athens to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast labyrinth.

2500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> grows older, {{death is}} still {{difficult}} to fathom and this affects how a child responds.

Reactions can manifest themselves in [...] "acting out" [...] behaviors: a return to earlier behaviors such as sucking thumbs, clinging to a toy or angry behavior; though {{they do not have}} the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity. As children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.|$|E

As Dakshayani grew to womanhood, the idea of marrying anyone else, as intended by her father, became anathema to her.
