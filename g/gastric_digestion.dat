40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Celiac {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by intestinal inflammation triggered by gliadin, a component of dietary gluten. Oral administration of proteases that can rapidly degrade gliadin in the gastric compartment has been proposed {{as a treatment for}} celiac disease; however, no protease has been shown to specifically reduce the immunogenic gliadin content, in gastric conditions, to below the threshold shown to be toxic for celiac patients. Here, we used the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to redesign the active site of the acid-active gliadin endopeptidase KumaMax. The resulting protease, Kuma 030, specifically recognizes tripeptide sequences that are found throughout the immunogenic regions of gliadin, as well as in homologous proteins in barley and rye. Indeed, treatment of gliadin with Kuma 030 eliminates the ability of gliadin to stimulate a T cell response.

40|$|Abstract Background Safety {{assessment}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) food, with regard to allergenic potential of transgene-encoded xenoproteins, typically involves several different methods, evaluation by digestibility being one thereof. However, there are still debates about whether the allergenicity of food allergens is related to their resistance to <b>digestion</b> by the <b>gastric</b> fluid. The disagreements may in part stem from classification of allergens only by their sources, which we believe is inadequate, and the difficulties in achieving identical experimental conditions for studying <b>digestion</b> by simulated <b>gastric</b> fluid (SGF) so that results can be compared. Here, we reclassify allergenic food allergens into alimentary canal-sensitized (ACS) and non-alimentary canal-sensitized (NACS) allergens and use a computational model that simulates <b>gastric</b> fluid <b>digestion</b> to analyze the digestibilities of these two types. Results The model {{presented in this paper}} is as effective as SGF digestion experiments, but more stable and reproducible. On the basis of this model, food allergens are satisfactorily classified as ACS and NACS types by their pathways for sensitization; the former are relatively resistant to <b>gastric</b> fluid <b>digestion</b> while the later are relatively labile. Conclusion The results suggest that it is better to classify allergens into ACS and NACS types when understanding the relationship between their digestibility and allergenicity and the digestibility of a target foreign protein is a parameter for evaluating its allergenicity during safety assessments of GM food. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{the role}} of <b>gastric</b> <b>digestion</b> (by acid-dependent pepsins) in overall protein {{assimilation}} has never thoroughly been studied, it is {{generally considered to be}} limited. Protein that escapes assimilation in the small intestine is intensely fermented by the colonic flora. Phenol and p-cresol are specific bacterial metabolites of tyrosine. AIM: To elucidate {{the role of}} <b>gastric</b> <b>digestion</b> of protein by evaluating the influence of acid suppression therapy on overall protein assimilation and fermentation. METHODS: Protein assimilation was studied in 16 healthy subjects under basal conditions and after omeprazole treatment using the combined 14 C-octanoic acid/ 13 C-egg white breath test. The degree of protein fermentation was estimated by measuring the urinary output of phenol and p-cresol in 41 healthy volunteers and in 17 patients treated for more than 1 month with omeprazole because of peptic disease. RESULTS: Protein assimilation was significantly impaired after omeprazole treatment. Gastric emptying, conversely, was not affected. The urinary output of phenol and p-cresol was increased in patients treated with omeprazole as compared to untreated controls. CONCLUSION: Gastric acid suppression therapy hampers protein assimilation and may promote protein malabsorption. <b>Gastric</b> <b>digestion</b> is likely to play a substantial role in overall protein assimilation. status: publishe...|$|E

In experiment 2, first step {{was followed by the}} hydrolysis with the multi-enzyme pancreatin (intestinal digestion), at pH 6. 8 and 37 °C for 4 h. The released glucose (RG) and the refractive index (RI) were determined from the supernatant obtained after centrifugation.

The lowest value was recorded after 2 hours of <b>gastric</b> <b>digestion</b> (0. 332 mg/mL). The concentration of the reducing sugars increased throughout the intestinal digestion from 0. 549 mg/mL up to 1. 990 mg/mL, as a result of starch hydrolysis to dextrins, maltose and then to glucose.

Despite this, we feel that temperatures within this range probably had minimal impacts on the <b>gastric</b> <b>digestion</b> rate. This minimal effect on <b>gastric</b> <b>digestion</b> over the 10 °C interval commonly encountered by cornsnakes means they can engage in activities other than thermoregulation without impacting digestion.|$|E
