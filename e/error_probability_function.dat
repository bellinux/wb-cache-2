Since the components in such circuits are subjected to circuit-specific aspects like reconvergence and logic masking, their error bounds are highly dependent on circuit structure and the error bounds for each circuit is unique in that way. In this work, we present a study of circuit-specific error bounds for fault-tolerant computation in heterogeneous circuits.

We generalize the diversity order and the multiplexing gain to diversity profile (DP) and multiplexing profile (MP), respectively. By expanding the log of <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> <b>function</b> (or data rate function) into a iterated log function expansion (ILFE) in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the generalized profiles capture the traditional diversity order or multiplexing gain in the first order, but extend them to include higher order effects. Using the lexicographical order for ranking the profile, we show that schemes with higher ranked diversity profiles (or multiplexing profiles) have better asymptotic error performance (or higher asymptotic data rate). We then investigate the tradeoff between these two profiles and consequently extend the DMT to diversity and multiplexing profile tradeoff (DMPT), which provides a more detailed analysis on the tradeoff between error probability and data rate in asymptotically high SNR. We compare the traditional DMT and the DMPT of several communication systems, including point-to-point systems, systems with parallel channels, and systems with relays.

40|$|Reliability {{modeling}} and evaluation {{is expected to}} be one of the major issues in emerging nano-devices and beyond 22 nm CMOS. Such devices would have inherent propensity for gate failures due to the underlying device variabilities. Many of these failures would be transient in nature, necessitating the need for probabilistic logic based analysis. Current research in this area is concerned with computing error bounds, but they do not account for circuits structures or are usually derived for specific logic gate types. In addition, the usual focus is on computing the average error behavior. In this work, we propose an exact probabilistic error model to compute the maximum error in a circuit-specific manner and can handle various types of logical components in the same circuit. We model the error estimation problem as a maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP) over the joint <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> <b>function</b> of the entire circuit. Using this model, we can not only compute the maximum error, but can also identify the input vector that cause the maximum output error. We demonstrate this model using MCNC and IS-CAS circuits.
