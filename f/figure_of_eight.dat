5|$|The bailey was an {{enclosed}} courtyard overlooked by the motte {{and surrounded by}} a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch. The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte, but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain. The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was {{the centre of the}} castle's economic activity. The bailey was linked to the motte either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the motte. Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> around the castle. Wherever possible, nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.|$|E

25|$|Retro-direct drivetrains used on {{some early}} 20th century {{bicycles}} have been resurrected by bicycle hobbyists. These have two possible gear ratios but no gear lever; the operator simply pedals forward for one gear and backward for the other. The chain path is quite complicated, since it effectively {{has to do}} a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> as well as follow the normal chain path.|$|E
25|$|Born in Scotland, Alexander Cockburn {{grew up in}} Youghal, County Cork, Ireland. He was {{the eldest}} son of the former Communist author and journalist, Claud Cockburn, by his third wife, Patricia Byron, née Arbuthnot (who also wrote an autobiography, <b>Figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eight).</b> His ancestral family {{included}} Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet, {{who was responsible for}} burning down Washington in the War of 1812. He had two younger brothers, Andrew Cockburn and Patrick Cockburn, who are also journalists. His half-sister, the barrister and mystery writer Sarah Caudwell, died in 2000. In addition, journalists Laura Flanders and Stephanie Flanders are his half-nieces, daughters of his half-sister Claudia Cockburn and her husband Michael Flanders. Actress Olivia Wilde is his niece, daughter of his brother Andrew Cockburn.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of the chains involved several processes: The <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> links were punched from {{a sheet of}} steel and assembled three deep with the centre link overlapping the two outer, like a bicycle chain. The links were held together with rivets cut from steel wire and hooks punched from sheet metal were attached to either end. The entire chain was filed smooth, burnished and tempered in hot oil. Because the work was so fine, the chains were often thinner than a piece of cotton thread, a magnifying instrument was required. In addition it was common practice to place a glass globe filled with water {{in front of a}} candle and a mirror behind to increase the light. By 1793 Robert Cox had a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. Production flourished and in 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. It was built to an advanced design with particularly large windows on either side. 74' long but only 18' wide, it allowed the maximum amount of natural light to enter.|$|E
50|$|The {{match in}} Ceylon was versus the Ceylon Board President's XI at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo, the International XI winning by 194 runs after Underwood {{produced}} the outstanding <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> for 10 and seven for 33.|$|R
50|$|In {{his debut}} season, James played off a half-forward flank and booted the terribly {{inaccurate}} <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> goals, 43 behinds. Throughout his career {{he played in}} a variety of positions, including the backline. After his retirement in 1963, he went to coach Robinvale.|$|R
25|$|Klusener {{made his}} Test debut for South Africa against India in Calcutta {{during the second}} Test in 1996/97. Klusener, at the time playing {{primarily}} as a bowler, took some fearful hammering {{at the hands of}} Mohammad Azharuddin, who at one point hit him for five consecutive fours, in his first innings of his debut but returned career best <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> for 64 in the second.|$|R

500|$|The Quantock Greenway is a {{footpath}} {{that opened}} in 2001. The route of the path follows a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> centred on Triscombe.

500|$|At {{the grounds}} of the tower there was a large {{permanent}} funfair, with rides including <b>Figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eight,</b> Wall Of Death, Donkey Derby, The Himalayan Switchback Railway and The Caterpillar. To give easy access from the promenade entrance to the tower, a chair lift was introduced. [...] In 1898–99 an acrobat named Hardy performed for a season at the tower without a safety net and often without a balancing pole on the high wire [...] above the dancing platform. In 1908 the 'Himalaya Railway'was replaced with a scenic railway.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the words}} ‘we have been successful,’ had no sooner issued {{from the mouth}} of the man with the bag, than Mr. Simon Tuggs rose from the tub of weekly Dorset, opened his eyes very wide, gasped for breath, made <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> in the air with his pen, and finally fell into the arms of his anxious mother, and fainted away without the {{slightest}} ostensible cause or pretence.|$|R
60|$|He turned twice or thrice {{in a big}} circle, weaving {{his head}} from right to left. Then he began making loops and <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> with his body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided figures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never {{stopping}} his low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last the dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but {{they could hear the}} rustle of the scales.|$|R

2500|$|The {{elimination}} trials, held on Sunday 28 September {{were not}} expected to be as challenging as they turned out. [...] There was a transport, store and reassemble test which involved folding or dismantling the wings, moving the aircraft a short distance and housing in a shed 10ft (3 m) wide, then reversing the process. This had to be done by only two people. A flying test followed, a flight of one lap plus a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> to be made from each cockpit in turn.|$|E
2500|$|Competitors No.s 5, 8 and 11 did {{not arrive}} {{in time for}} the {{elimination}} trials. [...] The Missel Thrush did, but was out even {{before the start of the}} elimination test, badly damaged in an accident begun with undercarriage failure. The elimination trials did not reduce the field as severely as in 1924, but three aircraft (No.1, 12 and 15) were disqualified after suffering undercarriage failures in the flying tests. These tests involved a pair of five-minute flights over the airfield, including a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight,</b> the first flown from one cockpit and the second from the other. All the entrants passed the weight checks, the dismantle-house-reassemble test, similar to that undertaken in 1924 and the more demanding take off test.|$|E
2500|$|Swift moths are crepuscular {{and some}} species form leks, also {{thought to have}} arisen {{independently}} in the genus Ogygioses (Palaeosetidae). In most genera, males fly swiftly to virgin females that are calling with scent. In other genera, virgin females [...] "assemble" [...] upwind to displaying males, which emit a musky pheromone from scales on the metathoracic tibiae. In such cases of sex role reversal, there may be visual cues also: males of the European ghost swift are possibly the most frequently noticed species, being white, ghostly and conspicuous when forming a lek at dusk. Sometimes they hover singly as if suspended from a thread or flying in a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> motion. The chemical structures of some pheromones have been analysed.|$|E
50|$|Dressage {{movements}} {{may include}} circles, <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight,</b> and crossing the diagonal and all paces - walk, working trot, collected trot, extended trot, canter, a halt, and a rein back. Multiple horses are judged on {{ability to move}} in harmony and ideally will have similar conformation, action, and movement. Horses are {{to remain on the}} bit throughout the test, maintaining impulsion, elasticity, rhythm, and forward movement. The goal is to make the test look effortless, and an obedient and responsive horse is essential for a good dressage test.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2006, Watson flew to Los Angeles {{to record}} his album That's Life. On the flight, {{he told his}} {{producer}} that he was experiencing terrible pressure inside his skull. When they landed, his producer suggested a game of tennis to clear his head. Watson {{could not see the}} ball at all. After a visit to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and an MRI scan, he was advised that he had a developing pituitary adenoma, which was the size of two golf balls. According to Watson, [...] "Since an early age I've had an in-built premonition, a vision that I wouldn't make 40. For the previous seven years I'd have a recurring nightmare in which my head exploded. And here I was with a brain tumour on the eve of my 40th birthday; I thought, 'This is it, I was right, I knew it'." [...] Watson recalled that the tumours were [...] "like a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight,</b> one filling the frontal cavity of my skull, the other forced through into the top of my nose." [...] He stayed in Los Angeles for two days and continued recording his album while tests confirmed whether the tumour was malignant or not – {{it turned out to be}} benign.|$|E
2500|$|The role of Juan Diego as both {{representing}} and {{confirming the}} human {{dignity of the}} indigenous Indian populations and of asserting their right to claim a place of honour in the New World is therefore embedded in the earliest narratives, nor did it thereafter become dormant awaiting rediscovery in the 20th century. Archbishop Lorenzana, in a sermon of 1770, applauded the evident fact that the Virgin signified honour to the Spaniards (by stipulating for the title [...] "Guadalupe"), to the Indians (by choosing Juan Diego), and to those of mixed race (by the colour of her face). In another place in the sermon he noted a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> on the Virgin's robe and said it represented the two worlds that she was protecting (the old and the new). This aim of harmonising and giving due recognition to the different cultures in Mexico rather than homogenizing them was also evident in the iconography of Guadalupe in the 18th century {{as well as in}} the celebrations attending the coronation of the image of Guadalupe in 1895 at which a place was given to 28 Indians from Cuautitlán (Juan Diego's birthplace) wearing traditional costume. The prominent role accorded indigenous participants in the actual canonization ceremony (not without criticism by liturgical purists) constituted one of the most striking features of those proceedings.|$|E

The Australians lost their first five wickets for 137, but Darling, batting at number five, made the Australians' first hundred of the tour. His innings of five hours lasted into the third day. The seventh-wicket stand with Bert Hopkins was worth 131 runs, and the eighth-wicket stand with wicketkeeper Jim Kelly a further 119. The Australians made 474, before Warwick Armstrong took career-best <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> for 47 as the hosts were bowled out for 183 to secure the Australians' first win on tour.|$|R
60|$|Remember old Nelson! Certainly. And {{to begin}} with, {{his name was}} not Nelson. The Englishmen in the Archipelago called him Nelson because it was more convenient, I suppose, and he never protested. It would have been mere pedantry. The true form of his name was Nielsen. He had come out East long {{before the advent of}} {{telegraph}} cables, had served English firms, had married an English girl, had been one of us for years, trading and sailing in all directions through the Eastern Archipelago, across and around, transversely, diagonally, perpendicularly, in semi-circles, and zigzags, and <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eights,</b> for years and years.|$|R
2500|$|Although Ridgway did {{not play}} {{in any of the}} Tests that year, he was {{regarded}} as a contender for honours but, in 1950, injury again took its toll. Career-best <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> for 39, however, against Nottinghamshire {{at the tail end of}} the season, were followed by an impressive 1951, where he took over 90 wickets and, with Alec Bedser amongst others declining to tour India, Ridgway was a natural choice, and was one of seven players who made their Test debut on that trip where he opened the bowling with Brian Statham. Ridgway took 41 wickets at an average of 26.04 in 16 first-class matches on the tour, but only seven wickets at 54.14 in the five Tests.|$|R
6000|$|To the {{rendering}} [...] "circular" [...] it is objected that {{a circular}} shield of, say, four feet {{and a half}} in diameter, would be intolerably heavy and superfluously wide, while the shields represented in Mycenaean art are not circles, but rather resemble a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight,</b> in some cases, or a section of a cylinder, in others, or, again, a door (Fig. 5, p. 130).|$|E

60|$|Sir Henry Lee {{remained}} still confused, {{and unable}} to answer, when there arrived a fourth person, whom the cries of Alice had summoned to the spot. This was Joceline Joliffe, one of the under-keepers of the walk, who, seeing how matters stood, brandished his quarterstaff, a weapon from which he never parted, and having made it describe the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> in a flourish through the air, would have brought it down with a vengeance upon {{the head of the}} steward, had not Sir Henry interposed.|$|E
50|$|In 1913-14, Barnes toured South Africa with MCC {{and played}} {{in the first four}} Tests of a five match series. He missed the last Test because of a {{financial}} disagreement. His 49 wickets on the matting pitches used in this series remains the world record for wickets taken in a Test series. In the second Test at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg, he became the first bowler to take more than 15 wickets in a Test with <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>eight</b> for 56 and nine for 103 resulting in a match analysis of seventeen for 159. Only Jim Laker's match analysis of nineteen for 90 in 1956 has since surpassed this feat.|$|R
