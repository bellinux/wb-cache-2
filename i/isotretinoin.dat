5|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral <b>isotretinoin.</b> After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that <b>isotretinoin</b> use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. <b>Isotretinoin</b> use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for <b>isotretinoin,</b> she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent <b>isotretinoin</b> use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E
5|$|High-risk {{neuroblastoma}} {{is treated}} with intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, bone marrow / {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation, biological-based therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid (<b>isotretinoin</b> or Accutane) and antibody therapy usually administered with the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-2.|$|E
5|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{is a high}} concern using two methods {{at the same time}} is reasonable, and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug <b>isotretinoin,</b> due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|When {{the lesion}} is localized, it is {{generally}} curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent <b>isotretinoin</b> also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking <b>isotretinoin</b> due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, <b>isotretinoin,</b> retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. <b>Isotretinoin</b> pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids <b>isotretinoin</b> and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> is {{primarily}} (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Three metabolites of <b>Isotretinoin</b> are detectable in human plasma after oral administration: 4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoid acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin). <b>Isotretinoin</b> also oxidizes, irreversibly, to 4-oxo-isotretinoin—which forms its geometric isomer 4-oxo-tretinoin. After an orally-administered, 80mg dose of liquid suspension 14C-isotretinoin, 14C-activity in blood declines with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of <b>isotretinoin</b> and its conjugates are then excreted in the subject's urine and faeces in relatively equal amounts. After a single, 80mg oral dose of <b>Isotretinoin</b> to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean ±SD elimination half-life (t1/2) of <b>isotretinoin</b> and 4-oxo-isotretinoin were 21.0 ± 8.2 hours and 24.0 ± 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of <b>isotretinoin</b> ranged from 0.90 to 5.43 {{in patients with}} cystic acne.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{dispensing}} of <b>isotretinoin</b> is by an FDA-mandated website called iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE {{has applied}} to <b>isotretinoin</b> prescriptions since 1 March 2006. Under it, dermatologists must register their patients {{on the system}} before prescribing <b>isotretinoin.</b> Pharmacists must then verify the prescription on the iPLEDGE website before dispensing <b>isotretinoin.</b> The website allows no more than thirty days' supply of the drug to be prescribed or dispensed; and after issuance, another prescription may not be written for at least 30 days (even {{in the case of}} lost prescriptions). Prescriptions expire from iPLEDGE if not picked up from the pharmacy seven days after issuance. Physicians and pharmacists must verify written prescriptions on the system before filling an <b>isotretinoin</b> prescription. Due to the teratogenic effects of <b>isotretinoin,</b> iPLEDGE makes additional requirements of female patients filling prescriptions for the drug: women with child-bearing potential must commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for the duration of <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy and for a month immediately preceding and a month immediately following therapy. Additionally they must have two negative pregnancy tests 30 days apart and have negative pregnancy tests before each prescription is written. Alerts continue to exist against purchasing <b>isotretinoin</b> online.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of acne, the most prescribed retinoid drug is 13-cis retinoic acid (<b>isotretinoin).</b> It reduces the size and secretion of the sebaceous glands. Although {{it is known that}} 40mg of <b>isotretinoin</b> will break down to an equivalent of 10mg of ATRA— the mechanism of action of the drug (original brand name Accutane) remains unknown and is a matter of some controversy. <b>Isotretinoin</b> reduces bacterial numbers in both the ducts and skin surface. This is thought to be a result of the reduction in sebum, a nutrient source for the bacteria. <b>Isotretinoin</b> reduces inflammation via inhibition of chemotactic responses of monocytes and neutrophils. <b>Isotretinoin</b> also has been shown to initiate remodeling of the sebaceous glands; triggering changes in gene expression that selectively induce apoptosis. <b>Isotretinoin</b> is a teratogen with a number of potential side-effects. Consequently, its use requires medical supervision.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, a {{systematic}} review covering all {{articles in the}} literature related to <b>isotretinoin,</b> depression and suicide, as well as articles related to class effect, dose response, and biologic plausibility found that the literature reviewed was consistent with an association of <b>isotretinoin</b> administration and depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable individuals. Following this systematic review, in a 2014 review a group of Australian dermatologists and psychiatrists collaborated {{on a set of}} recommendations for safe prescribing of <b>isotretinoin.</b> However, whether <b>isotretinoin</b> use is causally associated with mental illness remains controversial. In a survey published in February 2015, 37% of 591 dermatologists stated that they believe that <b>isotretinoin</b> may cause psychiatric disturbances.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{a special}} {{procedure}} {{is required to}} obtain the pharmaceutical. In most other countries, a consent form is required which explains these risks. Women taking <b>isotretinoin</b> must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy. Sexual abstinence or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., condoms) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable failure rates of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy are generally counselled to have a termination. <b>Isotretinoin</b> {{has no effect on}} male fertility.|$|E
25|$|Studies in {{mice and}} rats have found that retinoids, {{including}} <b>isotretinoin,</b> bind to dopaminergic receptors in the central nervous system. <b>Isotretinoin</b> may affect dopaminergic neurotransmission by disrupting the structure of dopamine receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity. The dopaminergic system is implicated in numerous psychological disorders, including depression. <b>Isotretinoin</b> is also thought to affect the serotonergic system - it increases expression of 5-HT1Areceptors in the pre-synaptic neuron, which inhibit serotonin secretion. <b>Isotretinoin</b> also directly and indirectly increases the translation of the serotonin transporter protein, leading to increased reuptake and consequently reduced synaptic availability of serotonin.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturer}} recommends pregnancy {{be excluded}} in female patients two {{weeks prior to}} commencement of <b>isotretinoin,</b> and they should use two simultaneous forms of effective contraception at least one month prior to commencement, during, and {{for at least one}} month following <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, <b>isotretinoin</b> {{can only}} be {{prescribed}} by dermatologists or specialist physicians; some countries also allow limited prescription by general practitioners and family doctors. In the United Kingdom and Australia, <b>isotretinoin</b> may be prescribed only by or {{under the supervision of}} a consultant dermatologist. Because severe cystic acne has the potential to cause permanent scarring over a short period, restrictions on its more immediate availability have proved contentious. In New Zealand, <b>isotretinoin</b> can be prescribed by any doctor but subsidised only when prescribed by a vocationally-registered general practitioner, dermatologist or nurse practitioner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{cutaneous}} lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{association}} between <b>isotretinoin</b> use and psychopathology has been controversial. Beginning in 1983, isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after <b>isotretinoin</b> use. A {{number of studies}} have been conducted since then of the drug's effect on depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and other psychological effects.|$|E
25|$|Hyperostosis {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients receiving treatment with <b>isotretinoin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rarely, {{irritable}} {{mood and}} aggression {{have been reported}} during <b>isotretinoin</b> use.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} studies emphasise {{the potential for}} positive behavioural outcomes of <b>isotretinoin</b> treatment associated with its efficacy in treating acne and subsequent improvements in self-esteem. However, such studies are unable to support the conclusion that acne results in clinical depression, nor that <b>isotretinoin</b> treatment leads to an improvement in clinical measures of depression and/or anxiety. Many of the studies cited to support {{the existence of a}} relationship between <b>isotretinoin</b> treatment and decreased symptoms of depression and/or anxiety have significant methodological flaws. For instance, one of the most commonly cited studies involved just 10 patients assessed with unstructured psychiatric interview, involved no control group and didn't report any statistics.|$|E
25|$|One {{study of}} <b>isotretinoin</b> {{found a small}} {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> {{therapy has}} {{furthermore}} proven effective against genital warts in experimental use, but is rarely {{used for this}} indication as there are more effective treatments. <b>Isotretinoin</b> may represent an efficacious and safe alternative systemic form of therapy for recalcitrant condylomata acuminata (RCA) of the cervix. In most countries this therapy is currently unapproved and only used if other therapies failed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> use can rarely {{lead to a}} {{more severe}} form of acne, acne fulminans.|$|E
25|$|Systemic retinoids (<b>isotretinoin,</b> etretinate) are {{contraindicated}} {{during pregnancy}} {{as they may}} cause CNS, cranio-facial, cardiovascular and other defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> is a {{teratogen}} {{highly likely}} to cause birth defects if taken by women during pregnancy or even a short time before conception. A few of the more common birth defects this drug can cause are hearing and visual impairment, missing or malformed earlobes, facial dysmorphism, and abnormalities in brain function. <b>Isotretinoin</b> is classified as FDA Pregnancy Category X and ADEC Category X, and use is contraindicated in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> {{is known}} to cause meibomian gland {{dysfunction}} which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). It has also been found to cause salivary gland dysfunction in some people, causing xerostomia (dry mouth). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of {{the cells of the}} exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some patients after discontinuation of <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|Podophyllin, podofilox and <b>isotretinoin</b> {{should not}} be used during pregnancy, as they could cause birth defects in the fetus.|$|E
25|$|In February 2002, Roche's patents for <b>isotretinoin</b> expired, {{and there}} are now many other {{companies}} selling cheaper generic versions of the drug. On June 29, 2009, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the original creator and distributor of <b>isotretinoin,</b> officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their Accutane brand in the United States due to what the company described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with {{the high cost of}} defending personal-injury lawsuits brought by some patients prescribed the drug. Generic <b>isotretinoin</b> will remain available in the United States through various manufacturers. Roche USA continues to defend Accutane and claims to have treated over 13 million patients since its introduction in 1982. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. apparently will continue to manufacture and distribute Roaccutane outside of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin's exact {{mechanism}} of action is unknown, but several {{studies have shown that}} <b>isotretinoin</b> induces apoptosis (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. <b>Isotretinoin</b> has a low affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{receiving}} <b>isotretinoin</b> therapy are {{not permitted}} to donate blood during and for at least one month after discontinuation of therapy due to its teratogenicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> is {{not only}} {{considered}} the only known possible cure of acne in some patients, but was originally a chemotherapy treatment for certain cancers, such as leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{with good}} {{evidence}} include ivermectin and azelaic acid creams and brimonidine, doxycycline, and <b>isotretinoin</b> by mouth. Lesser evidence supports metronidazole cream and tetracycline by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>Isotretinoin</b> is best absorbed {{when taken}} with a high-fat meal, {{because it has a}} high level of lipophilicity. The {{efficacy}} of <b>isotretinoin</b> doubles when taken after a high-fat meal compared to when taken without food. Due to Isotretinoin's molecular relationship to Vitamin A, it should not be taken with Vitamin A supplements due to the danger of toxicity through cumulative overdosing. Accutane also negatively interacts with tetracycline, another class of acne drug, and with micro-dosed ('mini-pill') progesterone preparations, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol ('OrthoNovum 7/7/7'), St. John's Wort, phenytoin, and systemic corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|Several trials over {{inflammatory}} bowel disease {{claims have}} been held in the United States thus far, with many of them resulting in multimillion-dollar judgments against the makers of <b>isotretinoin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotretinoin</b> may stop {{long bone}} growth {{in young people}} who are still growing. Several reports state that {{premature}} epiphyseal closure can occur in acne patients receiving recommended doses of Accutane.|$|E
