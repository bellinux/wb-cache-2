5|$|Many {{institutes of}} higher {{education}} teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E

The severity of behavioral impairment during depletion depends in part on whether the person expects further challenges and demands. When people <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to exert self-control later, they will curtail current performance more severely than if no such demands are anticipated.|$|E

Without reviewing {{the content of the}} tenure application, they determined that the process was carried out according to policy and denied the appeal.

25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} at the {{beginning}} of August in 1914, the common belief was, that the war would only last {{for a couple of months}} at most. The shipyard management did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> many orders, and therefore reduced the headcount. But after a while the order intake increased; the Imperial Russian Army ordered more vessels, ship repair projects and gave various other assignments. The earlier declared ban the Emipre had laid down towards orders from Finnish companies was practically omitted.|$|E
25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions of confidentiality. But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Cashdan {{proposed}} that mate strategies among both genders differ {{depending on how}} much parental investment is expected of the male, and provided research support for her hypotheses. When men <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to provide a high level of parental investment, they will attempt to attract women by emphasising their ability to invest. In addition, men who expect to invest {{will be more likely to}} highlight their chastity and fidelity than men who expect not to invest. Men with the expectation of low parental investment will flaunt their sexuality to women. The author argues the fact the research supports the idea that men expecting to invest emphasise their chastity and fidelity, which is a high cost strategy (because it lowers reproductive opportunities), suggests that that type of behaviour must be beneficial, or the behaviour would not have been selected.|$|E

25|$|Like most {{industrialists}} of his era, Roach was staunchly anti-union, {{and insisted}} his employees negotiate {{on an individual}} basis for their wages. Roach however, took the concept of individual negotiation much further than most of his contemporaries. Instead of paying a set wage to workers based on their qualifications or skill, he organized a sliding scale of wages for each group, based on a set of criteria Roach himself deemed important. A worker who met all the criteria would receive the top rate, while those who did not would have their wages progressively reduced, depending on the number of criteria they failed. Criteria for payment included not only a worker's skill level, but his punctuality, dependability, eagerness and quality of work, in addition to which his moral character was subject to assessment. Workers who spent too much on alcohol, who paid their rent erratically, whose families were poorly clothed, or whose children did not attend church or school, could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their wages reduced still further.|$|E
500|$|According to Wilkie, [...] "years of {{cooperation}} from both popes and cardinal protectors had taught a wilful Henry VIII to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{his way over}} the church of England". Clement VII died on 25 September before learning of the denial of papal authority on 31 March by the Convocation of Canterbury. In the papal conclave, 1534, Campeggio was the only cardinal to oppose Farnese's proposal for non-secret voting and the only cardinal not to kiss {{the feet of the}} newly elected Farnese as Paul III.|$|E

By choosing a military loyalist to convey the message, and by not including any of the specifics such as the conspirators' names and weapons, Pašić, a survivor, hedged his bets against the various possible outcomes and consequences of the impending assassination.|$|E

500|$|Home's cabinet colleagues Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod, who {{disapproved of}} his candidacy, made a last-minute {{effort to prevent}} him from taking office by trying to persuade Butler and the other {{candidates}} not to take posts in a Home cabinet. Butler, however, believed it to be his duty to serve in the cabinet; he refused to have any part in the conspiracy, and accepted the post of Foreign Secretary. The other candidates followed Butler's lead and only Powell and Macleod held out and refused office under Home. Macleod commented, [...] "One does not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> many people with one in the last ditch."

[...] Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position, and swayed few delegates. He was followed by two other gold men, Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell. Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration's policies, so long that Russell, fearing that Vilas' speech would cut into his time, asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes. Bryan consented, on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount; this was agreed to. [...] "And I needed it for the speech I was to make."

He stated that {{from his point of view}} overtaking was easy, and he did not expect to catch Rossi, but it had been a good start for the season starting from first place, recording the fastest lap, and winning the event. Haryanto said it felt [...] "really great" [...] to finish on the podium, but thought it would be difficult to close the gap with the drivers in front of him. He stated that he did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fast pace on the soft-compound tyres but knew that his pace under race conditions was good. Having been disappointed at his result in the qualifying session, Rossi was pleased to stand on the podium. He felt he achieved the best result for Racing Engineering.
