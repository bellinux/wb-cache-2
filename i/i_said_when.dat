Like all four, we'll play a riff, I'll come in with the drums, and {{next thing you know}} were jamming, and then it sounds like a verse, or a chorus or {{breakdown}} part. And then we'll stop. [...] "Alright, man, we got a great verse, let's try to get a chorus for it." [...] So, you know, that's how the process goes. So it is a full band collaboration, much more than ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Herodotus' {{account of}} the story of Zalmoxis or Zamolxis, the Getae (speaking the same {{language}} as the Dacians and the Thracians, according to Strabo) believed in the immortality of the soul, and regarded death as merely a change of country. Their chief priest held a prominent position as the representative of the supreme deity, Zalmoxis, who is called also Gebeleizis by some among them. Strabo wrote about the high priest of King Burebista Deceneus: [...] "a man who not only had wandered through Egypt, but also had thoroughly learned certain prognostics through which he would pretend to tell the divine will; and within a short time he was set up as god (as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>when</b> relating the story of Zamolxis)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski led 383 laps {{on his way}} to {{his fourth}} win of the season. [...] "What a night," [...] said Keselowski. [...] "Part of me, I pulled into victory lane and I pinched myself once to make sure I wasn't dreaming. These are nights you don't forget as a driver and you live for. The Miller Lite Ford Fusion was just flying, and this is I'm couldn't ask for a better way to enter the Chase than to win and take the first seed. We're ready. We want to run for another Cup. We really feel like this team has it." [...] "You know, it's {{definitely}} frustrating not making that Chase, but like <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> you do make the Chase, {{you want it to be}} for a championship, not just ride around in it," [...] said a disappointed Clint Bowyer.|$|E

This has been the longest drought I’ve ever been in. … It’s just a hard‑fought race, a hard‑fought battle, a hard‑fought four years.” ...|$|R

2500|$|If {{water is}} poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards {{those that are}} wet. If (two) {{identical}} pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [...] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [...] The experimental proof [...] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The kung [...] note or the shang [...] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [...] the kung or the shang notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous , but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [...] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary {{way in which a}} thing of the same class responds [...] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer , and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [...] When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is[...] [...] It is not only the two [...] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [...] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves ... (As <b>I</b> <b>said)</b> <b>when</b> the note kung is struck forth from a lute, other kung strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [...] They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [...] And wherever there is a mutual reaction [...] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [...] But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, we know. So also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1, tr. Needham 1954: 281-282) ...|$|E
