40|$|We study {{degradation}} {{mechanisms in}} 50 mum gate width/ 0. 45 mum length AlGaN/GaN HEMTs after <b>electrical</b> <b>overstresses.</b> One hundred nanosecond long rectangular current pulses are applied on the drain contact keeping either {{both of the}} source and gate grounded or the source grounded and gate floating. Source-drain pulsed I-V characteristics show similar shape for both connections. After the HEMT undergoes the source-drain breakdown, a negative differential resistance region transits into a low voltage/high current region. Changes in the Schottky contact de I-V characteristics and in the source and drain ohmic contacts are investigated {{as a function of}} the current stress level and are related to the HEMT dc performance. Catastrophic HEMT degradation was observed after I-stress = 1. 65 A in case of the 'gate floating' connection due to ohmic contacts burnout. In case of the 'gate grounded' connection, I-stress = 0. 45 A was sufficient for the gate failure showing a high gate susceptibility to overstress. Backside transient interferometric mapping technique experiment reveals a current filament formation under both HEMT stress connections. Infrared camera observations lead to conclusion that the filament formation together with a consequent high-density electron flow is responsible for a dark spot formation and gradual ohmic contact degradation.

Results on thermal overstress and <b>electrical</b> <b>overstress</b> experiments are presented. In addition, preliminary results toward the development of physics-based degradation models are presented focusing on the electrolyte evaporation failure mechanism. An empirical degradation model based on percentage capacitance loss under <b>electrical</b> <b>overstress</b> is presented and used in: (i) a Bayesian-based implementation of model-based prognostics using a discrete Kalman filter for health state estimation, and (ii) a dynamic system representation of the degradation model for forecasting and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. A leave-one-out validation methodology is used to assess the validity of the methodology under the small sample size constrain. The results observed on the RUL estimation are consistent through the validation tests comparing relative accuracy and prediction error. It has been observed that the inaccuracy of the model to represent the change in degradation behavior observed {{at the end of the}} test data is consistent throughout the validation tests, indicating the need of a more detailed degradation model or the use of an algorithm that could estimate model parameters on-line. Based on the observed degradation process under different stress intensity with rest periods, the need for more sophisticated degradation models is further supported.

40|$|Light Emitting Diode (LED) {{lighting}} systems are being implemented {{as a future}} light source in many sectors. They have advantages such as power efficiency, higher reliability, small in size, faster switching speed, etc. Previous {{research has shown that}} same types of LEDs, from same manufacturer may have significantly different characteristics and behaviour under similar operating condition. These findings indicate the difficulties in assessing and maintaining the LED {{lighting systems}} in the field after their deployment, particularly in the case of safety critical, emergency and harsh environment applications. This paper demonstrates two different prognostics and health management (PHM) approach namely data driven and model driven approach to assess the reliability and predict the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of LED lighting systems in the field. Focus {{of this paper is to}} compare the performance of these two different modelling approaches under thermal and <b>electrical</b> <b>overstress</b> conditions.

40|$|Prognostics is an {{engineering}} discipline {{that focuses on}} estimation of the health state of a component and the prediction of its remaining useful life (RUL) before failure. Health state estimation is based on actual conditions and it is fundamental for the prediction of RUL under anticipated future usage. Failure of electronic devices is of great concern as future aircraft will see an increase of electronics to drive and control safety-critical equipment throughout the aircraft. Therefore, development of prognostics solutions for electronics is of key importance. This paper presents an accelerated aging system for gate-controlled power transistors. This system allows for {{the understanding of the}} effects of failure mechanisms, and the identification of leading indicators of failure which are essential in the development of physics-based degradation models and RUL prediction. In particular, this system isolates <b>electrical</b> <b>overstress</b> from thermal overstress. Also, this system allows for a precise control of internal temperatures, enabling the exploration of intrinsic failure mechanisms not related to the device packaging. By controlling the temperature within safe operation levels of the device, accelerated aging is induced by <b>electrical</b> <b>overstress</b> only, avoiding the generation of thermal cycles. The temperature is controlled by active thermal-electric units. Several electrical and thermal signals are measured in-situ and recorded for further analysis in the identification of leading indicators of failures.
