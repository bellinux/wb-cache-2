40|$|International audienceShort {{wavelength}} <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> (2 - 4 kHz) are {{detected in}} association with the Langmuir waves (~ 15 - 30 kHz) in the source regions of several local type III radio bursts. They are most probably not due to any resonant wave-wave interactions such as the electrostatic decay instability because their wavelengths are much shorter than those of Langmuir waves. The Langmuir waves occur as coherent field structures with peak intensities exceeding the Langmuir collapse thresholds. Their scale sizes are of the order of the wavelength of an ion sound wave. These Langmuir wave field characteristics indicate that the observed short wavelength <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> are most probably generated during the thermalization of the burnt-out cavitons left behind by the Langmuir collapse. Moreover, the peak intensities of the observed short wavelength <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> are comparable to the expected intensities of those <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> radiated by the burnt-out cavitons. However, the speeds of the electron beams derived from the frequency drift of type III radio bursts are too slow to satisfy the needed adiabatic ion approximation. Therefore, some non-linear process such as the induced scattering on thermal ions most probably pumps the beam excited Langmuir waves towards the lower wavenumbers, where the adiabatic ion approximation is justified...|$|E

In this model, Langmuir wave growth is suppressed by refraction in field-aligned density irregularities except near density minima where clumps of Langmuir waves form.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} {{from the}} plasma wave instrument on the Galileo spacecraft {{have shown that}} Langmuir waves observed {{in conjunction with a}} type III solar radio burst contain many beat-type waveforms, with beat frequencies ranging from about 150 to 650 Hz. Strong evidence exists that the beat pattern is produced by two closely spaced narrowband components. The most likely candidates for these two waves are a beam-generated Langmuir wave and an oppositely propagating Langmuir wave produced by parametric decay. In the parametric decay process, nonlinear interactions cause the beam-driven Langmuir wave to decay into a Langmuir wave and a low-frequency <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>wave.</b> Comparisons of the observed beat frequency are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for a three-wave parametric decay process.

40|$|A fluid {{analysis}} is presented of the <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> mode in a weakly ionized collisional plasma. The ion-neutral collision frequency exceeds the ion gyrofrequency while the electrons remain magnetized. Under these conditions, an <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> can propagate at arbitrary angles {{with respect to}} the direction of the magnetic field. In the presence of an electron flow along the magnetic lines the sound mode can grow. Due to the electron collisions the mode is unstable while ion collisions cause an angle dependent instability threshold which is such that the mode is most easily excited at very large angles. Hot ion effects are included in the study by means of an effective viscosity which effectively describes the ion Landau damping effect.

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of laser}} light with plasmas {{is one of}} the key physics issues for the use of high-power lasers for inertial fusion, high-energy-density physics, and scientific stockpile stewardship. The coupling physics is extremely rich and challenging, particularly in the large plasmas to be accessed on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The coupling mechanisms span the gamut from classical inverse bremsstrahlung absorption to a variety of nonlinear optical processes. These include stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) from electron plasma waves, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) from <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves,</b> resonant decay into electron plasma and <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves,</b> and laser beam filamentation. These processes depend on laser intensity and produce effects such as changes in the efficiency and location of the energy deposition or generation of a component of very energetic electrons, which can preheat capsules. Coupling physics issues have an extremely high leverage. The coupling models are clearly very important ingredients for detailed calculations of laser-irradiated target behavior. Improved understanding and models enable a more efficient use of laser facilities, which becomes even more important as these facilities become larger and more expensive. Advances in the understanding also allow a more timely and cost-effective identification of new applications of high-power lasers, such as for generation of high-temperature hohlraums and compact x-ray sources, or for discovery of advanced fusion schemes. Finally, the interaction of intense electromagnetic waves with ionized media is a fundamental topic of interest to numerous areas of applied science and is an excellent test bed for advancing plasma science and computational modeling of complex phenomena.

It is pos-sible {{to prepare the}} modeling of the dusty in volcano like the dust sound waveguides. Dusty is in state of the plasma. Waveguides are formed by the distribution of dusty particles with various masses m = m(x) in trans-verse coordinate. The dust <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> propagate along the longitudinal z-direction. In the case of contact of dusty plasma with a semi-infinite dielectric, there exists the dust acoustic mode that possesses the negative group velocity (backward wave) in the specified interval of wave numbers.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{an account of}} a theoretical study of the nonlinear interaction of three waves in a plasma. Kinetic equations are derived, which describe the interaction for a plasma obeying the fluid equations of magnetohydrodynamics, and for a plasma obeying the Vlasov-Poisson equations. In the magnetohydrodynamic case we find that energy is transferred {{back and forth between}} the three waves in a periodic manner. We study a Vlasov plasma with a diffuse ion beam propagating through it, and find that one wave, a Landau unstable <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> propagating on the beam, behaves as though its energy were negative. The kinetic equations predict that as it transfers energy to two other waves, it grows in amplitude, and that all three waves reach an infinite amplitude in a finite time. This phenomenon is known as an 'explosive instability', and the mechanisms governing the interaction are analysed in order to find stabilisation processes. We show that the unstable oscillations cause a heating of the beam ions, a reduction in beam velocity and a distortion of the beam distribution function, all of which contribute to stabilising the Interaction. We find that the heating Is the dominant process, causing heavy Landau damping of the unstable waves. Two computer programs are described which were used to simulate the beamed plasma configuration in order to test the theory. The results show that heating is the dominant beam effect, and that wave growth saturates as the heating becomes significant. Some of the computational techniques developed during the implementation of the programs are described, and a critical survey is made of the programs themselves...|$|R

In this decay, 'pump' Langmuir waves L, driven by an electron beam, produce backscattered product Langmuir waves L-prime and <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> S. The L and L-prime waves beat at the frequency and wavevector of the S waves, thereby modulating the wave packets. Beam speeds calculated using the modulated Jovian wave packets (1) are reasonable, at 4 - 10 times the electron thermal speed, (2) are consistent with theoretical limits on the decay process, and (3) decrease with increasing foreshock depth, as expected theoretically. These results strongly support the theory. The modulation depth of some wave packets suggests saturation by the decay L yields L-prime + S.

Fundamental emission at 1 AU is found to proceed only when stimulated by the presence of a source of <b>ion</b> <b>sound</b> <b>waves.</b> However, it is argued that electrostatic decay of Langmuir waves can supply the necessary waves provided the driving electron beam is sufficiently fast. Under these conditions, the predicted fundamental field strengths can account for both the highest and typical fields observed; they also dominate the predicted harmonic fields, consistent with observations. This mechanism is also consistent with previous observations that fundamental emission generally occurs early in type III events, when the beam is fastest.
