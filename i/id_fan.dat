50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large Forced Draught (FD) Fans. For {{efficiency}} these fans drew warm air from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This combustion air was passed through the Air Heater which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace and direct some of the air to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large Induced Air (<b>ID)</b> <b>Fans</b> on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the Air Heater where the heat is transferred to the incoming combustion air. The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a draw of combustion air into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney. The exhaust gases could not be allowed to cool below a certain temperature, as there was a risk of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the flue gases condensing and forming acids which could have damaged the <b>ID</b> <b>Fans.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{mechanical}} induced draught. The first is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall draught in the furnace.

The second method is by simply using an induced draught fan (<b>ID</b> <b>fan)</b> which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack.

40|$|Abstract]: Australia’s {{coal fired}} power {{stations}} {{are the most}} efficient form of providing bulk base load power generation (i. e. electricity) to consumers. This is due to Australia having an abundance of thermal coal reserves, which is the fuel used in coal fired power stations. Therefore it is extremely important that these power stations operate at maximum availability and reliability to ensure the consumer receives cost effective and uninterrupted electricity. Callide C Power Station in Biloela Queensland is a 900 Megawatt (MW) coal fired power station that was commissioned in 2001. Unfortunately Callide C Power Station has been plagued with continuous operational and reliability problems caused from the induced draft (ID) fans since initial commissioning. The <b>ID</b> <b>fan</b> problems have arisen from the bearing lubrication system which provides oil recirculation to the induction motor bearings and fan main shaft bearings. Consequently these issues have caused half-load unit (225 MW) run-backs and full unit (450 MW) trips over the past decade. This project’s aim is to analyse the <b>ID</b> <b>fan</b> lubrication system and then identify and define all root causes and their associated failure modes. Once all root causes are identified through Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process, effective design solutions can be researched and evaluated so a proposed modification design project can be finalised. This final design proposal {{will be used to}} justify capital expenditure so implementation can occur in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 45 - 56 Induced draft (<b>ID)</b> <b>fan</b> systems {{often use}} louvers or {{variable}} {{inlet guide vanes}} to control the flow of exhaust through the fans. An <b>ID</b> <b>fan</b> system can be made more efficient by using a variable frequency drive (VFD) to control the fan speed, which controls the air flow without adding restrictions to the flow path. To reduce energy costs, many companies are using more VFDs. This paper discusses how a VFD was the source of high torsional vibration in a motor/ID fan system operating a sufficient margin away from the torsional natural frequencies. This type of system instability is not a classical torsional resonance and would be difficult to predict in the design stage. As a result of the high torsional vibration, several couplings were damaged and a motor shaft experienced a fatigue failure before the problem could be clearly identified and solved. Two different fan systems at the refinery were tested and shown to exhibit similar torsional behavior, although only one of these systems actually failed. Test data showed that the dynamic torque in the couplings was excessive when the original VFD was operated at electrical frequencies above the first torsional natural frequency of the system (21 to 28. 5 Hz depending on the fan and coupling arrangement). Within the normal operating speed range, there was continual reversing torque, which is considered unacceptable for centrifugal equipment. To demonstrate that the VFD was the source of the excitation, the VFD was reconfigured as a soft starter so that it could be bypassed and the fan could ten be operated at constant speed using inlet damper control. When operating across-the-line without the VFD, the dynamic torque was significantly reduced (approximately 10 percent of the motor rated torque). After the test results were reviewed, a new VFD was developed and installed by the manufacturer to prevent the problem from reoccurring within the normal operating speed range. Final measurements are presented that show significant reduction in dynamic torque after the drive modifications were implemented...|$|E

A palm oil mill plant situated in Kulai, Johor {{was chosen as the}} study site. The mill was equipped with a multi-cyclones connected with a recirculation duct from the outlet to the inlet of the unit. Different recirculation airflow rates (0 %, 11 % and 17 % of the total exhaust gas flow rate) were available by the means of external induced draft (<b>ID)</b> <b>fan</b> to extract part of the exhaust gas stream from the multi-cyclones outlet back into its inlet. The flue gas volumetric flow rate and particulate concentration were measured at the boiler outlet (cyclone inlet), stack gas (emitting the cyclone) and recirculation duct using US EPA methods. The average concentration of O 2 measured was 16. 9 % while the average concentration (corrected to 7 % O 2) of CO 2, CO, NO and SO 2 measured was 2. 93 %, 5153 mg/Nm 3, 84. 2 mg/Nm 3 and 339 mg/Nm 3, respectively. Besides, the particulate emission factor based on 27, 000 kg/hr fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processed, 6, 000 kg/hr fibre and shell (F and S) burned, and 8, 000 kg/hr boiler capacity (BC) was 5. 45 ± 2. 18 g/kg, 24. 5 ± 9. 82 g/kg, and 18. 4 ± 7. 36 g/kg, respectively.

40|$|Chinese {{translation}} of the Reduce Air Infiltration in Furnaces fact sheet. Provides {{suggestions on how to}} improve furnace energy efficiency. Fuel-fired furnaces discharge combustion products through a stack or a chimney. Hot furnace gases are less dense and more buoyant than ambient air, so they rise, creating a differential pressure between the top and the bottom of the furnace. This differential, known as thermal head, is the source of a natural draft or negative pressure in furnaces and boilers. A well-designed furnace (or boiler) is built to avoid air leakage into the furnace or leakage of flue gases from the furnace to the ambient. However, with time, most furnaces develop cracks or openings around doors, joints, and hearth seals. These openings (leaks) usually appear small compared with the overall dimensions of the furnace, so they are often ignored. The negative pressure created by the natural draft (or use of an induced-draft fan) in a furnace draws cold air through the openings (leaks) and into the furnace. The cold air becomes heated to the furnace exhaust gas temperature and then exits through the flue system, wasting valuable fuel. It might also cause excessive oxidation of metals or other materials in the furnaces. The heat loss due to cold air leakage resulting from the natural draft can be estimated if you know four major parameters: (1) The furnace or flue gas temperature; (2) The vertical distance H between the opening (leak) and the point where the exhaust gases leave the furnace and its flue system (if the leak is along a vertical surface, H will be an average value); (3) The area of the leak, in square inches; and (4) The amount of operating time the furnace spends at negative pressure. Secondary parameters that affect the amount of air leakage include these: (1) The furnace firing rate; (2) The flue gas velocity through the stack or the stack cross-section area; (3) The burner operating conditions (e. g., excess air, combustion air temperature, and so on). For furnaces or boilers using an induced-draft (<b>ID)</b> <b>fan,</b> the furnace negative pressure depends on the fan performance and frictional losses between the fan inlet and the point of air leakage. In most cases, it would be necessary to measure or estimate negative pressure at the opening. The amount of air leakage, the heat lost in flue gases, and their effects on increased furnace or boiler fuel consumption can be calculated by using the equations and graphs given in Industrial Furnaces (see W. Trinks et al., below). Note that the actual heat input required to compensate for the heat loss in flue gases due to air leakage would be greater than the heat contained in the air leakage because of the effect of available heat in the furnace. For a high-temperature furnace that is not maintained properly, the fuel consumption increase due to air leakage can be as high as 10 % of the fuel input...|$|E
