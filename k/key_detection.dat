40|$|We {{present a}} new dual {{watermarking}} and fingerprinting system, where initially all {{copies of a}} protected object are identically watermarked using a secret <b>key,</b> but individual <b>detection</b> <b>keys</b> are distinct. By knowing a <b>detection</b> <b>key,</b> an adversary cannot recreate the original content from the watermarked content. However, knowledge of any one <b>detection</b> <b>key</b> is sufficient for modifying the object so that a detector using that key would fail to detect the marks. Detectors using other <b>detection</b> <b>keys</b> would not be fooled, and such a modified object necessarily contains enough information about the broken detector key – the fingerprint. Our dual system limits the scope of possible attacks, when compared to classic fingerprinting systems. Under optimal attacks, {{the size of the}} collusion necessary to remove the marks without leaving a detectable fingerprint is superlinear in object size, whereas classic fingerprinting has a lower bound on collusion resistance that is approximately fourth root in object size. By using our scheme one can achieve collusion resistance of up to 900, 000 users for a two hour high-definition video. 1...|$|R
50|$|Traditional DJ {{mixing with}} vinyl {{required}} the DJ sync tracks tempo and the modify each tracks volume and equalisation {{to create a}} smooth blend. DJs can use a mixer's crossfader to switch between tracks or use the volume control for each source with the crossfader permanently positioned in the middle. Mixing is usually done {{through the use of}} headphones and a monitor speaker or foldback as basic aids. At this basic level the DJ is required to develop a specific auditory skill where each track's tempo had to be distinguished while listening to more than one piece of music. The use of compact discs and players such as the CDJ by DJs brought technological advances for the DJ performing a mix including a readout of the bpm and a visual representation of the beat. Modern computer technology has allowed automatic beatmatching and led to debate regarding its use, which is sometimes described as cheating. DJ software such as VirtualDJ provides automatic beatmatching and <b>key</b> <b>detection</b> which simplifies harmonic mixing.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{automatic}} identification of Western classical music styles by directly using chroma histograms as classification features. Thereby, we evaluate {{the benefits of}} knowing a piece's global key for estimating key-related pitch classes. First, we present four automatic <b>key</b> <b>detection</b> systems. We compare their performance on suitable datasets of classical music and optimize the algorithms' free parameters. Using a second dataset, we evaluate automatic classification into the four style periods Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern. To that end, we calculate global chroma statistics of each audio track. We then split up the tracks according to major and minor keys and circularly shift the chroma histograms {{with respect to the}} tonic note. Based on these features, we train two individual classifier models for major and minor keys. We test the efficiency of four chroma extraction algorithms for classification. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of <b>key</b> <b>detection</b> performance on the classification. Additionally, we compare the key-related chroma features to other chroma-based features. We obtain improved performance when using an efficient <b>key</b> <b>detection</b> method for shifting the chroma histograms...|$|E
40|$|Introduction We {{propose a}} public-key {{watermarking}} system [1], where as usual, all the {{copies of a}} protected object are identically marked, but where each user has a distinct secret <b>detection</b> <b>key.</b> All such <b>detection</b> <b>keys</b> are di#erent from the secret embedding key. Even by gaining the knowledge of a relatively large number of <b>detection</b> <b>keys,</b> an adversary cannot remove the secret marks from the protected content. We show that an attacker who has access to one <b>detection</b> <b>key</b> can always fool the corresponding WM detector, but not other WM detectors. Also, in that process, the attacker necessarily inserts a FP in the modified content. Our WM/FP system significantly improves upon the best known asymptotic resistance to collusion attacks to O(N log N) from O(N 1 / 4) [2]. II. System Description Marking.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} the detector design in generalized space shift keying (GSSK) modulation for large MIMO systems. An orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based detector design is adopted {{due to its}} low complexity compared with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector. To improve {{the performance of the}} OMP algorithm, our first design is to propose an equalizer at the receiver in order to orthogonalize the equivalent channel matrix; our second design is to propose an equalizer whose columns pursue orthonormality to the columns of the channel matrix. We obtain closed-form expressions of the equalizers under the two design objectives. Simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority compared with the standard OMP algorithm.

In comparison with no pre-training and pre-training with asymmetric patterns, pre-training networks with sets of single vertical, horizontal, positive-oblique or negative-oblique bars speeded subsequent learning of symmetrical patterns.
