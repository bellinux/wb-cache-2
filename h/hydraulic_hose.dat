60|$|He had tasted toil, {{and what}} toil really is only those know who have borne {{it in the}} steamy heat of the tropics, which saps the white man's vigour; while he had {{discovered}} what, artist as he was, he had not learned before: that, by way of compensation, man may attain a certain elusive spirituality by the stern subjugation of his body, {{even when it is}} accomplished by brutal manual labour. As the Estremedura's sobrecargo he had watched the struggle for existence between man and man with good-humoured toleration of its petty wiles and trickeries, but now it was the cleaner and more primitive struggle between man and matter he was called upon to take his part in with the faith in the destiny of his species which is capable of moving mountains, and not infrequently does so with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> and blasting charges, as well as a few odd thousand tons of iron and water in a stranded steamer. Lying still a while, he heard the great pump hurling out its announcement of man's domination to swamp and forest, and then went peacefully to sleep.|$|E

5000|$|Cut-off factor (AKA [...] "Cut-off Length") is {{a factor}} used to {{calculate}} the length of a hose cut to achieve the desired overall length of hose plus fittings.

50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic systems rely on high {{pressures}} (usually over 7000 kPa) to work properly. If {{a hydraulic}} system loses fluid pressure, (burst <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose)</b> {{it will become}} inoperative and components such as actuators may collapse. This is an undesirable condition in life-critical systems such as aircraft or heavy machinery, such as forklifts. Hydraulic fuses help guard against catastrophic failure of a hydraulic system (for instance, by line breakage or component failure) by automatically isolating the defective branch.|$|E
25|$|The spring {{release device}} {{was used in}} the past almost universally on {{trailing}} type plows with one to three or four bottoms. It is not practical on larger plows. When an obstruction is encountered the spring release mechanism in the hitch permits the plow to uncouple from the tractor. When a hydraulic lift is used on the plow, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> will also usually uncouple automatically when the plow uncouples.|$|R

40|$|Hoses can be {{components}} of fluid power control systems. To determine the dynamic behaviour of such systems {{you need to}} know the dynamic properties of the components included. This investigation aims to develop a method to determine these properties of hoses. Nitrile-black-carbon is used in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses.</b> A literature study gives that rubber is a very complex material. It is viscoelastic with a lot of non-linearities so it is not self-evident how to model the hose. Four different models are studied. One of them gives an idea of the static relation between the rubber tube and the reinforcing. Two of them take the dynamic properties of rubber into account. The fourth model is a second order black box model. Laboratory tests have been done. The relationship between pressure changes and volume changes in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> at different frequencies is measured. Two seated valves were used, one for increasing and one for decreasing the pressure in the hose. The volume of oil coming out from the hose was measured with a cylinder. Three different hoses are tested. The test results agree rather well with one of the dynamic rubber models and with the black box model, useful for control system analysis. QC 20150917 </p...|$|R

50|$|Butler scored {{an early}} Silver Crown win at the Hulman 100 (Indianapolis). This race was Steve's final USAC victory and {{included}} a special twist: Butler {{was forced to}} perform in-cockpit diagnosis and repair of a problem that was causing the engine to misfire. At mid-race, the rough-running engine was causing Butler to fade back into the pack and was threatening his ability to even finish. However, during a caution period, Butler was {{able to identify the}} problem as a faulty ignition switch. He then disconnected the switch and secured the bare wire by tying it off around a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose,</b> thereby preventing the exposed strands from shorting out. All this was accomplished on the race track, while driving with one hand and repairing with the other. With full power restored, Butler charged into the lead and defeated Ron Shuman by 10 seconds at the checkered flag.|$|E
50|$|The tool uses air {{to pound}} {{its way through}} the ground {{underneath}} the obstruction. The tools is cylindrical in shape and ranges from one to eight inches in diameter and between three and six feet long. It is made from metal. Different manufacturers have different front styles and control mechanisms. Some have bullet shaped front and others have a stepped front similar to a unibit. Compressed air is used to power the tool, this air is run through a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hose</b> with an oiler attachment to send oil through with the compressed air. The tool works in a way very similar to a jack hammer, inside the cylinder is a piston a valve opens and the air blows into the chamber forcing the piston forward which in turn propels the tool forward. The valve then shuts and the piston is pushed at a slower speed back in the tool, the valve reopens the piston pounds again and the tools moves forward. This process is continually repeated until the bore has run the intended distance. Both the lighter reverse hit of the piston and the friction of the ground surrounding the tool keep it moving forward instead of stopping. The speed of the tool can be controlled by a valve that connects the tools hose to the air supply this valve is outside the tool and remains accessible to the operator. As the tool pounds through the ground it compresses the soil. This compaction maintains the same diameter as the tool and leaves the bore hole through which the product is passed.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{systems have}} an {{advantage}} in fuel efficiency {{because there is no}} belt-driven hydraulic pump constantly running, whether assistance is required or not, and this is a major reason for their introduction. Another major advantage is the elimination of a belt-driven engine accessory, and several high-pressure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hoses</b> between the <b>hydraulic</b> pump, mounted on the engine, and the steering gear, mounted on the chassis. This greatly simplifies manufacturing and maintenance. By incorporating electronic stability control electric power steering systems can instantly vary torque assist levels to aid the driver in corrective maneuvers.|$|R
