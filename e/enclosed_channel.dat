50|$|The male {{members of}} the group Squamata have hemipenes, which are usually held {{inverted}} within their bodies, and are everted for reproduction via erectile tissue like that in the human penis. Only one is used at a time, and some evidence indicates that males alternate use between copulations. The hemipenis has a variety of shapes, depending on the species. Often it bears spines or hooks, to anchor the male within the female. Some species even have forked hemipenes (each hemipenis has two tips). Due to being everted and inverted, hemipenes do not have a completely <b>enclosed</b> <b>channel</b> for the conduction of sperm, but rather a seminal groove that seals as the erectile tissue expands. This is also the only reptile group in which both viviparous and ovoviviparous species are found, as well as the usual oviparous reptiles.

The experimental {{results show that the}} maximum smoke temperature decreases with an increasing flame inclination angle when fire source is moving away from the channel center in Region I (within the dimensionless distance for 0. 64), which is caused by the gas velocity difference of the two sides of flame. However, when the dimensionless distance is > 0. 64, the maximum smoke temperature was observed to rise. In addition, an existing model was improved to predict the maximum smoke temperature in <b>enclosed</b> <b>channel</b> applying it to different boundary conditions. Its predictions fit reasonably well when the fire source located at Region I. Beyond that, the predictions are lower than the experiments, which is probably because of the absent consideration of bouncing process of the hot smoke from end walls. Therefore, an extra correction coefficient was proposed to the improved model in Region II with a consideration of bouncing process of the hot smoke from both end walls. As a result, {{it was found that the}} experimental results can be well predicted by this model in Region II...|$|E
50|$|The Nubian {{sandstone}} complex has a thickness varying {{from under}} 500 m to over 3000 m, {{resting on the}} Precambrian basement. This is complicated by various structural faults and fold axes traversing the region in a north-eastern direction. Maximum development occurs in the Ain Dalla basin, a downthrown structural block south-west of the Bahariya oasis. Basement features present a dominant control on the complex's structural and sedimentological form. Despite many structural complications, Nubian sandstone likely constitutes a single hydrogeological system west of the Suez Gulf. To the east, on the Sinai peninsula, a second system might exist with some connection to the primary western system in the north. The main western system, extending into Libya and Sudan, consists of a multi-layered artesian basin where massive groundwater reserves accumulated, principally during pluvials of the Quaternary. Locally, carbonate rocks overlying the complex display karst features and are recharged by upwards leaks from the underlying major aquifer. Fluvial and structural interpretations from 2007 show the desert in western Egypt was induced by fluvial action, including recently mapped alluvial fans. In central areas, braided channels are spatially aligned to a north-east structural trend, suggesting preferential water flow paths. Alluvial fans and structurally <b>enclosed</b> <b>channels</b> coincided to gentle slopes and optimal recharge conditions between 1 and 5%, indicating high groundwater potential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interpretations correlated with anomalies from groundwater in 383 wells, suggesting {{a connection between the}} spatial organization of fluvial and structural features with low-salinity groundwater, which exists adjacent to alluvial fans and the south-west reaches of structurally <b>enclosed</b> <b>channels.</b> Wells in the vicinity of structures contained low-salinity water.|$|R

The application of the linear regression as a predicting equation has increased the data of complete stratigraphic sections approxi-mately twofold. The results of the linear regression analyses indicate that along the fluvio-lacustrlne and bracklsh-marine facies areas, the stratigraphic nterval thickness i controlled by the thickness of the <b>enclosed</b> <b>channel</b> sandstone.

The analysis further indicates that the stratigraphic interval shows progressive thickening toward the brackish-marine facies area and thinning toward the fluvlo-lacustrine facies area. The analysis has established that the linear regression relationship between the stratlgraphlc interval and channel sandstone thickness does not significantly vary within and between the fluvio-lacustrine and brackish-marine facies areas. Thus, a Common Regresslou equation of the entire stratigraphical data along the outcrop belt was devised and used as the predicting equation.

Since all of the components are made by conventional photolithographic techniques, they can be assembled into more complex integrated systems. The combination of pump and components into self-contained miniaturized devices may provide significant improvements in DNA analysis speed, portability, and cost.

40|$|An optical {{oxygen sensor}} {{system based on}} the process of {{fluorescence}} quenching is reported. The device detects the fluorescence quenching of a ruthenium complex [Ru(dip- phen) 3 (ClO) 4] also known as RUDPP by sensing minute variations of a fluorescent membrane emission intensity. A dual channel design consisting of a reference branch and a sensing branch is used. Both branches include modulated light from a bright blue LED acting as the excitation source coupled through an <b>enclosed</b> <b>channel</b> to a photo-diode. The sensing branch has the RUDPP fluorescence quenching membrane sandwiched between the blue LED and the photo-diode, while the reference branch is void of such membrane. To avoid membrane saturation in the sensing branch, the excitation source is modulated with a 350 Hz square wave. The output signals of the two channels are amplified separately and subtracted from each other using a difference amplifier. Adjusting the difference amplifier output to zero effectively ensures excitation source interference cancellation. The photodiode in the sensing branch detects the intensity variations as a function of fluorescent quenching by oxygen. It was possible to isolate the fluorescent signal completely, based solely on electronic components, without the use of optical filters. The output signal from the difference amplifier is further amplified (with an adjustable gain for calibration) and displayed. Sensor performance was tested and it exhibited both excellent sensitivity and response time, compared to the recent oxygen sensors reported by others. A decrease of less than 4 percent oxygen concentration was readily detectable.

Monogamy, as participants construct it, is critiqued as an action and policy that produces an exclusive and contained essence of relationships and that guards against a perceived chaotic excess that is set up in opposition to it.

Methods with high selectivity, wide dynamic range, and excellent precision, capable of simultaneously analyzing many biomolecules are required to decipher cellular function. This thesis describes a molecular and microfluidic toolbox designed with those criteria in mind. It also presents a tool for graphical representation of nucleic acid sequences. Proximity ligation is a novel protein detection method that requires dual and proximate binding of two oligonucleotide-tagged affinity reagents to a protein or protein complex in order to elicit a signal. The responses from such recognition reactions are the formation of specific nucleic acid reporter molecules that are subsequently amplified and quantitatively detected. A scalable microfluidic platform suitable for fluorescence detection, cell culture, and actuation is also described.

40|$|Sensor and {{instrumentation}} networks operating inside aircraft wings, unmanned air vehicle (UAV) fuselage, small submarine craft and/or automobile engine compartments {{could be}} significantly enhanced or enabled by implementing radio communications within these spaces. A wired infrastructure can be cumbersome and expensive {{to install and}} maintain inside challenging environments such as aircraft and submarines. Furthermore, wire bundles and assemblies can be heavy, and flight vehicle environments are particularly sensitive to mass distribution. Wireless sensor and instrumentation networks would offer an alternative to their wired counterparts, and could alleviate many of the aforementioned concerns associated with wired assemblies. Furthermore, wireless sensor networks could be quickly deployed in these environments, enabling rapidprototype instrumentation and sensor systems. The nodes of this network are envisioned to be quite small such that the environments they are measuring are not appreciably affected {{by the presence of}} the nodes themselves. Perhaps the size of a dime, these sensor nodes would nominally contain all of the sensors, processors, antennas, communications subsystems and energy storage elements necessary to perform the required instrumentation operations in these proposed environments. However, the interior enclosures of aircraft wings, UAV fuselage and small submarines are highly reverberant to propagating electromagnetic waves due to the metallic walls surrounding the space, and energy that is transmitted within the enclosure by a radio device can be expected to remain in the space for long durations in time. This lingering of energy can cause the communications channel dispersion in the enclosure to be considerable, potentially limiting and/or degrading communications. The work described in this dissertation studies the wireless RF communications channel native to these enclosures to better understand the unique characteristics of this channel, referred to as the <b>enclosed</b> space radio <b>channel.</b> For the purposes of this research, the enclosures considered are generally described as being 1) several meters or less per dimension, 2) enclosed by metallic boundaries on many or all sides, and 3) filled with non-uniform objects and/or obstructions. Measurements of the channel dispersion in two representative enclosures are made between 200 MHz and 20. 0 GHz, utilizing the metrics of RMS delay spread, mean excess delay, and the 50 % and 90 % coherence bandwidth. A model for the channel dispersion is formed based on simple descriptions of the enclosure, and it is shown that this model matches the measured data well. A model for the gain of the <b>enclosed</b> space <b>channel</b> is developed and presented, and this model also demonstrates a good match to the gain measured in the channel. The dynamic range of the <b>enclosed</b> space <b>channel</b> gain is measured and modeled, and both theory and the measurements show that the dynamic range is bounded in a high-frequency limit. Both the dispersion model and gain model utilize the enclosure quality factor as a critical parameter, and through the quality factor an important tradeoff between gain and dispersion is seen. Measurements of the enclosures used in this work show average RMS delay spreads of 100 - 300 ns and 50 % coherence bandwidths of 1 - 5 MHz, indicating that the dispersion in these enclosures is less than the dispersion seen in the outdoor mobile communications channel, but greater than the dispersion seen in the indoor wireless communications channel. Measurements of the gain in these enclosures show average values between - 10 and - 30 dB—considerably larger than the gain typically seen in the indoor or outdoor channels. Single-carrier communications experiments using real signals of several different modulation formats are made between 3. 0 and 18. 0 GHz, and the results show that data rates up to 5 Mbps are readily obtainable. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multicarrier modulation scheme is evaluated in the <b>enclosed</b> space <b>channel,</b> and results suggest that data rates up to 54 Mbps are possible using the IEEE 802. 11 a communications standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a reference test case with repeatable and accurate results {{is of paramount importance}} for the validation of numerical Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) models and simulations. In this study, a new experimental facility was designed and constructed for the investigation of FSI between fully developed laminar flow and test section plate in an <b>enclosed</b> flow <b>channel.</b> Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software was used to model laminar flow in a shallow rectangular duct to determine proper dimensions of the experimental apparatus. The FSI problem was then modeled in CFD using the predetermined dimensions. The experimental set up included construction of the duct, creation of a closed flow circuit and its instrumentation. The metal test plate was fitted with gages to gather real-time information on the strain levels during the experiment. Subsequently, the experiment was performed and the results were compared with the FSI modeling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen numerically {{simulating}} a {{kinetic model}} of $n^+nn^+$ semiconductor device, obtaining a constant macroscopic current at steady-state {{is still a}} challenging task. Part of the difficulty comes from the multiscale, discontinuous nature of both $p|n$ junctions which create spikes of electric field and <b>enclose</b> a <b>channel</b> where corresponding depletion layers glue together. The kinetic formalism furnishes a model holding inside the whole domain, but {{at the price of}} strongly-varying parameters. By concentrating both the electric acceleration and the linear collision terms at each interface of a Cartesian computational grid, we can treat them by means of a Godunov scheme involving 2 types of scattering matrices. Combining both these mechanisms into a global S-matrix can be achieved thanks to ''Redheffer's star-product''. Assuming that the resulting S-matrix is stochastic permits to prove maximum principles under a mild CFL restriction. Numerical illustrations of collisional Landau damping and various $n^+nn^+$ devices are provided on coarse grids...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{patterning}} {{has been}} widely used in research on fundamental cell biology and in applications such as tissue engineering, neuron network formation, cell based biosensor and drug screening. Although various methods have been developed, cell patterning in an enclosed microfluidic device at single cell level remains challenging. This paper describes a microfluidic device with microwells and protein patterns paired together in a single microchannel for an easy cell patterning. Cells captured in the microwells were positioned directly onto the protein patterns within 5 min and the patterning performance was successfully demonstrated using HeLa cells and human gallbladder carcinoma cells (SGC- 996). Cells survived for 6 days in the microchannel. Cell attachment, migration, proliferation and cell colony formation were observed. Our device is free of topographic constraint for the patterned cells and no complex chemical modification to the substrate is needed, offering a simple, fast, and easy-to-operate way of patterning cells at single cell level in an <b>enclosed</b> microfluidic <b>channel...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} changes of ordered hexagonal arrays of iodine nanostructures <b>enclosed</b> inside one-dimensional <b>channels</b> of aluminophosphate zeolites are studied. These isolated nanochains undergo structural transformations between linked chains and separated molecules, {{as shown by}} tracing the temperature variations of their distinctive Raman features when these nanostructures are heated thermally to the transition temperature of similar to 70 degrees C. The reversibility of this transition is improved by replacing the conventional thermal heating with localized heating using a focused laser beam, which reduced the diffusion along the channels. In addition, the optically identified transition is consistently confirmed by thermal characterization using differential scanning calorimetric and thermal gravimetric analyses...|$|R
