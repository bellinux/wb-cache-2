40|$|Purpose – This paper {{addresses}} horizontal {{supply chain}} collaboration among autonomous freight carriers in the less-than-truckload industry. The {{main purpose of}} the paper is to identify and explain the challenges with <b>joint</b> <b>operational</b> decision-making in this context and investigate the precise role of information technology (IT) therein. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical evidence is gathered by means of exploratory and explanatory case research, with multiple cases at the planning departments of European freight carriers operating in collaborative transportation networks. Findings – Collaborating carriers face fundamental challenges in <b>joint</b> <b>operational</b> planning and control of collaborative transportation, despite the broad availability of state-of-the-art IT. These operational supply chain challenges {{can be explained by}} technological differences of the available IT applications, which hinder integration. Research limitations/implications – Any expectations with regard to state-of-the-art XML or EDI-based IT integration for improved <b>joint</b> <b>operational</b> decision-making in collaborative transportation networks should be considered with care. In particular, the authors' research findings may encourage practitioners to consider new planning and control procedures and develop dedicated IT applications for collaborating freight carriers. Originality/value – The paper highlights the importance of horizontal supply chain collaboration for small and medium-sized freight carriers in the less-than-truckload industry and conceptualises how collaborative transportation networks are organised. Furthermore, an IT typology is introduced to explain the challenges with <b>joint</b> <b>operational</b> decision-making...|$|R
