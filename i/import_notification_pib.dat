40|$|Since the {{creation}} of the GATT and the WTO, one of the main goals has been to decrease trade barriers and increase openness in trade. However, there has been concern that as importing countries honor WTO commitments and lower tariff rates, they may be replacing traditional tariff barriers with non-tariff barriers. Recent literature has found that the implementation of food safety standards, specifically the use of <b>import</b> <b>notifications</b> and rejections, has acted as a significant barrier to trade in both the EU and the US. This thesis empirically examines the relation between declining tariff rates and a count of EU seafood <b>import</b> <b>notifications</b> as a measure of non-tariff barriers. Possible motives for the use of <b>import</b> <b>notifications</b> are divided into two categories: risk and protectionism. The results provide evidence showing not only a negative relation between tariff and non-tariff barriers, but possible illegitimate use of <b>import</b> <b>notifications</b> by <b>importing</b> countries with a high need for protection...|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaria is a {{notifiable}} {{disease in}} the Netherlands, a non-endemic country. Imported malaria infections occur regularly among travellers, migrants and visitors. Surveillance data were analysed from 2008 to 2015. Trends in amounts of notifications among risk groups were analysed using Poisson regression. For asylum seekers, yearly incidence was calculated per region of origin, using national asylum request statistics as denominator data. For tourists, denominator data were used from travel statistics to estimate incidence per travel region up to 2012. Results: A modest increase in overall <b>imported</b> malaria <b>notifications</b> occurred in 2008 - 2015 (from 222 in 2008 to 344 in 2015). Notably, in 2014 and 2015 sharp increases were seen in malaria among travellers {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFR), and in asylum seekers. Of all Plasmodium falciparum infections, most (1254 / 1337; 93. 8 %) were imported from Africa; 1037 / 1337 (77. 6 %) were imported from Central and West Africa. Malaria in VFR was mostly caused by P. falciparum infection after visiting Ghana (22 %) or Nigeria (19 %). Malaria in asylum seekers was mostly caused by Plasmodium vivax infection from the Horn of Africa. The large number of notifications in asylum seekers resulted from both an increase in number of asylum seekers and a striking increase of malaria incidence in this group. Incidence of malaria in asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa ranged between 0. 02 and 0. 3 % in 2008 - 2013, but rose to 1. 6 % in 2014 and 1. 3 % in 2015. In 2008 - 2012, incidence in tourists visiting Central and West Africa dropped markedly. Conclusions: Imported malaria is on the rise again in the Netherlands, most notably since 2013. This is mostly due to immigration of asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa. The predominance of P. vivax infection among asylum seekers warrants vigilance in health workers when a migrant presents with fever, as relapses of this type of malaria can occur long after arrival in the Netherland...|$|R
