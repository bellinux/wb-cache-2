40|$|Research question/purpose – Instagram {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} popular tool for sport organisations to share visual content. This study aims to examine how professional team sport organisations use Instagram for branding purposes and to explore the given meaning of Instagram followers’ reactions to the organisations’ Instagram activity. Research methods – The {{study was conducted in}} two phases. First, we analysed 2017 Instagram photos of two football teams from the English Premier League. Photos were categorised on product- and non-product-related brand attributes. Employing a quantitative content analysis technique, statistical analysis involved intra-case and inter-case relationships between brand attributes and Instagram’s key fan <b>engagement</b> <b>features</b> (Comment and Like). Second, we analysed 2100 Instagram comments from a qualitative perspective in order to gain further insight into the fans’ meanings associated with such posts. Results and findings – The findings offer significant insights to sport marketers in their efforts to increase fan engagement through social media. For both of the examined football teams, product-related attributes were used significantly more often than non-product-related attributes and encouraged greater engagement from online followers. Against these brand attributes, fans’ interaction through one of the Instagram’s key <b>engagement</b> <b>features</b> is expressed through ‘aspiring’-, ‘belonging’-, ‘criticising’- and ‘loving’-based comments. Implications – The study shows that Instagram facilitates co-branding, while giving fans {{a more active role in}} the branding process through comments. We recommend a culture change whereby teams become more market-focused and communications-driven by employing a greater understanding of the semiotics of images and fan comments through the use of social media.

The 'Metrics Feedback Cycle' (MFC) is introduced as a formal process prescribing the iterative evaluation and improvement of application-wide engagement, using data collected from metrics as input to improve related <b>engagement</b> <b>features.</b> This framework was showcased using a gamified eLearning application as a case study. In this paper, we designed a prototype and tested it with thirty-six (N= 36) students to validate the effectiveness of the MFC. The analysis and interpretation of metrics data shows that the gamification features had a positive effect on user engagement, and helped identify areas in which this could be improved. We conclude that the MFC has applications in gamified systems that seek to maximise engagement by iteratively evaluating implemented features against a set of evolving metrics. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Alcohol {{advertising}} {{has recently}} expanded onto {{social networking sites}} (SNSs), which allows users to interact with alcohol ads through user <b>engagement</b> <b>features</b> (e. g.

Methods: In Study 1, alcohol advertising posted on Facebook by Budweiser and Bud Light were evaluated for compliance with a self-regulated alcohol advertising code and for thematic content. User-generated comments written {{in response to these}} ads were also evaluated. The results of this study were used to inform Study 2, a 2 (within) x 2 (between) x 2 (between) factorial randomized trial. Participants (n= 120) viewed four pre-selected Facebook ads, of which two were compliant and two were non-compliant with a self-regulated alcohol advertising code. Participants also viewed real-world high or low user engagement values and real-world pro- or anti-drinking user-generated comments.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{explores the}} internet’s {{role in the}} Finnish 2004 European election. The first aim is to explore how {{different}} actors employed the web during the campaign. The second aim is to analyze {{the impact of the}} actors ’ web strategies on voters. Two circumstances make Finland interesting. First, the basic prerequisite for web campaigning is fulfilled since the northern countries, including Finland, are the most ‘wired ’ area in Europe. Second, the electoral system is based on voters ’ direct choice of candidates, which encourages candidate-driven campaigning. The findings show that the main actors of Finnish campaigns, candidates and parties, dominated the on-line environment. Major party candidates, especially, campaigned on-line. Overall, the websites of all actors provided few information and <b>engagement</b> <b>features.</b> However, major party candidates made better use of the web than other candidates. Additionally, the news media’s ‘candidate selectors ’ made good use of web-specific features, and attracted relatively large voter interest. Concerning voter impact, few voters visited election-related websites. Moreover, few indicated that they obtained very/quite much information to support their voting decision from the web. Interestingly, young voters were an important exception...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Smartphone-based smoking {{cessation}} interventions are increasingly used around the world. However, {{the effects of}} smartphone applications on applicability and efficacy on cessation rate and prevention of relapses are not often evaluated. Therefore, this review aims to assess the evidence on effectiveness of smartphone applications as an intervention tool for {{smoking cessation}} support. Material and Methods We conducted the search using Ovid Medline/PubMed, CENTRAL and Scopus databases dated (January 2007 - June 2016). Inclusion criteria include randomized control trials or intervention studies with mobile applications that offer smoking cessation support. Two assessors independently extracted and evaluated the data from each included study Results The review of eight selected studies illustrate the use of smartphone applications in increasing quit rates among smokers, however adherence to app features influences quit rates. Audiovisual features followed by a quit plan, tracking progress and sharing features are most accepted and utilised app features. However, inconsistency was observed in their association with abstinence or quit rate. App <b>engagement</b> <b>features</b> increase the statistical significance in the quit rate. Development of smartphone applications was supported by behaviour change theories in all studies nevertheless; heterogeneous forms of intervention were adopted within studies. Similarly, reduction in relapse attributed to enhanced discussion among quitters using social media applications was observed. Conclusions Quality evidence is warranted with large sample size to measure effect size of the intervention. Future research on effectiveness and efficacy of smartphone alone and comparisons with other mHealth interventions, such as text messaging would be useful...|$|E

40|$|Background: Driving {{after the}} {{consumption}} of alcohol represents a significant problem globally. Individual prevention countermeasures such as personalized mobile apps aimed at preventing such behavior are widespread, {{but there is little}} research on their accuracy and evidence base. There has been no known assessment investigating the quality of such apps. Objective: This study aimed to determine the quality and accuracy of apps for drink driving prevention by conducting a review and evaluation of relevant mobile apps. Methods: A systematic app search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. App quality was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Apps providing blood alcohol calculators (hereafter “calculators”) were reviewed against current alcohol advice for accuracy. Results: A total of 58 apps (30 iOS and 28 Android) met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Drink driving prevention apps had significantly lower engagement and overall quality scores than alcohol management apps. Most calculators provided conservative blood alcohol content (BAC) time until sober calculations. None of the apps had been evaluated to determine their efficacy in changing either drinking or driving behaviors. Conclusions: This novel study demonstrates that most drink driving prevention apps are not engaging and lack accuracy. They could be improved by increasing <b>engagement</b> <b>features,</b> such as gamification. Further research should examine the context and motivations for using apps to prevent driving after drinking in at-risk populations. Development of drink driving prevention apps should incorporate evidence-based information and guidance, lacking in current apps...|$|E

Civic engagement and community service should be inextricable from research, teaching and learning. The Talloires Network is an international coalition of higher education institutions founded on such a vision. It is because of this vision that the MacJannet Foundation approached the Talloires Network in 2009 to establish the MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship. Following in the footsteps of founders Donald and Charlotte MacJannet, the international Foundation is dedicated to providing pathways for individuals and institutions to use their skills for the good of their communities.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsSmartphone {{applications}} (apps) offer {{a potentially}} cost-effective and a wide-reach aid to smoking cessation. In 2012, a {{content analysis of}} smoking cessation apps suggested that most apps did not adopt behaviour change techniques (BCTs), which according to previous research had suggested would promote higher success rates in quitting smoking. This study examined whether or not, this situation had changed by 2014 for free smoking cessation apps available in the Apple App Store. It also compared the use of engagement and ease-of-use features between the two time points. Methods 137 free apps available in the Apple App Sore in 2014 were coded using an established framework for {{the presence or absence}} of evidence-based BCTs, and engagement and ease-of-use features. The results from the 2014 data were compared with a similar exercise conducted on 83 free apps available in 2012. ResultsBCTs supporting identity change, rewarding abstinence and advising on changing routines were less prevalent in 2014 as compared with 2012 (14. 6 % vs. 42. 2 %, 18. 2 % vs. 48. 2 %, and 17. 5 % vs. 24. 1 %, respectively). Advice on coping with cravings and advice on the use of stop-smoking medication were more prevalent in 2014 as compared with 2012 (27. 7 % vs. 20. 5 % and 14. 6 % vs 3. 6 %, respectively). The use of recognised <b>engagement</b> <b>features</b> was less common in 2014 than in 2012 (45. 3 % vs. 69. 6 %) while ease-of-use features remained very high (94. 5 % vs. 82. 6 %).
