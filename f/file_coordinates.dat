40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{similarity}} of the AMBER force field’s energy functional form {{with that of}} the CHARMM force field, gives the potential for direct translation of common bonding and nonbonding terms, along with their parameters, present in CHARMM topology and parameter files, with the intent of evaluation within the AMBER software; specifically the SANDER and PMEMD dynamics engines. To this extent, we have created a tool, CHAMBER, which can take a CHARMM protein structure <b>file</b> (PSF), <b>coordinate</b> <b>file</b> (COR) and associated forcefield files, and convert these to an AMBER topology file (prmtop) and associated <b>coordinate</b> <b>file</b> (inpcrd). CHAMBER opens a conversion route which enables the simulation of CHARMM parameterized models using AMBER’s PMEMD engine; thus providing improved serial efficiency as well as parallel efficiency over large numbers of CPUs. Significant effort has been expended in ensuring a true representation of the CHARMM force field in AMBER providing energies and forces that are the same to the limits of machine precision.

40|$|BitTorrent (BT) is {{currently}} the most popular file-sharing peer-to-peer (P 2 P) clients [1]. Several reports have shown that it accounts {{for the majority of}} peer-to-peer traffic, up to one third of the global Internet traffic. However, leaving the media attention aside for one moment, we ask the question: Why does BT work so well? BT attempts to build robustness to freeloading (i. e. downloading without uploading) by implementing a tit-for-tatlike strategy (TFT) within its protocol. It is often believed that this strategy alone is responsible for the high levels of cooperation found. The TFT strategy was championed in Axelrod’s book “the evolution of cooperation ” [2]. BT works by groups of peers (called swarms) with an interest in downloading a specific <b>file</b> <b>coordinating</b> and cooperating to speed-up the process [3]. Each peer in the swarm stores pieces of the file. Cooperating peers download and upload required pieces. If a peer stops uploading it will tend to be “choked ” by other peers, meaning they stop uploading to it. This implements the TFT-like process. So-called “seeder ” peers store the whole file: if a swarm contains no seeders, it may lead to a situation in which pieces of the file are missing from the swarm as a whole. Since seeders have nothing left to gain, the system requires some altruistic behavior from peers. We argue that the TFT strategy is not an adequate explanation of the high levels of cooperation found within BT because: (i) the TFT strategy can be bettered by other less cooperative strategies; (ii) identity can be faked by modifying the client thus circumventing TFT; (iii) unconditional altruism is required for BT to operate in any case. Given that suc...|$|R
