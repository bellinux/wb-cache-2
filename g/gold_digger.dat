After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the 552nd AEWCW also had administrative control of the 966th AEWCS, based at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida.

500|$|The ninth track from Unorthodox Jukebox, [...] "Money Makes Her Smile", is {{the result}} of a trip to a strip club done by Mars and Diplo, who {{afterwards}} decided to create an [...] "anthem" [...] for it, since Mars' debut solo single was an awful song to be played in such place, according to him. The recording was described as a [...] "strip-club-directed banger", infused with disco elements. Its composition includes [...] "rapid-fire chants, breathless percussion, propulsive electronic blips" [...] along with [...] "rave sirens and hardcore punk rattle". Lyrically, the song describes a <b>gold</b> <b>digger</b> who can only be satisfied by [...] "fat stacks of money". The album's final song of the standard edition, [...] "If I Knew", is a Sam Cooke-inspired ballad which incorporates soul and doo-wop nuances. It lyrically delves on themes of regret. [...] "Old & Crazy", a duet between Mars and Esperanza Spalding, was included on the deluxe version of Unorthodox Jukebox. Jeff Bhasker, one of the track's producers, confessed that the song is reminiscent of the sound of a 1920s Paris club. He went on explaining that its process began with Emile Haynie producing a beat and Bhasker adding a sample of a Django Reinhardt recording over it.|$|E

2500|$|By {{contrast}} {{there was}} also a smaller but influential stream of anti-New Deal art. [...] Gutzon Borglum's sculptures on Mount Rushmore emphasized great men in history (his designs had the approval of Calvin Coolidge). [...] Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway disliked the New Deal and celebrated the autonomy of perfected written work as opposed to the New Deal idea of writing as performative labor. The Southern Agrarians celebrated a premodern regionalism and opposed the TVA as a modernizing, disruptive force. Cass Gilbert, a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order, designed the new Supreme Court building (1935). Its classical lines and small size contrasted sharply with the gargantuan modernistic federal buildings going up in the Washington Mall that he detested. Hollywood managed to synthesize liberal and conservative streams, as in Busby Berkeley's <b>Gold</b> <b>Digger</b> musicals, where the storylines exalt individual autonomy while the spectacular musical numbers show abstract populations of interchangeable dancers securely contained within patterns beyond their control.|$|E
