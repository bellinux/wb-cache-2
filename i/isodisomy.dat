50|$|Uniparental disomy (UPD) {{occurs when}} a person {{receives}} two copies of a chromosome, or of part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copy from the other parent. UPD can {{be the result of}} heterodisomy, in which a pair of non-identical chromosomes are inherited from one parent (an earlier stage meiosis I error) or <b>isodisomy,</b> in which a single chromosome from one parent is duplicated (a later stage meiosis II error). Uniparental disomy may have clinical relevance for several reasons. For example, either <b>isodisomy</b> or heterodisomy can disrupt parent-specific genomic imprinting, resulting in imprinting disorders. Additionally, <b>isodisomy</b> leads to large blocks of homozygosity, which may lead to the uncovering of recessive genes, a similar phenomenon seen in children of consanguineous partners.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isodisomy</b> in a non-mendelian trait {{in humans}} caused by both {{copies of a}} {{chromosomal}} set being inherited from the biological mother or the father. It differs from uniparental disomy in that instead of receiving an identical set of chromosomes from one parent, the fertilized ovum contains {{a complete set of}} chromosomes from one parent resulting in a complete set of chromosomes from only one parent. This may result in the expression of recessive traits in the offspring. Some authors use the term uniparental disomy and <b>isodisomy</b> interchangeably.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{favorable}} prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a substantial subset of patients relapses. Since this occurs {{not only in}} the high risk but also in the standard/intermediate groups, the presently used risk stratification is suboptimal. The underlying mechanisms for treatment failure include presence of genetic changes causing insensitivity to the therapy administered. To identify relapse-associated aberrations we performed single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of 307 uniformly treated, consecutive pediatric ALL cases accrued 1992 - 2011. Recurrent aberrations of 14 genes in patients who subsequently relapsed or had induction failure were detected. Of these, deletions/uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> of ADD 3, ATP 10 A, EBF 1, IKZF 1, PAN 3, RAG 1, SPRED 1, and TBL 1 XR 1 were significantly more common in B-cell precursor ALL patients who relapsed compared with those remaining in complete remission. In univariate analyses, age (10 years), WBC counts (> 100 × 109 /l), t(9; 22) (q 34;q 11), MLL rearrangements, near-haploidy, and deletions of ATP 10 A, IKZF 1, SPRED 1, and the pseudoautosomal 1 regions on Xp/Yp were significantly associated with decreased 10 -year event-free survival, with IKZF 1 abnormalities being an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis irrespective of risk group. High age and deletions of IKZF 1 and SPRED 1 were also associated with poor overall survival. Thus, analyses of these genes provide clinically important information.

40|$|Cytogenetic {{analyses}} of a consecutive series of 67 paediatric (median age 8 years; range 0 - 17) de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients revealed aberrations in 55 (82 %) cases. The most common subgroups were KMT 2 A rearrangement (29 %), normal karyotype (15 %), RUNX 1 -RUNX 1 T 1 (10 %), deletions of 5 q, 7 q and/or 17 p (9 %), myeloid leukaemia associated with Down syndrome (7 %), PML-RARA (7 %) and CBFB-MYH 11 (5 %). Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analysis and exon sequencing of 100 genes, performed in 52 and 40 cases, respectively (39 overlapping), revealed ≥ 1 aberration in 89 %; when adding cytogenetic data, this frequency increased to 98 %. Uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> (UPIDs) were detected in 13 % and copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 63 % (median 2 /case); three UPIDs and 22 CNAs were recurrent. Twenty-two genes were targeted by focal CNAs, including AEBP 2 and PHF 6 deletions and genes involved in AML-associated gene fusions. Deep sequencing identified mutations in 65 % of cases (median 1 /case). In total, 60 mutations {{were found in}} 30 genes, primarily those encoding signalling proteins (47 %), transcription factors (25 %), or epigenetic modifiers (13 %). Twelve genes (BCOR, CEBPA, FLT 3, GATA 1, KIT, KRAS, NOTCH 1, NPM 1, NRAS, PTPN 11, SMC 3 and TP 53) were recurrently mutated.

40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) arrays {{are increasingly}} being used in clinical routine for genetic analysis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (BCP ALL). Because constitutional DNA is not readily available as a control {{at the time of}} diagnosis, {{it is important to be}} able to distinguish between acquired and constitutional aberrations in a diagnostic setting. In the present study we focused on uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> (UPIDs). SNP array analyses of 143 pediatric and 38 adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias and matched remission samples revealed acquired whole chromosome or segmental UPIDs (wUPIDs, sUPIDs) in 32 cases (18 %), without any age- or gender-related frequency differences. Acquired sUPIDs were larger than the constitutional ones (mean 35. 3 Mb vs. 10. 7 Mb; P< 0. 0001) and were more often terminally located in the chromosomes (69 % vs. 4. 5 %; P< 0. 0001). Chromosomes 3, 5, and 9 were most often involved in acquired wUPIDs, whilst recurrent acquired sUPIDs targeted 6 p, 9 p, 9 q, and 14 q. The majority (56 %) of sUPID 9 p was associated with homozygous CDKN 2 A deletions. In pediatric ALL, all wUPIDs were found in high hyperdiploid (51 - 67 chromosomes) cases and an extended analysis, also including unmatched diagnostic samples, revealed a higher frequency of wUPID-positivity in higher modal number (56 - 67 chromosomes) than in lower modal number (51 - 55 chromosomes) high hyperdiploid cases (34 % versus 11 %; P= 0. 04), suggesting different underlying mechanisms of formation of these subtypes of high hyperdiploidy.

40|$|Background: Pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} disease that arises in a multistep fashion through acquisition of several genetic aberrations, subsequently {{giving rise to}} a malignant, clonal expansion of T-lymphoblasts. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify additional as well as cooperative genetic events in T-ALL. Methods: A population-based pediatric T-ALL series comprising 47 cases was investigated by SNP array and deep sequencing analyses of 75 genes, in order to ascertain pathogenetically pertinent aberrations and to identify cooperative events. Results: The majority (92 %) of cases harbored copy number aberrations/uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> (UPIDs), with a median of three changes (range 0 - 11) per case. The genes recurrently deleted comprised CDKN 2 A, CDKN 2 B, LEF 1, PTEN, RBI, and STIL. No case had a whole chromosome UPID; in fact, literature data show that this is a rare phenomenon in T-ALL. However, segmental UPIDs (sUPIDs) were seen in 42 % of our cases, with most being sUPID 9 p that always were associated with homozygous CDKN 2 A deletions, with a heterozygous deletion occurring prior to the sUPID 9 p in all instances. Among the 75 genes sequenced, 14 (19 %) were mutated in 28 (72 %) of 39 analyzed cases. The genes targeted are involved in signaling transduction, epigenetic regulation, and transcription. In some cases, NOTCH 1 mutations were seen in minor subclones and lost at relapse; thus, such mutations can be secondary events. Conclusions: Deep sequencing and SNP array analyses of T-ALL revealed lack of wUPIDs, a high proportion of sUPID 9 p targeting CDKN 2 A, NOTCH 1 mutations in subclones, and recurrent mutations of genes involved in signaling transduction, epigenetic regulation, and transcription.

40|$|Chromosome banding {{analyses}} reveal secondary chromosome abnormalities {{in addition}} to the MYC translocations t(8; 14) (q 24;q 32), t(8; 22) (q 24;q 11), and t(2; 8) (p 11;q 24) in 60 %- 80 % of Burkitt lymphomas/leukemias (BL). The high incidence of such aberrations indicates that additional changes are important, perhaps necessary, for malignant transformation, i. e., the 8 q 24 /MYC rearrangements may not be sufficient. To investigate this possibility, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on 20 cases of 8 q 24 /MYC-positive BL. Nineteen (95 %) harbored genomic imbalances; the only case without such aberrations displayed secondary changes by chromosome banding analysis. Thus, all BL cases had abnormalities {{in addition to}} the 8 q 24 translocation. The adult cases harbored more changes (median 3; range 1 - 21) than did the childhood cases (median 1. 5; range 0 - 5) (P = 0. 034). Several recurrent aberrations were detected by SNP array analysis, in particular losses of 6 q 14. 1 -q 22. 33, 9 p 21. 3, and 13 q 14. 2 -q 14. 3, gains of 1 q 23. 3 -q 31. 3, chromosome 7, 13 q 31. 3, and partial uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> for 6 p 12. 2 -pter, 9 p 23 -pter, and 17 p 11. 2 -pter. The molecular genetic consequences of these changes include deletions of the CDKN 2 A and TP 53 genes, and gains/losses of several genes, such as MIR 17 HG and E 2 F 2 K, involved in the MYC pathway. Thus, deregulation of the MYC pathway, both directly through the 8 q 24 /MYC translocation and indirectly through secondary genomic imbalances, may be essential not only for the initiation but also for the progression of BL. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{malignancies}} in children. It is characterized by gain of chromosomes, typically +X, + 4, + 6, + 10, + 14, + 17, + 18, and + 21,+ 21; little is known about additional genetic aberrations. Approximately 20 % of the patients relapse; therefore it is clinically important to identify risk-stratifying markers. We used SNP array analysis to investigate a consecutive series of 74 cases of high hyperdiploid ALL. We show that the characteristic chromosomal gains are even more frequent than previously believed, indicating that karyotyping mistakes are common, and that almost 80 % of the cases display additional abnormalities detectable by SNP array analysis. Subclonality analysis strongly implied that the numerical aberrations were primary and arose before structural events, suggesting that step-wise evolution of the leukemic clone is common. An association between duplication of 1 q and + 5 was seen (P = 0. 003). Other frequent abnormalities included whole-chromosome uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> (wUPIDs) 9 and 11, gain of 17 q not associated with isochromosome formation, extra gain of part of 21 q, deletions of ETS variant 6 (ETV 6), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A (CKDN 2 A) and paired box 5 (PAX 5), and PAN 3 poly(A) specific ribonuclease subunit homolog (PAN 3) microdeletions. Comparison of whole-chromosome and partial UPID 9 suggested different pathogenetic outcomes, with the former not involving CDKN 2 A. Finally, two cases had partial deletions of AT rich interactive domain 5 B (ARID 5 B), indicating that acquired as well as constitutional variants in this locus may be associated with pediatric ALL.

40|$|Previous {{cytogenetic}} {{studies of}} myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemias {{in children with}} Down syndrome (ML-DS and DS-ALL) have revealed significant differences in abnormality patterns between such cases and acute leukemias in general. Also, certain molecular genetic aberrations characterize DS-related leukemias, such as GATA 1 mutations in ML-DS and deregulation of the CRLF 2 gene in DS-ALL. Whether microdeletions/microduplications also vary between DS and non-DS cases is presently unclear. To address this issue, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of eight pediatric ML-DS and 17 B-cell precursor DS-ALL. In the ML-DS cases, a total of 29 imbalances (20 gains and nine losses) and two partial uniparental <b>isodisomies</b> (pUPDs) were detected. None of the 11 small (defined as < 10 Mb) imbalances were recurrent, nor were the pUPDs, whereas of the 18 large aberrations, three were recurrent-dup(1 q), + 8 and + 21. In contrast, several frequent changes were identified in the DS-ALL cases, which harbored 82 imbalances (30 gains and 52 losses) and four pUPDs. Of the 40 large changes, 28 were gains and 12 losses, with +X, dup(Xq), dup(1 q), del(7 p), dup(8 q), del(9 p), dup(9 p), del(12 p), dup(17 q), and + 21 being recurrent. Of the 40 microdeletions identified, several targeted specific genes, with the following being repeatedly deleted: BTG 1 and CDKN 2 A/B (29 % of cases), ETV 6, IKZF 1, PAX 5 and SERP 2 (18 %), and BTLA, INPP 4 B, P 2 RY 8, and RB 1 (12 %). Loss of the SERP 2 and INPP 4 B genes, encoding the stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member 2 and the inositol polyphosphate 4 -phosphatase-II, respectively, has previously never been implicated in leukemia. Although deletions of the other genes {{have been associated with}} ALL, the high frequency of BTG 1 loss is a novel finding. Such deletions may characterize a clinical subgroup of DS-ALL, comprising mainly boys with a high median age. In conclusion, ML-DS and DS-ALL are genetically distinct, with mainly gains in ML-DS and deletions in DS-ALL. Furthermore, DS-ALL is characterized by several recurrent gene deletions, with BTG 1 loss being particularly frequent. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The human 11 p 15 {{region is}} divided into two {{independent}} imprinted domains, the H 19 /IGF 2 and CDKN 1 C/KCNQ 1 domains. Each domain is regulated by its own imprinting control regions, ICR 1 and ICR 2, which carry opposite germline imprints. The expression of 11 p 15 imprinted genes is regulated by two major mechanisms. ICR 1 binds a zinc finger protein (CTCF) on the unmethylated maternal allele and acts as a chromatin insulator, whereas ICR 2 is unmethylated on the paternal allele and serves as a promoter for a regulatory non-coding RNA (KCNQ 1 OT 1). Dysregulation of 11 p 15 genomic imprinting results in two human foetal growth disorders: the Beckwith-Wiedemann (BWS) and the Silver-Russell (SRS) syndromes, which display opposite growth phenotypes. Various 11 p 15 epigenetic and genetic defects result in BWS and SRS. Gain or loss of DNA methylation account for 60 % of BWS and SRS and, in most cases, the mechanism of the DNA methylation defect is unknown. The overall aim of this thesis was to decipher the mechanisms resulting in loss or gain of DNA methylation at ICR 1 or ICR 2 by investigating large cohorts of BWS and SRS patients displaying a “primary” DNA methylation defect. We aimed at establishing what was the incidence of copy number variations (CNVs) (duplications, deletions and segmental uniparental <b>isodisomies)</b> confined to one or one part of the H 19 /IGF 2 or CDKN 1 C/KCNQ 1 domains. We also screened extensively the ICR 1 imprinting control region in BWS and SRS patients to identify new genetic defects. We show in this work that genetic defects in cis account for a significant proportion (approximately 30 %) of BWS patients with ICR 1 gain of DNA methylation but are rare in SRS and BWS patients with loss of DNA methylation at ICR 1 and ICR 2, respectively. We describe novel small gain and loss CNVs involving only part of the two domains in BWS and SRS. We also describe, for the first time, mutations and small deletions involving binding sites for the OCT 4 and SOX 2 pluripotency factors. Those defects account for approximately 14 % of BWS cases and result in a BWS phenotype upon maternal transmission. We further characterize the role of OCT 4 /SOX 2 pluripotency factors in the maintenance of genomic imprinting at the H 19 /IGF 2 domain in mouse embryonic stem cells. By screening the whole 11 p 15 region for susceptibility alleles for loss or gain of DNA methylation, our group identified a novel 4. 5 kb cis-regulatory region within the CDKN 1 C/KCNQ 1 domain. A specific 4. 5 kb haplotype confers, upon maternal transmission, a risk of ICR 2 loss of DNA methylation in BWS patients. This study investigated the mechanism involved in the risk of ICR 2 loss of DNA methylation in BWS and showed that within this 4. 5 kb region, two SNPs (rs 11823023 and rs 179436) affect CTCF occupancy at DNA motifs flanking the CTCF 20 bp core motifs. This study identifies a new cis-regulatory region and highlights the crucial role of CTCF for the regulation of genomic imprinting at the CDKN 1 C/KCNQ 1 domain. These recent findings bring new insights in the regulation of genomic imprinting at both the IGF 2 /H 19 and CDKN 1 C/KCNQ 1 domains...|$|R
5000|$|The current {{research}} describes Raine Syndrome as a neonatal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, indicated by its osteosclerotic symptoms that {{are seen in}} those suffering from the disease. It {{has been found that}} a mutation in the gene FAM20C is the cause of the Raine Syndrome phenotype. This microdeletion mutation leads to an unusual chromosome 7 arrangement. The milder phenotypes of Raine Syndrome, such as those described in Simpson’s 2007 report, suggest that Raine Syndrome resulting from missense mutations may not be as lethal as the other described mutations (OMIM). This is supported by findings from Fradin et al. (2011), who reported on children with missense mutations to FAM20C and lived to ages 1 and 4 years, relatively much longer than the life spans of the previously reported children. Simpson et al.’s (2007) report states that to date, effected individuals have had chromosome 7 uniparental <b>isodisomy</b> and a 7p telomeric microdeletion. They had abnormal chromosome 7 arrangements, with microdeletions of their D7S2477 and D7S1484 markers (Simpson 2007). Raine Syndrome appears to be an autosomal recessive disease. There are reports of recurrence in children born of the same parents, and an increased occurrence in children of closely related, genetically similar parents. Individuals with Raine Syndrome were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the mutation of FAM20C. Also observed have been nonsynonomous mutation and splice-site changes (Simpson et al. 2007). [...] FAM20C, located on chromosome 7p22.3, is an important molecule in bone development. Studies in mice have demonstrated its importance in the mineralization of bones in teeth in early development (OMIM, Simpson et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2010). FAM20C stands for “family with sequence similarity 20, member C.” It is also commonly referred to as DMP-4. It is a Golgi-enriched fraction casein kinase and an extracellular serine/threonine protein kinase. It is 107,743 bases long, with 10 exons and 584 amino acids (Weizmann Institute of Science).|$|E

In some instances, the deleted region does not include 11 p 13, {{the location of the}} WT 1 gene, suggesting the existence of a second Wilms tumor gene on 11 p. Both the exclusive loss of the maternally derived allele in Wilms tumors and the recent description of constitutional paternal <b>isodisomy</b> for this region in patients with either the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) or isolated hemihypertrophy have suggested that this second locus is subject to sex-specific genomic imprinting. Given that one of these isodisomic patients had minimal congenital anomalies (hemihypertrophy), we hypothesized that a proportion of Wilms tumors which had not lost heterozygosity for 11 p markers (about 60 % of all cases) might have arisen consequent to 11 p paternal heterodisomy and that patients constitutionally homozygous at 11 p 15 might harbor paternal <b>isodisomy.</b> We have analyzed 40 Wilms tumor cases to determine the parental origin of the child's 11 p 15 alleles.

Delineation {{of the extent of}} the disomy region may help in understanding the mechanism and the stage, meiotic or mitotic, of disomy formation in this disease and in associated tumours. Our current studies in WBS patients with seventeen 11 p and one 11 q markers reveal paternal <b>isodisomy,</b> not heterodisomy, in the five cases. For one case we demonstrate unambiguously that partial <b>isodisomy</b> for 11 p and somatic mosaicism for UPD resulted from a post-fertilization event. The restriction of <b>isodisomy</b> to part of 11 p in another case, and somatic mosaicism for UPD in three other cases, suggest a mitotic recombinational event that must have occurred after fertilization. Mosaic phenotypes reflect the timing of their origin and the fate of the cells involved, as well as the cell-specific pattern of imprinting. Somatic mosaicism for UPD in four cases may thus explain the incomplete forms of WBS. The association of hemihypertrophy in sporadic WBS and even some cases of isolated hemihypertrophy.

The 2 cases with LOH limited to less than 9 Mb were intrachromosomal deletions. Among the 8 leukemias with 50 -Mb LOH segments, 4 had partial uniparental <b>isodisomy</b> and 4 had interstitial uniparental <b>isodisomy.</b> These isodisomic cases showed clustering of the centromeric and telomeric LOH breakpoints. This suggests that the cases with interstitial uniparental <b>isodisomy</b> arose in a leukemia-initiating cell by double-homologous recombination events at intervals of preferred mitotic recombination. Homozygous inactivation of NF 1 favored outgrowth of the leukemia-initiating cell. Our studies demonstrate that LOH analyses of loci distributed along the chromosomal length along with copy-number analysis can reveal novel mechanisms of LOH that may potentially identify regions harboring “cryptic” tumor suppressor or modifier genes whose inactivation contributes to tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|Silver-Russell {{syndrome}} (SRS) shares {{common features}} of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) {{and a number}} of dysmorphic features including lateral asymmetry in about 50 % of subjects. Its genetic aetiology is complex and most probably heterogeneous. Approximately 7 % of patients with SRS have been found to have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7  (mUPD 7). Genomic DNA samples from five SRS patients with mUPD 7 have been analysed for common regions of <b>isodisomy</b> using 40  polymorphic markers distributed along the length of chromosome 7.  No regions of common <b>isodisomy</b> were found among the five patients. It is most likely that imprinted gene(s) rather than recessive mutations cause the common phenotype. Heterodisomy of markers around the centromere indicated that the underlying cause of the mUPD 7 is a maternal meiosis I non-disjunction error in these five subjects.    Keywords: Silver-Russell syndrome; mUPD; heterodisomy; isodisom...|$|E

40|$|Uniparental disomy for {{maternal}} chromosome 7 {{has been}} described in three patients with recessive disorders. Short stature {{in each of these}} patients has been explained by the effect of imprinting of growth-related genes on maternal chromosome 7. Alternatively, although less likely, all these patients may be homozygous for a rare recessive mutation. Here we report both paternal <b>isodisomy</b> for chromosome 7 and normal growth in a patient with a recessive disorder, congenital chloride diarrhea. She had inherited only paternal alleles at 10 loci and was homozygous for another 10 chromosome 7 loci studied. Her physical status and laboratory tests were normal except for a mild high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. As the patient has normal stature, {{it is likely that the}} paternal chromosome 7 lacks the suggested maternal imprinting effect on growth. Paternal <b>isodisomy</b> for human chromosome 7 may have no phenotypic effect on growth...|$|E
40|$|We report {{maternal}} {{uniparental disomy}} of chromosome 17 (mat UPD 17) in a 2. 5 -year-old girl presenting infantile cystinosis. This patient was homozygous for the 57 kb deletion encompassing the CTNS gene, frequently found in patients from the European origin. The proband's mother was heterozygous for the deletion {{and the father}} did not carry the deletion. We carried out haplotype analysis with polymorphic markers spanning the whole chromosome 17. Informative markers showed the presence of two maternal alleles but no paternal allele for regions spanning the 17 q arm and the proximal half of 17 p, and only one maternal allele on the distal 17 p arm. As deletion of half of 17 p is probably not viable, these results suggest mat UPD 17 with heterodisomy of 17 q and proximal 17 p and <b>isodisomy</b> of distal 17 p. This is the first demonstration of mat UPD 17, in particular of <b>isodisomy</b> 17 p, in cystinosis...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} growth failure, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, muscular hypertonia, and severe {{psychomotor}} retardation are described. At birth, both cases had cytogenetic mosaicism in lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts, in case 1 ring chromosome 21 and monosomy 21 {{and in case}} 2, deletion of chromosome 21 and monosomy 21. At a later age the lymphocyte karyotype changed almost completely to 46,XX, but the fibroblast karyotype remained as before. DNA polymorphism analysis described elsewhere indicated that the 46,XX lymphocytes contained two identical chromosomes 21 (<b>isodisomy),</b> in case 1 inherited from the father and in case 2 from the mother. The <b>isodisomy</b> {{was the result of}} duplication of a chromosome in mitosis after the loss of the homologous abnormal chromosome ("compensatory isodisomy"). We report here that this cytogenetic mechanism can result in false normal cytogenetic findings. The phenotypes were attributed to the cells with monosomy 21 in case 1 and to the deletion and monosomy of chromosome 21 in case 2...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} male infant who {{presented}} at 8 {{months of age}} with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) responsive to plasma therapy. Investigation showed him to have complement factor H (CFH) deficiency associated with a homozygous CFH mutation (c. 2880 delT [p. Phe 960 fs]). Mutation screening of the child's parents revealed that the father was heterozygous for this change {{but that it was}} not present in his mother. Chromosome 1 uniparental <b>isodisomy</b> of paternal origin was confirmed by genotyping chromosome 1 SNPs. CD 46 SNP genotyping was undertaken in this individual and another patient with CFH deficiency associated with chromosome 1 uniparental <b>isodisomy.</b> This showed a homozygous aHUS risk haplotype (CD 46 GGAAC) in the patient with aHUS and a homozygous glomerulonephritis risk haplotype (CD 46 AAGGT) in the patient with endocapillary glomerulonephritis. We also showed that FHL- 1 (factor H-like protein 1) was present in the patient with aHUS and absent in the patient with glomerulonephritis. This study emphasizes that modifiers such as CD 46 and FHL- 1 may determine the kidney phenotype of patients who present with homozygous CFH deficiency...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a patient with a {{congenital}} disorder of glycosylation type Id (CDG-Id) caused by a homozygous mutation in the ALG 3 gene, which results from a de novo mutation in combination with a segmental maternal uniparental <b>isodisomy</b> (UPD). The patient presented with severe psychomotor delay, primary microcephaly, and opticus atrophy, compatible with a severe form of CDG. Isoelectric focusing of transferrin showed a type I pattern and lipid-linked oligosaccharide analysis showed an accumulation of dol-PP-GlcNAc 2 Man 5 in patient's fibroblasts suggesting a defect in the ALG 3 gene. A homozygous ALG 3 missense mutation p. R 266 C (c. 796 C > T) was identified. Further evaluation revealed that neither the mother nor the father were carrier of the p. R 266 C mutation. Marker analysis revealed a segmental maternal <b>isodisomy</b> for the chromosomal region 3 q 21. 3 - 3 qter. UPD for this region has not been described before. More important, the combination of UPD with a de novo mutation is an exceptional coincidence and an extraordinary observation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{myeloproliferative}} disorders (MPDs) are {{a group of}} haematopoietic stem cell diseases, characterised by proliferation {{of one or more}} cells of the myeloid lineage. Several lines of evidence have highlighted the importance of aberrant tyrosine kinase signalling in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Cloning of rare chromosomal translocations and point mutation analysis in the MPDs has identified diverse deregulated tyrosine kinase genes, notably PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR 1 and JAK 2. However the majority of atypical MPDs still remain to be characterised and identification of patients harbouring fusions, particularly those involving the PDGF receptors is of increasing importance, as {{they are likely to be}} responsive to targeted therapy with imatinib. I am investigating MPD patients for abnormalities affecting tyrosine kinase signalling, and have used three approaches, translocation cloning, expression analysis and SNP array analysis to detect regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Thus far, by translocation cloning I have identified a previously undescribed partner gene fused to PDGFRB and two new PDGFRA fusion genes. I have also designed two reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays and a cDNA MLPA assay to detect over-expression of specific tyrosine kinases screening approximately 200 patients. Each assay identified all patients previously diagnosed with known fusions. Additionally, two patients identified with overexpression of PDGFRB have been found to have cryptic ETV 6 -PDGFRB fusions and overexpression of PDGFRA in one patient lead to the discovery of a previously undescribed fusion involving a novel partner gene (KIF 5 B). Recent evidence has indicated that acquired <b>isodisomy</b> is a novel mechanism by which mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. Typically, acquired <b>isodisomy</b> is associated with oncogenic changes rather than tumour suppressor genes, eg. the activating JAK 2 V 617 F mutation and 9 p aUPD. I have undertaken a screen using Affymetrix 50 K SNP arrays for regions of acquired <b>isodisomy</b> as a means to identify genomic regions that may harbour novel oncogenes in different subgroups of MPD patients. Large tracts of homozygosity (defined as > 20 Mb running to a telomere), strongly suggesting acquired <b>isodisomy,</b> were seen in 40 % aMPD patients. The homozygous tracts encompassed diverse genomic regions in aMPD, but two common regions (3 cases for each region) were identified at 7 q and 11 q. Mutations in the CBL ubiquitin ligase gene were discovered in all three aCML patients with 11 q aUPD as well as in an additional 23 MPD patients following further screening...|$|E
40|$|Paternal <b>isodisomy</b> for {{chromosome}} 5 {{was detected}} in a 2 -year-old boy with type III {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder of alpha motor neurons, known to map to 5 q 11. 2 - 13. 3. Examination of 17 short-sequence repeat polymorphisms spanning 5 p 15. 1 - 15. 3 to 5 q 33. 3 -qter produced no evidence of maternally inherited alleles. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal male karyotype, and FISH with probes closely flanking the SMA locus confirmed the presence of two copies of chromosome 5. No developmental abnormalities, other than those attributable to classical childhood-onset SMA, were present. While {{the absence of a}} maternally derived chromosome 5 could have produced the symptoms of SMA through the mechanism of genomic imprinting, the lack of more global developmental abnormalities would be unusual. Paternal transmission of two copies of a defective gene at the SMA locus seems to be the most likely cause of disease, but proof of this will have to await the identification of the SMA gene. While uniparental <b>isodisomy</b> is a rare event, it must be considered as a possible mechanism involved in SMA when conducting prenatal testing and counseling for this disorder...|$|E
