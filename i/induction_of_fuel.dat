40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the sensitivity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) activities of Crangon crangon (L.) to the water-accommodated fraction (WAF) <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> oil spilled by the oil tanker Prestige, {{in order to assess}} their usefulness as markers for this kind of pollution. Laboratory exposure of shrimps to WAF <b>of</b> weathered Prestige <b>fuel</b> oil showed no significant interference with AChE activity.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Induction</b> <b>of</b> {{labor is}} being {{increasingly}} {{used to prevent}} adverse outcomes in {{the mother and the}} newborn. This study assessed the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor and determinants of its use in Africa. Methods We performed secondary analysis of the WHO Global Survey of Maternal and Newborn Health of 2004 and 2005. The African database was analyzed to determine the use <b>of</b> <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor at the country level and indications for <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor. The un-met needs for specific obstetric indications and at country level were assessed. Determinants <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor were explored with multivariate regression analysis. Results A total of 83, 437 deliveries were recorded in the 7 participating countries. Average rate <b>of</b> <b>induction</b> was 4. 4 % with a range of 1. 4 – 6. 8 %. Pre-labor rupture of membranes was the commonest indication for <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor. Two groups of women were identified: 2, 776 women with indications had <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor while 7, 996 women although had indications but labor was not induced. <b>Induction</b> <b>of</b> labor was associated with reduction of stillbirths and perinatal deaths [OR – 0. 34; 95 % CI (0. 27 – 0. 43) ]. Unmet need for <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor ranged between 66. 0 % and 80. 2 % across countries. Determinants <b>of</b> having an <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor were place of residence, duration of schooling, type of health facility and level of antenatal care. Conclusion Utilization <b>of</b> <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor in health facilities in Africa is very low. Improvements in social and health infrastructure are required to reverse the high unmet need for <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> labor. </p...|$|R
40|$|Some {{explosion}} {{models for}} Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), {{such as the}} gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) or the double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar (DDSC) models, rely on the spontaneous initiation of a detonation in the degenerate C/O material of a white dwarf. The length scales pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in multi-dimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of 1 D simulations at higher resolution, {{such as the ones}} performed for this work, as guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable gradient in self-ignition (<b>induction)</b> times <b>of</b> the <b>fuel,</b> which we set up with a spatially localized non-uniformity of temperature [...] a hot spot. We determine the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in a detonation in white dwarf matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations with the hydrodynamics code FLASH. We quantify the dependences of the critical sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of modeling of SNe Ia. Comment: 43 pages, 12 figures, 12 table...|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{a disease}} of altered gene {{expression}} involving a complex array of epigenetic events, gene mutation, chromosome rearrangements and altered chromosome number. The coincidence of genotoxic events with the <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> cancer has <b>fueled</b> great interest in molecular/cytogenetic epidemiological studies aimed at linking polymorphisms in genes for DNA repair and carcinogen metabolism and biomarkers of DNA/chromosome damage with cancer risk. These studies are now being expanded to include the role of dietary factors that {{are known to be}} important in DNA metabolism and repair such as folic acid, vitamin B 12 and zinc. The use of DNA damage biomarkers as a surrogate for cancer would greatly facilitate our capacity to identify the most important risk factors for cancer however these biomarkers need validation. The Nordic and Italian prospective cohort studies have confirmed that elevated rates of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes are predictive of cancer risk and similar studies are now underway to validate other biomarkers such as the micronucleus assay which are more practical to apply in the larger population setting. Validation of these biomarkers requires a thorough understanding of the importance of methodological, demographic, environmental and dietary variables and the ongoing HUMN project is a good example how this can be achieved for the micronucleus assay. The capacity to study human populations has opened up new opportunities to define acceptable DNA damage rates and to establish recommended dietary allowances for genomic stability. Controlling DNA damage rate to its possible minimum is likely to have an important impact in preventing cancer and other DNA damage-related degenerative diseases including ageing...|$|R

40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces human monocytes {{to express}} many proinflammatory mediators, {{including}} the procoagulant molecule tissue factor (TF) and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNIF-alpha). The TF and TNF-alpha genes are regulated by various transcription factors, including nuclear factor (NF) -kappaB/Rel proteins and Egr- 1. In this study, {{the role of}} the MEK-ERK 1 / 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in LIPS <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> TF and TNF-alpha gene expression in human monocytic cells was investigated. The MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor PD 98059 reduced LPS <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> TF and TNIF-alpha expression in a dose-dependent manner. PD 98059 did not affect LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins and minimally affected LPS <b>induction</b> <b>Of</b> KB-dependent transcription. In contrast, PD 98059 and dominant-negative mutants of the Ras-Raf 1 -MEK-ERK (extacellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway strongly inhibited LPS <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> Egr- 1 expression. In kinetic experiments LPS <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> Egr- 1 expression preceded <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> TF expression. In addition, mutation of the Egr- 1 sites in the TF and TNF-alpha promoters reduced expression of these proinflammatory genes.

We found that stress fiber formation requires de novo protein synthesis, p 38 Mapk and Smad signaling. We show that TGF-beta via Smad and p 38 Mapk up-regulates expression of actin-binding proteins including high-molecular-weight tropomyosins, alpha-actinin and calponin h 2. We demonstrate that, among these proteins, tropomyosins are both necessary and sufficient for TGF-beta <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> stress fibers. Silencing of tropomyosins with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) blocks stress fiber assembly, whereas ectopic expression of tropomyosins results in stress fibers. Ectopic-expression and siRNA experiments show that Smads mediate <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> tropomyosins and stress fibers.

We {{demonstrate that the}} HCMV immediate-early 2 (IE 2) gene product IE 86 can effectively block the <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> IFN-β during HCMV infection. IE 86 also efficiently blocked the <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> IFN-β following Sendai virus infection, demonstrating that IE 86 's ability to block <b>induction</b> <b>of</b> IFN-β {{is not limited to}} HCMV infection, identifying IE 2 as an IFN-β antagonist...|$|R
