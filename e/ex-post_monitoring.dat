We consider a situation where an incumbent provides access to an essential facility and competes downstream with an entrant such that the anticompetitive danger is twofold.

When assessing an expert’s competence using ex-post information, jurors overweigh how much they learn from failed predictions and underweigh how much they learn from successful ones. As a result, they underestimate the competence of experts on average. To defend their reputation, experts are too reluctant to base predictions on ex-ante information that complements, and too eager to base predictions on ex-ante information that substitutes, for what jurors independently learn <b>ex-post.</b> Optimal <b>monitoring</b> is coarser and career incentives are weaker than under Bayesian assumptions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the task the supervisor should be optimally charged with in an agency {{model in which}} the principal faces corruption concerns. We highlight a fundamental tradeoff between monitoring the agent's effort choice and auditing it <b>ex-post.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> proves more effective in tackling corruption, since the supervisor sends the report before the profit realization. By {{taking advantage of the}} supervisor's uncertainty about the state of nature, the principal can design a compensation scheme which prevents all forms of corruption at a lower cost. Conversely, auditing allows the principal to save the cost of supervision when the profit realization already suffices to set the compensation due to the agent. We show that the choice between monitoring and auditing crucially depends on the supervisor's ability to falsify information and the cost of hiring a supervisor.

New Zealand water and soil planning is currently facing the challenge of developing a framework which will allow management of the resources {{to the satisfaction of}} the wider goals and objectives of the New Zealand community. This implies a shift from the single objective approach, adopted at present, to the multiple objective approach described in this document. It is shown that there are adequate means available to quantify the effects of water and soil management proposals within a multiple objective framework. The major drawback at present is that experience with these techniques, especially environmental quality and social impact, is limited in New Zealand. The study stresses {{that there is a need}} for the planning process to find local means to attain predetermined national goals and objectives. This is achieved by integrating the public into the decision making framework. Multiple objective programming techniques are shown to have a place in formalising the analytical structure within which decisions about resource management are to take place. An example of one such technique, goal programming, shows that these techniques have a useful part to play in a multiple objective planning framework. Analysis of the water and soil decision making process shows that there is a general failure by funding, promoting and implementing agencies to gather and use feedback information from <b>ex-post</b> and <b>monitoring</b> analyses to refine and develop the ex-ante technique.

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to {{describe}} quality assurance mechanisms at the Translation Service of the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU (GSC). The first part will put the GSC's translation activity into a more general framework of {{the workings of the}} whole institution. Furthermore, the GSC's approach to translation quality will be explained, and tools and procedures that are used and help translators achieve the required quality of their products will be described. The next part will focus on the <b>ex-post</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> that was introduced a few years ago to systematically monitor both the quality of translations that leave the Translation Service and the individual performance of translators. The final part will be dedicated to a recently-adopted special procedure to ensure the best quality of the GSC Translation Service’s hallmark product – the European Council conclusions. The chapter is descriptively oriented and draws on everyday practice of a GSC's translator and the quality policy coordinator. Hopefully, it will raise awareness of the activities of the GSC's Translation Service, provide inspiration for other translation departments and practitioners and offer topics for further research for academia. With approximately 600 translators and 300 other management and support staff, the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU’s Translation Service is a little smaller than the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Translation and about half the size of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation, but still large by most standards. Each year the Council’s service translates around 15, 000 documents, which represent roughly 110, 000 pages of source material and a yearly translation output, expressed as a sum of all target languages, in the range of 1. 2 million pages (Council 2016 a, Council 2017).

40|$|International audienceThere {{have been}} many reviews about how energy {{efficiency}} policies for existing buildings work, but more rarely {{about the details of}} their effective impacts and costs, mainly due to difficulties in accessing data. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plans enable to know what policies are implemented and how. But details about their impacts and costs can often be found in national language only, and rarely in a single report (if available at all). This paper presents an analysis of <b>ex-post</b> evaluations and <b>monitoring</b> reports available for 13 major energy efficiency schemes for retrofitting buildings.

The second part proposes a methodology to compare results and costs of different policies, illustrated by one pilot comparison between the Italian and the French tax credit schemes.

40|$|Differences in {{monitoring}} cost is a commonly observed {{feature of the}} credit markets of LDCs.

40|$|Beginning in the mid-seventeenth century, England {{changed its}} system of raising {{revenues}} from tax farming, {{combined with the}} granting of monopolies, to direct collection within the government administration. Rents were then transferred from tax farmers and monopolists to the central government such that English public finances improved dramatically compared to both the old system and to its major competitor, France. We offer a theory explaining this development. In our view, a cost of tax farming is the ex-ante inefficiency due to the auction mechanism while a cost of direct collection is the <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> cost the government incurs to prevent theft. When the monitoring cost is high the government therefore allows tax farmers to extract large rents to enhance their up-front payments. In addition, because revenues materialize late under direct collection, and since the government faces limited borrowing, a high default risk makes a system of up-front collection attractive. The results of the model are consistent with historical facts from England and France. ...|$|E

It has been found that for a DRM scheme to be Fair Use friendly it has to aim to reach the following idealistic characteristics: *	The copyright holders should not be able to interfere with usage which a judge would or could rule as fair use. *	The Consumers would be able to consume the content easily and spontaneously within interoperable regimes. *	The Consumers? privacy rights would be respected, in congruence with the legislation in question. *	The Consumers should be able to purchase, replicate and distribute music at a monetary cost. *	The Consumers should be able to replicate, distribute and store music at the cost of diminished quality, slow replication and slow distribution. However it has also been found that these characteristics alone are not enough, and therefore the DRM scheme should be implemented within the following conditions: *	The DRM scheme should find ways to handle the ambiguity of Fair Use. *	The DRM scheme should facilitate <b>ex-post</b> tracking and <b>monitoring</b> rather than ex-ante based decision making. *	The DRM scheme should support interoperability and privacy.

I evaluate critically the neoliberal approach to these aspects of development and capabilities in the MENA region generally and with a special case study of Egypt. A socially and politically oriented capabilities approach integrates poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) techniques, economic and technical tools of ex-ante and <b>ex-post</b> assessment, and <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation methodologies in a comprehensive manner. Accordingly, it begins by identifying interested stakeholders and asking questions regarding facilitating and coordinating their participation as well as building institutional arrangements that will assure sustainability of the human development process.

Finally, progress towards collecting data and building a database of relevant indicators, and developing tools of monitoring and evaluation along with the development of the institutional and technical capability of stakeholders are examined within a dynamic historical context of democratization. Building on other experiences of participatory assessment of different policies, the approach I advocate [...] - besides producing empirical analysis [...] - is intended to engage all actors involved (government, business, labour, and civil society institutions representing different segments of the population, in particular women) in active participation within a deeply democratic social and political context.

40|$|Keywords:      Agricultural R&D, field experimentation, crossbreeding, dairy, feeding technologies, mixed farming, farming systems research, modelling. Smallholder {{mixed crop}} {{livestock}} systems {{continue to be}} a dominant agricultural production system in many developing countries, including India. Dairy farming {{is part and parcel of}} many such systems, and it is often seen as an important livelihood option to increase household income and to therefore contribute to poverty alleviation in rural areas. As a result, substantial efforts in agricultural R&D have been directed towards design of new technologies for smallholder dairy farming. Variable success in technology transfer has clearly shown that adoption is context-specific, related to the physical and socio-economic environment, access of farmers to resources, access to information and personal attitudes. A series of concepts and methods were developed to incorporate these considerations, and to replace narrow technology-driven approaches by broader ones such as Farming Systems Research (FSR). This thesis describes and analyses experiences of BAIF, an Indian NGO, with the use of FSR methodology in livestock development programmes in Gujarat, India. The objectives were to identify criteria and methodologies for selection of appropriate livestock technologies for farm level, and to identify differences in the methods of selection of appropriate technology. Section 1 describes the variation in livestock production systems in India in general and in Gujarat-state. Livestock comprises defined and undefined breeds of cattle and buffalo. Total livestock population increased annually by over 1 % in the last four decades, with buffalo and goat populations increasing faster than cattle. This section also gives background to the BAIF organization and to FSR methodologies. Section 2 more specifically describes the Gujarat research area with agro-ecological zone-wise information on animal breeds, herd composition, feed resources, crops, and trends in seasonal availability of feed as derived from transects, Participatory Rural Appraisals, and mapping. Constraint analysis and modelling indicated limited genetic potential of the local breeds and shortage of feed resources, both quantitatively and qualitatively, as major constraints for livestock development. Crossbreeding for breed improvement and use of (improved) local feed resources were identified as suitable technologies to alleviate these constraints. <b>Ex-post</b> performance <b>monitoring</b> of some BAIF crossbreeding programmes show that crossbred cattle fitted well in the smallholder mixed farming systems of both tribal and non-tribal farmers in all three selected agro-ecological zones (Section 3). Milk production of crossbreds was substantially higher, as was livestock gross margin and household income. Although quality of the roughages is a major limiting factor, farmers owning crossbreds tried to adjust to the needs of the cows by feeding concentrates. There was no difference in workload and labour division between households with and without crossbreds. Crossbreeding thus proved a techno-economically and socially viable livelihood option for both mixed and landless farming systems in Gujarat. Various modelling approaches were used in Section 4 to explore, ex ante, the suitability of feeding technologies such as urea supplementation, use of local and commercial concentrates, urea-treated straw with concentrates, and leuceana tree leaves for crop-livestock systems in Gujarat, India. Major conclusions were that (i) concentrate feeding is beneficial to farmers with market access and crossbred cows, (ii) crossbreeding interventions are more remunerative for landless and tribal farmers than for non-tribal farmers; feeding interventions are more effective for crossbreds than for local cows, (iii) maximum farm income is achieved at medium milk yields per animal; higher milk yields require use of better feeds, which renders the straws of the grains useless for feeding; at farm level, the (economically) optimum cropping pattern would then shift from grain crops to cotton. This section continues with a narrative on BAIF's experiences with field testing of technologies at animal, at herd, at farm and watershed level, including a shift to crop research when dictated by local needs. Over a period of roughly 30 years, three phases in on-field testing can be distinguished, i. e., starting with a period of predominantly top-down approaches, moving to a phase with emphasis on participatory identification and testing of technologies, and then into a phase with work at community and watershed level. A few cases are discussed for each phase, illustrating the processes, methods and types of technologies involved, and drawing lessons on field experimentation for livestock and rural development in general. The studies brought out, among others, that adoption of technologies is facilitated when these u se local (feed) resources, that are readily available, requires only small changes in farm practices, are relatively simple to implement, and yield tangible results in the short term. Section 5 analyses the dynamics in methods and approaches of BAIF's work on livestock development, as it grew from Gandhian roots into a large development organization. It emphasises the dynamics in approaches between top-down, objectivist and reductionist approaches on one hand and bottom-up, constructivist, holistic and self-organized approaches on the other hand. These experiences are set against similar developments on the (inter) national scene and in industrialized countries, along with factors that influence the changes, suggesting that agricultural R&D behaves as a complex adaptive system with its own dynamics and associated paradigm shifts. It also discusses a number of cross-cutting issues such as the notion of real versus perceived problems, hierarchy and grid, phases in development and aspects of holism versus reductionism, also reflected in notions of goal and process orientation. Concluding, the thesis considers development as a continuous process, of which the goals change over time-and-space. This reflects a paradigm issue, and if development is indeed a dynamic process it implies that choice of methodology and technology) should go along with changes occurring in that process. Some guidelines regarding the usefulness of approaches and technologies are given. But agricultural R&D is ultimately considered to be a complex adaptive system, also in Gujarat, and development organizations such as BAIF have to, therefore, show dynamic behaviour...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} new approach that enables policy-makers to analyze welfare gains from improvements {{in the quality of}} infrastructure services in developing countries where data are limited and supply is subject to interruptions. With the tight budgetary constraints that usually exist, {{it is important to be}} able to prioritize public sector investments on the basis of expected benefits. However, policy analysts are rarely able to measure the benefits of improving the quality of infrastructure services, even though they may yield large welfare benefits. The most frequently cited reason for failures to carry out such welfare analysis is the scarcity of data on service quality. The main contribution of this dissertation is a new model of welfare evaluation of changes in the quality of infrastructure services. This model is estimated using the existing data from household energy surveys or data from the energy sections of multi-purpose household surveys. Potential applications of this model range from ex-ante reform evaluation to <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> of policy outcomes, which makes this approach a useful contribution to policy analysis and to the literature on welfare evaluation of quality changes in infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} novel theory of securitization based on intermediaries minimizing the moral hazard that insiders can misuse assets held on-balance sheet. The model predicts how intermediaries finance different assets. Under deposit funding, the moral hazard is greatest for low-risk assets that yield sizable returns in bad states of nature; under securitization, it is greatest for high-risk assets that require high guarantees and large reserves. Intermediaries thus securitize low-risk assets. In an extension, I identify a novel channel through which government bailouts exacerbate the moral hazard and reduce total investment {{irrespective of the}} funding mode. This adverse effect is stronger under deposit funding, implying that intermediaries finance more risky assets off-balance sheet. The dissertation discusses the implications of different forms of guarantees. With explicit guarantees, banks securitize assets with either low information-intensity or low risk. By contrast, with implicit guarantees, banks only securitize assets with high information-intensity and low risk. Two extensions to the benchmark static and dynamic models are discussed. First, an extension to the static model studies the optimality of tranching versus securitization with guarantees. Tranching eliminates agency costs but worsens adverse selection, while securitization with guarantees does the opposite. When the quality of underlying assets in a certain security market is sufficiently heterogeneous, and when the highest quality assets {{are perceived to be}} sufficiently safe, securitization with guarantees dominates tranching. Second, in an extension to the dynamic setting, the moral hazard of misusing assets held on-balance sheet naturally gives rise to the moral hazard of weak <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> in securitization. The use of guarantees reduces the dependence of banks' ex-post payoffs on monitoring efforts, thereby weakening monitoring incentives. The incentive to monitor under securitization with implicit guarantees is the weakest among all funding modes, as implicit guarantees allow banks to renege on their monitoring promises without being declared bankrupt and punished...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} digital piracy for {{commercial}} profit {{has received a}} lot of attention in the industrial organisation literature over the last few years. Illegal competition from pirates reduces the revenue of the legal firm and this has been a concern of the digital media and software industry globally. This thesis is motivated by the observation of three important gaps in the literature on commercial piracy. First, pirated products are usually imperfect substitutes of the legal product. This implies that the impact of a change in the legal product’s price on the demand for the pirated product will be different from the impact of a change in the price of the pirated product on the legal firm’s demand. The existing literature on product differentiation, however, does not consider such kind of asymmetric product differentiation. Second, empirical evidences show that firms often need to incur costs to document and report signs of piracy, and then the regulatory authority decides whether or not and how much to invest in monitoring which, in turn, affects the probability that the pirate is being caught and convicted. The implications of costly reporting by the legal firm and <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> by the authority have not been investigated. Third, while the importance of piracy in affecting innovation has been widely recognised, there has not been much work that directly models the impact of piracy on firms that engage in competition for innovation. This thesis presents three theoretical essays that attempt to fill these gaps in the literature. The first essay analyses the effects of the degree of asymmetric product differentiation on the profit ordering of two competing firms in a Stackelberg model to investigate whether a leader earns a higher or a lower profit than a follower. The model captures asymmetric product differentiation by two cross-price effect parameters, and this two-dimensional model generates novel results that are absent in the literature on profit-ordering with symmetric product differentiation. For example, we find that for every level of the cross-price effect of the change in the leader’s price on the follower’s quantity there exists a critical value for the cross-price effect of the change in the follower’s price on the leader’s quantity, such that below this critical level the leader earns a higher profit than the follower, but the reverse is true above this critical value. The second essay introduces piracy in a market with asymmetric product differentiation. It examines the regulatory authority’s decision on whether to monitor piracy following the legal firm’s report of the presence of a pirate in the market. In the model, the authority decides whether or not and how much to invest in monitoring in order to maximise a politically motivated objective function. We show that with <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> the government will monitor piracy under both price and quantity competition if the legal firm’s political influence is sufficiently high. We also find that, when holding the cross-price effect of the legal firm’s price on the pirate’s output constant, there exists a unique level of the cross-price impact of the pirate’s price on the legal firm’s output, above which monitoring will be higher under quantity competition, and below which monitoring will be higher under price competition. Moreover, we show that when the government can credibly commit to monitor piracy the legal firm’s investment on innovation is higher under quantity competition than under price competition. The last essay analyses the effect of piracy on innovation when two legal firms engage in R&D competition. When a single firm is deciding how much to invest in R&D which will stochastically determine whether innovation will be successful, piracy unambiguously retards innovation. However, we show that when two legal firms are engaging in a patent race, piracy may enhance innovation. We also show that if the difference between the efficiency parameters of the innovating firms is relatively large then piracy increases aggregate R&D investment and the profit of the less efficient firm...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{institutions}} {{under which}} venture capital investment operates in China and {{whether and how}} these institutions affect venture capitalists’ (VCs) investment preferences, ex-ante project screening strategies, and <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> activities in China. Based on an analysis of about 50 unstructured and semi-structured interviews and an examination of more than 800 venture capital backed deals, this study finds that regulations on corporate governance impact VCs’ investment activities in China. Due to regulatory restrictions, most foreign venture capital firms are structured under limited partnerships, whereas all domestic venture capital firms (VCFs) are structured as limited companies in China. The difference in corporate governance of VCFs heavily affects VCs’ investment strategies in China. VCFs under limited partnerships show more risktaking capability than those structured as limited companies by investing more in younger projects with higher R&D intensity. Associated with the difference in investment preferences, VCFs under limited partnerships employ stage financing more frequently than those structured as limited companies do. At the same time, the stage financing strategies deployed by VCFs under limited partnerships {{are closely related to}} agency problems and transaction uncertainties. The more serious agency problems are the more intensive stage financing will be. However, VCFs structured as limited companies rarely employ stage financing and there is no visible pattern shown in their stage financing arrangements. Finally, similar to the practices in developed countries, VCs in China also take human capital factors as the utmost important criteria. However, they are more demanding in project screening by imposing additional criteria. Further, VCFs under limited partnerships are more demanding and more sensitive to market growth rate and financial returns, and more concerned about public policies. These results may be explained by the weak regulatory institutions in China and the incentives provided by different governance structures. VCFs structured as limited companies are organized hierarchically. Their incentive structure is designed to discourage risk taking and responsibilities. VCFs under limited partnership are more independent in governance that their incentive structures are designed to encourage risk taking and responsibilities.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes macroeconomic {{effects of}} ex-ante information acquisition problems between lenders and borrowers in credit markets. It examines {{the ways in}} which the costs associated with the screening of privately informed heterogeneous borrowers affect contractual arrangements, efficient allocation of credit and macroeconomic fluctuations. In the first chapter, screening can be achieved by collateral requirements and credit limits. We analyze how changes in collateral availability affect aggregate investment and output dynamics through the misallocation of credit across heterogeneous investors. Groups of investors with different observable quality finance investment projects through bank loans, pledging part of their projects. Borrower risk is private information within a group, which requires financial contracts that may pool or separate borrowers with common quality. Pooling contracts offer efficient loan amounts but entail cross subsidization of high-risk borrowers, while separating contracts offer efficient loan rates but entail credit rationing of low-risk borrowers. A financial shock that reduces the collateral capacity of investors may switch the financial contracts designed for low-quality investors from pooling to separating, which increases credit rationing and reallocates credit in favor of high-quality investors. This flight to quality in bank lending reduces aggregate investment efficiency and real economic activity. In the second chapter, screening can be achieved by incurring resource costs. We build a dynamic model featuring costly screening of borrowers to examine how aggregate shocks are amplified and propagated through net-worth effects compared to a standard model of <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> costs. Costly screening is a way to economize on agency costs induced by cross subsidization, but is an agency cost itself, making investment dependent on borrower net-worth. Thus, costly screening can be an alternative to widely assumed monitoring costs in generating net-worth effects that enhance the propagation of aggregate shocks. One advantage of the screening framework is that it yields wealth effects that induce persistent dynamics especially in bad times when screening is more likely, which may create deeper and longer recessions than booms. Moreover, by yielding efficient risk pricing and quantity rationing endogenously, the screening framework constitutes an empirically plausible alternative to monitoring costs to motivate the agency costs in unsecured lending...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims at {{studying the}} fundamental challenges that shape {{the very essence}} of the European Merger Control System. In this respect, the core of the thesis relates to the rationale behind enacting a merger control mechanism in the European legal system and the goals that it is meant to achieve. While investigating these issues, the contribution’s recurrent theme gravitates around concepts such as legal certainty, effectiveness and welfare enhancement, principles which are acknowledged to be essential to the generic functioning and development of the European construction and, more particularly, to the appropriate operation of the competition and merger control policies. We have argued that the European Merger Control System embodies a dual purpose: attaining consumer and societal welfare. One has to go beyond assessing the anti-competitive effects that a merger might induce and investigate the different economy-wide effects that concentration transactions and policy approaches may have. Still, the Commission’s practice to date reveals no clear inclination to take societal welfare considerations into account while appraising concentration transactions, thus emphasizing certain conflicts between the goals set by the Treaties and the means used to achieve them. We have debated on which of the two possible methods of assessment, ex-ante or ex-post merger control serves the purpose of attaining consumer and societal welfare best. We concluded that the ex-ante method of control seems more appropriate for fulfilling the societal welfare goal and the ex-post method of control does better when talking about consumer welfare. In the current setup, the ex-ante method may be flawed, due to the limited capacity of grasping the future outlook of essential elements of the market dynamics, the uncertainty which surrounds the concept of standard of proof, the limited possibility of predicting corporate and competitive strategies, the use of assumptions and template test which base their findings on previous market behavioural patterns. The ex-ante method is designed to attain societal welfare; however, we may suggest that it may miss certain essential elements necessary for fulfilling the consumer welfare goal. These elements and features may be provided under an ex-post scheme. We proposed that a reconstruction of the merger control system would seem necessary. On conceptual grounds, we suggested a clear acknowledgment of the societal welfare goal in the Merger Control Regulation’s text and in the Commission’s appraisal process. We proposed a departure from the current approach of sole hard core (a priori) prevention towards a more complex construction entailing lighter ex-ante scrutiny combined with consistent <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring.</b> We consider that by contemplating the proposed reforms aimed at a better use of the direct effect concept, private enforcement and consistent efficiency review in an ex-post judiciary setting, the system would be more susceptible to appropriately test the attainment of its goals. Also, a proper concentration transaction follow-up procedure would alleviate the ‘legal certainty realization’ critique and the current system’s inherent prediction shortcomings would be resolved. Thus, the merger control would contribute in a more active and effective manner to the expansion of the European construction...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation: 	METHODOLOGY AND ESTIMATION OF THE WELFARE IMPACT OF ENERGY REFORMS ON HOUSEHOLDS IN AZERBAIJAN Irina Klytchnikova, Doctor of Philosophy, 2006 Dissertation {{directed}} by:	Professor Richard Just 	Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics This dissertation {{develops a}} new approach that enables policy-makers to analyze welfare gains from improvements {{in the quality of}} infrastructure services in developing countries where data are limited and supply is subject to interruptions. With the tight budgetary constraints that usually exist, {{it is important to be}} able to prioritize public sector investments on the basis of expected benefits. However, policy analysts are rarely able to measure the benefits of improving the quality of infrastructure services, even though they may yield large welfare benefits. The most frequently cited reason for failures to carry out such welfare analysis is the scarcity of data on service quality. The main contribution of this dissertation is a new model of welfare evaluation of changes in the quality of infrastructure services. This model is estimated using the existing data from household energy surveys or data from the energy sections of multi-purpose household surveys. Potential applications of this model range from ex-ante reform evaluation to <b>ex-post</b> <b>monitoring</b> of policy outcomes, which makes this approach a useful contribution to policy analysis and to the literature on welfare evaluation of quality changes in infrastructure. An application of the proposed model in the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan demonstrates how this approach can be used in welfare assessment of energy sector reforms. The planned reforms in Azerbaijan include a set of measures that will result in a significant improvement in supply reliability, accompanied by a significant increase in the prices of energy services so that they reach the cost recovery level. Currently, households in rural areas receive electricity and gas for only a few hours a day because of a severe deterioration of the energy infrastructure following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The reforms that have recently been initiated will have far-reaching poverty and distributional consequences for the country as they result in an improvement in supply reliability and an increase in energy prices. The new model of intermittent supply developed in this dissertation is based on the household production function approach and draws on previous research in the energy reliability literature. Since modern energy sources (network gas and electricity) in Azerbaijan are cleaner and cheaper than the traditional fuels (fuel wood, etc.), households choose modern fuels whenever they are available. During outages, they rely on traditional fuels. Theoretical welfare measures are derived from a system of fuel demands that takes into account the intermittent availability of energy sources. The model is estimated with the data from the Azerbaijan Household Energy Survey, implemented by the World Bank in December 2003 /January 2004. This survey includes an innovative contingent behavior module in which the respondents were asked about their energy consumption patterns in specified reform scenarios. Estimation results strongly indicate that households in the areas with poor supply quality have a high willingness to pay for reliability improvements. However, a relatively small group of households may incur substantial welfare losses from an electricity price increase even when it is combined with a partial reliability improvement. Unlike an earlier assessment of the same reforms in Azerbaijan, analysis in this dissertation clearly shows that targeted investments in improving service reliability may be the best way to mitigate adverse welfare consequences of electricity price increases. Hence, policymakers should focus their attention on ensuring that quality improvements are a central component of power sector reforms. Survey evidence also shows that, although households may incur sizable welfare losses from indoor air pollution when they rely on traditional fuels, they do not recognize indoor air pollution as a factor contributing to the high incidence of respiratory illness among fuel wood users. Therefore, benefits may be greater if policy interventions that improve the reliability of modern energy sources are combined with an information campaign about the adverse health effects of fuel wood use...|$|E
