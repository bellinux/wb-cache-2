5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with {{a gust of}} 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8inches (46mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4inches (35mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in {{a short amount of}} time. Skewed to {{the left side of the}} transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of rain. A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7feet (5.1m), causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{length of}} the bowling crease, {{specified}} as three feet {{either side of the}} wicket in 1774, was increased to four feet each side in 1902 (i.e., eight feet eight inches in total). After the width of the wicket was increased from eight to nine inches in 1939, the bowling crease was by default reduced in length by <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> on each side.|$|E

25|$|To {{maintain}} top quality, berries {{are harvested}} {{at least every}} other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of stem left. Strawberries need {{to remain on the}} plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} windlass is {{made from}} an iron rod of circular section, about <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in diameter and two feet long, bent to make an L-shape with legs of slightly different length. The shorter leg is called the handle, and the longer leg is called the arm. Welded {{to the end of}} the arm is a square, sometimes tapered, socket of the correct size to fit onto the spindle protruding from lock winding gear.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{effects may}} often be {{dependent}} on the environment. Such interactions are known as G×E interactions, in which {{the effects of a}} gene allele differ across different environments. Simple examples would include situations where a gene multiplies the effect of an environment: perhaps adding 1inch to height in high nutrient environments, but only <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> to height in low-nutrient environments. This is seen in different slopes of response to an environment for different genotypes.|$|E

25|$|V. {{squamosa}} {{is typically}} about <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> long and distinguishable by its black body and yellow striping pattern over its entire body. This species has clear wings and a hairless body. While the males and workers resemble other yellowjackets, the queen {{has a unique}} appearance. She is significantly larger than the males and workers and is more orange in color. In addition, both V. squamosa and the V. sulphurea have two stripes on their scuta, which differentiates them from other species.|$|E
25|$|The {{figures of}} the wayang are also present in the {{paintings}} of that time, for example, the roof murals of the courtroom in Klungkung, Bali. They are still present in traditional Balinese painting today. The figures are painted, flat woodcarvings (a maximum of 5 to 15mm thick—barely <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch)</b> with movable arms. The head is solidly attached to the body. Wayang klitik {{can be used to}} perform puppet plays either during the day or at night. This type of wayang is relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|Desirable actions such as enrolling {{children}} in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families {{to stay at home}} rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} soft {{conversion}} {{was within the}} construction products industry (metricated 1969 and 1972) where certain products continue to be produced to with reference to Imperial trade names but made using metric dimensions in the factory; for example, a 13mm thick plasterboard is still often called 'half-inch', even though the measurement is rounded to a convenient metric size and so is now only approximately <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> thick. The construction industry itself (which included civil engineering projects) {{was one of the}} leaders in the metrication programme, having drawn up a detailed plan in 1967 and completing the phase-over by the end 1972.|$|E
25|$|Some wine experts {{debate the}} {{importance}} of humidity for proper wine storage. In the Wine Spectator, writer Matt Kramer cites a French study which claimed that the relative humidity within a bottle is maintained at 100% regardless of the closure used or {{the orientation of the}} bottle. However, Alexis Lichine contends that low humidity can still be detrimental to premium wine quality due to the risk of the cork drying out. As a way of maintaining optimal humidity, Lichine recommends spreading <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of gravel {{on the floor of a}} wine cellar and periodically sprinkling it with some water.|$|E
25|$|It was {{cut into}} three {{sections}} on 10February1908 by Asscher Brothers of Amsterdam and eventually into nine large stones {{and a number}} of smaller ones. At the time, technology had not yet evolved to guarantee the quality of modern standards, and cutting the diamond was difficult and risky. To enable Asscher to cleave the diamond in one blow an incision <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (1.27cm) deep was made. Then a sharp knife was placed in the incision and the diamond was split clean in two with a piece of steel along one of four possible cleavage planes. The Cullinan split through a defective spot which was shared in both halves of the diamond.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} {{claimed a}} reported 1,335 lives and injured 199; {{although it is}} known that more perished than the official records show. The seven barangays that existed on the island previous to the eruption were completely wiped out. Post mortem examination of the victims seemed to show that practically all had died of scalding by hot steam or hot mud, or both. The devastating effects of the blast reached the west shore of the lake where a number of villages were also destroyed. Cattle to the number of 702 were killed and 543 nipa houses destroyed. Crops suffered from the deposit of ashes that fell to a depth of almost <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in places near the shore of the lake.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} {{skew bridge}} built {{to carry the}} Haggerleazes branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway over the River Gaunless in County Durham proved too difficult for the original contractors, Thomas Worth and John Batie, who, after piling the foundations for the abutments and laying the lower courses of masonry, abandoned the work. The contract was re-let to James Wilson of Pontefract on 28 May 1830 for £420, an increase of £93 over the original tender. As the principles were not completely understood, the work continued to prove difficult and its imminent collapse was solemnly predicted {{right up until the}} time, {{a few days before the}} opening of the branch, the centring was removed and the crown of the arch settled by less than <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (13mm).|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 1809, Baker and Tartar chased a Danish {{privateer}} sloop near Felixberg on {{the coast}} of Courland. The sloop was armed with two 12-pounders on slides and two long 4-pounders, and carried a crew of 24. Her crew ran her ashore and then left her, taking their muskets up behind some sand hills where some local civilians joined them. Baker, concerned that the schooner might harm British trade, sent in his boats to bring her out or destroy her. The British cutting out party boarded the privateer, without loss despite the small arms fire from the beach, got her off the shore, and turned her guns on the beach. While the boarding party was securing the vessel, one of the men fortunately discovered a lighted candle set in a powder cartridge in the magazine and extinguished it when it had only a <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> to burn. The privateer's magazine contained about a hundredweight of powder; had it exploded it would have killed the boarding party. The prize crew then brought the sloop off. The privateer was probably Felix.|$|E
