After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into <b>erasers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber <b>erasers</b> into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E
25|$|In {{a related}} work, his Erased de Kooning Drawing of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by {{abstract}} expressionist artist Willem de Kooning. Perhaps surprisingly, De Kooning was sympathetic to Rauschenberg's aims and implicitly endorsed this experiment {{by providing the}} younger artist {{with one of his}} own drawings which was very densely worked, taking 2 months and many <b>erasers</b> for Rauschenberg to (incompletely) erase.|$|E

"The quantum <b>eraser</b> {{effect of}} Scully and Drühl {{dramatically}} underscores {{the difference between}} our classical conceptions of time and how quantum processes can unfold in time. Such eyebrow-raising features of time in quantum mechanics have been.[...] described ‘as {{one of the most}} intriguing effects in quantum mechanics’.[...] The quantum <b>eraser</b> concept has been studied and extended in many different experiments and scenarios, for example, the entanglement quantum <b>eraser,</b> the kaon quantum <b>eraser,</b> and the use of quantum <b>eraser</b> entanglement to improve microscopic resolution." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Eraser</b> tool erases content {{based on}} the active layer. If the user is on the text layer, then any text across which the tool is dragged will be erased. The <b>eraser</b> will convert the pixels to transparent, unless the {{background}} layer is selected. The size and style of the <b>eraser</b> can be selected in the options bar. This tool is unique in that it can {{take the form of}} the paintbrush and pencil tools. In addition to the straight <b>eraser</b> tool, there are two more available options - background <b>eraser</b> and magic <b>eraser.</b> The background <b>eraser</b> deletes any part of the image that is on the edge of an object. This tool is often used to extract objects from the background. The magic <b>eraser</b> tool deletes based on similar colored pixels. It is very similar to the magic wand tool. This tool is ideal for deleting areas with the same color or tone that contrasts {{with the rest of the}} image.|$|R
25|$|Searle then supposes {{that he is}} in {{a closed}} room and has a book with an English version of the {{computer}} program, along with sufficient paper, pencils, <b>erasers,</b> and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.|$|E
25|$|Working in California in the 1960s, Vija Celmins' early work, {{generally}} in photorealistic painting and pop-inspired sculpture, was representational. She recreated commonplace {{objects such as}} TVs, lamps, pencils, <b>erasers,</b> and the painted monochrome reproductions of photographs. A common underlying theme in the paintings was violence or conflict, such as war planes, handguns and riot imagery. A retrospective of the 1964–1966 work was organized by the Menil Collection {{in cooperation with the}} Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2010. She has cited Malcolm Morley and Jasper Johns as influences in this period.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} this period, from 1976 to 1983, Celmins also {{returned}} to sculpture in a way that incorporated her interest in photorealism. She produced a series of bronze cast, acrylic painted stones, exact replicas of individual stones she found near her cottage in Sag Harbor, with eleven examples held at the MoMA (see photos). By 1981, she abandoned the pencil completely, and {{returned to}} painting, from this point forward working also with woodcuts and printing, and substantially in charcoal {{with a wide variety of}} <b>erasers</b> - often exploring negative space, selectively removing darkness from images, and achieving subtle control of grey tones.|$|E

2500|$|The one-room school {{building}} {{was only about}} thirty by fifty feet and rested on stone pillars about four {{feet off the ground}} at the front entrance. [...] Inside a chalk-board stretched across the back wall, and a pot-bellied stove stood {{near the center of the}} room. [...] A water bucket, a tin dipper, six <b>erasers,</b> and a broom completed the educational supplies.|$|E
2500|$|Some of IBM's {{advances}} {{were later}} adopted in less expensive machines from competitors. [...] For example, Smith-Corona electric typewriters introduced in 1973 switched to interchangeable Coronamatic (SCM-patented) ribbon cartridges, including fabric, film, erasing, and two-color versions. At {{about the same}} time, the advent of photocopying meant that carbon copies and <b>erasers</b> were less and less necessary; only the original need be typed, and photocopies made from it.|$|E
2500|$|Ballpoint pens with [...] "erasable ink" [...] were {{pioneered by}} the Paper Mate pen company. The ink {{formulas}} of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent. Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning {{they can also}} write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with <b>erasers,</b> any eraser will suffice.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Erasermate pen was a refillable {{ballpoint pen}} {{fitted with a}} replaceable <b>eraser.</b> A disposable version called Erasermate 2 was subsequently introduced, with an appearance similar to the non-erasable Write Bros. stick pen, except for a slightly larger girth, {{and of course the}} black <b>eraser,</b> affixed to the pen's cap. The <b>eraser,</b> not unlike that of a standard no. 2 pencil, was about 5 mm in diameter, and 10 mm in length. The <b>eraser</b> was held in place by the force exerted by the cylindrical abscess of the pen cap. The <b>eraser</b> could be removed, but replacing it required more effort. Erasermates come in blue, black and red ink, with the pen's exterior often matching the color of its ink.|$|R

In March 2016, Guerilla Toss released their album <b>Eraser</b> Stargazer through DFA Records. <b>Eraser</b> Stargazer was recorded during the winter of 2015 in Livingston, NY. Guerilla Toss released two more recordings in 2016. One of them was a remix EP of <b>Eraser</b> Stargazer by Giant Claw—who did the artwork for <b>Eraser</b> Stargazer, Live in Nashville, and Gay Disco—titled Giant Claw vs. Guerilla Toss, which was released in May 2016 through DFA Records. The other release was their first live album, Live in Nashville, which was recorded at The End in Nashville, TN on March 11, 2016 during the <b>Eraser</b> Stargazer tour. The album was released in June 2016 on vinyl via Feeding Tube Records and digitally via DFA Records.|$|R

Also, {{a portrait of}} Lee made up of 4,877 Singapore flag <b>erasers</b> was unveiled by Lee Suan Yew, Lee's brother, at The Red Box. In the same month, Singapore singer-songwriter Reuby released a song he wrote about Lee, [...] "Legendary", dedicating it to him.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 the Correcting Selectric II was announced. It {{added an}} {{internal}} correction feature to the Selectric II, intended {{to eliminate the}} need for typists to use cover-up tape, [...] "white-out" [...] correction fluid, or typewriter <b>erasers.</b> The carriage on this machine held both the main typing ribbon cartridge and two small spools for a correction ribbon. A new ribbon type, the Correctable Film ribbon, was introduced at the same time. This produced typing quality equal to the carbon film ribbon, but with a pigment designed to be easily removable from paper.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also used}} as an abrasive, {{especially}} in polishes, pencil <b>erasers,</b> cosmetic exfoliants, {{and the production of}} stone-washed jeans. [...] "Pumice stones" [...] are often used in beauty salons during the pedicure process to remove dry and excess skin {{from the bottom of the}} foot as well as calluses. It was also used in ancient Greek and Roman times to remove excess hair. Finely ground pumice is added to some toothpastes and heavy-duty hand cleaners (such as Lava soap) as a mild abrasive. Pumice {{is also used}} as a growing substrate for growing horticultural crops. Some brands of chinchilla dust bath are made of powdered pumice.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II {{significant}} uses included {{door and}} window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, matting, flooring and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the automotive industry. The use of rubber in car tires (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed {{a significant amount}} of rubber. [...] Gloves (medical, household and industrial) and toy balloons were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as adhesives in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make rubber bands and pencil <b>erasers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Reveille V (August 29, 1984 – June 25, 1999) Reveille V was a {{descendant}} of a championship purebred Rough Collie. She was chosen to be mascot {{from a pool of}} 2000 puppies because of her lineage and her marking. In December 1984, Reveille V was brought to the Texas A campus, and her first official appearance as mascot came at a basketball game on January 11, 1985. During her tenure, she attended every Texas A football game with one exception. [...] During the 1987 corps trip, TCU officials refused to allow the Aggie mascot into the TCU stadium citing a regulation disallowing live mascots at home games. [...] She attended many home basketball, baseball and volleyball games. A mischievous dog, Reveille V often stole <b>erasers</b> from chalkboards during class.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eraser</b> Company was {{incorporated}} in 1935 Until the 1940s, the Rush <b>eraser</b> {{was the only}} product manufactured by The <b>Eraser</b> Company. It was used for typing and drafting corrections on printed material. Expansion followed the company's discovery that the product would also remove film insulation from magnet wires. Since then, the company developed its capabilities beyond magnet wire stripping into cable, wire and tube processing (stripping, feeding, cutting, twisting, measuring, dereeling) equipment, and infrared heating devices.|$|R

2500|$|A {{variation}} {{known as}} [...] "Correcting Selectrics" [...] introduced a correction feature, where a sticky tape {{in front of}} the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard <b>erasers</b> that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable [...] "pitch" [...] so that the typewriter could be switched between pica type (10 characters per inch) and elite type (12 per inch), even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were monospaced—each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital [...] "W" [...] to a period. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of proportional spacing, called the IBM Executive, proportional spacing was not provided with the Selectric typewriter or its successors the Selectric II and Selectric III.|$|E
2500|$|Metafont, not {{strictly}} part of TeX, is a font description system {{which allows the}} designer to describe characters algorithmically. It uses Bézier curves in a fairly standard way to generate the actual characters to be displayed, but Knuth devotes substantial attention to the rasterizing problem on bitmapped displays. Another thesis, by John Hobby, further explores this problem of digitizing [...] "brush trajectories". This term derives {{from the fact that}} Metafont describes characters as having been drawn by abstract brushes (and <b>erasers).</b> It is commonly believed that TeX is based on bitmap fonts but, in fact, these programs [...] "know" [...] nothing about the fonts that they are using other than their dimensions. It {{is the responsibility of the}} device driver to appropriately handle fonts of other types, including PostScript Type 1 and TrueType. Computer Modern (commonly known as [...] "the TeX font") is freely available in Type 1 format, as are the AMS math fonts. Users of TeX systems that output directly to PDF, such as pdfTeX, XeTeX, or LuaTeX, generally never use Metafont output at all.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{structure}} but not fluorescent, germicidal lamps {{depend on}} the property that spectrum of 254nm kills most germs. Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of fused quartz that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize oxygen to ozone. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage {{and should not be}} used or observed without eye and skin protection. Besides their uses to kill germs and create ozone, they are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters {{in the same way as}} blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some EPROM <b>erasers.</b> Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning germicidal), rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, [...] diameter, [...] long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).|$|E
25|$|Typewriter <b>eraser</b> brushes were {{necessary}} for clearing <b>eraser</b> crumbs and paper dust, {{and using the}} brush properly was {{an important element of}} typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.|$|R
