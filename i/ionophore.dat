25|$|To {{initiate}} parthenogenesis {{of swine}} oocytes, various methods exist to induce an artificial activation that mimics sperm entry, such as calcium <b>ionophore</b> treatment, microinjection of calcium ions, or electrical stimulation. Treatment with cycloheximide, a non-specific protein synthesis inhibitor, enhances parthenote development in swine presumably by continual inhibition of MPF/cyclin B. As meiosis proceeds, extrusion {{of the second}} polar is blocked by exposure to cytochalasin B. This treatment results in a diploid (2 maternal genomes) parthenote Parthenotes can be surgically transferred to a recipient oviduct for further development, but will succumb to developmental failure after ≈30 days of gestation. The swine parthenote placentae often appears hypo-vascular: see free image (Figure 1) in linked reference.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{basis for}} the postulated role of intrinsic <b>ionophores</b> in mitochondrial ion transport and energy coupling is summarized. Intrinsic <b>ionophores</b> appear to be linked to, or contained within, specific ionophoroproteins localized in the inner membrane, and the isolation of these <b>ionophores</b> requires their release from the ionophoroproteins. At least ten different species of <b>ionophores</b> have been isolated from the mitochondrion, five {{of which have been}} wholly or in part chemically identified. Intrinsic <b>ionophores</b> have been implicated in the activation of inorganic phosphate in ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, and in the contol of the coupling modes.

This practice {{contributes to the}} rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including MRSA. The most common form of antibiotics are called <b>ionophores.</b> <b>Ionophores</b> were originally developed as coccidiostats for poultry and prevent coccidiosis in cattle as well. <b>Ionophores</b> work by improving both feed efficiency and growth rate and lower methane production as one result. <b>Ionophores</b> have not been shown to create antibiotic-resistant MRSA.|$|R
40|$|Calcium <b>ionophores</b> cause {{polyclonal}} {{proliferation of}} lymphocytes from man, rabbit and pig, {{but are not}} mitogenic for mouse T or B lymphocytes. We show here that two Ca 2 + <b>ionophores</b> (A 23187 and ionomycin) nonetheless activate a substantial proportion of mouse B lymphocytes at concentrations which effectively inhibit DNA synthesis induced by conventional mitogens, such as anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. Activation of B cells was detected by (i) increased expression of Ia antigen after 24 hr culture with <b>ionophores,</b> and (ii) the accelerated onset of DNA synthesis in B cells primed with <b>ionophores</b> for 24 hr, washed and then rechallenged with anti-Ig. Unlike anti-Ig, the <b>ionophores</b> did not induce either the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, or RNA synthesis in B cells. Finally, activation of B cells by <b>ionophores</b> is highly susceptible to inhibition by cyclosporine. These results therefore suggest that elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + induced by these <b>ionophores</b> is sufficient to cause B cells to leave Go, but not to enter the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Clearly, additional signals are required for B cells to progress further into cycle and eventually become committed to DNA synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Ion-selective {{electrodes}} (ISEs) {{have been}} developed that incorporate a novel supramolecular class of <b>ionophores</b> called molecular asterisks. These <b>ionophores</b> are constructed with "arms" of repeating phenylene sulfide units that radiate outward from a core of either benzene or coronene. The flexibility of the arms, {{as well as the}} open exterior geometry and multiple soft Lewis base functionalities make these molecules potential candidates as <b>ionophores</b> for ISEs particularly for soft Lewis acids like transition metals. Studies with molecular asterisk-based ISEs show that these <b>ionophores</b> display a high selectivity relative to ion-exchanging <b>ionophores</b> toward Ag+ over a number of other cations. According to theoretical prediction, these ISEs demonstrate a super-Nernstian region of response toward silver from 10 - 6 to 10 - 5 M with a Nernstian response above 10 - 5 M, when primary ion is absent from the internal filling solution. Additionally, it was determined that both the nature of the core entity and the length (or generation) of the arms play a role in governing selectivity of these <b>ionophores.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The <b>ionophores</b> alone at concentrations from 1 nM to 20 muM did not stimulate bone resorption, nor did they potentiate bone resorption stimulated by submaximal concentrations of PTH after either brief (15 - 60 min) or extended (1 - 3 day) exposure to the <b>ionophores.</b> Unexpectedly, {{we found that the}} <b>ionophores</b> inhibit in a dose-dependent manner bone resorption stimulated by PTH and a wide variety of other compounds (prostaglandin E 2, 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyl-xanthine, and phorbol myristate acetate). This inhibition was not due to irreversible damage to the bones by the <b>ionophores,</b> because the inhibition was reversible even after 24 h of treatment. Inhibition of bone resorption by the <b>ionophores</b> was observed in media of both high and low calcium concentration, indicating that the inhibition was not due to a critical extracellular calcium concentration. Inhibition by the <b>ionophores</b> differs qualitatively in several ways from that produced by calcitonin, a natural inhibitor of bone resorption. Furthermore, A 23187 at 1. 0 mug/ml had no effect on the accumulation of cyclic AMP in the medium of either control, PTH- or calcitonin treated calvaria. We conclude that the <b>ionophores</b> A 23187 or X 537 A do not stimulate bone resorption nor potentiate the effects of stimulators of bone resorption; instead they are inhibitors of bone resorption stimulated by a wide variety of compounds...|$|R
