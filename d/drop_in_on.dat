25|$|By May 1916, Böhme {{was already}} a veteran of aerial warfare; he had flown {{numerous}} barrage, defensive patrols and bombing missions. He was promoted to Leutnant der Reserve (lieutenant of reserves) in this same month. On 20 May, he wangled an aircraft ride to <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the director of Hubertus Mills, to help celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary. On this trip, he met the director's eldest daughter and began a correspondence with her that led to their engagement in October 1917. Their letters {{became the basis for}} a posthumous book, Briefe eines deutschen Kampffliegers an ein junges Mädchen (Letters of a German Combat Pilot to a Young Girl), published in 1930.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the bicycle}} and the down-to-earth manners suggest a simple life style, the Dutch royal {{court of the}} 1950s and 1960s was still a splendid affair with chamberlains in {{magnificent}} uniforms, gilded state coaches, visits to towns in open carriages and lavish entertaining in the huge palaces. At {{the same time the}} queen began visiting the citizens of the nearby towns and, unannounced, would <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> social institutions and schools. Her refreshingly straightforward manner and talk made her a powerful public speaker. On the international stage, Queen Juliana was particularly interested in the problems of developing countries, the refugee problem, and had a very special interest in child welfare, particularly in the developing countries.|$|E
25|$|The band first hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, {{formerly}} of Trapeze. According to Ian Paice, Glover {{had told him}} and Lord {{a few months before}} his official resignation that he wanted to leave the band, so they had already started to <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece band, with Hughes as both bassist and lead vocalist. According to Hughes, he was persuaded to join under the guise that the band would be bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers had just started Bad Company. Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in Northeast England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.|$|E

500|$|... "The series, especially, {{has shown}} that it’s willing to stretch some of these {{emotional}} or philosophical moments out, to really {{get the most out}} of the actors’ performances and give them scenes where they can expand their characters beyond what’s on the page. In a finale that could have felt too scattered—we <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> every major character of the season who’s still alive—that sense that cooler heads would rather prevent greater war but were thwarted by hotter, younger heads was what united the story".|$|E
