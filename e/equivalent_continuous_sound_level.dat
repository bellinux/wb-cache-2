As the speed increases, aerodynamic noise becomes predominant and begins {{to be the main}} noise source at a certain high speed. As a result, aerodynamic noise has to be focused on when designing new high-speed trains. In order to perform the aerodynamic noise optimization, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (SPL) has been used in the present paper, which could take all of the far field observation probes into consideration. The Non-Linear Acoustics Solver (NLAS) approach has been utilized for acoustic calculation. With the use of Kriging surrogate model, a multi-objective optimization of the streamlined shape of high-speed trains has been performed, which takes the noise level in the far field and the drag of the whole train as the objectives. To efficiently construct the Kriging model, the cross validation approach has been adopted.

Outdoor and indoor noise levels were simultaneously recorded during one week inside and outside each child's bedroom {{and in the other}} room where each child spent most of his or her time, called ''the main room''. Associations between equivalent noise levels and familial or environmental characteristics were explored. The recorded <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> (LAeq) were prone to large variability between dwellings regardless of the measurement location and time of day. Factors linked to outdoor noise level differed from those associated with indoor noise level. Indoor noise levels were associated with the number of children present and noise sources present in the dwelling, hereas outdoor LAeq depended significantly on the socio-economic status (SES) of the household. An association was found between the type of view from the window and outdoor LAeq, but no significant association was observed between view from the window and indoor LAeq. These results support a complex link between noise exposure and the characteristics of the dwelling and of the family, and highlight the contribution of the indoor noise sources to the ambient noise level. Considering the observed acoustic levels and their variability, the sensitivity of children to noise, and the length of time they spend at home, research efforts are needed to better quantify noise exposure at home if the actual burden of noise on child health is to be identified...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate acoustical parameters of the space via computer simulation program and examine the effect of architectural features of the space namely; central atrium, glass dome and the existing material applications. Considering the relationship between the users’ noise annoyance and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (Leq) is also intended in this study. The research techniques are computer simulations, noise measurements and questionnaires. Acoustical parameters; reverberation time (RT), early decay time (EDT), sound transmission index (STI) and <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (Leq) values are obtained by simulations and measurements. Questionnaires are used for understanding the noise annoyance and auditory perception of the users. The results show that the noise annoyance ratings correlate well with the Leq variances.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} has been to measure the <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> {{pressure}} <b>level,</b> Leq, close to crossings and roundabouts. The measurement results have been compared with calculations according to the Nord 2000 method. The main aim {{can be divided into}} three parts: - To come up with a method on how to measure traffic noise close to crossings and roundabouts and how to compare the measurements with the calculation model - To find out if there is {{a significant difference between the}} calculation model and reality - If there is,what is this difference due to and how does it look. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level,</b> Leq, has been measured in 1 / 3 -octave bands at three crossings and three roundabouts in the city Borås, Sweden. Measurements have been performed on the traffic passing through these crossings/roundabouts. Three different vehicle categories have been used: cars, dual-axle heavy vehicles and milti-axle heavy vehicles. Four microphones have been placed along the connecting roads at the approximate distances 10, 43, 76 and 109 m, counted from the crossing/roundabout. The perpendicular distance from the microphone to the road varies due to the existing terrain, but the height of the microphone positions were always set to 3 m above the local ground. In most cases passenger cars dominated the traffic. The measurements have been compared with the calculation model Nord 2000 and the difference has been analysed. The results indicate that the measured A-weighted Leq close to crossings and roundabouts is lower than the calculated value if the speed limit is used as input in the calculation model. This is probably due to the fact that the speed in the crossing/roundabout is lower than the speed limit which was 50 km/h. When observing the difference between a position close to the crossing/roundabout and a position at a distance that is not affected by the crossing/roundabout, i. e. the traffic is free flowing; all results indicate that the A-weighted Leq is lower in the position close to the crossing/roundabout. This should be due to the fact that the speed is lower close to the crossings than at the position with free flowing traffic...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{pollution}} is {{a level of}} environmental noise which is considered as a disturbing and annoying phenomenon for human and wildlife. It {{is one of the}} environmental problems which has not been considered as harmful as the air and water pollution. Compared with other pollutants, the attempts to control noise pollution have largely been unsuccessful due to the inadequate knowledge of its effectson humans, as well as the lack of clear standards in previous years. However, with an increase of traveling vehicles, the adverse impact of increasing noise pollution on human health is progressively emerging. Hence, investigators all around the world are seeking to findnew approaches for predicting, estimating and controlling this problem and various models have been proposed. Recently, developing learning algorithms such as neural network has led to novel solutions for this challenge.

40|$|Theme: Care of the Professional VoicePoster presentation: {{abstract}} no. BS 25 INTRODUCTION: Broadcasters {{generally have}} voice quality perceived as appealing {{or better than}} average speakers(e. g. Bele, 2007). It is contended that these broadcasters may have a better control of voice production {{as a result of}} self-awareness or training (Schneider & Sataloff, 2007). Although {{it is not clear what}} exactly a better control of voice production means, it is hypothesized that it involves an easy phonation with a good resonance. This study investigated whether professional broadcasters showed a higher degree of resonatory vibration in the head and neck areas when compared with novice. METHOD: Thirty two broadcasters (17 males and 15 females, aged from 20 to 24 years) with a 3 - 4 year history of professional broadcasting training, were recruited to participate in the study. Their voice (including vowels, rhymes, a poem, and a passage) was first recorded and assessed together with the vibration signals from three accelerometer sensors placed on the thyroid, chin, and nasal bridge. Thirty seven participants (16 males and 21 females, aged from 20 to 26 years) with no experience in broadcasting (novice group) were recruited as control subjects to perform the same recording task. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: The broadcasters could speak in more than one mode (natural, broadcasting, or resounding mode), and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (Leq) of the recordings of broadcasters was significantly higher than novice group.

The objectives of the article were to monitor and to assess the existing noise levels at the selected sites. A modular precision Sound Level Meter (SLM) Type One {{was used in the}} measurements. The measurements were taken for 24 –hours in the residential area and from 6 am to 7 pm in the school area (schooling hours). The measurements were taken at an interval of ten minutes and each measurement lasted for five minutes at appropriate points in accordance with ISO 1996 - 1 : 1982, ISO 1996 - 2 : 1987 and ISO 19896 - 3 : 1987. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Continuous</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Level</b> (Leq), Sound Level exceeded 10 % of the measurement period (L 10), Sound Level exceeded 90 % of the measurement (L 90), minimum noise level (Lmin) and maximum noise level (Lmax) were measured to assist in assessing the existing noise levels at the selected sites. Results showed that the monitored noise levels in terms of Leq, in residential area ranged between 52. 1 dB(A) to 72. 7 dB (A) and in the school area ranged between 68. 2 dB(A) to 73. 7 dB(A). These levels highly exceeded the level recommended by the World Health Organization (p ≤ 0. 001). These noise levels cause sleeping disturbance, interfere with speech communication and message extraction. The main causes of such noise levels are related to transportation system, motor vehicles and traffic supported by poor urban planning. To reduce such noise levels suggestion are made for municipalities to consider protection of communities from an environmental noise {{as an integral part of}} their policy for environmental protection to create conducive environment for the society...|$|E
40|$|A-weighted <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (LeqA), {{ultrafine}} particles (UFP, particles with {{aerodynamic diameter}} < 100 nm) number concentrations, and fine particles (particles with aerodynamic diameter < 2. 5 um) mass concentrations were measured simultaneously at increasing distances from the freeways on four streets in Los Angeles, CA, {{with or without}} sound wall, from February to June 2013. Correlations among UFP number concentrations, PM 2. 5 mass concentrations and LeqA were assessed by Pearson correlation coefficient. The impacts of wind direction, traffic volume {{and the presence of}} sound wall on PM 2. 5 mass concentrations, UFP number concentrations and LeqA were also investigated. Moderate correlation(r ranges from 0. 514 to 0. 605, p< 0. 05) between LeqA and UFP number concentrations were observed under downwind conditions on all four streets. However, no correlation was found under upwind conditions. PM 2. 5 mass concentrations were correlated with UFP number concentration, but not with LeqA. The sound wall was effective at blocking noise but its ability to block particulate matters needs further investigation. It suggests that the residents and workers who live or work at the dominantly downwind side of freeway are exposed to higher UFP yet similar noise levels when comparing with the situations at the upwind side of freeway. In addition, it is feasible to use the upwind side of freeway as a control for the two common confounders, particulate matters and noise, in epidemiological and occupational exposure studies. Data generated in this study may be used to study the independent and synergistic health impacts of noise and particulate matters near freeways, especially from an occupational exposure perspective for near roadside workers such as traffic directing personnel, gas station personnel and toll station workers...|$|E
40|$|This guide {{recommends}} {{measurement techniques}} and methods which will enable a characterisa-tion {{of the noise}} immission from a wind turbine {{or a group of}} wind turbines at a noise receptor location. It complements a previous document dealing with the measurement of the source strength of a wind turbine, Reference []. In several countries standards or guidelines on how to measure noise immission from industrial sources have been implemented. However, it is, in general, not possible to apply the procedures specified in these documents to wind turbine acoustic measurements since they must be carried out in windy conditions outside the scope of the standards dealing with noise from industrial plants. This guide provides several practical and reliable methods for determining wind turbine noise immission: three methods for <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> A-weighted <b>sound</b> pressure <b>levels</b> and one method for A-weighted percentiles.

40|$|Objectives We {{examined}} {{to what degree}} annoyance ratings to noise, air pollution and other common environmental factors in the home environment could be considered to mirror personality disposition in terms of habitual anxiety level and, when appropriate, objectively modeled noise and nitrogen emission (NOx). Methods A trait anxiety scale was introduced in a cross-sectional public health survey with 2, 856 respondents. Of these, 705 had self-reported asthma and the rest constituted gender-matched referents. Annoyance to ten specific factors in the residential environment, mainly focusing on source-specific noise and air pollution, was assessed on a six-point likert scale. A-weighted energy <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> during a full day (24 h; L (Aeq, 24)) as well as annual average NOx levels (mu g/m(3)) at the residential address were modeled with high resolution, using a road data base and a detailed emission data base for NOx. Results The two most prevalent complaints were annoyance to traffic noise and sounds from neighbors, which was reported by about 8 % of the participants. Unadjusted logistic regression analyses using the continuous trait anxiety score as a predictor showed positive associations with ratings of annoyance from total traffic noise, sounds from neighbors, sound from ventilation, exhaust fumes from traffic, sounds from other installations, and vibrations from traffic (ORs between 1. 37 and 2. 14). Modeled noise and NOx exposure were positively related with annoyance to traffic noise and exhaust fumes, respectively. Adjustment of the trait anxiety scores for other individual characteristics and potential determinants did not change the overall pattern of results. Conclusion Trait anxiety scores were often mirrored in ratings of annoyance, which suggests caution when using annoyance reports either as a surrogate measure for environmental exposure on the individual-level in epidemiologic studies or when studying the moderating effects of annoyance on health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurements}} of environmental noise {{level in the}} fishing training ship Kagoshima-maru {{have not yet been}} put into practical use. Therefore, to catch hold of the outline of noise level, the measurement of <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> A-weighted <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> by a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meter at underway of Kagoshima-maru was carried out. The highest environmental noise level was measured 100 dB near the main engine, and in the engine room, 95 dB, in the engine control room, 75 dB, respectively. The lowest level was 50 dB in the chart room. The crew's quarter, the highest noise level in the accommodation space, was 64 - 69 dB. The cadet's quarter was influenced considerably by the noise of the bow-thruster and the line-hauler, the noise level under fishing tuna-long-line was about 4 dB higher than the underway condition. ターボチャージャーを備えた中速ギヤードディーゼルを主機関とするかごしま丸は,他船と同様に主機近くにおける騒音レベルが 100 dBを越え,機関室内全て約 95 dB以上であった。 1 日 8 時間労働で 85 dBを聴力障害が起こる限界とされており,ここに勤務する機関部員は当然そのことに留意する必要がある。しかし機関制御室は 75 dB程度であり聴力障害の恐れは少ない。一方,海図室は船内で最も低い 50 dBを示した。これは陸上における静かな事務所に相当し,チャートワークを行うには最適である。居住区は騒音レベルが最も高かった部員室においても 64 ~ 69 dBの間にあり,外航労務協会などの 3, 000 ~ 20, 000 G/Tの船舶の騒音レベル設計目標を下回った。学生室の騒音レベルは常用航走時 57 ~ 67 dB,鮪操業時 62 ~ 69 dBの間にあり,各学生室は操業時に平均 4 dB高くなった。特に常用航走時,学生室 11 号と学生室 2 号では 10 dBの差がみられた。 10 dB大きくなると感覚的に 2 倍の大きさに聞こえるといわれている。乗船に不慣れな学生にとって,陸上生活から船上生活へと急激な環境変化への順応に際し,この騒音レベルの違いが一部神経質な学生にとって不利な条件となる可能性がある。かごしま丸の船内環境騒音レベル分布は,騒音源である機関室を中心として船尾側のレベルは船首側のレベルより高い傾向にあった。隔壁が存在することによる機関室騒音の減衰は,周波数帯域により異なり,約 2 kHzまで減衰率は急激に増大するが, 3 kHzを超えるとほぼ一定値となる傾向にあった...|$|R
40|$|It is {{observed}} {{that in order}} to characterize the environmental noise in a site, during diurnal reference time (6 - 22 hr) or nocturnal reference time (22 - 6 hr), relatively at preset time window, observation period, a single value of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>continuous</b> A-weighted <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> LA,eq is used. This value is determined by integrating and averaging the squared A-weighted sound pressure of fluctuating noise during the measurement time interval, in which there are representative values of acoustic event pressure levels: so it is very important accurately to select the suitable integration time. Such matter are highly relevant to the area of measuring environmental noise and this paper aims to present a statistical method, for determining the minimum measurement time interval for an accurate estimation of LAeq. The proposed algorithm, based on CPER bootstrap method, has been experimentally verified with real data obtained from road traffic noise measurement and it showed a very good stability. The methodology is suitable for upgrading the level meter firmware in order to have the real time information on the measurand uncertainty estimation and on the minimum measurement time interval...|$|R
