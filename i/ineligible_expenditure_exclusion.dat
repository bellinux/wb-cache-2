Among them Hall’s model suggests that consumption expenditures follow random walk. In this study Hall’s Rational Expectations-Life Cycle Permanent Income hypothesis was tested for food-drink expenditures, semi durable and nondurable consumption goods expenditures and service expenditures which are subitems of private final consumption <b>expenditures.</b> <b>Exclusion</b> Test results rejected the RE-LCPI hypothesis for Turkish economy.

The introductory part of the thesis contains {{a brief description of}} Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness and its implementation into targets of regional politics. The following parts are dedicated to the public procurement in general and then in a specific envoronment of Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness. The fundamental part of the thesis illustrates process of supervision of the public contracts (ex-ante and ex-post), results of the checks and most frequent mistakes revealed during checks with a brief analysis of their causes and suggested steps to eliminate them in future. Next part of this thesis is aimed at <b>ineligible</b> <b>expenditures</b> caused by mistakes in public procurements. The final part contains a closer look at area of public procurement in the frame of current programming period 2014 and 2020...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 10625 This thesis {{set out to}} {{investigate}} whether ageing is a surrogate measure for proximity {{to death in the}} older population when estimating medication expenditures. The medication expenditures used were the ingredient cost of medications for the public health system. Concerns about the long term sustainability of health care expenditures and in particular prescribing expenditures has become an important policy issue in most developed countries. Previous studies suggest that proximity to death (PTD) has a significant effect on total health care <b>expenditures,</b> with its <b>exclusion</b> leading to an overestimation of likely growth.

40|$|Fundamental {{tax reform}} would do far {{more damage to}} {{charities}} than the obvious repeal of the deduction for charitable contributions. Over the decades, charities have quietly garnered billions {{of dollars worth of}} indirect benefits. For example, the largest tax <b>expenditure</b> - the <b>exclusion</b> from workers 2 ̆ 7 income of employer-provided health insurance - has fattened nonprofit hospitals, and the new tuition tax credits promise to spur tuition inflation. Tax reform presents an opportunity to eliminate tax subsidies and enact any desired direct expenditures for specific public goods and activities. However, converting tax expenditures to direct outlays would likely take the form of vouchers, which could be used with any type of provider - nonprofit, government, or for-profit. From a public finance perspective, the concept of a charitable sector could largely become an historical relic...|$|R
40|$|Background Concerns {{about the}} long term {{sustainability}} of health care expenditures and in particular prescribing expenditures has become an important policy issue in most developed countries. Previous studies suggest that proximity to death (PTD) has {{a significant effect on}} total health care <b>expenditures,</b> with its <b>exclusion</b> leading to an overestimation of likely growth. There are limited studies of pharmaceutical expenditures taking PTD into account. Objective This paper presents an empirical analysis of public medication expenditure on older individuals in New Zealand (NZ). The aim of the study is to examine the individual effects of age and proximity to death (PTD) using individual level data. Methods This study uses individual level dispensing data from 2008 / 2009 covering the whole population of medication users age 70 years or more and resident in New Zealand. A case control methodology is used to examine individual cost and medication use for a 12 month period for decedents (cases) an...|$|R
40|$|Efforts by Australian {{governments to}} restructure the welfare state since the 1990 s have {{included}} {{the development of a}} plethora of performance indicators tied to the outputs of social programs. Performance measures can be misleading because they tend to be limited in their assessments to the target group. Social outcomes generated by public expenditure that are not related to the role and tasks of the agency services, tend not to be measured or are under reported. For example, the performance of state sponsored literacy programs can be measured by how well children learn in schools but the flow on effects of a more literate community and the social and economic implications thereof are rarely examined. Moreover, social welfare performance indicators do not consider the equity implications of gross and net public expenditure. That is, governments may spend money in a given area to achieve social outcomes but also tax the same community in ways which moderate the effectiveness of social programs. This paper reports on a project that aims to deploy geographical information systems (GIS) to investigate these processes. The equity implications of gross and net public expenditure are considered in a discussion of the development of a process to map the impact of public <b>expenditure</b> on social <b>exclusion.</b> Lou Wilson, John Spoehr and Sonia Marti...|$|R
40|$|Serious {{efforts to}} forge a budget {{agreement}} in 2013 will {{increase the likelihood that}} lawmakers will seek changes to tax provisions in order to raise revenue. The exclusion of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums and medical benefits from taxable income could be a target, since this exclusion reduced federal tax revenues by $ 268 billion in 2011 alone [...] by far the largest federal tax <b>expenditure.</b> Moreover, the <b>exclusion</b> disproportionately subsidizes those with higher incomes. Yet proposals to change the tax exclusion of employer-sponsored insurance have provoked intense debate. This brief provides estimates of the revenue potential and distributional consequences of a new policy option. The policy analyzed here would impose a cap, or dollar limit, on the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored health coverage excluded from income and payroll taxes. The cap would be set at the 75 th percentile of the sum of premiums and other medical benefits, and would be indexed, or allowed to grow over time, by a five-year average of the rate of GDP growth. The goal in choosing the level and indexing for the cap was to select a policy that would make a significant contribution to debt reduction, but would be distributionally equitable. This brief answers four critical questions related to the 75 th percentile cap on the exclusion of premium and medical benefits: What are the estimated new tax revenues related to this policy in 2014 and 2014 [...] 2023 ? How many people would pay higher taxes in each quintile of income? How much would taxes increase for those paying higher taxes? What are the characteristics of employers whose employees are likely to pay higher taxes? The evidence shows that the 75 th percentile tax cap would produce $ 264. 0 billion in new income and payroll tax revenues over the coming decade while still preserving 93 percent of the tax subsidies available under the current policy. Across all tax units, 15. 7 percent would pay higher taxes under the 75 th percentile cap on the exclusion of premium and medical benefits in 2014, with this share increasing to 20. 0 percent by 2023. Although tax units across the entire income distribution would experience some tax increases, these increases are considerably smaller and less prevalent at lower income levels. The policy change would affect public-sector employees {{to a greater extent than}} private-sector employees. In addition, among private-sector employees, those in the financial services/real estate or professional services industries would be affected to a greater extent, while employees in other industries such as the retail industry, would be affected to a lesser extent. Establishments with a union presence have only a modestly higher share of employees with premiums above the 75 th percentile premium, compared to the average across all establishments...|$|R
