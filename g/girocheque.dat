50|$|This {{issue was}} {{rectified}} in the 1978 relaunch. The term <b>girocheque</b> was dropped {{in favour of}} the more neutral cheque. Nevertheless the media continued to refer to Girocheques as Giros.|$|E
5000|$|It also {{proposed}} that the government itself should start using the Giro by making social security payments through the service. As most people still did not have bank accounts, {{this led to the}} birth of the <b>girocheque,</b> a payment instrument exchangeable at the Post Office for cash, but equally capable of being paid into any bank account.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{benefits}} were paid weekly, in cash, at the Employment Exchange. From 1973, the then Department of Employment began {{to open a}} new network of Jobcentres that advertised Jobs but did not process benefits. During this time, claimants were required to make claims and 'sign on' in separate Unemployment Benefit Offices. With the introduction of the Employment Service in the mid 1990s, the Unemployment Benefit Offices were integrated into Jobcentres. From the 1970s {{benefits were}} paid in the form of <b>girocheque</b> until the early 2000s when payments would be made directly to the claimants bank account.|$|E
50|$|During 2003 the DWP {{commenced}} {{the use of}} Post Office {{accounts for}} the payment of benefits, a process fully operational {{at the beginning of}} the financial year in 2005. The accounts are licensed and the electronic benefits transfer banking engine are provided by the company JP Morgan Europe. Prior to these services the banking facility were provided by Citibank. As of 2012, the payment system for benefits is being streamlined, and all payments will now be made into bank, building society or Post Office accounts, and the use of <b>Girocheques</b> will be phased out by early 2013.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>Girocheque</b> {{quickly became}} {{associated}} with welfare dependence. Worse still, {{the name was}} often associated with Girobank in the public psyche, making little distinction between the welfare cheque and the business. Having a giro account meant writing one's own girocheques and although recipients of girocheques {{did not need to}} have (and most did not have) a giro account, girocheques issued by personal customers were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the recipient. They also carried the name and address of the issuer, making them very noticeably different from the cheques issued by other banks and noticeably similar to welfare girocheques.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom and {{in other}} {{countries}} the term giro may refer to a specific system once operated by the post office. In the UK, the giro service was originally known as National Giro. In due course [...] "giro" [...] {{was adopted by the}} public and the press as a shorthand term for the <b>girocheque,</b> which was a cheque and not a credit transfer. Meanwhile there were Bank Giro Credits, which were instructions to credit a particular bank account: these were not instructions to debit another account, so they had to be accompanied with cash or cheques, and they could be used both for bill payments and as paying-in slips; when used for paying bills they were often free-of-charge to the payer when used at the payer's or payee's bank but with an administration charge at other banks.|$|E
