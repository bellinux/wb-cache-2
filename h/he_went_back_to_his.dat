Lü Meng feared that Gan Ning would kill the servant so he did not send the servant away. Later, when Gan Ning visited Lü Meng's house and brought along gifts for the latter's mother, Lü brought the servant out to meet Gan, and Gan promised to spare the servant. However, Gan Ning reneged on his word later as he tied the servant to a tree and personally killed him by firing arrows at him.

25|$|In 1847, {{during a}} seven-month visit to England, he was {{appointed}} conductor at the London Drury Lane Theatre by its then-musical director, the popular French musician Louis Antoine Jullien. He was impressed with its quality when he first heard the orchestra perform at a promenade concert. In London he also learned that he knew far more English than he had supposed, although still did not understand half of what was said in conversation. He began writing his Mémoires. During his stay in England, the February Revolution broke out in France. Berlioz arrived back in France in 1848, only to be informed {{that his father had}} died shortly after his return. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> birthplace to mourn his father along with his sisters. Meanwhile, Harriet's health was declining due to alcohol abuse and she suffered a series of strokes that left her an invalid.

500|$|In late 2000, Kuntz {{decided not}} {{to return to his}} role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{position}} as a roving instructor with the team, which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, [...] ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. He tells me about every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You don't get that too often in this game. You're expected just to be strong, handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. He loves us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hostilities}} in Europe officially {{ended on}} 8 May 1945, when the Allies accepted the unconditional surrender of German forces. There were however {{a large number}} of German units in Norway—one of the few places in Europe still under German control—and the Allies feared the German commander there might attempt to fight on. In Operation Doomsday, Cain travelled to Oslo, Norway, with the 1st Airlanding Brigade on 11 May 1945. Working with Milorg (the Norwegian resistance), the British took the surrender of German troops in Norway without incident, before returning to the UK on 25 August 1945. Having remained {{in the service of the}} South Staffordshire Regiment, Cain officially relinquished his wartime commission on 28 December 1945 and was granted the honorary rank of Major. Upon leaving the army <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> pre-war occupation with Shell, living in East Asia and then West Africa. [...] In 1951 he was elected to the Nigerian House of Representatives while working there. [...] He returned to Britain in 1965 and settled in the Isle of Man upon his retirement.|$|E
500|$|At {{the height}} of Skelton's popularity, his nine-year-old son Richard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia and was given a year to live. [...] While the network told him to take as much time off as necessary, Skelton felt that until <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> television show, he {{would be unable to}} be at ease and make his son's life a happy one. He returned to his television show on January 15, 1957, with guest star Mickey Rooney helping to lift his spirits. In happier times, he frequently mentioned his children on his program, but found it extremely difficult to do so after Richard became ill. Skelton resumed this practice only after his son had asked him to do so. After his son's diagnosis, Skelton took his family on an extended trip, so Richard could see as much of the world as possible. When they arrived in London, there were press accusations that the trip was more about publicity than his seriously ill son. There were also newspaper reports about Richard's illness being fatal, which were seen by the boy. The family returned to the United States after the British press stories.|$|E
