40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to design a robust adaptive backstepping excitation controller for multimachine power systems in order to reject <b>external</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The parameters which significantly affect the stability of power systems (also called stability sensitive parameters) are considered as unknown and the <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> are incorporated into the power system model. The proposed excitation controller is designed {{in such a way that}} it is adaptive to the unknown parameters and robust to <b>external</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The stability sensitive parameters are estimated through the adaptation laws and the convergences of these adaptation laws are obtained through the negative semi-definiteness of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs). The proposed controller not only provides robustness property against <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> but also overcomes the over-parameterization problem of stability sensitive parameters which usually appears in some conventional adaptive methods. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is tested on a two-area four machine 11 -bus power system by considering <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> under different scenarios and is compared to that of an existing nonlinear adaptive backstepping controller. Simulation results illustrate the robustness of the proposed controller over an existing one in terms of rejecting <b>external</b> <b>disturbances...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Synthetic {{biology is}} {{foreseen}} to have important applications in biotechnology and medicine, {{and is expected}} to contribute significantly {{to a better understanding of}} the functioning of complex biological systems. However, the development of synthetic gene networks is still difficult and most newly created gene networks are non-functioning due to intrinsic parameter uncertainties, <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> and functional variations of intra- and extra-cellular environments. The design method for a robust synthetic gene network that works properly in a host cell under these intrinsic parameter uncertainties and <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> is the most important topic in synthetic biology. Results In this study, we propose a stochastic model that includes parameter fluctuations and <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> to mimic the dynamic behaviors of a synthetic gene network in the host cell. Then, based on this stochastic model, four design specifications are introduced to guarantee that a synthetic gene network can achieve its desired steady state behavior in spite of parameter fluctuations, <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> and functional variations in the host cell. We propose a systematic method to select a set of appropriate design parameters for a synthetic gene network that will satisfy these design specifications so that the intrinsic parameter fluctuations can be tolerated, the <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> can be efficiently filtered, and most importantly, the desired steady states can be achieved. Thus the synthetic gene network can work properly in a host cell under intrinsic parameter uncertainties, <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> and functional variations. Finally, a design procedure for the robust synthetic gene network is developed and a design example is given in silico to confirm the performance of the proposed method. Conclusion Based on four design specifications, a systematic design procedure is developed for designers to engineer a robust synthetic biology network that can achieve its desired steady state behavior under parameter fluctuations, <b>external</b> <b>disturbances</b> and functional variations in the host cell. Therefore, the proposed systematic design method has good potential for the robust synthetic gene network design. </p...|$|R
