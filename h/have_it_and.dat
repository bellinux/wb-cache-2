25|$|On 26 November 2014 a ninth doctor, Dr. Songo Mbriwa, was {{reported}} to be sick with Ebola disease. He was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Freetown. He was one of the doctors that cared for the late Dr Martin Salia, who experienced a false-negative Ebola test, but did indeed <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> may have exposed others.|$|E
25|$|All {{statistical}} hypothesis tests have a probability of making type I and type II errors. For example, all blood tests for a disease will falsely detect {{the disease in}} some proportion {{of people who do}}n't <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> will fail to detect the disease in some proportion of people who do have it. A test's probability of making a type I error is denoted by α. A test's probability of making a type II error is denoted by β. These error rates are traded off against each other: for any given sample set, the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error. For a given test, the only way to reduce both error rates is to increase the sample size, and this may not be feasible.|$|E

Three decades later, Teller confirmed that it was during his visits that he concluded that Israel was in possession of nuclear weapons. After conveying the matter to the U.S. government, Teller reportedly said: [...] "They [...] <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> they were clever enough to trust their research and not to test, they know that to test would get them into trouble." ...|$|E

Among other activities, the foundation hosts events for people with Down syndrome. The foundation gave the Down Syndrome Association of Greater St. Louis the resources to open an office and hire staff. In 2009, the Albert Pujols Wellness Center for Adults with Down Syndrome opened in Chesterfield, Missouri; Pujols {{was present at the}} opening on November 18.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the song, there is a five-second harmony line of two bağlamas (one each panned far left and far right on respect octaves), a Turkish folk instrument. The beat is then changed to a more upbeat version of the same melody with more percussion. The basic ornamentation is loyal to characteristic Turkish string ornamentations. Timbaland also used the Turkish oud to mellow out the guitar riff. The chord series follows the Am-C-G-D keys. Following the instrumental, Timberlake begins the verse at thirteenth bar. The original track had a bridge, including the pre-verses, the verses and the choruses. After hearing the vocals of Timberlake, they decided to remove the bridge and follow a simple flow, because they felt its [...] "too much" [...] to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> a break {{at the end of the}} song. Timbaland provides backing vocals on the song.|$|E
500|$|... "Drink You Away" [...] {{was written}} by Timberlake, Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley, Jerome [...] "J-Roc" [...] Harmon and James Fauntleroy. The song was {{produced}} by Timbaland, Timberlake and Harmon while Jones provided additional production. It was recorded the Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Ives played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake; for the process they were assisted by Alejandro Baima. The keyboards were provided by Harmon. It was sent to country radio in the United States on November 23, 2015, as the fourth and final single from The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 (2013). Regarding the single release, Sony Music Nashville executive vice president, promotion/artist development Steve Hodges stated, [...] "we received several requests from key programmers {{and we decided to}} get them a shortened version [...] so they didn't have to air the longer cut from the album," [...] adding [...] "our promotion staffs will not be actively working the single, we simply wanted to make the song easily accessible for country radio. Now they <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> can play it if they'd like" [...] in an interview for Billboard.|$|E
500|$|Warhawk {{was first}} {{announced}} {{to the public in}} May 2005, with a working build shown at E3 in 2006. This version was the first PlayStation 3 title to be shown with the newly announced Sixaxis motion sensing technology. In February 2007, it was announced that the single player element of the game was to be pulled. This was due to concerns Incognito had over the quality of the single-player campaign, particularly when compared to the multi-player modes. Dylan Jobe, the game's director, stated, [...] "If we were to continue down our single-player/multiplayer approach, it would have resulted in not as good single player or not as good multiplayer". The extra development of the multiplayer mode was used to improve existing elements such as in-game communication, and to implement new features such as On Demand Split Screen, whereby players can easily enter split screen mid-game. Split screen can only be used in battles that allow it. Only unranked servers have the ability to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> even then, it is an option whether or not the host wants it on or off. It was also revealed {{at the same time that}} Warhawk would be made available for download over the PlayStation Network.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{becomes a}} bookie {{and takes a}} $50 bet from Brian on a Celebrity Boxing match pitting Mike Tyson against Carol Channing. Brian bets on Tyson and loses. Stewie comes to collect, but Brian laughs him off and tells him he will have the money in 24 hours. After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian {{says he does not}} <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> to give him until next Friday. Stewie reveals that he is serious about {{settling}} the bet and, on two occasions, brutally beats up Brian (using such means as a golf club, shooting him in both knees with a pistol, and a flamethrower) to coerce him into paying up. Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's bet is satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one [...] "free revenge shot" [...] to make up for all the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian. After biding his time and making Stewie worry about what could happen, Brian—while the Griffins are in London, leaving the Patriots-Silly Nannies game—nonchalantly shoves Stewie in front of a moving bus.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in April 1949, {{there was}} {{considerable}} pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party.

[...] There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP.

2500|$|Bevin, Attlee's Foreign Secretary, famously {{stated that}} [...] "We've got to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> it's {{got to have}} a bloody Union Jack on it." [...] The first {{operational}} British A Bomb was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US McMahon Act, which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US-UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. British atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of Attlee's own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain.|$|E
