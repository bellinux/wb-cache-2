5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> going to be loaded up? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> gonna be Chicago house? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> gonna {{be a little bit of}} one vocal line? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
