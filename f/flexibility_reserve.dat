40|$|Modern {{conceptions of}} progress, {{based on the}} {{dominant}} Cartesian reductionist paradigm, {{are associated with a}} linear drive towards ever greater ascendancy, order, organisation, homogeneity, hegemony, performance, efficiency, and control. Similarly modern conceptions of progress are associated with positivist approaches to overcoming and extinguishing disorder, inchoateness, uncertainty, redundancy and risk. In this framework, diversity is conceived as a threat to system organisation, efficiency and control. Many contemporary conceptions of sustainability and sustainable development, framed within this paradigm, envisage sustainability as aligning with such ideas of progress. By this narrative, sustainable systems are achievable through ever greater efficiency, through for example, technological prowess, improved organisational structure/control, taming of “big data” and through risk reduction/extinction. Similarly, corporate sustainability would be advanced through growth, mergers and acquisitions, rationalisation, pruning of smaller operations/sites within firms, layoffs, increased corporate control, accountability and managerialism. “Bigger is better” is the apposite maxim. From a complex systems perspective however, a very different picture is evident. In the ecological domain, sustainable ecosystems have been quantitatively shown to be those which maintain an appropriate (context, time and space dependent) dynamic balance between opposing tendencies of ascendancy and efficiency on one hand and diversity and redundancy on the other (Ulanowicz, 2009; Goerner et al., 2009). Ecological biodiversity is an absolute requirement for ecosystem endurance since it facilitates system resilience in the event of significant perturbation (whether sudden shock or longer term stress). For example, a species which can feed on a selection of available prey species is more resilient against partial ecosystem destruction/prey extinction than one which relies on a single species for food. While the latter scenario represents a situation of greater efficiency, it is also more rigid and less resilient. Moreover, while the tendencies of complex systems towards ascendancy (organisation, efficiency) and disorder (redundancy, diversity) are antagonistic at local levels, they are in fact mutually dependent at higher levels (Ulanowicz et al, 2009) : “A requisite for the increase in effective orderly performance (ascendency) is the existence of <b>flexibility</b> (<b>reserve)</b> within the system. Conversely, systems that are highly constrained and at peak performance (in the second law sense of the word) dissipate external gradients at ever higher gross rates”. This model has been mirrored across techno-economic and social domains wherein similar sustainability models have been proposed (e. g. Stirling, 2011). This framework has manifested itself in research outputs across virtually every discipline, where in different guises sustainable and persistent systems have been shown to require a balance between tendencies of control, structure and organisation and those of diversity and disorder...|$|E

40|$|A region-wide Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) was {{recently}} {{proposed by the}} Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). In order for the Western Area Power Administration (Western) to make more informed decisions regarding its involvement in the EIM, Western asked Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) to review the EIM benefits study (the October 2011 revision) performed by Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc. (E 3). Key components of the E 3 analysis made use of results from {{a study conducted by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); therefore, we also reviewed the NREL work. This report examines E 3 and NREL methods and models used in the EIM study. Estimating EIM benefits is very challenging because of the complex nature of the Western Interconnection (WI), the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy resources, and the complex decisions and potentially strategic bidding of market participants. Furthermore, methodologies used for some of the more challenging aspects of the EIM have not yet matured. This review is complimentary of several components of the EIM study. Analysts and modelers clearly took great care when conducting detailed simulations of the WI using well-established industry tools under stringent time and budget constraints. However, it is our opinion that the following aspects of the study and the interpretation of model results could be improved upon in future analyses. The hurdle rate methodology used to estimate current market inefficiencies does not directly model the underlying causes of sub-optimal dispatch and power flows. It assumes that differences between historical flows and modeled flows can be attributed solely to market inefficiencies. However, flow differences between model results and historical data can be attributed to numerous simplifying assumptions used in the model and in the input data. We suggest that alternative approaches be explored in order to better estimate the benefits of introducing market structures like the EIM. In addition to more efficient energy transactions in the WI, the EIM would reduce the amount of <b>flexibility</b> <b>reserves</b> needed to accommodate forecast errors associated with variable production from wind and solar energy resources. The modeling approach takes full advantage of variable resource diversity over the entire market footprint, but the projected reduction in <b>flexibility</b> <b>reserves</b> may be overly optimistic. While some reduction would undoubtedly occur, the EIM is only an energy market and would therefore not realize the same reduction in reserves as an ancillary services market. In our opinion the methodology does not adequately capture the impact of transmission constraints on the deployment of <b>flexibility</b> <b>reserves.</b> Estimates of <b>flexibility</b> <b>reserves</b> assume that forecast errors follow a normal distribution. Improved estimates could be obtained by using other probability distributions to estimate up and down reserves to capture the underlying uncertainty of these resources under specific operating conditions. Also, the use of a persistence forecast method for solar is questionable, because solar insolation follows a deterministic pattern dictated by the sun's path through the sky. We suggest a more rigorous method for forecasting solar insolation using the sun's relatively predictable daily pattern at specific locations. The EIM study considered only one scenario for hydropower resources. While this scenario is within the normal range over the WI footprint, it represents a severe drought condition in the Colorado River Basin from which Western schedules power. Given hydropower's prominent role in the WI, we recommend simulating a range of hydropower conditions since the relationship between water availability and WI dispatch costs is nonlinear. Also, the representation of specific operational constraints faced by hydropower operators in the WI needs improvements. The model used in the study cannot fully capture all of the EIM impacts and complexities of power system operations. In particular, a primary benefit of the EIM is a shorter dispatch interval; namely, 5 minutes. However, the model simulates the dispatch hourly. Therefore it cannot adequately measure the benefits of a more frequent dispatch. A tool with a finer time resolution would significantly improve simulation accuracy. When the study was conducted, the rules for the EIM were not clearly defined and it was appropriate to estimate societal benefits of the EIM assuming a perfect market without a detailed specification of the market design. However, incorporating a more complete description of market rules will allow for better estimates of EIM benefits. Furthermore, performing analyses using specific market rules can identify potential design flaws that may be difficult and expensive to correct after the market is established. Estimated cost savings from a more efficient dispatch are {{less than one percent of}} the total cost of electricity production...|$|R

In this review, we discuss metabolic phenotype and metabolic signalling in the contexts of pathological hypertrophy and HF.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} Lord Aberdeen’s second tenure as Foreign Secretary, in Robert Peel’s {{government}} of 1841 - 46. The tenure is first contextualised by {{an analysis of}} Aberdeen’s ‘mental map’, in order to reconstruct the personal influences and reasoning behind Conservative foreign policy. The study then engages with Aberdeen’s dealings in Europe, where it provides an alternative interpretation of the Anglo-French entente. It considers Aberdeen and the Conservatives’ approach to Russia and the ‘Eastern Question’ which, along with Chapter Two, treads historiographical terra incognita. Britain’s engagement with America is then analysed; the discord of preceding years, various festering diplomatic sores, and America’s growing influence had combined to throw relations into sharp focus. This study re-examines archives that have, for the most part, been long neglected or examined {{in the light of}} historiographical debates long superseded by new developments. Where the present methodology varies from previous works is that different questions are being asked of the material in accordance with the new contexts in which Aberdeen and Conservative foreign policy are considered: these relate to conclusions drawn from the analysis of Aberdeen’s ‘mental map’ and to the wider objectives of the Conservative government. This approach facilitates a study in which Aberdeen’s foreign policy is analysed on its own terms. The historiography has hitherto largely used Palmerstonian and/or liberal contexts as the parameters of debate about the foreign policy of the Peel administration, which only served to distort conclusions. This study’s approach leads it to consider a rational and competent Foreign Secretary whose policy dovetailed with the objectives of the Conservative government and was crucial in helping Peel to deliver them. A consistent set of principles ran through foreign policy dealings – albeit with a <b>flexibility</b> <b>reserved</b> for the means by which they were applied – not least a focus on the maintenance and extension of mercantile intercourse as a means by which to consolidate and protect British power. These observations help lead the study to consider a reinterpretation of Aberdeen and the Peel government, and to ask new questions about mid nineteenth-century Conservatism...|$|R

The assigning of one or more of the plurality of power reserves may further comprise determining a portion of the power reserve requirement of the power network provided by each selected power reserve in accordance with the respective power <b>reserve</b> <b>flexibility</b> characteristics of the power reserves. Assigning the one or more power reserves may further comprise determining if, for a particular instance in time, the power reserve requirement is met by the assigned one or more power reserves, assigning a next power reserve to deliver power to the power network if the power reserve requirement is not met, the next power reserve determined from the order of the indexing values associated with the respective power reserves and adjusting a power to be delivered to the power network by a most recently allocated reserve of the one or more power reserves that have been assigned to provide power at that instant in time to a level of power sufficient to meet the power reserve requirement at that instant in time if the power reserve requirement is met. The power to be delivered by the most recently allocated reserve may be adjusted by subtracting the difference between the power reserve requirement at that instant in time and a summation of a power to be delivered at that instant in time by each of the power reserves assigned to deliver power at that instant in time from the power to be delivered at that instant in time by the most recently allocated reserve assigned to deliver power at that instant in time. Assigning the one or more power reserves may further comprise determining if the one or more assigned power reserves provide the power reserve requirement, continuing assigning the reserves if the power reserve requirement is not met and stopping the assigning the reserves if the power reserve requirement is met. The method may further comprise determining, prior to assigning one or more of the power reserves, whether or not the plurality of power reserves will be able to provide the power reserve requirement from the power <b>reserve</b> <b>flexibility</b> characteristics associated with the plurality of power reserves. The power reserve requirement associated with the power network may be a power required to be delivered to the network over a period of time. The power reserve requirement associated with a power network may be determined by estimating a power reserve requirement associated with the power network. The power <b>reserve</b> <b>flexibility</b> characteristics may be obtained from a memory. The indexing value may be obtained from a memory. The method may further comprise receiving the power <b>reserve</b> <b>flexibility</b> characteristics and receiving the indexing values.

According to {{an aspect of the}} invention there is provided a method for allocating power reserves in a power network. The method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with the power network. The method then comprises assigning power reserves associated with the network to deliver power for meeting the power reserve requirement, the power reserves assigned according to an indexing value associated with delivery of power by respective power reserves. Throughout this disclosure it will be understood that each indexing value assigned to a power reserve may correspond to a financial cost associated with that reserve. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for allocating power reserves in a power network. The method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with the power network. The method then comprises assigning power reserves associated with the network for meeting the determined power reserve requirement, the power reserves assigned according to a power response characteristic associated with each of the power reserves. According to a further aspect of the invention a method for allocating power resources provided by a plurality of power reserves in a power network to meet a power reserve requirement of the power network is provided. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of power reserves, information indicative of power response characteristics associated with power resources provided by the respective power reserves. The method also comprises obtaining, for the plurality of power reserves, information indicative of an indexing value associated with the power resources provided by the respective power reserves. In addition, the method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with a power network. The method also comprises assigning one or more power resources provided by the plurality of power reserves in accordance with the power response characteristics and the indexing value associated with each power resource provided by the plurality of power reserves to provide the power resource requirement. The power response characteristic may be considered as a deliverable power response of a power reserve. Also the power response characteristic may be considered as a mapping of the highest power and longest duration positive and negative power response with respect to time associated with a power reserve. Such a system of mapping of power reserve supply and reserve requirement allows for simple description of any flexible resource, intermittent source or frequency service regardless of their particular dynamic response. Once the method is complete, the reserve requirement may be fully accounted for by the cumulative supply provided by the least expensive available reserves. The method may be applicable to forecasted worst-case intermittency, or can be applied to state of the art frequency control services such that reserves are allocated to individual FCR, FRR or RR services. The cumulative supply can be decomposed to determine and share cost of intermittency. The method may provide intuitive visual reserve adequacy assessment and user input allocation via a user interface. The methods described herein allow for available resources to be used to their fullest which can bring down the price of reserves and may lead to a significant cost reduction for the various system operators by enlarging the pool of available reserves. A system for defining resources irrespective of type is disclosed. Consequently, a single definition system is provided to identify the power characteristics of flexible resources, intermittent resources, or frequency services regardless of their particular dynamic response. A system that enables a user to be provided with a visual reserve adequacy assessment and reserve distribution is disclosed...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{penetration}} of wind generation will inevitably impose additional requirements {{on the remaining}} large conventional plant to deliver both the <b>flexibility</b> and <b>reserve</b> necessary to deal with variability and unpredictability of wind power, which will inevitably have cost implications. Energy storage systems {{appear to be an}} obvious solution for dealing with the unpredictability of renewable sources: during periods when intermittent generation exceeds the demand, when the surplus could be stored and then used to cover periods when the load is greater than the generation. However, views on the role of bulk storage remain highly controversial and, somewhat surprisingly, there has been very little work carried out to demonstrate the necessity (or otherwise) and economics of storage based applications in systems with high {{penetration of}} wind energy.

40|$|Flexibility of the {{transportation}} system {{is one of the}} important performance measures needed to deal with demand changes. In this paper, we provide a quantitative assessment of capacity flexibility for the passenger transportation network using bi-level network capacity models. Two approaches for assessing the value of capacity flexibility are proposed. One approach is based on the concept of reserve capacity, which reflects the flexibility with respect to changes in terms of demand volume only. The second approach allows for variations in the demand pattern in addition to changes in demand volume in order to more fully capture demand changes. Two models are developed in the second approach to consider two types of capacity flexibility. The total capacity flexibility allows all users to have both route choice and destination choice when estimating capacity flexibility. The limited capacity flexibility estimates how much more demand volume could be added to a fixed demand pattern by allowing the additional demand to deviate from the fixed demand pattern. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the different concepts of capacity flexibility for a passenger transportation system under demand changes.

40|$|The textile {{industry}} achieves economic benefits through outsourcing to low cost markets. Today, reshoring is an emerging trend due to rising cost and unemployment concerns. This problem is {{primarily due to}} an industry-wide focus on economic benefits only. Cost saving is a basic reason for international outsourcing while domestic outsourcing provides capacity flexibility. Moreover, outsourcing risk has {{a major impact on}} strategic location of the production destinations.

40|$|The {{integration}} of {{variable renewable energy}} sources (VRE) is likely to cause fundamental and structural changes to the operation of future power systems. In the United Kingdom (UK), large amounts of price-insensitive and variable-output wind generation {{is expected to be}} deployed to contribute towards renewable energy and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission targets. Wind generation, with near-zero marginal costs, limited predictability, and a limited ability to provide upward dispatch, displaces price-setting thermal power plants, with higher marginal costs, changing <b>flexibility</b> and <b>reserve</b> requirements. New-build, commercial-scale, and low-carbon generation capacity, such as CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear, may impact power system flexibility and ramping capabilities. Low-carbon generation portfolios with price-sensitive thermal power plants and energy storage are therefore likely to be required to manage increased levels of variability and uncertainty at operational timescales. This work builds on a high-resolution wind reanalysis dataset of UK wind sites. The locations of existing and proposed wind farms are used to produce plausible and internally consistent wind deployment scenarios that represent the spatial distribution of future UK wind capacity. Temporally consistent electricity demand data is used to characterise and assess demand-wind variability and net demand ramp events. A unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model is developed to evaluate the likely operating regimes of thermal power plants and CCS-equipped units across a range of future UK wind scenarios. Security constraints for reserve and power plant operating constraints, such as power output limits, ramp rates, minimum up/down times, and start-up times, ensure the operational feasibility of dispatch schedules. The load factors, time spent at different loads, and the ramping and start-up requirements of thermal power plants are assessed. CO 2 duration curves are developed to assess the impacts of increasing wind capacity on the distribution of CO 2 emissions. A sensitivity analysis investigates the impacts of part-load efficiency losses, ramp rates, minimum up/down times, and start-up/shut-down costs on power plant operating regimes and flexibility requirements. The interactions between a portfolio of energy storage units and flexible CO 2 capture units are then explored. This multi-disciplinary research presents a temporally-explicit and detailed assessment of operational flexibility requirements at full 8760 hour resolution, highlighting the non-linear impacts of increasing wind capacity. The methodological framework presented here uses high spatial-and temporal-resolution wind data but is expected to provide useful insights for other VREbased power systems to mitigate the implications of inadequate flexibility...|$|R
40|$|In the Pacific, the {{protection}} of coral reef resources is often achieved through the implementation of village-based marine reserves (VBMRs). While substantial fisheries benefits are often reported, results of quantitative approaches are controversial for benthic macroinvertebrates, whose life history traits may cause low congruence with protective measures implemented at non-ecologically relevant scales. This study investigated the structural and behavioral responses of the exploited topshell Tectus niloticus within a very small (0. 2 km 2) VBMR in Vanuatu, south Pacific. The results of underwater surveys and a nine-month tagging experiment emphasized contrasted, scale-dependent responses. At the reserve scale, our results failed to demonstrate any positive effect of protection {{after three years of}} closure. In contrast, abundance, density and biomass increased more than ten-fold {{in the southern part of}} the reserve, along with significantly larger (25 %) individual sizes. The dispersal of tagged specimens was also consistently lower after 2, 4 and 9 months in the latter zone. Analyses of 17 substratum variables revealed a marked small-scale patchiness delineating contrasted benthic microhabitats, the distribution of which closely matched that of trochus. We advocate that i) VBMRs have inherently unequal ecological potentials for protecting and managing highly habitat-dependent species such as trochus; ii) 'success' or 'failure' is to a certain extent pre-determined by the trajectory of species-specific microhabitats, which may outreach protection effects. This has strong implications in the Pacific where the location and size of reserves primarily depends upon marine tenure, and communities have little <b>flexibility</b> in setting <b>reserve</b> boundaries...|$|R

Conventional statistics do not adequately address heterogeneity and longitudinal performance trajectories. Generalised growth mixture modelling (GGMM; Muthén, 2004) was utilised {{to identify and}} predict heterogeneous longitudinal cognitive performance trajectories following training. Specific and generalised effects of training were examined. Baseline characteristics such as age, sex and proxies for cognitive reserve were also explored as predictors of trajectories. Data from 315 community-dwelling older adults (age 55 – 85 years) from the Active Cognitive Enhancement (ACE) Program training study were analysed. Short-term (VM) and long-term verbal memory (LTVM) and executive functioning (EF) were tested using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the CogState Ltd Groton Maze Learning Test (GMLT) at baseline and at 3 -, 6 - and 12 -month follow-ups. Generalised growth mixture modelling demonstrated High, Moderate, and Low performance classes for memory performance. High and Low classes were identified for executive function. Also identified were demonstrable performance trajectory gains in the trained individuals of the Low class for executive function, those performing at a low normative level at baseline (Cohen’s d = 2. 23). These results offer a novel contribution to the literature. Gains by those trained in the Low performing VM and LTVM classes’ performance trajectories were also shown (Cohen’s d = 4. 48 and 1. 38, respectively). However, the experimental participants were compared to {{a small number of}} controls (n = 2) thus no meaningful training effects on memory were identified. The GGMM models therefore demonstrated that the multidomain ACE cognitive training program produced some generalised cognitive improvement in healthy older adults, albeit to limited extent. Age and estimated premorbid IQ (a proxy for cognitive reserve) predicted Low EF performance trajectories compared to High class performances. Trained individuals {{were more likely to be}} older and have lower levels of estimated pre-morbid IQ. Individuals who demonstrated executive function performance gains were less likely to demonstrate verbal memory trajectory gains. These findings suggest distinct responses to training in different cognitive domains and/or distinctive inter-individual responses to elements of the multi-domain training program. Caution with interpretation of GGMM labels and predictive factors identified is necessary, given their relativity to the cohort. With this approach, current theories including compensation, magnification, ‘Use It or Lose It’, plasticity, <b>flexibility,</b> and cognitive <b>reserve</b> are supported. Application of GGMM can also further facilitate development of individually tailored and cost effective cognitive training programs...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} European {{policy goals}} aiming towards a {{sustainable}} energy supply, the share of renewable energy sources in the electricity system is increasing. The two technologies driving this development in Europe, i. e. wind and PV, are characterised by a variable energy output, facing a limited predictability. These unexpected output variations challenge the real-time balance between electricity demand and supply and require appropriate operating reserve capacity. In the absence of large-scale storage or price responsive demand, the balancing of the power system is the main bottleneck for a large-scale deployment of renewable electricity generation in the power system. This dissertation deals with the management of operating reserves for balancing the power system with high shares of wind power. Firstly, a numerical model is developed to generate realistic time series of wind power generation and predictions over a region. This data is {{used to determine the}} short-term variations and prediction errors impacting the system balance. These are assessed by means of a flexibility assessment tool quantifying the operational thermal flexibility which is available for covering real-time system imbalances. Results show that without additional <b>reserve</b> requirements, this <b>flexibility</b> is insufficient to ensure a reliable integration of wind power. Particularly the upward fast-response flexibility is found to be scarce. Secondly, a statistical methodology is used to size and allocate additional reserve capacity to maintain stable reliability standards while integrating wind power. A strategy which minimises total capacity while maximising the allocation of reserve capacity towards slow-response reserves is put forward as a cost-efficient strategy. This is verified by means of a model simulating the day-ahead scheduling of power plants to meet the demand for power and reserve capacity. It is found that reserve requirements, and in particular the fast-response upward reserves, impact electricity generation cost. This cost increase is minimised when deploying slow-response reserve strategies. Results indicate the importance of peak power plants and base load flexibility to obtain a cost-efficient procurement of thermal reserve capacity. Finally, two reserve strategies are presented based on probabilistic wind power forecasting tools. Information concerning the uncertainty of the wind power forecast is used to obtain time-varying reserve requirements and enables the active participation of wind power in reserves. It is shown that both strategies achieve substantial cost savings without impacting system security. In particular the dynamic reserve strategy is particularly useful for reducing upward reserve capacity. In contrast, wind power participation remains a last-resort measure when facing low downward <b>flexibility</b> and elevated <b>reserve</b> requirements. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{users are}} {{investing}} in solar panels, batteries and smart-home energy systems. New technology is creating both new opportunities and new needs. New opportunities arise when users are empowered to respond to market signals. New needs arise when network topology is transforming. Decentralized renewable energy, electric vehicles, and storage are {{changing the face of}} electricity distribution networks. Taking advantage of new opportunities means opening the market to all participants. Making the best use of decentralized resources means identifying decentralized network needs and constraints. This dissertation is divided into two main parts to study the coordination of demand response -user participation- procurement. The first part studies the integration of demand response into the wholesale market design. The second part analyses local network needs and studies how user participation can be coordinated to provide local flexibility services. The integration of demand response into the wholesale electricity market is studied in Part I of the thesis. Demand response needs to be aggregated to make a difference at a wholesale market level. The aggregation of demand poses challenges to market design regarding interactions between actors, procurement procedures and remuneration mechanisms. What’s more, aggregation has effects on current market participants. The aggregator trades flexibility provided by consumers who already have contracts with retailers. These retailers foresee needs of their customers and trade energy accordingly. When a third party, the aggregator, is also making decisions on their forecasted load, conflicts arise. The exact nature of these conflicts is explored in detail. It is found that when consumers are asked to modify their consumption patterns at one hour, they are likely {{to make up for it}} at a later hour. This is defined as the rebound effect. Aggregators impact balancing responsible parties (BRPs) on two main levels: market profits and retail profits. Proposals for transfer payments from the aggregator to the BRP to solve these conflicts are modelled using an empirical approach. The BRP is modelled as a portfolio owner of generation and load. The aggregator supplies demand response flexibility to the market during the best possible hours as a result of an optimization. It is found that demand response will be deployed as long as the transfer payment is less than the peak and off-peak market price. Demand response has an arbitraging effect in the market therefore can be profitable for the party attributed balancing responsibility. Part II of the dissertation is aimed at reaping the possibilities of demand response at a local level. While the focus of Part I is geared towards wholesale market benefits, the focus of Part II is in using flexibility to deal with grid issues and avoid network reinforcements. It is found in current literature and ongoing projects that there is no consensus on a framework design for the procurement of local flexibility. The transmission system operator, the distribution system operator (DSO), an independent aggregator, and a third party actor have all been proposed as local market operators. A method is proposed to analyze the need that can be fulfilled by local flexibility in the distribution system. Demand and price criteria for flexibility services are defined from the point of view of the DSO. The value of flexibility to the DSO is defined by an analysis of the savings achieved by avoiding grid reinforcements. Congestion in the distribution grid is chosen a use-case to test the methodology. A first case is studied where the DSO procures flexibility directly at cost-value in order to avoid network reinforcements. It is found that flexibility use can save up to two thirds of the cost of grid reinforcements for the DSO compared to the case without flexibility. A second case is studied where a profit maximizing making aggregator is introduced. In this case, the DSO competes with a BRP for the flexibility resources that would solve its problems in the grid. A quantity demanded and a valuation of flexibility for the BRP is proposed. The BRP needs flexibility to cover deviations in its short term to intraday renewable energy profiles. The BRP is willing to pay for flexibility as long as it costs less than the balancing penalties it would otherwise incur. The two actors, DSO and BRP, have different decision horizons. The DSO needs to make a decision to buy flexibility or reinforce the network in advance, while the BRP needs flexibility on an almost real-time horizon. The aggregator needs to make the decision of who to sell to in advance, so the market is bilaterally organized. It is shown that as the DSO’s willingness to pay is higher than the BRP’s most of the time, so it wins the bid for most of the available flexibility with respect to the BRP. There is still a long way to travel for users to deliberately affect the functioning of electricity markets and grids. This dissertation opens up a discussion on a whole scale and a local level in an effort to exploit different possible uses of flexibilityContents Abstract i Contents xvii List of Figures xix List of Tables xxi 1 Introduction 1 1. 1 Smart Grid Context: Changing Electricity Production and Consumption............................ 1 1. 2 Thesis Motivation: Challenges to Integrate Demand Response into Electricity Markets...................... 4 1. 3 System Impact of New Technologies............... 4 1. 3. 1 Variable Generation.................... 4 1. 3. 2 Evolving Load Patterns.................. 6 1. 3. 3 Commercial Solutions................... 7 1. 4 Local Impact of New Technologies................ 8 1. 5 Research Objective: Market Coordination Mechanisms..... 9 1. 6 Thesis Outline........................... 10 2 Demand Response in the Wholesale Market 15 2. 1 Definition of Flexibility and Demand Response......... 17 2. 2 Key Aspects of Electricity Market Design............ 18 2. 2. 1 Temporal.......................... 18 2. 2. 2 Market Clearing: Price Formation............ 20 2. 2. 3 Spatial............................ 21 2. 2. 4 Contractual......................... 22 2. 2. 5 Reference Day-Ahead Wholesale Market Design..... 23 2. 3 Demand Response Integration................... 23 2. 3. 1 Timeline of Contracting and Operation of Demand Response 25 2. 3. 2 Benefit of Demand Response in the Wholesale Market. 26 2. 4 Remuneration of Demand Response in Wholesale Markets... 29 2. 4. 1 The LMP -

40|$|Executive Summary The Asian crisis {{highlighted}} {{deficiencies in}} the availability of information relating to the on and off-balance-sheet foreign currency activities of central banks and other public sector entities. This led the G- 10 Governors to ask the Euro-currency Standing Committee to establish a working group to develop a disclosure framework to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the group was asked to identify the statistical information that would enable markets to better assess the authorities' foreign currency liquidity position. This position comprises the foreign exchange resources {{at the disposal of}} the authorities that are easily mobilisable in times of need and the potential drains on those resources associated with the authorities' short-term foreign currency liabilities. The group was also asked to report on the most suitable framework for public disclosure, the specific form and content of the information to be released and the additional practical steps necessary to implement the chosen strategy. In its deliberations the group recognised that improvements in disclosure practices by G- 10 countries could help to encourage similar behaviour in emerging market countries. The analysis and recommendations of the working group should be assessed in the context of initiatives relating to disclosure currently under way in other forums. These include the work of a working party on transparency and accountability commissioned by a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 22 economies (the "Willard Group") and planned steps by the IMF Executive Board to strengthen the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In recognition of these initiatives, an IMF representative was {{invited to participate in the}} working group and information on disclosure practices was shared with the Willard Group working party. A representative from the European Central Bank (ECB) was also asked to participate in the group. The working group is of the opinion that a significant move towards enhanced disclosure is justified as regards both the content and the timeliness of the information. This conclusion was reached on the basis of a review of current disclosure practices in relation to the liquidity concept outlined in previous discussions among Governors and a cost/benefit analysis of such a step. Prevailing practices generally fall well short of providing the relevant information, particularly as concerns the potential short-term drains on reserves. As most recently highlighted by the Asian crisis, the failure to disclose the forward book of the monetary authorities is one important example. The main benefits of enhanced disclosure would be to improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help to induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion. It was noted that effective market discipline mechanisms also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Differing views were expressed in this regard and the group acknowledged that this issue deserved further analysis. The group weighed the possible benefits of greater transparency against some potential costs. These were seen as being primarily associated with reduced operational flexibility to intervene covertly in order to counteract exchange market pressures, with the uncertainties involved in the transition towards a more demanding disclosure standard and with the logistical burdens of implementation. The specific recommendations of the group take the form of: a "disclosure template" outlining the content of the information to be disclosed; prescribed standards of timeliness, including both periodicity and disclosure lags; a timetable for implementation; and a proposal for further work on disclosure standards for private market participants. The disclosure template, summarised below, has three distinguishing features. Firstly, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible with respect to the coverage of both institutions and financial instruments. As regards institutions, conceptually the template is intended to apply to all the public sector entities that would be responsible for, or involved in, counteracting currency crises. In practice, this should at least include the monetary authorities, defined here to include both the central bank and the central government (excluding social security), but depending on institutional arrangements could extend to other public sector entities. As regards financial instruments, the template attempts to cover all the relevant on and off-balance-sheet liquid assets and short-term liabilities. Comprehensiveness is designed to provide a meaningful picture and to limit the scope for shifting components of the liquidity position to undisclosed items. Secondly, the template seeks to be sufficiently detailed to allow market participants to reach informed judgements about both reserves and drains on them. Detail is provided in several respects. These include, inter alia: a sectoral breakdown (notably as between the monetary authorities and other public sector entities); the separate identification of financial instruments that might vary in terms of liquidity (e. g., gold, deposits with banks headquartered in the reporting country) or cash flow characteristics (e. g., contingent vs. predetermined; time profiles, as captured by a residual maturity breakdown of the fixed-term liabilities); and complementary memorandum items (e. g., undrawn unconditional lines of credit, debt indexed to foreign currency). Finally, the template prescribes valuation principles that are consistent with the focus on liquidity. This suggests reporting, as far as possible, mobilisable foreign exchange resources at (approximate) market values and the future profile of drains on these resources in nominal terms (the cash flow value when the drain occurs). The group recommends endorsement of the template. At the same time, it recognises that improvements are possible. A review by technical experts of the details of the presentation would be helpful in identifying improvements in the way some of the information is portrayed and in accomplishing effective implementation. The issues to be addressed include, in particular, the treatment of derivatives positions and the clarification of the relationship between the definitions used in the report and those adopted in the balance-of-payments conventions, which are largely based on the residence criterion. It is recommended that technical experts be asked to report on these issues as soon as possible. The working group devoted much attention to the issue of timeliness, particularly in the light of the substantial element of judgement called for in examining this question. There are two features of information disclosure that affect timeliness: the disclosure lag, which determines how out-of-date the information is when released; and the frequency or periodicity of the disclosure, which determines the extent to which the information ages between releases and affects the incremental "news" content of the release. The group agreed that a common frequency and disclosure lag should apply to all the items of the template (except one memorandum item, viz. the currency composition by group of currencies). To do otherwise could greatly undermine the template's usefulness as it would provide an avenue for concealing changes in liquidity through whatever items are reported in the least timely fashion. The group also agreed that it is technically feasible to set a very high frequency and short lag. At the same time, the concomitant gains in terms of market discipline had to be weighed against the possible need for flexibility in exchange market operations, either for reserve management purposes or for covert intervention. In order to preserve <b>flexibility</b> in <b>reserve</b> management, the group decided to allow for less frequent and less detailed disclosure of the currency composition of the portfolio. Furthermore, forward positions should be reported only insofar as the domestic currency is involved, since only those transactions imply a future change in total official reserves. As concerns covert intervention, views regarding the true extent and value of such flexibility varied somewhat within the group. This reflected several factors, notably differing experiences with exchange rate regimes, institutional settings and opinions about the range and likelihood of circumstances in which it was regarded as useful to retain market uncertainty about the occurrence and/or size of the authorities' operations. Two further considerations argued against a rapid move to the highest feasible frequency and shortest feasible lag: implementation costs (especially in the context of efforts to address the "Year 2000 problem" and the introduction of the euro); and, given the residual uncertainties involved, concerns that such a step, once taken, would be costly to reverse if it proved unwarranted. In the light of these concerns, the group recommends that a first step would be to adopt a standard of a one-month frequency and a disclosure lag certainly not exceeding one month, to be implemented on or before end-June 1999. Since the frequency and disclosure lag would apply to all the categories of the template - except one memorandum item - this would already represent a significant improvement compared with current practices. In addition, the group notes that central banks are not the only holders of foreign currency reserves or liabilities, so that the full implementation of its recommendations would also require endorsement and corresponding action by other public sector entities, in particular finance ministries or treasuries. The group also considered the benefits associated with similar transparency about the risk positions, including foreign currency positions, of all private financial intermediaries. The group was of the opinion that further parallel work is needed in this area. It noted that an initial analysis had been carried out by the Euro-currency Standing Committee in 1994, as published in the report on "public disclosure of market and credit risks by financial intermediaries" (the "Fisher Report"). In connection with the enhanced disclosure proposed for the official sector, the group recommends that the ECSC now revisit the question of the appropriate disclosure standards for all market participants with a view to elaborating a set of good practices. ...|$|R
40|$| the by-pass roads {{could have}} {{negative}} effects on trade in the center. Nevertheless, in some places extensive plans for new main roads were introduced, sometimes beyond what was shown in The Norwegian Road Plan. At the same time problems caused by traffic, like accidents and noise, were pointed out. The road systems were based on principles of differentiation and separation, and noise barriers were suggested. The principles were modified and adapted to the local situation. Traffic safety and good environment were arguments for positioning of functions within short distances. Pedestrian and bicycle paths were important in most of the plans. They were located parallel to the roads or in parks and sports fields. Public transportation was a necessary part of the transport system, but mostly as a supplement to private cars, for instance as more effective ferry connections. Buses were necessary for people who did not own their own cars. Use of railways was of interest mostly for transportation of goods. When airfields were mentioned in the plans, there was optimistic thinking about the volume of air transport in the future. The municipalities had to build systems for water supply and sewage in order to improve the existing situation and to prepare for development in the villages. The systems for garbage collection also had to be improved, perhaps in cooperation with neighboring municipalities. Some Aspects of the Planning Tools and Planning Process The planning had synoptic-rationalistic ambitions There were synoptic ambitions in the desire to relate the plans to greater geographical areas and to see many issues and factors in relation to each other. The rationalistic ambitions lie in the goal orientation and the use of systematic methods in the planning. In addition to dealing with the total areas of the municipalities and many considerations and tasks for future development, the plans tried to look at the municipality in the perspective of expected development in the region and the county. Based on investigation and analysis comprehensive plans were presented for trade and industry, population, housing, public service etc. all over the municipality. In this way the plans had formulated goals, for the total municipality, for the zoned areas, and for different sectors or tasks. Systematic methods were used to find needs and solutions according to the goals. In the use of methods and {{in the structure of the}} plans, the "economic-base" model was essential. It coordinated possible development in trade and industry, population, economics, and the needs and tasks the plans were to deal with. In the evaluation of alternative development patterns, systematic analysis of commodity trade was used. In addition the choice of pattern was based on judgement and political conside-rations. As a basis for the land use plans, systematic analysis of existing land use and qualities was done. Identifying conflicts of interest, especially in relation to agriculture, was important for the choice of building sites. The general approach and use of methods are in accordance with the Anglo-Saxon planning tradition, based on physical planning and dealing with themes and considerations that are relevant to land use plans. Public organizations were active in the planning It is understandable that planning was criticized for using ”scientific” and complicated methods, especially for the analysis of trade and industry and population. On the other hand it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other or easier way to create a solid basis for the goals and long term plans. The view that the municipalities bought a more or less complete plan proposal from the consultant is not correct. Political and administrative boards were important participants in the planning. In the most cases the planning committee was active, and some places the municipal council discussed important issues during the process. The planning committee often had important politicians as members. The municipal engineer had an important role, and was in some cases responsible for parts of the planning. The agriculture authorities' contribution to the analysis of land use was decisive for the design of the plan. Other authorities in the municipality and on a higher level gave contributions. The contacts with the County governors planning department, the road authorities, and the region planning office, were especially important. Private actors were to a lesser degree involved in the planning, apart from some contact with business leaders in discussions about future development, and with land-owners in discussions about land use plans. Ordinary people were more concerned about specific concrete projects and site plans. In the descriptions of the planning pro-cess, the public inspection of the plan proposal on its way to final decision is emphasized. Few initiatives were taken to broader participation in the planning; so the criticism of lack of democracy may be correct. The planning took a long time Up till about eight years elapsed from the planning started until a plan proposal could be presented. One common cause was the lack of maps. In some cases the work halted because planners had to wait for clarification of various issues. However, it seems like the municipalities were interested in getting the planning done. The exception may be Tinn, where economic development work had priority and finalizing of the master plan was delayed. Especially in Saltdal there was disagreement about how comprehensive the planning should be. In this one can see a suggestion that the synoptic ambitions were per-haps too high and that the planning did not concentrate enough on the most important problems in the municipality. At the same it should be remembered that all necessary data had to be developed from scratch. When the Ministry eventually advised limiting the scope of the plans, this was not so simple, as they were supposed to be consistent and serve as good tools for the municipality at the same time. The plans show signs of strategic thinking The view that the plans were static and standardized is not correct. The point of the analyses of relations between employment, population, need for building sites, and need for services, was to show what was necessary to steer the development in a desired direction, and to prepare for the development that was expected. The land use plans were to prepare for and guide building when and if it might take place. There was a strategic thought behind the large allocations of land, greater than calculated need, especially for industry. This gave municipalities <b>flexibility</b> and <b>reserves</b> of land for the future. The plans emphasized the need for up dating of the plans according to changes in needs and conditions. The municipalities were to do the future planning themselves. The criticism of the plans as static and standardized stands in contrast to the view of the same plans as schematic and divided in zones, without thought for form. In this view can be seen a wish for the plans to go even further in determining concrete design than the zoning plans did. The plans show will to realism I have examined the realism of the plans in relation to the information one could have at the time the planning was taking place and based on the methods used. The extensive registration and analysis shows will to found the plans on as solid a base of information and facts as possible. The goals for population growth at 1 - 2 % each year in the five municipalities can be seen as unrealistic. At the time, many municipalities had overly optimistic prognoses for growth. However, many rural municipalities believed in ”vitamin injections” from an active regional policy, and based their prognoses in addition on rates of birth that had been common up until then. The will to realism is obvious in the coordination between prognosis, calculations of needs, and analysis of the municipality’s economics, action plan and long term budget. Here is also a connection between physical and economic planning. When the plans account for the limitations in the municipality's possibilities in directing authorities on a higher level, or private trade and industries, this is an expression of a realistic attitude. Politicians had a tendency to decide more optimistic goals than the consultant recommended. This reflected political will and optimistic belief in the future and in regional policy. Planning better than its reputation In the years after, it can be seen that the plans were in use for a long time, even beyond the plan period. Of course, all municipalities except for Eid had lower population growth than expected, for many reasons. Industries did not develop in the way the plans suggested, more women took jobs, and birth rates declined. In agriculture there was stability for a few years, but then the number of farmers declined in the municipalities that had a difficult organization of farm area. In the public sector the number of employees increased because of an increase in required municipal administration. In the private service there has also been growth due to increased prosperity. The land use plans have been mostly followed with rather minor changes and additions, even in the smaller villages. Despite lower population increase, the small villages contain a reasonable part of the population, and building has mostly been carried out according to the plans. However, there has been less building, generally because of the population trend, and the planned areas in most cases have been sufficient up until now. Roads are only partly built; in some cases new plans have been made or earlier plans have been changed. Many industrial sites and some center and business areas have not been developed. In summary, my conclusions are that the master planning was useful for the municipalities I have studied, and probably in many rural Norwegian municipalities.
