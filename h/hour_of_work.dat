[...] He had always made plans since he was a small boy; for poverty, and the fact that he was the eldest son of a large family, had given him the habit of thinking of spring and summer, autumn and winter, as so many stages in a prolonged campaign. Although he was still under thirty, this forecasting habit had marked two semicircular lines above his eyebrows, which threatened, at this moment, to crease into their wonted shapes. But instead of settling down to think, he rose, took a small piece of cardboard marked in large letters with the word OUT, and hung it upon the handle of his door. This done, he sharpened a pencil, lit a reading-lamp and opened his book. But still he hesitated to take his seat. He scratched the rook, he walked to the window; he parted the curtains, and looked down upon the city which lay, hazily luminous, beneath him. He looked across the vapors in the direction of Chelsea; looked fixedly for a moment, and then returned to his chair. But the whole thickness of some learned counsel's treatise upon Torts did not screen him satisfactorily. Through the pages he saw a drawing-room, very empty and spacious; he heard low voices, he saw women's figures, he could even smell the scent of the cedar log which flamed in the grate. His mind relaxed its tension, and seemed to be giving out now what it had taken in unconsciously at the time. He could remember Mr. Fortescue's exact words, and the rolling emphasis with which he delivered them, and he began to repeat what Mr. Fortescue had said, in Mr. Fortescue's own manner, about Manchester. His mind then began to wander about the house, and he wondered whether there were other rooms like the drawing-room, and he thought, inconsequently, how beautiful the bathroom must be, and how leisurely it was--the life of these well-kept people, who were, no doubt, still sitting in the same room, only they had changed their clothes, and little Mr. Anning was there, and the aunt who would mind if the glass of her father's picture was broken. Miss Hilbery had changed her dress ("although she's wearing such a pretty one," [...] he heard her mother say), and she was talking to Mr. Anning, who was well over forty, and bald into the bargain, about books. How peaceful and spacious it was; and the peace possessed him so completely that his muscles slackened, his book drooped from his hand, and he forgot that the <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was wasting minute by minute.|$|E

Hence, children in the household seem to contribute to behavioral differences in terms <b>of</b> the <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> men and women.

30|$|Is BMI {{related to}} <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> through {{marriage}} market mechanisms? We empirically explore this issue {{using data from}} the NLSY 79 and NLSY 97 and a number of estimation strategies (including OLS, IV, and sibling FE). Our IV estimates (with same-sex sibling’s BMI as an instrument and a large set of controls including wage) suggest that a one-unit increase in BMI leads to an almost 2 % increase in White married women’s <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> However, BMI is not associated with <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> married men. We also find that a one-unit increase in BMI leads to a 1.4 % increase in White single women’s <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> suggesting that single women may expect future in-marriage transfers that vary by body weight. We show that the positive association between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> White single women increases with self-assessed probability of future marriage and varies with expected cumulative spousal income. Comparisons between the association between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for White and Black married women suggest a possible racial gap in intra-marriage transfers from husbands to wives.|$|R
30|$|We use {{three types}} of {{regression}} methods: ordinary least squares (OLS), IV, and sibling fixed effect (FE) to establish a relation between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> First, we use OLS regressions to show the association between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> To decipher whether the relation between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is driven by labor markets or marriage markets, we run regressions that either include market wage or not. Wage tends to be lower for high-BMI people (Cawley 2004). Own wage effects can generate both a substitution effect and an income effect on <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> If wage {{is included in the}} regression, we can expect that the entire effect of body weight operates via marriage markets. In contrast, if own wage is not controlled for, body weight can affect <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> via marriage market effects as well as wage.|$|R

30|$|To {{examine whether}} body weight is {{associated}} with <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{in the labor market}} and possible causal links behind this association, we analyze US data from the NLSY 79 and NLSY 97. We use OLS, IV (with sibling BMI serving as an instrument for own BMI), and sibling FE regressions. Higher body weight (BMI) could affect <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> via mechanisms related to labor markets or marriage markets. Our conceptual framework leads us to expect that <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> will be associated positively with body weight as part of marriage market processes rewarding thinness, including in-marriage transfers. Given traditional gender roles, married women {{would be more likely to}} receive intra-marriage income transfers than married men, and thus, the <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> married women would be associated more positively with high BMI than the <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> married men. We find that using the IV method and controlling for wage, a one-unit increase in BMI leads to an almost 2 % increase in White married women’s <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> but BMI is not associated with <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> married men. This is consistent with our marriage market interpretations and dominance of traditional gender roles over egalitarian roles. We also raise the possibility that White married women benefit more from intra-marriage transfers than minority married women, possibly as a function of racial discrimination in marriage markets. Our findings of a strong association between BMI and <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for White married women, but no such association for Black or Hispanic married women, are consistent with the existence of ethnic discrimination in marriage markets.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the {{theoretical and empirical}} predictions of the effects <b>of</b> reductions in <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on wages and employment, the economic efficiency arguments for such reductions and the related issue of the determination <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in a bargaining framework. The conventional approach, assumes that workers will want to maintain their incomes in the face <b>of</b> reductions in <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> per period. This is difficult to justify theoretically, when hours and union/worker utility are taken properly into account. Rather, unions and workers that desire reductions in <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> are likely to opt for the same or even a reduced hourly wage, leading to a significant employment effect of any such measure. We show that this result is true in labour markets and economies where unions determine or bargain over the wage and in models where firms set the wage because it affects their workers' productivity. It is also true when firms demand positive overtime, when such models account properly for the long-run movement <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The thesis examines also the determination <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> employment and wages in a bargaining framework and shows that the employment effects of unionism {{are likely to be}} overestimated when no account is taken <b>of</b> the <b>hours</b> determination procedure. This allows us also to provide an economic rationale for union behaviour regarding reductions in <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and maximum <b>hours</b> legislation and determine the conditions under which reductions in standard <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can increase union utility and firm profits. Finally, empirical evidence is provided with a test {{of the relationship between the}} hourly wage and weekly <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> using aggregate data.
