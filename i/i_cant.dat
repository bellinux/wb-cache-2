Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box".

2500|$|The {{two boys}} {{got into trouble}} with the law for {{breaking}} into a locked van and stealing computers. In January 1998, they were charged with mischief, breaking and entering, trespassing, and theft. They both left good impressions on the juvenile officers, who offered to expunge their criminal records if they agreed to attend a diversionary program to include community service, received psychiatric treatment, and obeyed the law. Harris was required to attend anger management classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. They were so well-behaved that their probation officer discharged them from the program a few months earlier than the due date. Of Harris, it was remarked that he was [...] "a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life", while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but [...] "needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream." [...] On April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month. In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: [...] "Isnt america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free, <b>I</b> <b>cant</b> deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting {{in the front seat of}} his fucking van in plain sight in the middle of fucking nowhere on a fri-fucking-day night?
