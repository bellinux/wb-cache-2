Stacked legs flown between early June and mid-August into the moist southwesterly monsoon flow and the dry northeasterly flow of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) above, enable us to study {{the interaction between the}} two flows at the turbulence scale {{and the role of the}} planetary boundary layer (PBL) in the transfers between them. We describe the fluctuations observed at the top of the PBL and their evolution during the season. <b>Dry</b> <b>tongues</b> approximately 600 m wide and a few kilometres apart, intruding from the overlying SAL down into the PBL, are characteristic of the Sahelian region at that time of year. They are fully part of the entrainment process at the PBL top and responsible for large moisture fluxes in the upper PBL. They also skew the water vapour distribution which in turn impacts the water vapour scales. We evaluate the impact of the entrainment by use of a conditional analysis on combined fluctuations. The <b>dry</b> <b>tongues</b> play the largest role down to two thirds of the PBL depth. We find larger entrainment during early monsoon than during its active phase, and a large variability of the ratio of entrainment buoyancy flux over surface flux.

60|$|Then {{the deputy}} {{on the kitchen}} floor rolled over with an appalling snort, struggled, {{stretched}} himself, and awoke. A healthy animal, he had shaken off the fumes of liquor with a <b>dry</b> <b>tongue</b> and a thirst for water and fresh air. He raised his knees and rubbed his eyes. The water bucket was missing from the corner. Well, he knew where the spring was, and a turn out of the close and stifling kitchen would do him good. He yawned, put on his boots softly, opened the back door, and stepped out. Everything was dark, but above and around him, to the very level of his feet, all apparently pricked with bright stars. The bulk of the barn rose dimly before him on the right, to the left was the spring. He reached it, drank, dipped his head and hands in it, and arose refreshed. The dry, wholesome breath that blew over this flat disk around him, rimmed with stars, did the rest. He began to saunter slowly back, the only reminiscence of his evening's potations being the figure he recalled of his pretty hostess, with bare arms and lifted glasses, imitating the barkeeper. A complacent smile straightened his yellow mustache. How she kept glancing at him and watching him, the little witch! Ha! no wonder! What could she find in the surly, slinking, stupid brute yonder? (The gentleman here alluded to was his host.) But the deputy had not been without a certain provincial success with the fair. He was true to most men, and fearless to all.

60|$|One old {{hunter who}} has a <b>dry</b> <b>tongue,</b> who used to come to bathe in Walden once every year when the water was warmest, and at such times looked in upon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one {{afternoon}} and {{went out for a}} cruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked the Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him. Some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit, hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods. Late in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden, he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still pursuing the fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer, now from Well Meadow, now from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood still and listened to their music, so sweet to a hunter's ear, when suddenly the fox appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and still, keeping the round, leaving his pursuers far behind; and, leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening, {{with his back to the}} hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the latter's arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled, and whang!--the fox, rolling over the rock, lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but, spying the dead fox, she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked round and round him in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by the mystery. Then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst, and the mystery was solved. They waited in silence while he skinned the fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the woods again. That evening a Weston squire came to the Concord hunter's cottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined it and departed. He did not find his hounds that night, but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farmhouse for the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure early in the morning.|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been given to the potential negative impacts of the Saharan air layer (SAL) in recent years. Researchers recently raised questions about the negative impacts of Dunion and Velden and other studies in terms of storms that reached at least tropical storm strength and suggested that the SAL was an intrinsic part of the tropical cyclone environment for both storms that weaken after formation and those that intensify. Braun also suggested that several incorrect assumptions underlie many of the studies on the negative impacts of the SAL, including assumptions that most low-to-midlevel dry tropical air is SAL air, that the SAL is dry throughout its depth, and that the proximity of the SAL to storms struggling to intensify implies some role in that struggle. The recent paper by Reale et al. (RL 1) {{is an example of the}} problems inherent in some of these assumptions. In their paper, RL 1 analyze a simulation from the Global Earth Observing System (GEOS- 5) global model and describe an extensive tongue of warm, dry air that stretches southward from at least 30 deg N (the northern limit of their plots) and wraps into a low pressure system during the period 26 - 29 August 2006, suppressing convection and possibly development of the African easterly wave associated with that low pressure system. They attributed the warm, <b>dry</b> <b>tongue</b> to the SAL (i. e., heating of the air mass during passage over the Sahara and radiative warming of the dust layer). Whether it was their intention, the implication is that this entire feature is due solely to the SAL and not to other possible sources of dry air or warmth. In addition, they suggested that a cool tongue of air in the boundary layer located directly beneath the elevated warm, <b>dry</b> <b>tongue</b> (forming a thermal dipole) was possibly the result of reduced solar radiation caused by an overlying dust layer. They stated that "the cool anomaly in the lower levels does not have any plausible explanation relying only on transport. " In this comment, evidence from satellite and global meteorological analyses is presented that casts considerable doubt upon RL 1 s interpretation of the GEOS- 5 forecasts and their conclusion that the results implied a negative role of the SAL. We show that the major portion of the warm, dry air aloft was located in a nearly dust-free slot between two Saharan dust outbreaks, had a significant source from the midlatitudes (> 30 N), and was likely driven by strong subsidence warming and drying. In addition, when wind fields are examined in a reference frame moving with the wave, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) global meteorological analyses suggest that the cool tongue in the boundary layer can be readily explained by transport of cooler air from higher latitudes. At the very least, it offers a plausible alternative explanation for the cool tongue that does not rely on radiative impacts of the dust...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ex-amine the accuracy of the assess-ment of clinical dehydration in children with type 1 diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA remains the sin-gle most common cause of diabetes-related death in childhood (1). Accurate assessment and management of dehydra-tion is the cornerstone of DKA treatment (1, 2). The assessment of the degree of dehydration has traditionally been ac-cording to clinical criteria including pe-ripheral tissue perfusion and indicators of hemodynamic status (3). The clinical as-sessment of dehydration in children in common nonacidotic states (e. g., gastro-enteritis) has been previously shown (4) to overestimate the degree of dehydration by 3. 2 %. There have been no compa-rable studies in either DKA or any other form of metabolic acidosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We studied a random convenience sample of 37 children with type 1 diabetes, newly or previously diag-nosed, who presented to the Royal Chil-dren’s Hospital, Melbourne, with DKA. The patients were all 18 years of age and presented to the emergency department at Royal Children’s Hospital between 1996 and 2000. The study entry criteria were pH 7. 30 (capillary, venous, or ar-terial) and/or bicarbonate 15 mmol/l and ketones in the urine on dipstick test-ing. The following information was re-corded by the primary assessing doctor: newly diagnosed or established diabetes, age, sex, date and time seen, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pale and/or cool hands and feet, peripheral capillary refill time, reduced skin turgor, level of consciousness (on a rating scale of one to eight), sunken eyes, sunken fonta-nelle, <b>dry</b> <b>tongue,</b> Kussmaul breathing, blood glucose level, and estimated degree of dehydration (clinical assessment).

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} is a summary of {{syndrome}} types of gastric cancer in order of priority based on clinical practical situations, routine clinical syndrome differentiation and a large-sample clinical survey in 767 patients with gastric cancer. Methods: Based on the six-type classification of gastric cancer in a previous study, a bedside syndrome differentiation diagnosis was made simultaneously by two attending doctors of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to avoid possible diagnostic bias. A clinical differentiation survey form designed {{under the direction of}} epidemiologists was filled out by patients with gastric cancer in multiple centers, and the results were digitally valued and statistically analyzed. Results: The symptoms and signs in each syndrome type of gastric cancer were ranked in order of priority as follows: distended pain, stringy pulse, eructation, mood-related pain, susceptibility to anger, acid regurgitation, hiccup, fullness sensation or distension after eating just a little, dizziness, thin pulse, abdominal enlargement, obstruction sensation after eating, moving pain, and uneven pulse in disharmony between liver and stomach; dark red tongue with little fur or a smooth surface, burning pain, rapid pulse, associated burning heat in anus, dry mouth, fissured tongue, thin pulse, tidal fever in the afternoon, nausea and vomiting, and night sweating in impairment of yin due to stomach heat; slender tongue fur, obstruction after eating, slow pulse, moderate pulse, rapid and irregular pulse, normal mood, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cold extremities, lower-extremity edema, cold intolerance, pale complexion, dizziness, emaciation, hiccup, silence, nausea, uneven pulse, acid regurgitation, fullness sensation or distension after eating just a little, vomiting, and constipation in deficiency-cold in spleen and stomach; uneven pulse, stabbing pain, tortuous sublingual vein, blue or purplish tongue, fixed pain, tarry stool or dark red stool, vomiting of dark red fluid, pale complexion, dry mouth without desire to drink, stringy pulse, white tongue fur, nausea, thin tongue fur, colic pain, hiccup, dizziness, acid regurgitation, bitter taste in mouth, slow pulse, rapid and irregular pulse, thin pulse, and pain relief by pressing in interior retention of toxin stagnation; slippery pulse, greasy and thick tongue fur, dry mouth without desire to drink, vomiting of bilious fluid, nausea, bitter taste in mouth, fullness sensation or distension after eating just a little, colic pain, and hiccup in stagnation of phlegm-dampness; abdominal pain relief by pressing, map-like tongue, thin pulse, weakness, yellowish complexion, dizziness, spontaneous sweating, fissured tongue, epigastric discomfort, night sweating, emaciation, cold intolerance, constipation, nausea, and <b>dry</b> <b>tongue</b> in deficiency of both qi and blood.
