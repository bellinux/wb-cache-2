40|$|OBJECTIVE: To pilot an in-home unintentional injury hazard {{assessment}} tool and to quantify potential injury risks {{for young children}} in a low-income urban setting. METHODS: Two low-income neighbourhoods in Karachi, Pakistan, were mapped, and families {{with at least one}} child between the ages of 12 and 59 months were identified. Using existing available home injury risk information, an in-home injury risk assessment tool was drafted and tailored to the local setting. Home injury assessments were done in June-July 2010 after obtaining informed consent. RESULTS: Approximately 75. 4 % of mothers were educated through at least grade 12. The main risks identified were stoves within the reach of the child (n= 279, 55. 5 %), presence of open buckets in the bathroom (n= 240, 47. 7 %) within the reach of the child, and pedestal fans accessible to the child (n= 242, 48. 1 %). In terms of safety equipment, a <b>first-aid</b> <b>box</b> with any basic item was present in 70 % of households, but only 4. 8 % of households had a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. CONCLUSIONS: This {{was the first time that}} an in-home, all-unintentional injury risk assessment tool was tailored and applied in the context of a low-income community in Pakistan. There was a significant burden of hazards present in the homes in these communities, representing an important opportunity for injury prevention.
