5000|$|Piercy {{supported}} the west Eugene extension of Lane Transit District's Bus Rapid Transit system, having {{voted for it}} in her capacity as city representative to the regional Metropolitan Planning Commission. All local jurisdictions have been proponents of the <b>EmX</b> <b>system</b> for over a decade. Two segments were completed and were successful. This mass transit system is built into all local planning documents. It {{is designed to be}} efficient and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>EmX</b> <b>system</b> {{is made up}} of {{sections}} of dedicated bus lanes for most of the route (60%), with normal roads in between. The vehicles are given signal priority via ground-loop signaling to the traffic control system, with special traffic signals at intersections. The vehicles have two sets of doors on the left and three on the right, allowing loading from platforms on either side. Most of the right hand side platforms can only accommodate the rear two doors. Riding the Emerald Express was free when it began operations, but now costs regular fare. The vehicles are equipped with continuously variable transmission which allows for quick but smooth acceleration from stops and through the various road segments.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the relatively small body of literature on property value impacts of BRT in the U. S. by conducting a case study on Lane Transit District’s EmX BRT service in Eugene, Oregon, using econometric modeling techniques to estimate changes in property values associated with the BRT. The analysis is based on hedonic price regression analysis, where sale prices are modeled using several property characteristics {{that contribute to the}} market or sale price. The findings of this research indicate that the <b>EmX</b> BRT <b>system</b> does positively impact surrounding single-family home sale prices...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an industrial communicator for synchronization and control of electrical drive controllers with the interface of RS 232 or CANopen. Hardware of communicator uses the <b>EMX</b> development <b>system</b> by GHI Electronics. Communicator software is implemented in C# by the. NET Micro Framework. Communicator allows user to adjust and control up to four electric motor drives. After a successful connection with each unit, communicator can control its position, which specify the number of revolutions to the nearest thousandth of a turn. Communicator also periodically finds out and displays the current position of the connected units. User operates the communicator with GUI, application instructions are entered via the touch screen or buttons...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I studied the {{expression}} pattern of Emx 2 OS, the antisense {{partner of the}} homeobox gene Emx 2, in the developing mouse nervous <b>system.</b> <b>Emx</b> 2 OS was detectable in telencephalon, mammillary recess, mesencephalon, nasal pits and otic vesicle, all of them also expressing Emx 2. Within dorsal telencephalon, Emx 2 OS peaked in post-mitotic neurons, specifically {{at the time when}} they completed radial migration and turned Emx 2 off. Such pattern suggested that Emx 2 OS may be implicated in regulation of Emx 2, according to complex and even antithetic ways. By artificially modulating Emx 2 OS in primary cortico-cerebral precursors, via lentiviral RNAi and somatic transgenesis, we found that such transcript contributes to down-regulation of its sense partner, possibly by a Dicer-dependent posttranscriptional mechanism. On the other side, by ectopically activating Emx 2 OS in primary rhombo-spinal precursors, we elicited a robust activation of Emx 2. Further inspection of Emx 2 null cortices conversely showed a collapse of Emx 2 OS expression. Taken together, these results suggest that a mutual positive loop involving Emx 2 and Emx 2 OS is necessary to adequate expression of either transcript in the early neural tube...|$|R
40|$|As bus {{rapid transit}} (BRT) grows in {{popularity}} in the United States, {{a better understanding of}} the mode’s impacts on land uses and property values is needed. Economic theory suggests, and literature has shown, that people are willing to pay higher housing costs to lower their costs of transportation to areas of economic activity. Does high-quality BRT service reliably provide such access and, thereby, increase residential property values? The hypothesis is that property values are higher closer to BRT stations, reflecting a premium for the access provided by the BRT service to various goods, services, employment, education, and recreation. There has been some work on this topic outside of the U. S.; however, due to various cultural, social, and institutional differences, those experiences may not be applicable to U. S. property values. The literature includes, to date, very little work on U. S. BRT systems’ impacts on property values using robust econometric techniques and/or spatial modeling. Further, because every BRT system is different, it is necessary to analyze additional case studies to provide a more robust understanding of how modern U. S. experiences with BRT services may affect surrounding property values. This research contributes to the relatively small body of literature on property value impacts of BRT in the U. S. by conducting a case study on Lane Transit District’s EmX BRT service (Eugene, Oregon) using econometric modeling techniques to estimate changes in property values associated with the BRT. The analysis is based on hedonic price regression analysis, where sale prices are modeled using several property characteristics that contribute to the market or sale price. The findings of this research indicate that the <b>EmX</b> BRT <b>system</b> does positively impact surrounding single-family home sale prices. Results are statistically significant yet, as expected, relatively small in magnitude. An interesting finding is that the impact of the EmX stations on property values increased in each of the three periods examined in this study. For 2005 single-family home sales, the price increased $ 823 on average for every 100 meters closer to a station. In 2010, the marginal impact increased to an average of $ 1, 056 for every 100 meters closer to a station. In 2016, every 100 meters closer to a station adds an average of $ 1, 128 to a home’s sale price. These results provide further insight into how BRT services can enhance the livability and economic development in a community, and provide policymakers and the transit industry throughout the U. S. with the best information possible to make informed transit investment decisions in their communities...|$|R
