40|$|Geochemistry {{has become}} {{increasingly}} successful in the detection of certain types of ore deposits, and recently special {{attention has been given}} to the distribution of mercury. Its ease of migration makes it useful not only in an indirect search for several kinds of mineral raw materials but also in the investigation of tectonic processes and the processes and time of formation of ore deposits. This article discusses the use of geo-chemistry at Idrija, Yugoslavia, for finding ore bodies and to investigate other geologic problems, especially tectonically caused secondary aureoles, the determination of the threshold of mercury anomalies, and the vertical and areal distribution of mercury in the soil caused by contamination of the surface by mercury from a smelting plant. I NTRODUCTIO N T•E primary dispersal aureole of mercury can be divided into regional and local types on the basis of size and composition. The regional <b>dispersion</b> <b>aureole</b> embraces a larger area than local types related to an ore deposit, but the regional type is not defined by its extent in various directions but only by the general threshold values that characterize it. In detail, a local <b>dispersion</b> <b>aureole</b> represents an anomaly around individual mineral bodies in the frame-work of a regional one, and is limited merely by its own threshold. Such a <b>dispersion</b> <b>aureole</b> extends significantly in a certain direction, which reflects various structural elements. The formation of some aureoles is related to certain mineralization processes, but they are not developed in the regions of economic mineralization exclusively, and include broader territories around the ore deposit. Consequently, the elements that have great mobility are well suited for use in geochemical prospecting methods, and mercury is pre-eminent among those elements that give large and significant aureoles. This fact was determined first by Saukov (27), and his conclusions were confirmed by the results of numerous researches uch as those of Ver•kovskaja (33) ...|$|E
40|$|Stream {{sediment}} {{surveys were}} undertaken {{south of the}} Derbyshire limestone mass and north Leicestershire. The samples were analysed {{for a wide range}} of elements using a direct reading spectrometer. The analytical results were interpreted with the aid of computer-orientated techniques particularly, univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The univariate method used involved breaking down complex elemental distributions into discrete populations. The separated populations were then related to various causitive factors of the geological environment. The multivariate methods of cluster and principal components analyses were extensively used. From the application of Q-mode cluster analysis several criteria were deduced that may be useful in the interpretation of multi-element geochemical data. The results of the surreys showed some distinct elemental and sample associations that can be related to the effects of the secondary environment, bedrock and mineralization. Several areas were found deserving further attention. The Tickow Lane occurrence near Shepshed in Leicestershire showed a conspicuous enrichment of lead and molybdenum within the Triassic sandstones. The highest concentrations of lead and molybdenum were found in the grey sandstone below a dark brown layer. The apparent logarithmic decay pattern of certain elements across the stratigraphy and the clamming effect of finer sediments could imply a general downward percolation of metalliferous, solutions. Primary dispersion studies were also conducted on the limestone wallrocks adjacent to lead-zinc deposits in Derbyshire. Mineralogical, geochemical and thermoluminescence aureoles were determined from wallrock samples from five localities. The results showed very limited primary <b>dispersion</b> <b>aureoles</b> of quartz, fluorite and the wide range of elements determined. Natural, irradiated and deteriorated thermo- luminescence patterns were inconsistent and no diagnostic features were noted to indicate the presence of mineralized veins...|$|R
40|$|The {{variations}} in the trace elements Rb, F, Pb, Sr, Mn, Zr, Zn, Cu, Ni and Fe have been studied in limestone wallrocks next to lead - zinc - fluorite - barite mineralization in the Northern Pennine Orefield and Derbyshire Orefield; and next to haematite orebodies in the Cumberland Ironfieldo. Trace element aureoles have also been investigated in sandstones and shales. An analytical technique for the determination of fluorine in limestones was developed using the optical emission spectrograph, and found to give satisfactory results. Standard X-ray fluorescence techniques were employed for {{the determination of the}} other trace elements. The petrology, mineralogy and chemistry of certain aureoles have been examined in detail. The heavy metal content of the limestone wallrocks in the majority of cases, illustrates widespread and irregular dispersion patterns. It is suggested that migration of the metals has taken place through fractures developed prior to, or contemporaneously with, the mineralization. Diffusion of the heavy metals has occurred into massive country rocks at certain localities and results in a logarithmic decrease in concentration away from the ore and more restricted aureoles. The width of the dispersion patterns varies next to the veins, but in general a wider aureole is developed in Derbyshire than in the Alston Block. It is concluded that, at the time of emplacement, the Derbyshire veins were at a higher pressure than the veins in the Alston Block, but that variation in the temperature of the ore solutions was not an important parameter controlling the migration of the heavy metals. The alteration of the limestone wallrocks is discussed and suggestions are put forward to explain the possible origin of some of the replacement minerals. Adjacent to the veins, a depletion in strontium is recorded. This is related to the recrystallisation of the calcite which has liberated strontium from the crystal lattice. The strontium content of the Great Limestone and the D(_ 2) Limestone, the respective sampling horizons in the Alston Block and the Derbyshire area, are considerably different and it is concluded that this reflects either the original aragonite content of the limestones, or differing conditions of deposition in the two areas. Migration by diffusion into massive country rocks has occurred in the Cumberland Ironfield to far greater distances than in the Pennine Orefields; the depletion of strontium is also more extensive. It is suggested that the ore solutions were emplaced at higher temperatures than in the Pennine Orefields. The trace element aureoles in sandstone and shale wallrocks indicate that the heavy metals have been migrated through fractures, as irregular and widespread patterns are observed. A comparative study was conducted on the trace element variations which occur next to the veins which intersect the Whin Sill (quartz- dolerite) in the Alston Block. Contrary to previously reported widespread <b>dispersion</b> <b>aureoles</b> in igneous rocks, a narrow aureole is formed where diffusion has taken place into the wallrocks. A profound chemical change between the unaltered and altered quartz- dolerite has occurred where CO(_ 2), K(_ 2) O and H(_ 2) O are enriched, while Na(_ 2) O, MgO, total iron and CaO are depleted. The quartz-dolerite has been converted into a carbonate and clay-rich rock called the White Whin. The chemical and mineralogical variations are related to the {{variations in}} the trace elements where Rb, Ba, Pb and Zn are concentrated while Cu, Ni, Zr, Sr, V and Cr are depleted next to the veins. A geological and geophysical survey over altered and mineralised quartz-dolerite dykes at Closehouse mine, Lunedale near Middleton-in- Teesdale has produced results, which, it is hoped, will elucidate the complexities of the area...|$|R
