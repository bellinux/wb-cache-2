5|$|Brighton Forum {{is built}} on a high, {{prominent}} corner position, giving it <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> from the west and south and long southward views. Knapped flint is the main building material, augmented by stone dressings and some yellow brickwork to the quoins. The roof is laid with tiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{cockpit of}} the XR-1 seated the aircraft's two crew members in a tandem arrangement, the pilot located {{ahead of the}} observer, and was {{extensively}} glazed to provide <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> in the aircraft's intended observation and army co-operation role. During {{the development of the}} aircraft, Major General Robert M. Danford proposed to the War Department that the XR-1 be evaluated against the Stinson YO-54 and the Kellett YG-1B autogyro.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientists}} wanted <b>good</b> <b>visibility,</b> low humidity, light winds at low {{altitude and}} westerly winds at high altitude for the test. The best weather was predicted between July 18 and 21, but the Potsdam Conference {{was due to}} start on July 16 and President Harry S. Truman wanted the test to be conducted before the conference began. It was therefore scheduled for July 16, the earliest date at which the bomb components would be available.|$|E
30|$|In these anatomically {{difficult}} conditions, a piezo surgery device provides <b>good</b> intraoperative <b>visibility</b> and a {{safe and}} precise osteotomy due to its micrometric characteristics and selective cut [9].|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is known}} for its pure water and has uniquely <b>good</b> {{underwater}} <b>visibility</b> for a Finnish lake, easily extending to 6 - 10 m from the surface on calm and sunny days.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Rayleigh interferometer is its simple construction. Its drawbacks are (i) it requires a point or line source of light for <b>good</b> fringe <b>visibility,</b> and (ii) the fringes must be viewed with high magnification.|$|R
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{postponed}} {{for several days}} after the 23 February rehearsal due to weather conditions, but on 27 February the weather proved to be ideal, with clear skies and <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> for the aircraft of 51 Squadron, and a full moon which would provide illumination for the evacuation of the raiding force. The naval force under Commander Cook departed from Britain during the afternoon, and the Whitley transport aircraft carrying C Company took off from RAF Thruxton in the evening.|$|E
5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the cab, and was low enough to provide <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight from}} Frankfurt to Riyadh was uneventful, and weather {{conditions}} at Riyadh were <b>good,</b> with sufficient <b>visibility.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The high driving {{position}} and large glass area affords drivers with <b>good</b> all-round <b>visibility,</b> while the rear lamps are mounted {{high up on}} the structure so other road users can see them more prominently. Doors are fitted with anti intrusion bars with child locks at the rear.|$|R
30|$|The CDI {{technique}} alone {{might provide}} a <b>good</b> structural <b>visibility</b> compared to normal and EDI scanning done separately {{in patients with}} uveitis with posterior segment pathology. CDI OCT technique is thus able to visualize all posterior structures in a single image in patients with uveitis with posterior segment manifestations.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{is located}} in a rural location, on the hilltop with dense vegetation, shrubs and bushes, {{structured}} in relation to the Guadiana River with <b>good</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Palais des Sports {{is one of}} {{the best}} venues in Paris and offers <b>good</b> {{acoustics}} and <b>visibility</b> wherever you are sitting.|$|R
50|$|The HA set new {{standards}} in its day for lightweight, easy to operate controls, a slick short gearchange, lightweight steering and clutch pedal, <b>good</b> all-round <b>visibility</b> and relatively nippy performance. It {{was one of}} the first cars to be actively marketed towards women, perhaps as a result of these perceived benefits for them.|$|R
40|$|There exist several pulsed TV-holography {{techniques}}. Single pulse techniques give <b>good</b> fringe <b>visibility</b> {{but a large}} sensitivity {{for environmental}} instability. Double pulse techniques are much less sensitive to instabilities but normally yield a poorer fringe quality. New subtraction techniques, improving this visibility are introduced, and their features compared to the conventional pulsed TV-holography techniques. 1...|$|R
25|$|The armored cockpit was {{relatively}} roomy and comfortable, offering <b>good</b> <b>visibility.</b> A modern-day U.S. ground-attack aircraft, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, takes {{its name from}} the P-47.|$|E
25|$|Most {{heritage}} railways {{only have}} short lines {{and do not}} often have turntables {{at both ends of}} the line. A tank locomotive has <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> for the driver in both directions. As the trains being hauled are usually light, the tank locomotive is more fuel efficient than a large tender locomotive.|$|E
25|$|This group covers vegetation. White is {{typically}} open runnable forest. Green means {{a forest of}} low visibility with reduced running speed, being graded from slow running, through difficult running, to impassable. Yellow colour shows open areas. Green vertical stripes are used to indicate undergrowth (slow or difficult running) but otherwise with <b>good</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E
50|$|In transport, driver {{visibility}} is {{the maximum}} distance {{at which the}} driver of a vehicle can see and identify prominent objects around the vehicle. Visibility is primarily determined by weather conditions (see visibility) and by a vehicle's design. The parts of a vehicle that influence visibility include the windshield, the dashboard and the pillars. <b>Good</b> driver <b>visibility</b> is essential to safe road traffic.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1938, the Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO) searched unsuccessfully for a {{suitable}} engine {{for its new}} [...] "safe" [...] airplane, the Ercoupe. ERCO hired Harold Morehouse, former engineer in charge of small engine design at Continental Motors, to design a new engine. He {{came up with the}} inverted, in-line IL-116, which provided <b>good</b> pilot <b>visibility</b> and enhanced aircraft streamlining.|$|R
50|$|The airline {{is opposed}} to {{relocation}} of its hub, citing the costs of such a move and consistently favourable weather conditions at Kangerlussuaq, located deep inland, about 30 km {{from the edge of}} the Greenland ice sheet (Sermersuaq). The airline argues that the infrastructure at Kangerlussuaq is <b>good,</b> and <b>visibility</b> is not hampered by the coastal fogs, storms, heavy snowfall, and frequent turbulence in particular.|$|R
25|$|The Chevette's 1.3 litre {{engine and}} {{relatively}} small bodyshell allowed for good performance. The Chevette had a light steering, clutch and gearchange, {{as well as}} <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> and was spacious inside. The Chevette's success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars like the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, and saloon models which suited families, estate car for the service fleets and the 'Chevanne', van version for all other utility purposes.|$|E
25|$|Transport to {{the island}} is {{provided}} by C-130 Hercules military transport planes operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force that land at Jan Mayensfield's gravel runway. The planes fly in from Bodø Main Air Station eight times a year. Since the airport {{does not have any}} instrument landing capabilities, <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> is required, and {{it is not uncommon for}} the planes to have to return to Bodø, two hours away, without landing. For heavy goods, freight ships visit during the summer, but since there are no harbours, the ships must anchor.|$|E
25|$|In early 1917, the Peterborough based {{woodworking}} {{company of}} Frederick Sage & Company designed a two-seat patrol floatplane for the Royal Naval Air Service based on Sage's Type 3 landplane trainer. Like the Type 3, the new design, the Sage Type 4, was a single-engined biplane. Pilot and observer sat in separate tandem cockpits, with the pilot occupying the front cockpit,while the wireless operator/observer {{sat in the}} rear cockpit, with both crew members having <b>good</b> <b>visibility.</b> The aircraft was powered by a single 150hp (112kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 water-cooled V-8 engine in the nose driving a tractor propeller. Undercarriage consisted of two main floats under the wing the a further tail float.|$|E
50|$|The new car's {{appearance}} {{was similar to}} that of the JS1. Bodywork was again by Frua, but Guy Ligier insisted that the proportions of the cabin be adjusted so that the car was not too wide and had a low centre of gravity and <b>good</b> outward <b>visibility.</b> His requirement that it also be practical necessitated wide doors for ease of access and a usable trunk.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Allegro 2000 model has been praised for its {{aesthetic}} appeal, <b>good</b> cockpit <b>visibility,</b> light controls, operating economics and value, wide speed range, range and payload as well as enjoyable flight characteristics. It {{has been criticized for}} its poor ergonomic accommodation for taller pilots and also for poor control harmony, with the elevator controls much lighter than the ailerons, which are in turn much lighter than the rudder pedals.|$|R
25|$|The Battle was {{a robust}} {{aircraft}} which was frequently {{described as being}} easy to fly, even for relatively inexperienced pilots. The pilot was provided with overall <b>good</b> external <b>visibility</b> and the cockpit {{was considered to be}} roomy and comfortable for the era; however, the task of simultaneously deploying the flaps and the retractable undercarriage, which included a safety catch, has been highlighted as posing considerable complication. Climate control within the cockpit was also reportedly a less-than-desirable state of affairs.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, the {{aircraft}} was on a flight from Milan Malpensa Airport to Blackbushe Airport with three passengers, all Saudi nationals, and one crew member, the pilot (a Jordanian), on board. The passengers were Rajaa Hashim, one of the wives of Osama bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (who had died in an aircraft crash in the 1960s), as well as her daughter Sana Hashim and Sana's husband Zuhair Hashim. The aircraft involved had no prior incidents; weather conditions for the approach into Blackbushe Airport were warm and sunny, with very <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> and winds from the south.|$|E
25|$|The Hürkuş will be {{equipped}} for {{day and night}} flying as well as basic pilot training, instrument flying, navigation training, weapons and formation training. The aircraft will have <b>good</b> <b>visibility</b> from both cockpits with a 50 degree down-view angle from the rear cockpit, cabin pressurization (nominal 4.16 psid), Martin-Baker Mk T-16 N 0/0 ejection seats, an onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS), an Environmental Control System (Vapor Cycle Cooling), an anti-G system, high shock absorbing landing gear for training missions, and Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS). Microtecnica of Turin, Italy has been selected to provide the aircraft's environmental control system. The Hürkuş has been designed for a 35-year service life.|$|E
25|$|No. 24 Squadron {{was then}} re-equipped with the Airco DH.5. The DH.5 was unusual in design {{with the top}} wing having a 'back stagger', behind the lower wing, to give the pilot <b>good</b> <b>visibility,</b> {{especially}} overhead. Given its lack of power (top speed was 102 miles per hour) and poor performance at higher altitudes, it was used more for ground attack than air combat. Nevertheless, it was while flying the DH.5 that Woollett destroyed three more German aircraft and drove another down 'out of control'. On 17 August 1917, he became an ace. He was posted back to England as a flight instructor at Eastbourne in August 1917. On 9 January 1918, {{he was awarded the}} Military Cross; a Bar in lieu of a second award would follow on 22 June.|$|E
5000|$|An Ariane 6 {{launch vehicle}} will lift ATHENA in 2028 {{into a large}} {{amplitude}} Halo orbit around [...] of the Sun-Earth system through a direct transfer burn. [...] was selected due to its stable thermal environment, <b>good</b> sky <b>visibility</b> and high observing efficiency. ATHENA is planned to perform scheduled observations of up to 300 celestial locations per year, with these observations lasting from half an hour up to over 11 days, though can be repointed to observe transient events.|$|R
5000|$|The JS1 {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} in September of 1969 at the Salon de l'Auto in Paris. [...] The {{car was a}} two-door fixed-head mid-engined coupé. The body was designed by Pietro Frua and executed in fibreglass, but Ligier had considerable input into the character of his first car. His requirements that the car be light and compact but with <b>good</b> forward <b>visibility</b> from the cabin resulted in the JS1 having a large cockpit and big sloping windshield.|$|R
2500|$|Camm's {{priority}} {{was to provide}} the pilot with <b>good</b> all-round <b>visibility.</b> To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below {{the trailing edge of}} the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material.|$|R
