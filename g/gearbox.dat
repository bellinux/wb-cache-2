5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse <b>gearbox</b> designed by American <b>gearbox</b> specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this <b>gearbox.</b> It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the <b>gearbox.</b> The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original <b>gearbox,</b> mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|At first Citroën {{decided not}} to offer their new {{automatic}} EGS6 <b>gearbox</b> version in the UK due to the unfavourable exchange rate and costs, although this changed after a small number were privately imported for insurance classification purposes.

5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) <b>gearbox,</b> originally designed for use with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine {{was more than the}} <b>gearbox</b> could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid <b>gearbox</b> breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different <b>Gearbox)</b> design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
5|$|The car used {{a revised}} and lighter {{version of the}} 6-speed <b>gearbox</b> {{designed}} for the BT45B. Brabham designed the <b>gearbox</b> casing, which was cast by Alfa Romeo and used Hewland gears.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life: Opposing Force is an {{expansion}} pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game {{was developed by}} <b>Gearbox</b> Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on November 19, 1999. Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life and was first announced in April 1999. Randy Pitchford, the lead designer on the game, later noted that he believed <b>Gearbox</b> was selected to develop Opposing Force because Valve wanted to concentrate on their future projects. Over the course of development, <b>Gearbox</b> brought {{in a variety of}} outside talent from other areas of the video games industry to help bolster various aspects of design.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Relic Entertainment {{was bought}} by THQ, which {{confirmed}} in 2007 that it had acquired {{the rights to the}} series from Relic and Sierra. No further game in the series was made before THQ declared bankruptcy in 2013; on April 22, 2013, <b>Gearbox</b> Software announced that they had bought the rights to the series at auction for US$1.35 million. On July 19, 2013, <b>Gearbox</b> announced the production of remakes of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as Homeworld HD, later renamed Homeworld Remastered Collection. The following month, collection producer Brian Burleson stated that <b>Gearbox</b> had purchased the property with the express purpose of making a collection including the original and remastered versions of the game. He also noted that neither game had code in a releasable or playable state when purchased, and they ended up recreating many of the original development tools {{with the assistance of the}} Homeworld mod community. A later posting by a developer at <b>Gearbox</b> further praised the mod community for their assistance in getting the original code to be playable on modern computers. The stand-alone expansion Homeworld: Cataclysm was not announced for a remake, despite the outspoken interest of <b>Gearbox,</b> as they were unable to find the original source code for the game.|$|E
5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central <b>gearbox</b> so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor <b>gearbox</b> fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E

5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed <b>gearbox</b> is fitted; a six-speed <b>gearbox</b> was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as {{rotor blade}} {{friction}} and drag, <b>gearbox</b> losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) {{proportional to the}} third power of velocity remains.|$|E
50|$|Other {{disadvantages}} {{stemmed from}} the use of two engines, this made controlling the tractor more difficult because of the need for two <b>gearboxes.</b> There were two engines and <b>gearboxes</b> to maintain and repair and the probability of breakdowns was increased.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game's development, <b>Gearbox</b> {{acquired}} various outside talent to assist in designing some aspects of the game. In June 1999, <b>Gearbox</b> announced that the successful level designer Richard Gray would be assisting in developing the multiplayer aspects of the game. Several other designers subsequently joined the project in September 1999, with collective experience from the development of Daikatana, Quake II, Doom and Shadow Warrior. In the subsequent two months, media releases displaying a variety of screenshots were unveiled. The game was released on November 19, 1999. <b>Gearbox</b> later released a multiplayer update in May 2000, adding a new capture the flag mode to the game, along with various new items to accompany the new mode. Opposing Force was later released on Valve Software's Steam content delivery system. Opposing Force was also published as part of Sierra's Half-Life: Generation compilation in 2002, and as part of Valve Software and Electronic Arts' Half Life 1: Anthology on September 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium <b>gearbox</b> and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the <b>gearbox</b> during the first free practice session.|$|E

50|$|Initially, a Getrag four-speed manual was the {{standard}} transmission fitment. Five-speed overdrive Getrag <b>gearboxes</b> were {{fitted as standard}} in 1980, but close ratio 'sport' <b>gearboxes</b> were available at the car's release as an option. Alternatively, purchasers could opt for the ZF 3 HP-22 three-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|The name Self-Changing Gears is {{sometimes}} confusing: the <b>gearboxes</b> {{are not fully}} automatic, selection of gear ratio remains a manual choice, but the gear-changing and any clutch control needed is automated.

5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new <b>gearbox</b> case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new <b>gearbox</b> casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their <b>gearbox</b> casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
