25|$|A {{preliminary}} inquiry {{was held in}} 2003, the testimony from which was covered by a publication ban until 2010. At the inquiry, the fact that Pickton {{had been charged with}} attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of prostitute Wendy Lynn Eistetter in 1997 was revealed. Eistetter testified at the inquiry that after he had driven her to the Port Coquitlam farm and <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> Pickton slapped a handcuff on her left hand and stabbed her in the abdomen. She stabbed Pickton in self defense. Later, both she and Pickton were treated at the same hospital, where staff used a key they found in Pickton's pocket to remove the handcuffs from the woman's wrist. The attempted-murder charge against Pickton was stayed on January 27, 1998, because the woman had drug addiction issues and prosecutors believed her too unstable for her testimony to help secure a conviction. The clothes and rubber boots Pickton had been wearing that evening were seized by police and left in an RCMP storage locker for more than seven years. Not until 2004 did lab testing show that the DNA of two missing women were on the items seized from Pickton in 1997.|$|E
25|$|In October, Kane began feuding with Triple H, {{leading to}} a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks {{preceding}} the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He claimed that after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating mock sex with a mannequin in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasised before the title match. Triple H defeated Kane at No Mercy, due to Triple H and Flair cheating, unifying the two titles. On the October 28 episode of Raw, Kane defeated Triple H in a non-title Casket match to end their feud. At Survivor Series, Kane participated in the first-ever Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Shawn Michaels. Kane was the 22nd entrant in the 2003 Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final three.|$|E

500|$|During {{their second}} meeting, Cisneros asked Martínez {{to cast a}} spell on Fischer. Martínez said {{she was unable to}} do that, and Cisneros grew angry and left the store. A few days later, Cisneros called Martínez and asked her to pray for Fischer to get back {{together}} with Cristina. Cisneros returned for a third visit to Martínez's shop in October 1992, and asked her if she knew anyone willing to beat up Fischer. By winter, she changed her request and asked to have Fischer killed, offering US$3,000 to the person who would do it. According to Martínez, Cisneros told her that Fischer had raped Cristina and was telling his classmates at St. Joe that he <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> However, Cristina said she never had sex with him. Although Garza assured Martínez that he would find someone to carry out the job, he kept calling and visiting her to discuss his marriage problems. Under pressure from Cisneros, Martínez would often interrupt the sessions with Garza to remind him of the plan. Garza lied to Martínez on several occasions telling her he had someone lined up to kill Fischer. Cisneros contacted Martínez in November to ask her why the job had not been done. Martínez responded that she did not know when the murder would be carried out. Garza eventually divorced his wife on January 4, 1993, and kept calling Martínez to tell her his personal problems had not been fixed. On January 9, he traveled to Brownsville from San Antonio to talk about the divorce, and Martínez reminded him that a client of hers wanted Fischer dead. She told him again that if he facilitated Fischer's murder, Garza's personal problems would be solved.|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after he <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, {{very happy with the}} 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2015, Virginia Roberts made {{allegations}} of sexual impropriety against the Duke in court papers related to a civil action in Florida arising from the Epstein affair, but to which the Duke was not a party. Roberts claimed that the Duke was among men, including [...] "a former prime minister" [...] and Alan Dershowitz, who <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> while she was a teenager. She alleged she was first introduced to and, for £10,000, had sex with the Duke {{on a trip to}} London in 2001, when she was 17 (which is above the age of consent in the United Kingdom), and again in New York (where the age of consent is 17). Flight logs show the Duke and Virginia Roberts were in the same places when she alleges sex happened. The Duke and Roberts were also photographed together with the Duke's arm round Roberts' waist. Roberts said she was pressured to have sex with the Duke and [...] "wouldn't have dared object" [...] and feared leaving, as she felt Epstein, through contacts, could have got her [...] "killed or abducted". The allegations have, as of early 2015, not been tested in any court, but Roberts repeated allegations against the Duke and against Epstein in a sworn legal statement under penalty of perjury.|$|E

2500|$|On 3April 1937, Puyi's younger {{full brother}} Prince Pujie was proclaimed heir {{apparent}} after marrying Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The marriage had been politically arranged by Shigeru Honjō, a {{general of the}} Kwantung Army. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly {{in front of his}} brother and refused to eat any food provided by Lady Hiro Saga, believing that she was out to poison him. Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese. Puyi initially thought that Lady Saga was a Japanese spy, but came to trust her after the Sinophile Saga discarded her kimono dresses for cheongsam dresses and she repeatedly assured him that she come to the Salt Tax Palace because she was Pujie's wife, not because she was a spy. Behr described Lady Saga as [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "level-headed", and noted the irony of Puyi snubbing the one Japanese who really wanted to be his friend. A sign of improved relations came when Puyi gave Lady Saga a diamond encrusted watch as a belated wedding present.
