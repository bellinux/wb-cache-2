Since then I have been buying the books of Rodriguez during occasional stops at Lima airport and now I have the great pleasure to present Gustavo <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chile.</b> Rodriguez is one of those voices that surprise precisely because he does not boast of nourishing from literature. Not reading him is not permitted as an indulgence." ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{universities}} are making extensive efforts to attract prospective {{students to the}} fields of electrical, electronic, and computer engineering. Thus, outreach is becoming increasingly important, and activities with schoolchildren are being extensively carried out {{as part of this}} effort. In this context, robotics is a very attractive and effective tool for fostering interest in science and technology among children and young people and for attracting them toward engineering. In this article, experience with different robotics-centered outreach activities in the Universidad de Chile (UCH), Santiago, Chile, will be shared. These activities include robotics courses for children, social robots as keynote speakers, mechatronics design courses, and participation in international robotics competitions, which contribute synergistically to the goal of attracting students to UCH’s Electrical Engineering (EE) Department. Owing to its novelty, the use of social robots as keynote speakers for schoolchildren will be described in detail. Experimental results that demonstrate how sophisticated social robots can be used to foster the interest of young people in technology will be shown. Altogether, more than 3000 schoolchildren have participated directly in these outreach activities <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chile,</b> creating a sizeable impact in this country. This work was supported by the Chilean Government under the Explora-CONICYT Program and by the Millennium Nucleus Center for Web Research, Chile, under Grant P 04 - 067 -F...|$|E

It then {{describes how}} long it took for state support to arrive and how the inhabitants were marginalized from planning and implementing the reconstruction processes. As a result, this poorly served their needs and priorities and failed to utilize their knowledge and organizational capacities. <b>Here</b> and elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>Chile,</b> postcatastrophe reconstruction processes miss the opportunity to improve living conditions for the affected communities and to develop policies for disaster management that incorporate and use their social capital...|$|R
60|$|Finally, I must observe, {{that though}} I have {{described}} between {{the town of}} Copiapo and the western flank of the main Cordillera seven or eight axes of elevation, extending nearly north and south, it must not be supposed that they all run continuously for great distances. As was stated {{to be the case}} in our sections across the Cordillera of Central Chile, so here most of the lines of elevation, {{with the exception of the}} first, third, and fifth, are very short. The stratification is everywhere disturbed and intricate; nowhere have I seen more numerous faults and dikes. The whole district, from the sea to the Cordillera, is more or less metalliferous; and I heard of gold, silver, copper, lead, mercury, and iron veins. The metamorphic action, even in the lower strata, has certainly been far less <b>here</b> than <b>in</b> Central <b>Chile.</b>|$|R
