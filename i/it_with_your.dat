500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} have found less to favor in Smith's second book, Court Duel, though reviews have still been mainly positive. It was noted by Carolyn Phelan of Booklist to be [...] "different in setting, structure, and tone" [...] from its predecessor, {{who added that}} [...] "readers who loved Crown Duel for its strongly realized fantasy world, adventurous characters, and scenes of action may find the sequel disappointing," [...] though she found Meliara to be [...] "as compelling as ever." [...] Ruth Cox of Emergency Librarian observed [...] "a flicker of the love/hate relationship often found in adult romance novels between Meliara and Shevraeth." [...] Contributing to Brigham Young's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson called the second part [...] "fast paced and intriguing," [...] and said it could [...] "stand on its own as an enthralling story." [...] Jo Walton believed that the second story's changing fashions and fan customs were [...] "done very well," [...] and added that the court's culture of terror felt real. She opined that [...] "Mel's eruption into their midst has in it something of the stranger coming to Versailles, and it's fascinating," [...] but called [...] "Mel's continued obliviousness to the identity of her mysterious Unknown correspondent" [...] "slightly implausible." [...] Walton concluded that the combined volume Crown Duel is [...] "a charming book with a solid background and a great first person voice. Give it to your twelve year old friends, and read <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> inner twelve-year-old eyes." [...] The publication Voice of Youth Advocates included Crown Duel in its list of [...] "fantasy for people who don't like fantasy," [...] and wrote that the novel [...] "ha few fantastical creatures, and readers will relate easily to the main characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stylist Christina Havemeyer {{has stated}} that when {{deciding}} what the models will wear, [...] "I look for obviously what I {{think is going to}} be something that a teenage girl is going to gravitate toward." [...] She has noted the significance of color and variety. [...] "Mixing and matching is very important[...] [...]you can buy something from the store that's brand new and you can mix <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> grandma's necklace from 1959.

2500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Bernard Besserglik {{described}} {{the film as}} a [...] "visually lush, fast-moving story", stating as well that the director [...] "has a sure sense of spectacle and, despite its faults, the movie maintains its queasy grip". Dan Jolin of Empire gave the film {{four out of five}} stars and said [...] "The odd conclusion renders it somewhat oblique, but Perfume is a feast for the senses. Smell <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> eyes..." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Try as it might to be refined and provocative, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer never rises above the pedestrian creepiness of its conceit." [...] Scott also said that Whishaw [...] "does not quite manage to make Grenouille either a victim worthy of pity or a fascinating monster. [...] In the film he comes across as dull, dour and repellent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emily Temple of American Songwriter {{praised the}} record as [...] "impossibly optimistic," [...] writing that [...] "The music is charismatic and chaotic, full of shouts, clanging and bright guitars — listen to <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{eyes closed and}} you’ll see {{everything}} short of sparkling blue stars." [...] Alternative Press called the music on In Light [...] "enthralling," [...] summarizing that [...] "Givers have created a debut that will surely set them atop the indie-rock world, if not only for their strict adherence to trying everything possible and succeeding gloriously at it all." [...] Jon Young of Spin recommended that the record is [...] "best absorbed in small portions, allowing you to savor the seriously catchy melodies and uplifting vibes," [...] feeling that the songs blur together when consumed at once. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Music parsed the record, describing it as [...] "an exhilarating first listen: you just don’t know what’s going to happen next." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before. [...] I did not {{know at the time}} that we would get the chance to feast together." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. [...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun." [...] Emperor Taizong laughed and stated, [...] "Everyone says that Wei is arrogant and careless, but I call him 'delicate'; this shows it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Southern California duo named [...] "Faden Away" [...] {{as their}} {{favorite}} {{song on the}} album. [...] "I'm singing like a mothaf----r on there," [...] Snoop told HipHopDX. [...] "I just like the concept, too. When {{you get in a}} relationship <b>with</b> somebody, <b>it</b> could be <b>with</b> <b>your</b> wife, <b>it</b> could be <b>with</b> <b>your</b> girlfriend, <b>it</b> could be <b>with</b> <b>your</b> kids, <b>it</b> could be <b>with</b> <b>your</b> mom, <b>it</b> could be <b>with</b> <b>your</b> brothers, 'cause your relationships are relationships. And it gets to a point in time where it begins to fade away. But you try your best to hold on and keep the good things there. And a lot of times, we always looked at the ones who make the relationship go bad, but when it go bad, we the ones who try to keep the relationship together. So it's like that song represents so much of who I am and what I'm going through. Not even on a personal tip, but on a business tip. Maybe I'm fading away on a business tip, or the music side. Maybe I'm fading away careerwise. But it just feels like, 20 years from now, that record is still gonna be the shit, no matter where we at." ...|$|R
