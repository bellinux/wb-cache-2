40|$|As doenças circulatórias atingem as populações de países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento e uma de suas principais causas são os altos níveis de colesterol e triglicerídeos séricos. Este trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de desenvolver uma formulação de biscoito, com a combinação de farinha desengordurada de soja (FDS) e farelo de aveia (FA) como ingredientes funcionais e testar, através de estudo de intervenção em humanos, a sua possível ação hipocolesterolêmica. Além desses dois ingredientes, também foi estudado o efeito de maltodextrina e de xilanases, como possíveis melhoradores de textura. A dureza e o diâmetro dos biscoitos aumentaram com teores maiores de maltodextrina, assim como maiores teores de FDS e FA proporcionaram aumento da umidade e da luminosidade dos biscoitos. A adição de xilanases ocasionou aumento na dureza dos biscoitos. Na análise descritiva de Perfil Livre, comparando-se três diferentes amostras, verificou-se que aquela com maior teor de FDS diferenciou-se das com maior teor de FA e com teores iguais de FDS e FA, sendo caracterizada como mais dura, de cor mais escura e apresentando sabor mais característico de biscoito integral/cereal. No entanto, não se observou diferença na aceitação. A formulação com maior teor de FA foi selecionada para a avaliação clínica. Esta foi realizada através de ensaio randomizado, duplo cego, com a participação de 82 voluntários hipercolesterolêmicos, divididos em dois grupos (Teste - GT e Controle - GC). Os voluntários consumiram biscoitos com FDS e FA (GT) e biscoitos sem estes ingredientes (GC), durante 28 dias (90 g ± 1 g de biscoito/dia, correspondentes a 3, 1 g de ?-glucana e 14, 86 g de proteína de soja no GT). Foram {{realizadas}} análises do perfil lipídico (Colesterol Total - CT, LDL-colesterol, HDL-colesterol e Triglicérides) dos voluntários, nos tempos 0 e 28 dias, para comparação, dentro de cada grupo e entre os grupos. Quando comparados no início e final do estudo, o GT apresentou reduções significativas de 11, 24 % nos valores de CT e 17, 75 % para LDL-c, enquanto que as variações de TG e HDL-c não foram significativas. No GC, as análises mostraram reduções significativas de 5, 9 % nos valores de CT e 11, 01 % em LDL-c e acréscimo de 8, 72 % nos valores de HDL-c. Para Triglicérides não ocorreu variação significativa. Constatou-se que antes do início do estudo os voluntários apresentavam hipercolesterolemia limítrofe (segundo os valores de referência da Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia) e que os valores finais de CT e de LDL-c, nosdois grupos, se enquadraram dentro da faixa ótima para CT e desejável para LDL-c. Concluiu-se que o produto testado apresentou ação hipocolesterolêmica e que, embora não tenha havido diferença significativa ao final da intervenção, entre o GC e GT, foi caracterizada uma tendência à ocorrência de maiores índices de redução do CT e LDL-c no GT. The circulatory diseases {{reach the}} populations of developed and developing countries and one of they main causes are {{the high levels of}} cholesterol and seric triglycerides. This work was carried out with the objective of developing a biscuit formulation, combining defatted soy flour (DSF) and oat bran (OB) as functional ingredients and to test, through human intervention study, its possible hypocholesterolemic action. Beyond these two ingredients, also the effect of maltodextrin and xylanases were studied, as possible texture improvers. The hardness and the diameter of biscuits increased with increase of maltodextrin content and higher levels of DSF and OB provided increase in moisture and luminosity of biscuits. The addition of xylanases caused increase in the hardness of biscuits. In the descriptive analysis of Free Choice Profile, comparing three different samples, it was verified that the one with the bigger level of DSF was differentiated of the ones with bigger level of OB and same levels of FDS and FA, being characterized as harder, darker and presenting more characteristic flavor of integral/cereal biscuit. However, difference in the acceptance was not observed. The formulation containing higher level of OB was selected for clinical trial. This was carried out by a randomized <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> <b>assay,</b> with the participation of 82 hypercholesterolemic volunteers, divided in two groups (Test - TG and Control CG). The subjects consumed biscuits with DSF and OA (TG) and biscuits without these ingredients (CG), during 28 days (90 g ± 1 g of biscuits/day corresponding the 3, 1 g of ?-glucana and 14, 86 g of soy protein in TG). Analyses of the lipid profile (Total Cholesterol - TC, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and Triglyceride) of the volunteers had been carried out, in the times 0 and 28 days, for comparison, inside of each group and between the groups. When comparing {{the beginning and end of}} the study, the TG presented significant reductions of 11, 24 % for TC and 17, 75 % for LDL-c, while the variations for TG and HDL-c had not been significant. In the CG, the analyses showed significant reductions of 5, 9 % for TC and 11, 01 % for LDL-c and increase of 8, 72 % in the values of HDL-c. For Triglyceride significant variation did not occur. It was verified that while at the beginning of the study, the volunteers presented bordering hypercholesterolemy (according to values of reference of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology), the final values of TC and LDL-c, in the two groups, were inside the excellent range for TC, and desirable, for LDL-c. It was concluded that the tested product presented hypocholesterolemic action and although it was verified that at the end of the intervention did not have significant difference between the TG and CG it was characterized a trend to the occurrence of bigger indices of reduction of the CT and LDL-c in the TG...|$|E

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>blind</b> {{peer review}} is a {{standard}} practice in the scientific community. It acts {{as a means of}} validating work as well as of getting feedback to improve it. As such, it seems prudent to also use it as a learning tool in large lectures to provide students with personalized feedback on their work. The general process can be directly adopted for the lecture context, but details need to be modified and adapted to create a better learning experience. The structure of a large lecture has been adjusted to provide the context for a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> peer review process.

We devised a list of design implications for future revisions of the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> peer review system, based on feedback and experiences during the semester as well as on a survey among students at the end of the semester.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} methodological quality of {{approaches}} to blind ing and to handling of exclusions {{as reported in}} randomised trials from one medical specialty. DESIGN: Survey of published, parallel group randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: A random sample of 110 reports in which allocation was described as randomised from 1990 and 1991 volumes of four journals of obstetrics and gynaecology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The adequacy of the descriptions of <b>double</b> <b>blinding</b> and exclusions after randomisation. RESULTS: Through 31 trials reported being <b>double</b> <b>blind,</b> about twice as many could have been. Of the 31 trials only eight (26 %) provided information on {{the protection of the}} allocation schedule and only five (16 %) provided some written assurance of successful implementation of <b>double</b> <b>blinding.</b> Of 38 trials in which the authors provided sufficient information for readers to infer that no exclusions after randomisation had occurred, six (16 %) reported adequate allocation concealment and none stated that an intention to treat analysis had been performed. That compared with 14 (27 %) and six (12 %), respectively, for the 52 trials that reported exclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators could have <b>double</b> <b>blinded</b> more often. When they did <b>double</b> <b>blind,</b> they reported poorly and rarely evaluated it. Paradoxically, trials that reported exclusions seemed generally of a higher methodological standard than those that had no apparent exclusions. Exclusions from analysis may have been made in some of the trials in which no exclusions were reported. Editors and readers of reports of randomised trials should understand that flawed reporting of exclusions may often provide a misleading impression {{of the quality of the}} trial...|$|R

40|$|The {{feature of}} being ‘double blind’, where neither {{patients}} nor physicians {{are aware of}} who receives the experimental treatment, is universally trumpeted as being a virtue of clinical trials. The rationale for this view is unobjectionable: <b>double</b> <b>blinding</b> rules out the potential confounding influences of patient and physician beliefs. Nonetheless, viewing successfully <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> trials as necessarily superior leads to the paradox that very effective experimental treatments will not be supportable by best (double-blind) evidence. It seems strange that an account of evidence should make a priori judgments that certain claims can never be supported by ‘best evidence’. So far as treatments with large effects go, the claim that they are effective is highly testable and intuitively they should receive greater support from the evidence. In this paper I argue that the two potential confounders ruled out by <b>double</b> <b>blinding</b> are often not actual confounders outside placebo controlled trials of treatments with mild effects and that have subjective outcome measures...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mechanisms}} for adverse reactions to foods in the gastrointestinal tract are poorly understood. There is conflicting {{evidence in the}} literature on the role for IgE mediated allergy in gastrointestinal reactions to staple foods. AIM: The aim was therefore to study the role of IgE mediated allergy in a group of patients with a history of gastrointestinal symptoms related to staple foods (cows' milk, hens' egg, wheat and rye flour) verified in <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> placebo controlled challenges (DBPCFC). PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with DBPCFC, identified by screening of 96 consecutive patients referred to our allergy clinic for investigation of suspected gastrointestinal symptoms due to staple foods. METHODS: The screening included diaries as well as elimination diets and open and blinded food challenges. The frequency of atopy were compared between the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> positive and <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> negative patients. RESULTS: The positive DBPCFC in the 15 patients included eight patients with milk intolerance, four with wheat flour, two with egg, and one with rye flour. There was no indications of an allergic pathogenesis in all 15 patients with positive DBPCFC, as the skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test were negative for the relevant allergens. The frequency of atopy was four of 21 (19 %) in the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> negative group and three of 15 (20 %) in the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> positive group. CONCLUSION: In adult patients with staple food induced gastrointestinal symptoms, objectively verified by DBPCFC, there were no indications of IgE mediated allergy to the relevant foods suggesting other mechanisms in adults than in children. Future studies may include measures of local events in the shock organs in relation to food intake, for instance utilising inflammatory markers in jejunal fluids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{utility of}} using an {{endurance}} test {{as well as}} a maximal exercise test to assess the effect of amlodipine, a dihyriropyridine calcium antagonist, was evaluated in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Amlodipine, 10 mg/day, was compared with placebo in a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> crossover study. After a 2 week single blind placebo period, patients entered a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> crossover phase alternating between 4 weeks of placebo and 4 weeks of amlodipine. The two 4 week periods were separated by a 1 week single blind placebo washout period. The efficacy of drug therapy was assessed by frequency of angina, nitroglycerin consumption, peak oxygen consumption during a maximal treadmill exercise test and endurance time during a separate exercise test performed at 70 % of the peak work capacity determined before randomization. There was a reduction in angina frequency during the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> placebo and amlodipine studies (single blind placebo 14 ± 2 episodes' 2 weeks, double Mind placebo 7 ± 2 episodes/ 2 weeks [p < 0. 0051, amlodipine 6 ± 3 episodes/ 2 weeks, [p < 0. 005]), whereas nitroglycerin consumption was reduced with amlodipine (single blind placebo 12 ± 4 tablets/ 2 weeks, <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> placebo 8 ± 3 tablets/ 2 weeks, amlodipine 5 ± 3 tablets/ 2 weeks [p < 0. 011]). Amlodipine produced a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption (single blind placebo 18. 7 ± 1. 1 ml/kg per min, <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> placebo 18. 2 ± 1. 8 ml/kg per min, amlodipine 20. 4 ± 1. 6 ml/kg per min [p < 0. 05]) and endurance time (single blind placebo 15. 2 ± 1. 5 min, <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> placebo 15. 8 ± 2. 1 min, amlodipine 20. 2 ± 2. 5 min [p < 0. 005]). The changes in endurance time were independent of changes in peak oxygen consumption. It is concluded that the endurance exercise test and the maximal exercise test are complementary in evaluating the efficacy of antianginal therapy, but the endurance test may be more sensitive for detecting an improvement. Amlodipine significantly improved endurance time and peak oxygen consumption...|$|R
