2500|$|A {{section of}} layered, contrapuntal horn guajeos is also {{referred}} to sometimes as a moña. Moñas differ from typical rhythm section guajeos in that they often will rest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> or two within their cycle. Those beats within a measure not sounded by the moña are often [...] "filled" [...] by a chorus, or counter moña. The trumpet and trombone moñas shown below ("Bilongo") can be repeated verbatim, or altered. Improvisation is within a framework of repetition and the melodic contour of the moñas. In this way, multiple instrumentalists can improvise simultaneously while reinforcing the rhythmic/melodic momentum of the rhythm section.|$|E

The song's [...] "anticlimactic" [...] portion then decreases intensity until it has eventually resumed to simply a snare and bass riff.|$|R

5000|$|On Chord Harmonicas, {{there are}} 2 harmonicas hinged {{together}} capable together of playing 48 chords. They are 23 inches long, and each chord takes up 4 holes. The chord harmonica is used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat,</b> or tricks. Jerry Murad's Harmonicat's 1947 [...] "Peg O' My Heart" [...] was {{played on a}} Chord. Hohner's main Chord {{is known as the}} Hohner 48, because it plays 48 chords. Hohner from the 1930s to the late 1960s also produced the Polyphonia No. 8, which played 36 blow-only chords, in three rows. The concept failed and is often frowned upon by professional 48 chord players.|$|E

5000|$|A moña is a horn guajeo, {{which can}} be written or improvised. A section of layered, contrapuntal horn guajeos is also {{referred}} to sometimes as a moña. Moñas differ from typical rhythm section guajeos in that they often will rest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> or two within their cycle. Those beats within a measure not sounded by the moña are often [...] "filled" [...] by a chorus, or counter moña. What's known as the Cuban típico style of soloing on trombone draws upon the technique of stringing together moña variations. The following example shows five different variants of a 2-3 trombone moña improvised by José Rodrígues on [...] "Bilongo" [...] (c. 1969), performed by Eddie Palmieri. The examples are written in cut-time (2/2); {{there are two main}} beats per measure.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to Corso's use of {{marriage as a}} synecdoche <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Beat</b> view of women, postmodern feminist poet Hedwig Gorski chronicles a night with Corso in her poem [...] "Could not get Gregory Corso out of my Car" [...] (1985, Austin, Texas) showing the womanizing typical for heterosexual Beat behavior. Gorski criticizes the Beat movement for tokenism towards women writers and their work, with very few exceptions, including Anne Waldman, and post-beats like Diane DiPrima and herself. Male domination and womanizing by its heterosexual members, along with tokenism by its major homosexual members characterize the Beat Literary Movement. Beats scoffed at the Feminist Movement which offered liberalizing social and professional views of women and their works as did the Beat Movement for men, especially homosexuals. Corso however always defended women's role in the Beat Generation, often citing his lover, Hope Savage, as a primary influence on him and Allen Ginsberg.|$|E

5000|$|... "Come Get It Bae" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nick Catucci provided a favorable review; {{he wrote that}} Cyrus' background vocals [...] "made <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> with a restless edge", although he also felt that her contributions were [...] "sunk too low into the mix". Carl Williott from Idolator opined that the track is [...] "a worthy addition to their budding partnership", although he personally preferred Cyrus' appearance on [...] "Smoke Signals" [...] by Buddy, which Williams had produced shortly before premiering his own track. Michael Marotta from Vanyaland noted that Cyrus' repetition of the term [...] "Bangerz" [...] on her track [...] "SMS (Bangerz)" [...] was his favorite piece of Bangerz, and similarly noted that Cyrus' repetition of [...] "hey!" [...] had [...] "the same effect" [...] on [...] "Come Get It Bae".

5000|$|On its {{original}} release, the ZX Spectrum version of Bruce Lee received enthusiastic reviews. Computer Gaming World {{stated that the}} game [...] "delivers all the foot kicking, kick jabbing, quick ducking action-packed adventure you'd expect from a good grade B, martial arts movie". CRASH magazine awarded 91%, highlighting zesty graphics, enjoyable fighting action and addictivity. Sinclair User also found the game enjoyable, awarding 4 out of 5 stars, but felt that sound was underused and a larger variety of tasks could have been included. Your Spectrum were more critical, pointing out that it only takes a few games to complete all 20 chambers. In a 1990 retrospective, Your Sinclair found that Bruce Lee was still too easy to complete and the graphics had not aged well. In addition, {{it was felt that}} the fighting moves available to the player lacked impact and were too limited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> 'em up. However, it was described as a historically important game, being the first to combine the platform/collection and beat 'em 'up genres. Home Computing Weekly praised the graphics and movement.|$|E
5000|$|The duo {{first began}} {{recording}} music together in 2011, and a demo was created; Banks had provided vocals <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> created by RZA. During this time, however, {{the two were}} not planning on making an album together. RZA later regarded them as just [...] "buddies playing chess" [...] (they had played chess together at the time) who sometimes made music. Their demos {{caught the attention of}} an A&R, which is when they began recording longer compositions for an album. The duo began work on an album in 2013, which is when the first public mention of the their collaboration was made, during an interview that RZA had with Rolling Stone. In this interview, he explained that when his manager asked for who he would like the work with musically, he responded with Banks, saying that he [...] "just has an energy about him" [...] and that if they were to combine their musical talents, [...] "it would be great". RZA expected the album to take about a year to finish. During 2014, Banks' main project Interpol were recording their fifth album, El Pintor. The album was released in September 2014. Banks and RZA were planning on releasing their album in 2015, but decided that it was unfinished.|$|E
