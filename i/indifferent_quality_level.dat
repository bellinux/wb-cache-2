40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} service quality in the airport waiting environment using the Kano attractive quality factor and Timko’s customer satisfaction coefficient. Survey questionnaire composed of positive and negative questions were distributed to passengers in the airport waiting area. By analyzing the collected data, Timko’s customer satisfaction coefficient was calculated. Interestingly, it was revealed that quality was categorized into four sub-dimensions: attractive quality, uni-dimensional quality, must-be <b>quality,</b> and <b>indifferent</b> <b>quality.</b> Data analysis results provided key implications. First, according to Kano analysis, attractive quality is composed of interior illumination and activity. Uni-dimensional quality is composed of temperature, indoor air, cleanliness, and spatial density factors(inconvenient, narrow, complex). <b>Indifferent</b> <b>quality</b> is composed of convenience and social density factors(busy, crowded, disorder). Second, activity of waiting seating condition factor has the highest Timko’s customer satisfaction coefficient(. 58), but temperature of ambient condition factor and cleanliness of waiting seating condition factor have the lowest coefficient(-. 51). Third, under Kano analysis, indoor air and spatial density are uni-dimensional quality. However, under Timko analysis, it was changed into attractive quality. Based on the data analysis results, strategies that can minimize Better index and minimize Worse index were suggested. ? ??? ??? Kano ?????

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} trade barriers on <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> in a duopoly model for two countries with one producer in each country. The products are both vertically and horizontally differentiated. In absence of quality regulation, the two producers determine prices and <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> in a two stage game. The firms choose the <b>quality</b> <b>level</b> in the first game, and their prices in the second game. The Nash equilibrium illustrates that the producer in the large country produces a higher quality than the producer in the small country. However, a reduction of the trade barrier twists the <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> in favour of the small country. Furthermore, in case of implementation of a minimum quality standard, which forces the low quality producer from the small country to increase the <b>quality</b> <b>level,</b> the producer from the large country reacts strategically by lowering the <b>quality</b> <b>level</b> of his product.
