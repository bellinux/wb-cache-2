For this aforementioned study, a time series data for the years 2003 - 2012 has been employed and a secondary data from the annual reports of the six companies was solicited.

40|$|Purpose – To {{test the}} effects of underpricing and share {{retention}} (i. e. the proportion of shares retained by the pre-initial-public-offering (IPO) owners) on IPO aftermarket liquidity. Design/methodology/approach – Uses both percentage spread and <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> to measure liquidity. The percentage spread is the quoted bid-ask spread divided by the quoted midpoint and measures the trading cost relative to share price. <b>Turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> is the daily trading volume divided {{by the number of}} shares offered and measures the speed of transaction. Both non-parametric analyses and multiple regressions are conducted to investigate {{the effects of}} underpricing and share retention on liquidity. Findings – Results indicate that initial return is positively related to <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> and negatively related to percentage spread. These relations are significant even after controlling for other factors. Also finds that the pre-IPO owners’ retention rate is positively related to <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> and negatively related to percentage spread. High retention rates attract more trades, provide quality assurance, and improve IPO aftermarket liquidity. Originality/value – This paper investigates the theoretical links between underpricing and liquidity and provides direct evidence on Booth and Chua's liquidity theory.

We tested two hypotheses whether there have been significant improvements in the corporate performance of Indian manufacturing corporate firms following the merger event, using a parametric statistical t-test.

Employing the econometric methodology of the vector error correction model, the study shows that in the short-run, market capitalization <b>ratio</b> and <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> have significant negative effect on aggregate national output (GDP). The study also shows positive effect of value traded ratio as well as negative effect of inflation rate on GDP though not significant.

The successful selection and use of appropriate financial ratio {{is one of the}} key elements of the firm’s financial strategy. Hence, proper care and attention need to be given while such decision is taken. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the financial {{ratio analysis}} and profitability of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical industry over the past eleven (11) years period from 2001 – 2011. These financial ratio analyse have immense potentials to help organizations in improving their revenue generation ability as well as minimization of costs. The researcher used five (5) variables for the analyses such as: Inventory <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> (ITR); Debtors’ <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> (DTR); Creditors’ velocity (CRSV); Total assets <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> (TATR) and Gross profit margin (GPM). Profitability as a dependent variable is represented by Gross profit margin (GPM) while financial ratio analysis stands as ITR, DTR, CRSV and TATR for independent variables. Secondary data were obtained from the financial statements (Balance sheet and Profit and Loss account) of the selected quoted pharmaceutical companies’ financial statement. The data have been analyzed using descriptive research method and multiple regressions to find out the relationship between the variables. The results of the analysis showed that there is a negative relationship between all independent variables with profitability in the Nigerian pharmaceutical industry. It also revealed that debtors’ <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio,</b> creditors’ velocity and total assets <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> have no significant relationship on the profitability of the company while only inventory <b>turnover</b> <b>ratio</b> shows a significant relationship with profitability. The results further suggested that only 17. 8 % of the independent variables are determinant factors of profitability in the enterprises sampled while 82. 2 % of the major factors are determine from other factors outside the independent variables. Based on the above premises, the researcher recommended that the inventories of the company should be checked and monitored more frequently by management to prevent out of stock syndrome or over stocking of their products. It is also recommended that creditors’ velocity should be at a point where the creditors and purchases are equal in order to take the advantage of credit facility and any discount associated with prompt payment for goods to increase the profitability of the company. The management should utilize its assets efficient in generating more income for the company. </p...|$|R
