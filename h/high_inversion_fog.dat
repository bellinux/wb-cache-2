The ratio of the wavelength between the fog cells and {{the height of the}} boundary layer was found to be between 2 and 3, and the typical horizontal aspect ratio of fog cells was about a factor of two.

40|$|A {{process to}} achieve <b>high</b> <b>inversion</b> channel {{mobility}} in 4 H-SiC MOSFETs {{is needed to}} enable manufacturing of devices for high power applications. In this thesis, investigations on the electrical properties of oxides produced in an alumina furnace are presented. MOSFETs with gate oxides produced in this manner exhibit the <b>highest</b> <b>inversion</b> channel mobilities reported so far within the field. However mobile charge {{in the form of}} sodium is present in these oxides. Mobile charge reduces the device reliability and gives rise to threshold voltage shift, that is unacceptable in most applications. Comparison of this oxidation process is made to other processes known to increase the inversion channel mobility. Furthermore studies of MOSFETs at elevated temperatures are performed in order to investigate what mechanism is limiting the mobility. The studies show that phonon scattering is limiting the mobility in MOSFETs produced in an alumina furnace. A method to remove the sodium from the samples produced in this manner is presented and by removing the sodium new properties of the SiO_{ 2 }/SiC interface can be investigated. A high density of deep acceptor type interface traps is detected. Their presence does not degrade the saturation mobility but gives rise to large threshold voltage shifts. These traps have slow electron emisson rates and have energy levels deeper in the band-gap than the near interface traps that are normally associated with the mobility reduction in MOSFETs...|$|R

25|$|As {{the channel}} length becomes very short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at <b>high</b> <b>inversion</b> charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.|$|R

40|$|Conference on Fiber Lasers XIII -Technology, Systems, and Applications, Feb 15 - 18, 2016, San Francisco, CAThermal {{management}} {{is critical for}} kw-level power lasers, where mode instability driven by quantum defect heating is a major challenge. Tandem pumping using 1018 nm fiber lasers are used to enable both high brightness and low quantum defect. It is, however, difficult to realize efficient 1018 nm YDFL. The best demonstration to date {{is limited by the}} use of both conventional aluminosilicate host and smaller core diameters. In these cases, <b>higher</b> <b>inversion</b> is required due to the aluminosilicate host and higher pump brightness is required due to the smaller core, which results in high signal brightness for the same output power. These factors lead to large pump power to exit fiber, resulting in poor efficiency. Phosphosilicate host, on the other hand, requires much lower inversions to reach the gain threshold at 1018 nm. The combination of phosphosilicate host and large-core leakage channel fibers (LCF) is a perfect candidate for efficient 1018 nm fiber laser. We report a highly efficient Yb-doped phosphosilicate LCF laser with a quantum defect of 4. 1 % using a similar to 50 mu m-core diameter and similar to 420 mu m cladding diameter. The slope efficiency with respect to the launched pump power at 1018 nm is 70 %. The ASE suppression is > 60 dB. The large cladding of 420 mu m demonstrates a combination of high efficiency, similar to 4 % quantum defect and high-power low-brightness diode pumping.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{produced}} results {{to show how}} carriers populate electronic states of InAs quantum dot (QD) laser diodes which operate near 1. 3 um, especially those which incorporate tunnel injection. I used the segmented contact method to produce modal absorption, modal gain, spontaneous emission and population inversion spectra {{as a function of}} photon energy. The spontaneous emission spectra for a high performance QD structure showed an increased population of the higher energy QD states than the tunnel injection structure. Analysis of the carrier distribution within the high performance QD structure revealed that the population of the QD states can be described by Fermi- Dirac statistics (thermally distributed) at 300 K. As the temperature is lowered the electron distribution becomes clearly non-thermal, with clear regions of <b>high</b> <b>inversion</b> seen in the lower energy QD states. The <b>higher</b> <b>inversion</b> can be attributed to a reduced population of wetting layer states and as the temperature is lowered it becomes less likely for carriers to excite out of the dot states and thermally redistribute throughout the ensemble. The tunnelling injection structure was shown to exhibit unique features in its carrier distribution as compared to the high performance structure. At 300 K the carrier distribution function is populated to thermal levels over energy ranges corresponding to a subset of the QD ground and first excited states. Between these energy ranges there is a region of under populated states shown by a region of low inversion. This suggests dots of a particular size within the ensemble are preferentially populated by the resonant tunnelling process. This results in a reduced spectral broadening of the emission from the QD ensemble. At higher temperature the selective population can still be observed, however it is less pronounced, presumably due to more efficient thermal distribution of electrons at higher temperatur...|$|R
