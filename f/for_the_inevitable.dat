Though Báthory remained {{distrustful of}} the Habsburgs, he maintained {{the tradition of}} good relations that the Commonwealth had with its Western neighbor and confirmed past treaties between the Commonwealth and Holy Roman Empire with diplomatic missions received by Maximilian's successor, Rudolf II. The troublesome south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579. The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant Báthory subsidies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> war against Muscovy.|$|E
5|$|Night falls, and Captain Magenta detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in mid-air.

5|$|The {{failure of}} Troude's {{squadron}} {{to escape the}} British pursuit highlights {{the dominance of the}} Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809. With Martinique gone, and French Guiana and San Domingo falling the same year, Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies. Despite the supplies carried by Troude's ships, the situation there was desperate: food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island's morale. When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809, the French losing two more frigates, the inhabitants had no alternative but to wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> British invasion. In January 1810, Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe, which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Arab preparations, {{especially}} {{the construction of}} a large fleet, did not go unnoticed by the worried Byzantines. Emperor Anastasios II (r. 713–715) sent an embassy to Damascus under the patrician and urban prefect, Daniel of Sinope, ostensibly in order to plea for peace, but in reality to spy on the Arabs. Anastasios, in turn, began to prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> siege: the fortifications of Constantinople were repaired and equipped with ample artillery (catapults and other siege weapons), while food stores were brought into the city. In addition, those inhabitants who could not stockpile food {{for at least three years}} were evacuated. Anastasios strengthened his navy and in early 715 dispatched it against the Arab fleet that had come to Phoenix—usually identified with modern Finike in Lycia, it may also be modern Fenaket across Rhodes, or perhaps Phoenicia (modern Lebanon), famed for its cedar forests—to collect timber for their ships. At Rhodes, however, the Byzantine fleet, encouraged by the soldiers of the Opsician Theme, rebelled, killed their commander John the Deacon and sailed north to Adramyttium. There, they acclaimed a reluctant tax collector, Theodosius, as emperor. Anastasios crossed into Bithynia in the Opsician Theme to confront the rebellion, but the rebel fleet sailed on to Chrysopolis. From there, it launched attacks against Constantinople, until, in late summer, sympathizers within the capital opened its gates to them. Anastasios held out at Nicaea for several months, finally agreeing to resign and retire as a monk. The accession of Theodosios, who from the sources comes across as both unwilling and incapable, as a puppet emperor of the Opsicians provoked the reaction of the other themes, {{especially the}} Anatolics and the Armeniacs under their respective strategoi (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos.|$|E

Puntland officials also claimed that ISS began to retreat from the town, though these reports were later disproven by locals. By 23 November, all civilian residents of Qandala had fled; overall 25,700 locals had been displaced due to the ISS takeover.

25|$|Belisarius, {{with his}} small force, {{was unable to}} {{continue}} his march northwards towards Ravenna, since the Ostrogoth forces vastly outnumbered his own. Instead, he settled in Rome, preparing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> counterstrike. He set up his headquarters on the Pincian Hill, {{in the north of}} the city, and started repairing the walls of the city. A ditch was dug out on the outer side, the fort of the Mausoleum of Hadrian strengthened, a chain was drawn across the Tiber, a number of citizens conscripted and stores of supplies set up. The populace of the city, aware that the siege they were trying to escape was becoming inevitable, started showing signs of discontent.|$|E

25|$|A further {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in 1679, after the unexpected success {{of a group of}} covenanters, armed with pitch forks and the like, against government forces led by John Graham of Claverhouse at the Battle of Drumclog. For a time the authorities looked in danger of losing control of the south west of Scotland, as more and more people joined the rebel camp at Bothwell near Glasgow; but only a few weeks after Drumclog the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Bothwell Brig. In the weeks before the battle the Covenanters spent more time arguing among themselves than preparing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> counterstroke, which did much to contribute towards their downfall. Of 1,200 captured rebels taken to Edinburgh, some 400 were imprisoned in an area of Greyfriars Kirkyard over the winter months.|$|E
25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore {{could see that he was}} being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the British Mandate for Palestine fast approaching, the Yeshuv {{sought to}} bolster its {{capabilities}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> clash with Israel's Arab neighbors and their regular armies. It therefore secured the purchase of 25 Avia S-199s, a Czechoslovak derivative of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109. Alon was in the first batch of Sherut Avir pilots sent to fly the new aircraft, and departed Sde Dov on 6 May 1948. He was soon flying the Avia at the Czechoslovak airfield at České Budějovice. On 15 May, however, Israel declared its independence and found itself under immediate attack, including aerial strikes undertaken by the relatively powerful Royal Egyptian Air Force. Although they had not undergone any sort of gunnery training on the new aircraft, the pilots demanded to return home. On 20 May, therefore, Alon and fellow pilots boarded a Douglas C-54B for the return flight to Israel.|$|E

Moreover, we can observe the degree of success in the difficult transition from state-dominated to a more balanced institutional framework.|$|R

25|$|The {{big guns}} {{opened fire on}} the New Madrid {{defensive}} positions on March 13, and continued throughout the day. McCown realized that Pope would try to attack his forts by regular approaches. He felt that his reduced artillery companies would be too exhausted to resist, so {{he decided not to}} wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable.</b> On the night of March 13–14, orders were given to abandon the town and its two forts. A heavy rainstorm hid the troop movements from the enemy, so the evacuation was accomplished without incident. There was some confusion (which seems to have been exaggerated in Pope's reports), and the departure was so sudden that the guns in the forts had to be spiked and left behind, but most of the troops were successfully removed and redistributed. On the morning of March 14, two deserters appeared bearing a white flag, and informed Pope that the town was deserted.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, to allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, {{so this is not}} the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E
25|$|After 1966, Lin's few {{personal}} political initiatives were {{efforts to}} moderate the radical {{nature of the}} Cultural Revolution. Privately, he expressed unhappiness with the Cultural Revolution, {{but was unable to}} avoid playing a high-profile role due to the expectations of Mao, China's unpredictable political environment, and the manipulations of his wife and son, Ye Qun and Lin Liguo. After 1966, Lin, like Liu before him, attempted to build his own base of support so that he could better position himself <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable,</b> unpredictable political situation that would occur following the death of Mao. Lin's few proactive attempts to direct the Cultural Revolution were attempts to protect Red Guards and his political allies from political persecution, and to mediate the attempts of Jiang Qing and her followers to radicalize China's political climate. In May 1967, Lin's follower, Chen Boda, saved Zhou Enlai from being persecuted by Red Guards by convincing them that Zhou was Lin's follower and supporter. Zhou repaid Lin's assistance by giving him excessive public praise three months later, in August, but was forced to write a formal apology to Lin after Lin complained to Mao that such praise was inappropriate.|$|E
