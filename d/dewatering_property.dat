In {{wastewater}} treatment system, the humus soil activated sludge {{process is to}} culture microorganisms by setting the natural humus soil composite mineral filter to simulate natural soil growing conditions. After enriched and activated in the cultivation tank, the microorganisms with specific functions return to different position of activated sludge process and achieve enhanced operational performance. The project results showed the process could enhance the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus, reduce sludge production, improve sludge <b>dewatering</b> <b>property</b> and achieve odor elimination...|$|E
40|$|Digested sludges {{generally}} exhibit poorer dewaterability than activated sludges. This {{study investigated}} the effects of acidification and oxidation on EPS properties and dewaterability of anaerobic digested sludge in Fenton treatment in order to unravel the underlying mechanism of sludge conditioning. The results indicated that sludge <b>dewatering</b> <b>property</b> was improved after acidification treatment. Meanwhile, fluorescence analysis revealed that the protein-like substances were effectively removed from sludge bulk after acidification treatment. Acidification and Fenton oxidation showed a significant synergetic effect in enhancing sludge dewatering process. Solubilization and decomposition of bound EPS occurred synchronously during Fenton conditioning. Oxidation process is very likely to play a more important role in sludge conditioning than Fenton coagulation. According to pilot test, Fenton treatment performed much better in cake moisture content reduction than chemical conditioning with traditional inorganic coagulants. Additionally, full-scale application of Fenton conditioning will not have detrimental effects on performance of wastewater treatment system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Biosolid-liquid {{separation}} performance {{plays an}} important role in suspended solids removal and sludge thickening and dewatering process. Since the sludge is a highly complex colloidal system, the key factors affecting sludge dewatering and settling performance were not well understood. In this study, the dynamic variation in distribution and chemical composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), floc size distribution, charge property and settling and dewatering performance was investigated at four full scale WWTPs over 100 days. It was found that the change in EPS distribution and composition from different WWTPs showed a very similar pattern with operating time. The temperature rather than wastewater composition had more significant influence on content and chemical constituents of different EPS fractions. Additionally, more EPS was extracted from activated sludge at lower temperature (< 15 degrees C), indicating that the binding strength of EPS with microbial cells was weak. According to Pearson's correlation analysis, sludge <b>dewatering</b> <b>property</b> correlated well with content of protein-like substances in soluble EPS, while there was a strong correlation between sludge settleability (measured by sludge volume index) and floc size and volatile suspended solid/total suspended solid ratio (VSS/TSS).

Fenton's reagent considerably improved the aerobic digestion process in comparison with hydrogen peroxide as well as classical aerobic digestion. Application of Fenton's reagent also led to improvement of settling and <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of sludge and much better clarity of supernatant. Its drawback, however, is the formation of chemical precipitate and an apparent decrease in pH which might inhibit biochemical processes important for aerobic digestion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{it was shown}} that the enzymatic removal of xylan from ECF-bleached birch kraft pulp enhances the water removal from the pulp, {{especially}} in the late stages of pulp drying. The effect of xylanase treatments on dewatering was clarified by using a moving belt former (MBF), a press simulator (MTS), and an IR-drying equipment, to simulate and to measure <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> on wire, press and drying sections of a paper machine. The xylanase treatment slightly increased the pulp freeness indicating improved pulp drainage properties. At the moving belt former, however, no significant changes that would indicate enhanced dewatering in forming were observed. The xylanase treatments slightly enhanced the dewatering in wet pressing and furthermore, at the thermal drying the xylanase treatment had {{a positive effect on}} the dry solid content (DSC) development, and time to reach the 95 % dry solids content was reduced by up to 15 %. This was also confirmed by the decrease in the fiber saturation point (FSP) values and the amount of bulk water. Our results indicate that the xylanase treatment affected the water-binding xylan in the fiber cell wall, yielding enhanced <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties,</b> without deteriorating the pulp and paper properties...|$|R

The experiment was performed at a continuously operating full-scale wastewater treatment plant during a 6 -month period. The addition of the enzyme mixture resulted in improved gas production and <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties.</b> <b>Dewatering</b> experiments, both on enzyme-treated and reference sludge on the local centrifuges, indicated that the carbonaceous matter was decreased by 7 % in enzyme-treated sludge, and the average dry solids increased from 27 % (reference) to 31 % in enzyme-treated sludge. The polymer dosage was decreased from 8 to 5 kg/t dry solids. Additionally, practical experiences were gathered concerning the transformation from static laboratory-scale batch experiments to a dynamic continuous industrial scale setup.

40|$|Chemical {{conditioning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important processes for improve the performance of sludge dewatering device. Aluminum salt coagulant has been widely used in wastewater and sludge treatment. It is generally accepted that pre-formed speciation of aluminum salt coagulants (ASC) has an important influence on coagulation/flocculation performance. In this study, the interaction mechanisms between sludge particles and aluminum salt coagulants with different speciation of hydroxy aluminum were investigated by characterizing the changes in morphological and EPS properties. It was found that middle polymer state aluminum (Al-b) and high polymer state aluminum (Al-c) performed better than monomer aluminum and oligomeric state aluminum (Al-a) in reduction of specific resistance to filtration (SRF) and compressibility of wastewater sludge due to their higher charge neutralization and formed more compact flocs. Sludge was significantly acidified after addition Al-a, while pH was much more stable under Al-b and Al-c conditioning due to their hydrolysis stability. The size of sludge flocs conditioned with Al-b and Al-c was small but flocs structure was denser and more compact, and floc strength is higher, while that formed from Ala is relatively large, but floc structure was loose, floc strength is relatively lower. Scanning environmental microscope analysis revealed that sludge flocs conditioned by Al-b and Al-c (especially PAC(2. 5) and Al- 13) exhibited obvious botryoidal structure, this is because sludge flocs formed by Al-b and Al-c were more compact and floc strength is high, it was easy generated plentiful tiny channels for water release. In addition, polymeric aluminum salt coagulant (Al-b, Al-c) had better performance in compressing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure and removing sticky protein-like substances from soluble EPS fraction, contributing to improvement of sludge filtration performance. Therefore, this study provides a novel solution for improving sludge <b>dewatering</b> <b>property</b> by controlling aluminum speciation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In {{a previous study}} it was shown that highly depithed bagasse chemical pulp has excellent <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> which may improve the production rate of bagasse based tissue, paper and board. In this study pulp properties of this highly depithed bagasse pulp were tested and compared favourably with regular depithed bagasse pulp.

Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) -sludge is composed of compact flocs, while the chemical sludge contains higher colloids concentration in the liquid phase and retain water within the floc structure by stronger physical forces.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} produces sludge {{which is}} usually dewatered prior to disposal to reduce disposal costs. This work used compressive rheology tools to accurately measure the <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of selected sewage sludges {{with a focus on}} sludge produced by Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD). Sludges were sampled from a 500 litre ATAD pilot-plant at Killarney Co. Kerry, and from wastewater treatment plants in Australia, Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg. The project aims to outline the <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of these sludges and to determine some of the factors which govern wastewater sludge dewatering. The theoretical basis of this work was the phenomenonological solid-liquid separation theory of Buscall and White (1987). The gel-point, compressibility, and permeability have been established as the fundamental physical properties that determine suspension dewaterability. However, until recently, the experimental determination of these properties for wastewater sludges (which exhibit atypical behaviour) was limited due to theoretical and experimental constraints. Recently, new qualitative and quantitative methods based upon the Buscall and White (1987) approach to dewatering characterisation have been developed, and have been successfully applied to wastewater sludges (Stickland, 2005). In this study these methods were applied to ATAD sludges for the first time. Filtration, settling and centrifugation tests were used to measure the material characteristics of several ATAD sludges, some of which were conditioned using polymeric flocculants and inorganic coagulants. All wastewater treatment sludges which were investigated in this work exhibited nontraditional filtration characteristics, forming highly networked suspension at low solids concentrations. Such sludges are impermeable and highly compressible. A 500 litre ATAD pilot-plant was commissioned as part of this research. Thickened waste activated sludge was used as the feedstock for the ATAD pilot-plant. In retention time trials, temperatures of 60 °C were achieved during digestion. The pilot-plant achieved 47...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{limestone}} scrubbing is {{the most}} common flue gas desulphurization (FGD) process. In this process, oxidation of calcium bisulphite plays a major role both by determining the <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of the obtained sludge and the production of gypsum of high quality. In order to contribute to the simulation of the wet limestone FGD process, in the present paper a comprehensive model for isothermal gas-liquid stirred tank reactors has been used. Based {{on the assumption that the}} reactions are zeroth order with respect to gaseous reactants, the model requires appropriate physico-chemical parameters which are taken from the literature. The model was used to quantitatively interpret some literature experimental data concerning uncatalysed calcium bisulphite oxidation performed in a continuous stirred tank reactor. In particular, the model is capable of confidently predicting the transition from chemically to mass transfer controlled regime occurring when changing the operating conditions...|$|R

The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of three mechanical treatments on fibre and paper properties. The wing defibrator, the E-compactor, and the Valley beater were used for treating chemical softwood pulp. It was found that the type and intensity of mechanical treatments significantly affect the formation of fibre deformations, and thus the resulting properties of paper.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is the experimental study of the filtering kinetics of water fibrous suspensions based on plant fiber of primary and secondary processing and realization on its basis the comparative analysis of filterability for these suspensions. The research was conducted using the device for determining filtering and <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of suspensions and sediments by hydrodynamic permeability method. It was stated that the intensity of suspensions filtering {{on the basis of}} primary cellulose fibers is higher than suspensions of secondary fibers. When the grinding ratio of fiber increases the average velocity filtration decreases non-linearly regardless of the type of fibers. Mostly the effect is observed during filtration of suspensions based on primary fibers.

A literature analysis revealed that uncertainties on the mechanisms of the oxidation reaction and on the values of the kinetic parameters still remain. In the present work the oxidation rate was experimentally studied by contacting pure oxygen or mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen with a calcium bisulfite solution. The experiments were carried out in a well-mixed bubbling reactor varying temperature, oxygen partial pressure and sulfite concentration, in the absence of solid calcium sulfite and of catalytic species.

The main parameters of interest were capillary suction time (CST), concentration of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), charge density of the extracted EPS, filterability (dry solids content after vacuum filtration), compactibility (dry solids content after pressing) and concentration of fine particles in the liquid phase (turbidity). Sludge from the reactor working at 55 degrees C (thermophilic) contained the most fine particles in the liquid phase, which remarkably deteriorated filterability of the sample, however when subjected to an external pressure, the sludge reached the highest dry matter content of the sludge cake.

40|$|The {{coagulation}} and flocculation {{processes in}} conventional drinking water treatment generate aggregates which settle {{to form a}} sludge waste. This sludge can be dewatered further by thickening, centrifugation and filtration operations in order to recover water and minimise {{the volume of the}} waste stream. A range of water treatment sludges generated in the laboratory were characterised according to a phenomenological method that is valid from the dilute free-settling regime to the concentrated cake compression stages. These were compared with plant samples. Experimental results show that raw water natural organic matter (NOM), coagulant dose and coagulation pH affected both the rate and potential extent of dewatering. Similar effects were observed for both aluminium sulfate and ferric chloride.

40|$|Since {{the usage}} of {{chemical}} flocculants especially polyacrylamides is closely related with environmental pollution and health hazards, synthesis of environmental friendly and economic viable bio-flocculants that exhibit high flocculating efficiency is highly desirable. The production of natural bio-flocculants extracted from plant is urgently needed {{as an alternative to}} chemical flocculants due to their inherent low toxicity, biodegradability and low environmental footprint. In this study, a plant-based bio-flocculant was extracted from Hibiscus/Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) with conventional hydrothermal extraction (CHE) and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) processes by using water as solvent. The aims of this work were to produce the bio-flocculant through environmentally friendly and economically feasible process, optimise its extraction yield, optimise its flocculating and sludge <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties,</b> and also minimise its production cost in order to be comparable to chemical flocculants (polyacrylamides) from perspectives of quality and cost. The extraction efficiencies of bio-flocculants were justified by the optimised yields, the flocculating abilities were evaluated by the removal of suspended solids (SS) and turbidity after flocculation process and sludge volume index (SVI) whereas the sludge dewatering abilities were assessed by SS removal after filtration and water recovery. Single factor experimental design was employed to study the effects of extraction temperature, time, solvent loading, and agitation speed and particle size on yield, flocculating and <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of bio-flocculants. The influence of extraction parameters to yield and the reliability of the experimental data were verified by analysing the single factor experimental results with response surface methodology. Results showed that extraction yields were significantly affected by extraction temperature and time and solvent loading. Prolonged extraction (few hours) at high temperature (60 - 90 ˚C) decreased the yields of bio-flocculants extracted with CHE method. Conversely, extraction at high temperature was favourable for MAE method to raise the yield due to short extraction time in minutes. Flocculating abilities of bio-flocculants were not significantly affected by the extraction conditions whilst the sludge dewatering abilities were mainly influenced by the temperature and particle size.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the effect of}} dual-polymer flocculation on the compressive yield stress and hindered settling function of positively charged alumina suspensions as measured by a pressure filtration technique. The primary aggregates were formed using a short-chain poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) under two different shear mixing conditions at pH 5. This resulted in two types of aggregates with different mass fractal dimension and size. These aggregates were further flocculated using either a cationic or an anionic long-chain polymer at the same pH. A filtration study of these dual-polymer-induced aggregates showed that there may exist an optimum dosage for the second polymer, which results in the lowest final cake moisture. Dual-polymer flocculation was found to result in lower compressive yield stresses than that found for the case of single, high-molecular-weight polymer flocculation. This gave rise to lower final cake moistures for the dual-polymer-flocculated systems (28. 3 % w/w) compared {{to the case of}} the single, high-molecular-weight polymer-flocculated system (34. 7 % w/w). The filtration rate was high for the dual-polymer systems in most cases. In addition, the polymer dosage required to achieve good supernatant clarity was decreased from that of the single-polymer case when dual polymers were used. The use of dual-polymer flocculants of opposite charge was found to give an improvement in final cake moisture over that achieved using dual polymers of like charge. The structural characteristics of the primary aggregates were also found to have a significant influence on the <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of the dual-polymer-induced aggregates. Under the conditions used, large, open primary aggregates led to final flocs with lower cake moisture and faster filtration rate. It is envisaged that optimisation of industrial dewatering processes in this way can result in considerable savings in transportation and enhanced product value...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{commercial}} process for SO 2 removal from flue gas is the wet limestone flue gas desulfurization process, in which sulfite oxidation represents an important limiting phenomenon. A detailed {{knowledge of the}} oxidation process is important to determine the <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of the sludge produced, and {{a good understanding of}} the oxidation kinetics is also useful for the development of computer codes aimed at modeling the whole flue gas desulfurization process. Sulfite oxidation was studied both in homogeneous conditions, obtained bycontacting a sulfite solution with an oxygen saturated solution, and in heterogeneous conditions, obtained by contacting a sulfurous solution with an oxygen containing gas phase. As far as the bisulfite oxidation reaction in heterogeneous conditions is concerned, a previous experimental study by the same research group in absolute catalyst free conditions found a kinetic equation for calcium bisulfite oxidation which is of zero order in oxygen and three halves in HSO 3 -ions. The reaction has then been carried out in the presence of other catalysts, namely manganese and ferrous ions, into a laboratory-scale well-mixed reactor. Experimental results have shown that, when catalyst concentration increases, theree different reaction regimes (slow kinetic, slow diffusional and fast reaction regime) can be detected. This paper proposes a numerical model to describe the interaction between oxygen absorption and oxidation reaction, in which an in-parallel kinetic equation is used to describe the slow kinetic reaction results, according towhich the overall reaction rate can be calculated as the sum of the uncatalyzed and catalyzed reaction rate, also taking into account that the oxidation kinetics are zero order in oxygen. Moreover, this paper shows how the model is capable of describing the experimental results obtained by this research group, as far as the manganese catalyzed bisulfite oxidation rate is concerned.

40|$|The {{papermaking}} {{process can}} be described as a process to remove water from pulp. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the effects to <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> in each sub-process including forming, pressing and drying. Lampen mill refiner and Voith LR- 40 refiner is used to generate 4 different types of pulp which are subject to dewater with laboratory papermaking process. Moving belt former (MBF) was used to forming sheets and this machine also can generate different vacuum levels to remove the water from the wet web. Then the wet sheets are dewatered with MTS-press which can generate high pressure in a millisecond scale. IR-dryer was used to dry the sheets to evaluate the evaporation rate. It is found that with the increasing energy level in refining, the heavily refined fibres are shorter, more fibrillation, straight and fines than that of lightly refined. Meanwhile, the Voith refined fibres have more fibrillation than Lampen refined pulp. In forming part, the vacuum curves and surface level curves can be characterized by MBF. When high vacuum level applied on wet web, the heavily refined pulps or high fines content furnishes have higher vacuum curves and longer drainage time because the fibrillations and more fines result in the web denser and less permeable. Voith refined samples have higher vacuum curves and longer drainage time than that of Lampen mill refined samples. The dry solid content was measured after each sub-step. Heavily refined samples have lower dry solid content than that of lightly refined samples and Voith heavily refined samples have lower dry solid content than that of Lampen heavily refined samples. The heavily refined pulps or more fines content have the lower speed to be dried. Lightly refined samples have higher evaporation rate than of heavily refined samples...|$|R
40|$|Thermal drying of a pulp {{sheet on}} a paper machine {{is one of the}} most {{energy-intensive}} operations in the paper-making process (Ghosh, 2011). The drying section of a paper machine removes less than 20 % of the total water eliminated from the wet sheet, but is responsible for 78 % of the energy consumption of the paper machine (Karlsson, 2009 & Biermann, 1996). Any enhancement of the dewatering of the paper sheet in the forming and pressing sections, thereby sending a sheet of lower moisture content to the drying section, would result in significant energy savings in the drying of the paper. Typically, the Canadian Standard Freeness (or freeness) and the Water Retention Value (WRV) of pulp are used as a measurement for the dewatering ability of pulp on the wire of the paper machine (Hubbe, 2007). However, neither of these measurements was designed to predict the water removed from the wet sheet (TAPPI T 227, 1999, Scallan & Carles, 1972). The factors that influence the dewatering of pulp on the forming fabric and in the pressing section of a paper machine have been the subject of many studies (Hubbe, 2007). The first objective of the current study was to compile a literature review to build an dewatering of the pulp sheet. Pliable fibres may conform to each other, resulting in a sealing effect that inhibits drainage. Mechanical and enzymatic refining may induce external and internal fibrillation of fibres, and the generation of fines in the pulp. Treating the pulp with an enzyme, specifically endoglucanase, may enhance the susceptibility of the fibres to development by mechanical refining. In the current study, the dewatering of pulp was analysed at pilot scale in order to test which pulp measurements best predicted its forming and pressing performance. A hardwood pulp, composed of Eucalyptus grandis, was refined in a pilot refiner and yielded samples over a range of refining energies. The conventional dewatering measurements, freeness and WRV, were performed on the pulp samples and related to the dewatering performance of the handsheets produced therefrom. The formability (water removed during forming) and pressibility (water removed during pressing) of the handsheets were also determined, and compared to the freeness and WRV of the pulps. It was found that the formability of a handsheet was a much stronger predictor of its dewatering performance than either the freeness or WRV of the pulp. Formability was likely the best predictor of handsheet dewatering because it was a direct measurement of the dewatering performance of a sheet on the forming fabric, whereas freeness and WRV both measured the dewatering of a thicker pad of pulp. The effect of the refining of pulp with an enzyme additive on its <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> was also studied at pilot scale. An endoglucanase was incubated with a hardwood pulp, composed primarily of Eucalyptus grandis, and refined in a pilot refiner. The enzyme was added at four levels, including a control pulp with no enzyme. The <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of the handsheets formed from the pulp were tested and compared for each enzyme dosage. The morphology of fibres of each of the pulps was determined. It was found that increasing the enzyme dosage of the pulps resulted in the decrease of the dewatering ability of the handsheets. The number of fines in the pulp increased with increasing enzyme dosage. It was likely that fines were responsible for the restriction of pulp dewatering, as suggested by the choke-point hypothesis (Hubbe, 2007). Based on the extent of fibrillation and width of fibres, as well as the number of fines in the pulp, a model of the effect of the enzyme added on the dewatering of the pulp was proposed. Increasing the enzyme concentration in the pulp increased the susceptibility of the fibre to refining. An enzyme dosage of 100 g/t resulted in a more fibrillated fibre than found in the control pulp. However, the fibres of the pulp treated with the enzyme at a concentration of 200 g/t were less fibrillated, suggesting that the fibre surface was weakened to the extent that the fibrils were broke off during refining. The fibres of the pulp treated at 500 g/t were again more fibrillated, suggesting the occurrence of secondary fibrillation of the fibre at this high enzyme dosage. The fibres of the pulps treated at 500 and 200 g/t were also narrower, suggesting the loss of fibre material.

Because this sludge is highly rotten, {{it should be}} stabilized before its disposal. Aerobic and anaerobic digestion is widely considered as stabilization techniques. Because of high retention time and sludge dewatering difficulties, reduction in retention time, operation and maintenance should be given into consideration. Ultrasonic process increases the enzymatic activity, so decreases the hydrolysis time, a limiting factor in digestion process, and contributes to the decrease of the detention time. The objective of this investigation {{is to determine the}} effect of ultrasound in improving dewatering and stabilization of aerobic and anaerobic digested sludge. In addition, the impact of ultrasonic treatment on improvement of sludge dewatering and aerobic and anaerobic digestion is compared. Materials and Methods: In this survey, samples of aerobic and anaerobic digestion were collected from local full-scale Garb Town and Tehran South wastewater treatment plant, respectively. The grab samples were collected for 4 month from July to October 2010. Total numbers of 20 samples were collected biweekly for each type of digestion. Each sample was sonicated for 15, 30, 60, and 90 min under 35 and 131 kHz frequencies separately. Total solids, volatile solids, pH, temperature, total COD, dissolved COD and settle able solids were measured. Ultrasound bath of the solution in a 300 mL glass reactor was performed as a bath reactor with power of 500 W. Result: The results showed that the application of ultrasonic wave increased dissolved COD and temperature and decreased volatile solid, pH and settle able solids. Application of ultrasonic wave with frequency of 131 kHz decreased the VS and increased the dewatering of sludge more effective than the 35 kHz frequency and the highest performance was at 15 min of time and 131 kHz of frequency. Also sonication method showed better efficiency for anaerobic sludge samples compared to the aerobic sludge samples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion: The results obtained showed that digestion and <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> of sludge improved by ultrasonic application.

40|$|Hydrothermal {{carbonization}} (HTC) is {{a process}} where elevated temperature and pressure is used in order to convert biomass to hydrochar, a coal-like substance with good <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> and many potential uses. HTC {{can be used to}} treat digestate from anaerobic digestion, but the process water that remains after the hydrochar has been recovered needs to be treated further in the wastewater treatment plant. In order to make HTC more competitive compared to other sludge treatments it is important to find a good use for the process water. The main objective of this master thesis was to investigate the effects of recirculating HTC process water to the anaerobic digestion. To achieve the objective, both theoretical calculations and experimental trials were performed. The experimental trials were conducted with an Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS II) in order to investigate the anaerobic digestion in laboratory scale. In the first trial, three substrates, process water, hydrochar, and primary sludge were tested for their biochemical methane potential (BMP). All substrates were mixed with inoculum. Process water had a BMP of 335 ± 10 % NmL/gvs (normalized CH 4 production in mL per g added VS (volatile solids)), hydrochar had BMP of 150 ± 5 % NmL/gvs, and primary sludge had a BMP of 343 ± 2 % NmL/gvs. The methane production was almost the same for process water as for primary sludge i. e. no inhibitory effects could be seen when process water was mixed with only inoculum. In the second trial, a more realistic scenario was tested where process water was co-digested with primary sludge at different ratios. The results from the second trial were not statistically reliable and therefore cannot be used on their own to determine with certainty if the process water could have an inhibitory effect in a full-scale anaerobic digester. However, the combined results from both trials indicate that {{it is unlikely that the}} process water would have an inhibitory effect. The possible increase in methane yield, if the digestate from a biogas facility was treated in full-scale implementation of the HTC process, was calculated theoretically. The produced process water would have the capacity to increase the methane production with approximately 10 % for a biogas facility. For the calculations, the BMP for process water was assumed to be 335 NmL/gvs and no synergetic effects was considered...|$|R

Thermophilic Post-Digestion of Sewage Sludge – A Pilot Study Magnus Philipson Due {{to a new}} sludge {{regulation}} proposed by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{it is likely that}} sewage sludge produced at Swedish municipal sewage treatment plants has to be sanitized in the near future. In the Swedish EPA’s proposed new sludge regulation thermophilic digestion at 55 °C with 6 hour guaranteed exposure time is suggested an authorized sanitation method. At the sewage treatment plant in Uppsala, Kungsängsverket managed by Uppsala Vatten och Avfall AB, the process has got no sanitation step at present. The sludge is mesophilically digested at 37 °C and dehydrated with decanter centrifuges. An investigation conducted by an external consultant has shown that conventional sanitation through pasteurization would be very costly in terms of energy consumption. If the sludge could be sanitized via thermophilic anaerobic digestion this could be a much cheaper option due to increased gas production and reduced sludge volumes. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate the possibility to sanitize sludge from Kungängsverket via thermophilic post-digestion at 55 ° C. The work was carried out through pilot tests during 15 weeks with two digesters of 35 liters each fed with thickened mesophilically digested sludge from Kungsängsverket. The operation of the thermophilic post-digestion plant was evaluated by documenting the parameters ammonium nitrogen, pH, Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA), total alkalinity, bicarbonate alkalinity and degree of digestion as well as measurement of gas production and gas quality. The dewatering of the thermophilically post-digested sludge was investigated using a Capillary Suction Timer (CST- analysis). Based on extrapolated data from the experiments an energy balance for a full-scale post-digestion system at Kungsängsverket was made. Results show that thermophilic post-digestion of mesophilically digested sewage sludge is feasible and provides both increased gas production as well as increased degree of decomposition. It was shown that the anaerobic digestion processes proceeded despite high pH and high concentrations of ammonia. The resulting gas production were equivalent of 190 liters per kg volatile solids (VS) fed which extrapolated to full scale would mean an increase of the total biogas production at Kungsängsverket by about 20 %. The degree of digestion was between 15 and 20 % of input VS. CST-analyzes shows that the sludge <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties</b> is degraded by thermophilic post-digestion. Energy calculations show that thermophilic post-digestion can be a profitable method, given that it is feasible in full scale. It has to be stressed that the feasibility is dependent on fair <b>dewatering</b> <b>properties.</b> This has to be further investigated to determine whether the process can be implemented in full scale or not. This work is a first part of a larger project, SVU 12 - 118, where a larger set-up for sludge treatment through thickening, thermophilic post-digestion, aeration and addition of oxidizing agents will be evaluated...|$|R
