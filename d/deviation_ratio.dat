FACTORS AFFECTING T-BOND HEDGE RATIO INSTABILITY Unstable hedge ratios can adversely affect the measure of hedging effectiveness in the regression approach to minimize risk. This paper examines the relative importance of the correlation coefficient versus the standard <b>deviation</b> <b>ratio</b> as the cause of unstable hedge ratios using T-bond futures. The paper concludes that the standard <b>deviation</b> <b>ratio</b> is significantly more important than the correlation coefficient in determining changes in the hedge ratio for the Bellwether series, while both the standard <b>deviation</b> <b>ratio</b> and the correlation coefficient are important for the two-year T-note series.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the grain refinement and its mechanism in shear spinning, microstructures of shear spun parts made by aluminium alloy under different deformation conditions, induced by different shear spinning deviation ratios, are studied. The results show that, after shear spinning, the microstructure is distributed symmetrically about a zone in sheet thickness {{defined as the}} neutral zone which is located between the inner surface and the middle plane of spun sheet thickness. Various deviation ratios in shear spinning can lead to grain refinement in different regions along thickness direction of the spun part. The microstructure characteristics indicate that the mechanism of grain refinement {{is due to the}} formation of deformation bands (DBs). It is observed that in DBs, parallel geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs) formed by a zero <b>deviation</b> <b>ratio</b> and crossed GNBs formed by positive and negative deviation ratios are due to the different stress states induced by various deviation ratios in shear spinning.

The optimality does not depend on the presence of moral hazard and agency problems. Our theoretical model of multi-stage financing, largely based on Asian option pricing theory, allows us to compute the risk reduction ratio due to multi-staging. The return on a staged financing plan is equivalent to an exchange of a straight equity stake for that acquired through stochastic averaging over time. We compare standard <b>deviation</b> <b>ratios</b> for staged vs. up-front financings as well as across asset classes.

40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs), {{the class}} of salts with melting points below 100 °C, are {{promising}} alternatives to molecular solvents. Their great chemical tuneability opens the possibility of tailoring ILs for specific tasks; however, data from systematic structure-property studies of ILs, {{as well as a}} more complete understanding of the liquid structure and interionic interactions within ILs, are required for the rational design of ILs. In this thesis, a systematic study of the effect of alkyl chain length and alkyl chain branching on the transport properties and carbon dioxide solubility in trialkyltriazolium ionic liquids is described. The viscosities, diffusion coefficients, and conductivities of 15 1, 2, 4 -trialkyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ILs are reported, and are found to be greatly reduced in ILs that incorporate multiple branched alkyl groups on the cation. The interrelationships among the transport properties are analyzed by comparing the deviations of the transport properties of each IL from Walden’s Rule, the Stokes-Einstein equation, and the Nernst-Einstein equation. Preliminary evidence is given for a connection between the formation of polar and non-polar nanodomains within ILs, and the Nernst-Einstein <b>deviation</b> <b>ratio.</b> Henry’s Law constants for the solubility of carbon dioxide in the ILs are reported and found to be most strongly correlated to the molar volume of the IL; evidence supporting a relationship between the Nernst-Einstein <b>deviation</b> <b>ratio</b> and carbon dioxide solubility for a given IL is not found. ...|$|E
