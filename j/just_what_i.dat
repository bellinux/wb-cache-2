500|$|Musically, [...] "Deuces" [...] is a slow, down-tempo R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} house and pop music. The song has {{a length of}} four minutes and thirty-six seconds. It is backed by synth chords and [...] "eerie harmonies", with Brown's [...] "smooth vocals" [...] making use of auto-tune effects. According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, the song contains lyrical content about [...] "breaking {{it off with a}} girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work". In the first verse, Brown sings: [...] "All that bullshit is for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture / Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up / You'll regret the day when I find another girl, that knows <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> need / She knows <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean." ...|$|E

He further explained that [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. He typed out 2,000 words in the morning, {{directly}} from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month, completing it on 18 March 1952. Fleming took the name for his character {{from that of the}} American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that [...] "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> needed, and so a second James Bond was born".|$|E

"Fair Game", where Sia sings [...] "Watch me squirm baby, but you're <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> need," [...] is {{a minimalist}} and string-laden song about {{the desire to}} find an equal partner.

The song addresses [...] "the overwhelming strength [...] needed to convince herself that life was worth living after {{coming out of a}} crushing relationship." [...] "Free the Animal" [...] lyrically [...] "imagines being killed in lurid, masochistic detail" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Detonate me / Shoot me like a cannon ball / Granulate me / Kill me like an animal." [...] The tenth song, [...] "Fire Meet Gasoline", was compared to Beyoncé's [...] "Halo" [...] by Harriet Gibsone from The Guardian. [...] "Cellophane" [...] is an electropop track, where Sia likens herself to [...] "a basket filled with pain." [...] 1000 Forms of Fear concludes with [...] "Dressed in Black", which Heather Phares of AllMusic described as a ballad [...] "with more depth than the ones she writes for hire." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel centres on the {{exploits}} of James Bond, {{an officer in the}} Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, an expert on Caribbean birds and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, himself a keen birdwatcher, had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> needed, and so a second James Bond was born".

500|$|Leland reports meeting Maddalena in 1886, and {{she became}} the primary source for his Italian {{folklore}} collecting for several years. Leland describes her as belonging to a vanishing tradition of sorcery. [...] He writes that [...] "by long practice [...] has perfectly learned ... <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want, and how to extract it from those of her kind." [...] He received several hundred pages worth of material from her, which was incorporated into his books Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition, Legends of Florence Collected From the People, and eventually Aradia. Leland wrote that he had [...] "learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth the doctrines of Italian witchcraft" [...] in 1886, and had urged Maddalena to find it. Eleven years later, on 1 January 1897, Leland received the Vangelo by post. The manuscript was written in Maddalena's handwriting. Leland understood {{it to be an}} authentic document of the [...] "Old Religion" [...] of the witches, but explains {{that he did not know}} if the text came from written or oral sources.|$|E

[...] Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. “In fact, Willy's logical mind becomes blind…” Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. [...] This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul saying [...] "Pop, I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that? There's no spite in it any more. I'm <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am, that's all." [...] At Willy's funeral, Biff states that [...] "He had the wrong dreams...He never knew who he was.".|$|E
500|$|The Postman Always Rings Twice {{became a}} major box office success, which {{prompted}} the studio to take more risks on Turner, casting her outside of the glamorous sex symbol roles {{she had come to}} be known for. In August 1946, it was announced Turner was set to replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budgeted historical drama Green Dolphin Street (1947), a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds. It was Carey Wilson who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn, saying: [...] "I'm about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot. But it was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." [...] It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks. In an interview, Turner said: [...] "I even go running around in the jungles of New Zealand in a dress that's filthy and ragged. I don't wear any make-up and my hair's a mess." [...] Nevertheless, she insisted she would not give up her glamorous image.|$|E

2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready when I came in, would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am going to do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{continued}} {{his work with}} a series of instrumental works, called [...] Another Look at Harmony [...] (1975–1977). For Glass this series demonstrated a new start, hence the title: [...] "What I was looking for was a way of combining harmonic progression with the rhythmic structure I had been developing, to produce a new overall structure. (...) I'd taken everything out with my early works and it was now time to decide <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to put in—a process that would occupy me for several years to come." [...] Parts 1 and 2 of [...] "Another Look at Harmony" [...] were included in a collaboration with Robert Wilson, a piece of musical theater later designated by Glass as the first opera of his portrait opera trilogy: Einstein on the Beach. Composed in spring to fall of 1975 in close collaboration with Wilson, Glass's first opera was first premiered in summer 1976 at the Festival d'Avignon, and in November of the same year to a mixed and partly enthusiastic reaction from the audience at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Scored for the Philip Glass Ensemble, solo violin, chorus, and featuring actors (reciting texts by Christopher Knowles, Lucinda Childs and Samuel M. Johnson), Glass's and Wilson's essentially plotless opera was conceived as a [...] "metaphorical look at Albert Einstein: scientist, humanist, amateur musician—and the man whose theories (...) led to the splitting of the atom", evoking nuclear holocaust in the climactic scene, as critic Tim Page pointed out. As with Another Look at Harmony, [...] "Einstein added a new functional harmony that set it apart from the early conceptual works". Composer Tom Johnson came to the same conclusion, comparing the solo violin music to Johann Sebastian Bach, and the [...] "organ figures (...) to those Alberti basses Mozart loved so much". The piece was praised by The Washington Post as [...] "one of the seminal artworks of the century." ...|$|E
