5|$|Anderson {{came back}} for another PBL season with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2011. The team had changed {{locations}} from Manchester, New Hampshire to Saint John, New Brunswick in Canada {{prior to the start}} of the season. Anderson debuted on January 2, 2011in a loss against the Quebec Kebs, in which he recorded a team-high 20 points, 6 assists, and 4 steals. He had another notable scoring performance on January 21, when <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> 24 points on the Rochester RazorSharks. In the next two contests, Anderson recorded season-highs of 9 assists and 7 rebounds vs. the Halifax Rainmen and tied his season-bests of 24 points and 9 assists in a rematch against the Quebec Kebs. The three games led to him being named PBL Player of the Week on February 10, 2011. On March 17, Anderson scored a season-high 32 points with 12-of-24 shooting and 5 three-pointers vs. the Halifax Rainmen. He also contributed 6 assists and 4 rebounds. As the season came to a conclusion, he was named second-team All-PBL.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

25|$|Threatened by lung {{trouble in}} 1879, Horace Plunkett sought health in {{ranching}} {{for ten years}} (1879–89) in the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming, where, together with a substantial fortune, he acquired experience that proved invaluable {{in the work of}} agricultural education, improvement and development, to which he devoted himself on his return to Ireland {{after the death of his}} father in 1889. Never marrying, <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> his tremendous energy into politics, sociology, public administration and economics. As visible testimony to his endeavours, he left the Irish cooperative movement and what is now the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as his main legacies.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Leblond found that, when <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> liquid {{photographic}} emulsion on a histological section containing a radio element, the emulsion was eventually activated by the radio-element; and if thereafter routine photographic development and fixation {{were applied to}} the emulsion-covered section, black silver grains appeared in the emulsion wherever it overlay sites containing a radio-element. This liquid emulsion approach {{has been used to}} develop a new High Resolution Autoradiography procedure characterized by close contact between emulsion and section. Such close contact makes it possible to localize the radio-elements in the section at high resolution, so that radio-elements can be localized at high magnification in the light microscope.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{account of}} Wei Boyang {{is found in}} the Shenxian zhuan (Biographies of the Divine Immortals), a work {{attributed}} to Ge Hong (283-343). According to this record (trans. Campany, 2002:368-69), Wei Boyang {{was the son of a}} high-ranking family. He and three disciples retired to a mountain and compounded an elixir. When they tested it on a dog, the dog died. Despite this, Wei Boyang and one of his disciples decided to ingest the compound, and they also died. After the two other disciples had left, Wei Boyang came to life again. <b>He</b> <b>poured</b> some of the elixir into the mouths of the dead disciple and the dog, and they also revived. Thus Wei Boyang and his faithful disciple attained immortality. With an abrupt change in tone and language, the account ends with a final paragraph, which mentions Wei Boyang’s authorship of the Cantong qi and of another work entitled The Five Categories (Wu xianglei 五相類), criticizing at the same time those who read the Cantong qi as a work concerned with cosmology instead of alchemy.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 2015, Hansbrough {{signed a}} one-year {{deal with the}} Charlotte Hornets. He went on to have a career-worst season in 2015–16, {{averaging}} just 2.4 points and 2.0 rebounds in 7.8 minutes per game over 44 contests. He spent most of November and December serving as depth on the Hornets bench, before injuries to both Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller in January helped open up some minutes in the frontcourt for Hansbrough. He took advantage of this opportunity, with his best performance of the year coming in a road game against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 29. <b>He</b> <b>poured</b> in a season-high 12 points and a career high-tying 14 rebounds, the latter of which also tied for the highest total by any Hornets player in a single game in 2015–16. Hansbrough played in 12 total games in January, averaging 3.0 points, 3.8 rebounds and 0.7 steals in 13.4 minutes. However, he quickly saw his minutes dwindle with the roster getting healthier as the year continued to unfold. He averaged 1.9 points and 0.9 rebounds in 4.6 minutes in 16 total games {{from the start of}} February {{until the end of the}} regular season.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the first}} {{commercial}} television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939 over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors {{at the time to}} have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for Ivory Soap, he held up a bar of the product; for Mobilgas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel; and for Wheaties <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful. Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed {{in the early years of}} the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{explained}} in these letters {{that in an}} experiment he did show that the charge was in the glass itself {{and not in the}} water within the jar, as had been theorized by others. After a Leyden jar was charged <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> the water from it into another Leyden jar that was not charged.

Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar. The conclusion then was that it was the glass itself that was the condenser of the electric force. It was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter what shape the glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle. It was finally determined that a property of the glass itself was this [...] "force" [...] of equal and opposite charges.|$|E

He was a good enough golfer to represent Yorkshire, to partner Henry Cotton, and {{to play in the}} qualifying rounds of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1939. Sutcliffe wrote that leading golfers told him that had Waddington not been a cricketer, he had the talent to have succeeded as a golfer, although he was prone to carelessness in his play. One Bradford golf club banned him after <b>he</b> <b>poured</b> a glass of beer over the captain, who Waddington believed had used inappropriate language in front of a woman.
