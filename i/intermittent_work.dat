5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found <b>intermittent</b> <b>work,</b> including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{of the new}} county, {{which enabled}} both more local control and {{political}} patronage, followed the Scranton General Strike of 1877, part of the labor actions that had swept the country and were known as the Great Railroad Strike, starting in walkouts by railroad workers after wage cuts in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and <b>intermittent</b> <b>work.</b> In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, {{with a total of}} four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor John Hartranft eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.|$|E

In the same year, {{after more than a}} decade of <b>intermittent</b> <b>work</b> on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune ("The Yellow Princess"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.|$|E

500|$|The Pilgrim's Progress (1951), the composer's last opera, was the {{culmination}} of more than forty years' <b>intermittent</b> <b>work</b> on the theme of Bunyan's religious allegory. Vaughan Williams had written incidental music for an amateur dramatisation in 1906, and had returned to the theme in 1921 with the one-act The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains (finally incorporated, with amendments, into the 1951 opera). The work has been criticised for a preponderance of slow music and stretches lacking in dramatic action, but some commentators believe the work to be one of Vaughan Williams's supreme achievements. Summaries of the music vary from [...] "beautiful, if something of a stylistic jumble" [...] (Saylor) to [...] "a synthesis of Vaughan Williams's stylistic progress over the years, from the pastoral mediation of the 1920s to the angry music of the middle symphonies and eventually the more experimental phase of the Sinfonia antartica in his last decade" [...] (Kennedy).|$|E

Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and <b>intermittent</b> <b>work</b> force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a [...] "career".

40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that if a}} time series is not sampled at a fast enough rate to capture all the high frequencies then aliasing may occur.

The situation is more complex and more interesting for nonstationary series as aliasing can be <b>intermittent.</b> Recent <b>work</b> has shown {{that it is possible}} to test for the absence of aliasing in nonstationary time series and this article demonstrates that additional benefits can be obtained by modelling a series using a Shannon locally stationary wavelet (LSW) process. We show that for Shannon LSW processes the effects of dyadic-sampling-induced aliasing can be reversed. We illustrate our method by simulation on Shannon LSW processes and also a time-varying autoregressive process where aliasing is detected. We present an analysis of a wind power time series and show that it can be adequately modelled by a Shannon LSW process, the absence of aliasing can not be inferred and present a dealiased estimate of the series...|$|R

Others, however, perceive it as a threat to communal intimacy and local ways of life, and accuse it of increasing inequality in the village. Such polarisation of approaches reflects, at least partly, the pre-existing divisions and hierarchies in the village.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to measure the reliability of fatigue measures in an <b>intermittent</b> overhead <b>work</b> task. Fatigue measures included several EMG based parameters and subjective discomfort ratings through use of the Borg CR- 10 scale.

Ten participants used a drill tool to perform an overhead tapping task for one hour at a height relative to individual anthropometry. Reliability indexes, including Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, Standard Errors of Measurement, and Coefficients of Variation were determined for each fatigue measure for each of three shoulder muscles (anterior deltoid, middle deltoid, and trapezius). High reliability implies repeatable results, and precise and credible methods. Conversely, measurement error and subject variability can lead to low reliability of measures. The results indicated that ratings of perceived discomfort (RPD) parameters (slope and final rating) showed relatively high reliability.

Thirty firefighters were randomly allocated to the sleep restricted (n = 17, SR; 19 °C, 4 -h sleep opportunity) or hot and sleep restricted (n = 13, HOT + SR; 33 °C, 4 -h sleep opportunity) condition. Firefighters performed two days of simulated, <b>intermittent,</b> self-paced <b>work</b> circuits comprising six firefighting tasks. Heart rate, and core temperature were measured continuously.

There were no differences between the SR and HOT + SR groups in firefighters’ physiological responses, hydration status, ratings of perceived exertion, motivation, and four of the six firefighting tasks (charged hose advance, rake, hose rolling, static hose hold). Black out hose and lateral repositioning were adversely affected in the HOT + SR group.

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{reliable}} fault diagnostics for intermittent failure modes {{are an important}} tool to adequately deal with realistic failure behavior within complex systems. A large proportion of previous work utilizing model-based fault diagnostics has focused on persistent faults and often neglects the case where the system intermittently switches between a faulty and non-faulty behavior at discrete random intervals. Such intermittent behavior complicates the diagnostics task, with difficulties in detecting and isolating intermittent faults, which occur with low frequency but yet at high enough frequency to be unacceptable. Accurate assessment of intermittent failure probabilities is critical to diagnosing and repairing equipment and requires the development of models to describe {{the dynamics of the}} intermittent failure. This paper presents an overall framework for detecting sensor faults, through the use of nonlinear unknown input observers which are applicable to both persistent and <b>intermittent</b> faults.
