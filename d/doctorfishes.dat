50|$|Acanthurus monroviae is a {{tropical}} fish which {{is found in}} the eastern Atlantic ocean. It is commercial in fisheries, and is also used in aquariums. It was first named by Franz Steindachner in 1876, and is known commonly as the Monrovia <b>doctorfish.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the <b>doctorfish</b> Acanthurus chirurgus is reported {{for the first time}} in the Mediterranean Sea, off Elba Island, Tyrrhenian Sea (42. 726667 ° N, 10. 434444 ° E). This record is tentatively related to aquarium release. The {{occurrence of}} Acanthuridae in the Mediterranean Sea is briefly reviewed, and some distributional notes on Acanthurus coeruleus and Acanthurus monroviae in the Mediterranean are provided...|$|R
5000|$|Reaching {{a maximum}} size of 39 cm and 5.1 kg, Acanthurus chirurgus gets its common {{name for the}} {{structures}} called [...] "scalpels", which are found {{on either side of}} the caudal peduncle. The [...] "scalpel" [...] is used during fights with other <b>doctorfish</b> and as a defense mechanism against predators. Its coloration generally varies from blue-gray to dark brown. 10 to 12 vertical bars are always present, but often faint. The edges of the caudal, dorsal, and anal fins are blue. There is also a faint blue ring that can be seen encircling the [...] "scalpel" [...] on either side.|$|R

As estratégias reprodutivas de peixes-cirurgiões do gênero Acanthurus são bem conhecidas para todas as espécies registradas no Atlântico, exceto para Acanthurus monroviae, um cirurgião do Atlântico leste cuja biologia permanece pouco conhecida. Apresentamos aqui o primeiro relato do comportamento reprodutivo de A. monroviae, espécie exótica registrada nos recifes rochosos da costa sudeste do Brasil...|$|R
40|$|The <b>doctorfish</b> Acanthurus chirurgus (Bloch, 1787) is {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from the central Mediterranean, based on a specimen caught in Maltese waters during August 2016. Since the only previous Mediterranean record of this species was based on a single individual observed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the present record likely represents an independent introduction that may have occurred through the aquarium trade or via shipping. Two other surgeonfish species, Acanthurus coeruleus Bloch and Schneider, 1801 and Acanthurus monroviae Steindachner, 1876, were previously recorded from the central Mediterranean. While A. coeruleus may have established a population in the Levantine Sea, like A. chirurgus it has only been reported once from Malta (and from the central Mediterranean in general); both A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus are, therefore, considered to be casual species in Maltese waters. In contrast, A. monroviae was reported from several Mediterranean countries including Tunisia and Malta in the central Mediterranean. Here we present several authenticated reports of this species from Maltese waters, which strongly suggest that it has managed to establish a population in this region, although the possibility of multiple introductions cannot be excluded. peer-reviewe...|$|R
