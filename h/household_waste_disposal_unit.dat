40|$|The EU Landfill Directive {{requires}} Member States {{to reduce}} the amount of biodegradable waste disposed of to landfill. This has been a key driver for the establishment of new waste management options, particularly in the UK, which in the past relied heavily on landfill for the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW in the UK is managed by Local Authorities, some of which in a less conventional way have been encouraging the installation and use of <b>household</b> food <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> (FWDs) as an option to divert food waste from landfill. This study aimed to evaluate the additional burden to water industry operations in the UK associated with this option, compared with the benefits and related savings from the subsequent reductions in MSW collection and disposal. A simple economic analysis was undertaken for different FWD uptake scenarios, using the Anglian Region as a case study. Results demonstrated that the significant savings from waste collection arising from a large-scale uptake of FWDs would outweigh the costs associated with the impacts to the water industry. However, in the case of a low uptake, such savings would not be enough to cover the increased costs associated with the wastewater provision. As a result, this study highlights the need for policy intervention in terms of regulating the use of FWDs, either promoting them as an alternative to landfill to increase savings from waste management, or banning them as a threat to wastewater operations to reduce potential costs to the water industry...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{standard}} waste input–output {{models for}} single region and multi-regions do not endogenously treat the dependent relationship between income distribution (household consumption) and <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> generation. As in Miyazawa and Masegi (1963), I introduce the propagation process of income distribution and <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> generation into the extended input–output analysis and reveal the hidden money flow {{resulting from the}} industrial and <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> behaviour. From the empirical analysis, I find the endogenous income propagation effect resulting from the <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> treatments induced by unit household consumption (one million yen) was remarkably small, as compared to that for ordinary commodity productions. I also find that the contribution of industrial and <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> treatment and recycling activities to the 1995 Japanese economy was about one trillion yen (0. 1 % {{of the gross domestic}} output), considering the endogenous income propagation effects induced by the consumption behaviour of labours engaging in the waste treatments. Interestingly, the empirical results reveal that the contribution of one ton of the industrial waste to the Japanese economy was 5, 730 yen, while one ton of the <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> brought about 8, 266 yen of total economic impact. This indicates that the <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> activity was more beneficial than the industrial <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> activity, considering the endogenous income propagation effects.

Data from these boreholes were collected to support site characterization activities for the U 3 ax/bl <b>disposal</b> <b>unit</b> and the entire Area 3 RWMS. Site characterization at <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> within the Area 3 RWMS must address the possibility that subsidence craters and associated disturbed alluvium of the chimneys beneath the craters might serve as pathways for contaminant migration. The two boreholes were drilled and sampled to compare hydrogeologic properties of alluvium below the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>unit</b> with those of adjacent undisturbed alluvium. Whether Borehole UE- 3 bl-D 1 actually penetrated the chimney of the U 3 bl crater is uncertain. Analyses of core samples showed little difference in hydrogeologic properties between the two boreholes. Important {{findings of this study}} include the following: No hazardous or radioactive constituents of <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> concern were found in the samples obtained from either borehole. No significant differences in physical and hydrogeologic properties between boreholes is evident, and no evidence of significant trends with depth for any of these properties was observed. The values observed are typical of sandy materials. The alluvium is dry, with volumetric water content ranging from 5. 6 to 16. 2 percent. Both boreholes exhibit a slight increase in water content with depth, the only such trend observed. Water potential measurements on core samples from both boreholes show a large positive potential gradient (water moves upward, via evapotranspiration) for the entire vertical depth.

Results of the assessment are applicable to disposal of low-level radioactive waste (LLW), uranium mill tailings, hazardous waste, and sanitary landfills. Three kinds of <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>unit</b> covers or barriers to water infiltration are being investigated: (1) resistive layer barrier, (2) conductive layer barrier, and (3) bioengineering management. The resistive layer barrier consists of compacted earthen material (e. g., clay). The conductive layer barrier consists of a conductive layer {{in conjunction with a}} capillary break. As long as unsaturated flow conditions are maintained, the conductive layer will wick water around the capillary break. Below-grade layered covers such as (1) and (2) will fail if there is appreciable subsidence of the cover, and remedial action for this kind of failure will be difficult. A surface cover, called bioengineering management, is meant to overcome this problem. The bioengineering management surface barrier is easily repairable if damaged by subsidence; therefore, it could be the system of choice under active subsidence conditions. The bioengineering management procedure also {{has been shown to be}} effective in dewatering saturated trenches and could be used for remedial action efforts. After cessation of subsidence, that procedure could be replaced by a resistive layer barrier or, perhaps even better, by a resistive layer barrier/conductive layer barrier system.

Closure planning for this facility {{must take into account}} the regulatory requirements for a diversity of <b>waste</b> streams, <b>disposal</b> and storage configurations, disposal history, and site conditions. This paper provides a brief background of the Area 5 RWMS, identifies key closure issues, and presents the closure strategy. Disposals have been made in 25 shallow excavated pits and trenches and 13 Greater Confinement Disposal (GCD) boreholes at the 92 -Acre Area since 1961. The pits and trenches have been used to dispose unclassified low-level waste (LLW), low-level mixed waste (LLMW), and asbestiform waste, and to store classified low-level and low-level mixed materials. The GCD boreholes are intermediate-depth <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> about 10 feet (ft) in diameter and 120 ft deep. Classified and unclassified high-specific activity LLW, transuranic (TRU), and mixed TRU are disposed in the GCD boreholes. TRU waste was also disposed inadvertently in trench T- 04 C. Except for three <b>disposal</b> <b>units</b> that are active, all pits and trenches are operationally covered with 8 -ft thick alluvium.

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{evidence from the}} survey data suggests that prior {{to the introduction of}} the minimum wage only 23 per cent of employers paid wages below eight euros, and this applied primarily to Eastern German and to private-sector firms. Overall, only 6 per cent of employees received wages below the minimum wage. The difference-in-difference estimates indicate that the minimum wage had no significant impact on employment within the first year after its introduction in January 2010. This result is consistent with the notion that imperfect competition in the underlying product market facilitates the pass-through of cost increases to the consumers via price increases. This is because municipal firms have a monopoly over <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal.</b> According to German legislation, the cost recovery principle pertaining to <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> fees allows for the direct transmission of higher labour costs in the form of higher fees to households, whose demand for waste removal services tends to remain relatively constant.

We {{study the}} factors driving <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> and recycling in 18 cities in Taiwan and Japan {{in order to}} understand the impact of alternative waste management incentives. We show that this depends on the effect of distinct policies on the relative costs of the main alternative disposal methods: recycling, disposal to landfill and illegal dumping. The willingness both to recycle and to dispose to landfill depends on the relative costs of the waste collection regime, and these are dominated by the time cost of alternative disposal methods. The higher the frequency of waste collection, the less recycling and the more disposal to landfill there will be. This is because frequent collection reduces the marginal time-cost of disposal to landfill. Curbside collection of recy-clable material, and the frequency of that collection, has a similar effect on the recycling rate. Although direct incentives, such as unit pricing are important in the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> decision, recycling depends primarily on management of the time-costs it involves...|$|R
