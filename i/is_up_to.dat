5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E
5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa {{attempts to make}} friends with a new girl, Francine (who is much larger and tougher than Lisa), but Francine beats up Lisa severely.

Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E
5|$|The Apple A5 chip doubles {{processing}} speed and has graphics processing that <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> nine {{times faster than}} the previous iPad.

CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by iOSnoops indicate a 66% performance increase compared to the original iPad.|$|E
