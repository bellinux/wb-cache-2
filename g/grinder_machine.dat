40|$|Background: Human {{error is}} the most {{important}} cause of occupational and non-occupational accidents. Because, it seems necessary to identify, predict and analyze human errors, and also offer appropriate control strategies to reduce errors which cause adverse consequences, the present study was carried out with the aim of identifying human errors while operating meat grinder and offer suggestions in order to reduce human errors in this human-machine system. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. In this ergonomic study the “Task Analysis for Error Identification (TAFEI) ” technique was used in order to identify human errors while operating a meat <b>grinder</b> <b>machine.</b> According to this technique, firstly, tasks of human side of the interaction were described by Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and then the State-Space Diagrams (SSDs) were drawn. Finally, after forming the TAFEI diagrams, the transition matrix table was prepared in order to identify human errors. Results: After completing all the steps of TAFEI technique, the transition matrix table was formed. Results showed 49 illegal transition states; therefore, 49 human errors were identified and described while operating the meat <b>grinder</b> <b>machine.</b> Conclusion: The results of this study showed how and under which conditions may meat grinder users do error in the human-machine interaction. In this regard, possible human errors resulting from non-ergonomic design of Iranian meat <b>grinder</b> <b>machine</b> were identified...|$|E

Therefore, prevention is needed to reduce complaints that may arise on the workers. This research aims at studying the incidence of subjective health complaints (hand arm vibration syndrome) due to dental grinder vibration on dental laboratory workers in Abadi Dental Laboratory Surabaya. This research was a descriptive observational research in which the data were take using cross sectional approach. The subject of the research was 18 laboratory workers, drawn from the total population. Variables in the research were individual characteristics (age, sex, work hour and work duration), the intensity of grinder vibration exposure, and subjective complaints. The result of the subjective complaints (hand arm vibration syndrome) of the dental laboratory workers in Abadi Dental Laboratory showed that from 18 person, there were 13 person (72 %) who had a subjective complaints.

40|$|Various {{sizes of}} step drills were {{manufactured}} by a CNC <b>grinder</b> <b>machine</b> {{and used in}} the drilling process with different speeds and feed rates to produce single step holes in S 1214 free machining steel. The performance of step drills was {{compared with that of}} conventional twist drills in the drilling of the free machining steel for the same task. The influences of drill size, feed rate and cutting speed on the performance of step drills were studied. Experimental results show that for better cutting performance, the small diameter should not be less than 60 % of the large diameter. Also, most of the changes in the characteristics of the thrust force were influenced by the smaller drill of the step drill. On the other hand, the small diameter part of the step drill only contributed about 30 % of the torque. From the experimental results, empirical equations for drilling thrust force and torque have been established for step drills...|$|E

Experimental were used a few of machine which is <b>grinder</b> <b>machine,</b> lathe machine, rough surface and angle measured. High speed steel {{will be used to}} create a tool bit. During the tests, the depth of cut and cutting speed were kept constant and each test was conducted with a sharp uncoated tool insert. The tool will be test on difference type of material which is aluminum and steel. Underlying of this research is based on the literature review. Harder material needs the tool bit angle closer upon to the wok piece. Less clearance angle need because more force required overcoming the existing force. As we know area will influence the performance of force. Larger area will reduce force. Steel and aluminum are employed as test material in order to check the effectiveness of the tool bit. First assumption for optimum cutting angle for both materials is base on recommended angle. Optimum angle for Steel is 12 degrees and for aluminum is 15 degrees. Both material use different angle because different in structure of grain and composition of the metal. Aluminum is ductile material and the steel is brittle metal. It not all steel is totally brittle because brittle depends on carbon present in the metal itself. According to the first expectation, chip will be form for steel is non-continuous because it ductile material and for aluminum is continuous chip because brittle. The results obtained when the process complete are steel required 9 degree angle and the chip produced is discrete and for aluminum the angle required is 18 degree and the chip produce is continuous.
