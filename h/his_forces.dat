5|$|Although Hulagu was {{allied with}} Kublai Khan, <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> {{were unable to}} help in the assault against the Song, due to Hulagu's war with the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|During the march, Amangkurat {{tried to}} gain the loyalty of the lords in the territories he passed through. Many were {{previously}} loyal to Kajoran, who sided with Trunajaya, or were wavering between the two sides. The presence of the king and <b>his</b> <b>forces,</b> {{as well as the}} possibly booty to be gained in the campaign, motivated them to declare allegiance to Amangkurat and join <b>his</b> <b>forces.</b> At some point, the Javanese forces in the column reached 13,000.|$|E

5000|$|July: German forces under Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck capture Namacurra in Portuguese East Africa {{and seize}} {{important}} arms and supplies for <b>his</b> <b>force</b> after similar smaller successes against Portuguese outposts had already helped reprovision <b>his</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
500|$|Callaghan {{prepared}} <b>his</b> <b>force</b> to {{meet the}} Japanese {{that night in the}} sound. <b>His</b> <b>force</b> consisted of two heavy cruisers ( [...] and [...] ), three light cruisers ( [...] , , and [...] ), and eight destroyers: , , , , , , , and [...] Admiral Callaghan commanded from SanFrancisco.|$|R
5000|$|After issuing proclamations {{calling for}} the arrest of Loyalist {{officers}} {{and the return of}} the stolen munitions, Richardson resumed the march, <b>his</b> <b>force</b> grown to about 2,500. <b>His</b> <b>force,</b> still growing in size, marched toward the Enoree River, chasing down Loyalist leaders. On December 12 Richardson reported that <b>his</b> <b>force</b> numbered 3,000, and that he had captured Fletchall (who was found hiding in a cave) and several other Loyalist leaders. [...] Fletchall's farm was searched and his private correspondence, including letters from Governor Campbell, were found.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the expedition and {{with the majority of}} <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> in his way back, Przemysł II received a confidential message that the fortress of Drezdenko was protected by only a few German knights. The young prince, {{despite the fact that he}} only had a part of <b>his</b> <b>forces,</b> decided to make a quick attack. This completely surprised the defenders and fearing the same fate of soldiers from Strzelce Krajeńskie, they decided to surrender the fortress in exchange for a full pardon. After this, Przemysł II took the fortress in the name of his uncle and triumphantly returned home.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> {{at the bottom of a}} hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
5|$|With its capture, {{he persuaded}} Vasilevsky to allow <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> {{to move towards}} Riga, {{receiving}} a formal go-ahead by STAVKA in a directive on 29 July. On 30 July, <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> finally reached the seaside city of Tukums, near the Bay of Riga, thereby cutting off a total of 38 German infantry and armored divisions in Latvia. For his achievements in this battle, {{he was given the}} title of Hero of the Soviet Union. During the month of August, Soviet forces stalled in the Riga offensive, concentrating on halting German attacks. Finally on 14 September 1944, the First, Second and Third Baltic Fronts launched full-scale offensives with the objective of Riga, encountering fierce resistance by its defenders. On 24 September, with <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> only 12 miles (19km) from Riga, STAVKA ordered Bagramyan's forces to abandon it to the Second and Third Baltic Fronts, regroup, and instead advance against Memel. <b>His</b> <b>forces</b> attacked Memel on 5 October and on 10 October, reached the city, effectively preventing Army Group North from retreating to Prussia.|$|E
50|$|Even with Hull's {{failure and}} Dearborn's inaction, Van Rensselaer's {{situation}} appeared strong. On 1 September {{he had only}} 691 unpaid men fit for duty, but the arrival of reinforcements boosted <b>his</b> <b>force</b> considerably. In addition to <b>his</b> own <b>force</b> of around 6,000 regulars, volunteers and militia, Van Rensselaer had Brigadier General Alexander Smyth's force of 1,700 regular soldiers under his command. However, Smyth, who was a regular officer although a lawyer by trade, steadfastly refused to obey Van Rensselaer's orders or respond to his summons. As soon as <b>his</b> <b>force</b> reached the frontier, Smyth deployed <b>his</b> <b>force</b> near Buffalo, New York, {{at the head of}} the Niagara River.|$|R
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 May, Hotze {{assembled}} <b>his</b> <b>force</b> into three columns and marched toward Winterthur. Opposite him, Michel Ney, newly in command of his division of approximately 3,000 men, deployed <b>his</b> <b>force</b> around the heights, the so-called Ober-Winterthur, a ring of low-lying hills some [...] north of the city.|$|R
50|$|Within {{seventeen}} minutes, Valencia and <b>his</b> <b>force</b> fled to San Angel.|$|R
5|$|According {{to the new}} strategy, {{the forces}} under Girolamo Ramorino and Tomasz Łubieński were {{to leave the city}} and stay on the right bank of the Vistula, harass the Russian forces under von Rosen and von Rüdiger, capture the river {{crossings}} at Osiek, provide the city with supplies, and force Paskevich to divert some of <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> to fight them. Both forces left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. <b>His</b> <b>forces</b> also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's forces and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction.|$|E
5|$|After the Byzantine defeat outside Antioch, Heraclius and {{his brother}} Theodore, along with General Nicetas, {{combined}} their armies in Syria, but were defeated by Shahrbaraz and <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> who besieged Damascus and captured it along {{with a large number}} of Byzantine troops as prisoners. Furthermore, Shahrbaraz also defeated a Byzantine army near Adhri'at.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Alexandria, Shahrbaraz and <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> {{extended}} Sasanian rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands, and a certain Sahralanyozan was appointed as its governor. In 622, Heraclius counter-attacked against the Sasanian Empire in Anatolia. Shahrbaraz was sent over there to deal with him, but was eventually defeated by him.|$|E
50|$|Here {{the plans}} {{of both sides}} ran afoul of one another. Asboth divided <b>his</b> <b>force</b> and led the main {{contingent}} on a headlong charge down the main road. Meanwhile, he sent another portion of <b>his</b> <b>force</b> around the bypass along the route Montgomery's cavalry had taken. Seeing this and realizing <b>his</b> whole <b>force</b> could be trapped, Montgomery attempted to pull out, {{but it was too}} late. The homeguard and militia at the barricades would not budge.|$|R
50|$|After resting and {{supplying}} <b>his</b> <b>force,</b> Moyano led <b>his</b> <b>force</b> to Guapere (thought {{to be on}} {{the upper}} Watauga River in present-day Tennessee). The Spanish and native force attacked and burned Guapere and marched west to Chiaha (also in present-day Tennessee). Moyano's force built a fort in Chiaha and waited for Captain Juan Pardo to return.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the series}} progressed and more new {{characters}} were introduced, Trailbreaker only appeared when <b>his</b> <b>force</b> field was needed. In [...] "Triple Takeover" [...] a plot by Starscream, Astrotrain and Blitzwing {{resulted in the}} flooding of a city. Trailbreaker used <b>his</b> <b>force</b> field to protect himself and {{a small group of}} Autobots from a large tidal wave.|$|R
5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal <b>his</b> <b>forces,</b> bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{cause of}} delay, according to Professor Williams, was the long pause after the debacle of the Battle of Curupayty when the Allies overestimated the strength {{both of the}} opposing army and of Humaitá: they allowed López almost a year to rebuild <b>his</b> <b>forces,</b> devastated at the Battle of Tuyutí.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E
50|$|Seagrim led Karens in a {{campaign}} of sabotage against the occupation. <b>His</b> <b>force</b> enjoyed much support from Karen civilians despite a series of brutal Japanese reprisal killings against Karen villages. <b>His</b> <b>force</b> was gradually wiped out by a concentrated Japanese manhunt. To prevent further bloodshed Seagrim surrendered himself to the Japanese forces on 15 March 1944.|$|R
50|$|During the night, Taylor, knowing {{himself to}} be outnumbered, withdrew <b>his</b> <b>force</b> again.|$|R
2500|$|The {{left wing}} under Damas {{numbered}} about 14,000 soldiers, of whom half were regulars. <b>His</b> <b>force</b> occupied {{a strong position}} near Campotenese with his troops behind breastworks. <b>His</b> <b>force</b> was posted in a [...] wide valley with both flanks protected by mountains. The entry and exit points to the valley were narrow defiles. The pass behind the Neapolitans was the weak point in the defensive scheme. Damas put nine battalions in the first line defending three artillery redoubts. The first line was supported by cavalry and the balance of <b>his</b> <b>force</b> was deployed in a second line. He did not post any troops to cover the mountains on either flank.|$|R
5|$|At {{first light}} on 13 September, Cactus Air Force {{aircraft}} and Marine artillery fired {{into the area}} {{just south of the}} ridge, forcing any Japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle. The Japanese suffered several casualties, including two officers from Watanabe's battalion. At 05:50, Kawaguchi decided to regroup <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> for another attack that night.|$|E
5|$|Burnside was {{promoted}} to major general of volunteers on March 18, 1862 in recognition of his successes at the battles of Roanoke Island and New Bern, the first significant Union victories in the Eastern Theater. In July, <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> were transported north to Newport News, Virginia and became the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|Carleton {{addressed}} the weak {{points of the}} town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> to defensive positions along {{the walls and the}} inner defenses; and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.|$|E
5|$|Von Lettow-Vorbeck did {{not stay}} at Ngomano for long and soon marched <b>his</b> <b>force</b> south to attack more Portuguese positions, leaving only one company at Ngomano as a rearguard {{in case the}} British decided to follow him into Portuguese East Africa. <b>His</b> <b>force</b> won several more {{victories}} while seizing even more supplies and ammunition before moving back into German East Africa in 1918.|$|R
50|$|President Lopez {{sent the}} 21st Cavalry Regiment to Concepcion to {{reinforce}} the cavalry under Maj. Martin Urbieta. Though winning the Battle of Baiende, Col. Camisão was forced to retreat {{due to lack of}} supplies, which further reduced <b>his</b> <b>force</b> to 578 men. Though he died of cholera along the way, the remaints of <b>his</b> <b>force</b> reached Canuto on 11 June.|$|R

5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an {{air attack}} could weaken the Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers. A hit on the Vittorio Veneto slowed her temporarily and Iachino, realising his fleet was vulnerable without air cover, ordered <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> to retire. Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British {{attack on}} Saint Paul, French frigates {{continued}} {{to operate in}} the Indian Ocean, Hamelin personally leading a cruise in the Bay of Bengal during the autumn. His ships seized a number of small merchantmen and in the Action of 18 November 1809 he personally defeated and captured three large East Indiamen in convoy. Before his squadron and their prizes returned to Île de France in late December, they had also captured the British brig HMS Victor and the large Portuguese frigate Minerva. During the winter few ships were at sea, as the risk of being caught in a seasonal hurricane was considered too severe to operate between December and March. Rowley correspondingly withdrew most of <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> to the Cape of Good Hope, leaving a handful of smaller ships to watch the French islands. Hamelin too kept <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> in harbour at Île de France, replenishing his ships and recruiting sailors from the large pool of unemployed men in Port Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses Tigranes suffered, {{the battle was}} not decisive in ending the war. In {{retreating}} northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to elude Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans {{during the battle of}} Artashat. In 68, Lucullus' forces' began to mutiny, longing to return home, and he withdrew <b>his</b> <b>forces</b> from Armenia the following year.|$|E
50|$|Ord, {{leading the}} 10,000 strong 3rd Brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves set out west from Langley {{to clear the}} south bank of the Potomac River of Confederate pickets and partisans in Fairfax and Loudoun.
