40|$|Research on the {{restructuring}} of financial markets in advanced industrial countries has focused primarily on the consequences of changing regulation and of concentration of capital and control. At an international geographic scale, these processes have produced strong financial centers and new outposts <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> <b>transactions.</b> They have also resulted in the reworking of domestic capital markets with significant consequences for the location of economic activities and access to financial services. In Mexico the financial infrastructure is 'thin' both {{with respect to the}} variety of institutions and in space. As a consequence of privatization and state innovation, a financial infrastructure is developing with important implications <b>for</b> access to <b>capital</b> by different segments of the economy and regions.

5000|$|Keynes, {{one of the}} {{principal}} architects of the Bretton Woods system, envisaged capital controls as a permanent feature of the international monetary system, though he had agreed current account convertibility should be adopted once international conditions had stabilised sufficiently.

40|$|Since 1921, when special {{provisions}} <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> {{gains and losses}} were first adopted, these provisions {{have been subject to}} continuous modifications. The modifications reflect Congressional responses to taxpayers dissatisfied with inequitable laws and to pressure groups seeking special tax benefits. Many feel the resulting complex tax law is an intolerable burden to the average taxpayer. Indexing has been suggested as a solution to inequities created by inflation. Although some authors feel that indexation would result in less complexity, others disagree. ^ The present study compares the complexity under current law with the complexity which would be introduced if indexation was used <b>for</b> all <b>capital</b> asset <b>transactions.</b> This study differs from earlier ones in that it measures tax complexity as experienced by the taxpayer. Complexity is defined as a function of taxpayer errors and time. The time/error dimension of tax complexity is explored by examining four decision frames. The frames are composed of parallel (present and indexation methods) test instruments which include pertinent facts and required computations <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> asset <b>transactions</b> common to the individual taxpayer. The test instruments were completed by University of Nebraska at Omaha faculty, staff, and students. All but four of the 142 participants had filed 1984 tax returns. ^ A Time/Error Complexity index, expressing the relationship of the present method to indexation weighted for time and errors, is used for analysis. Relatively more complexity was experienced by the subjects under the present method than under indexation. The Wilcoxon ranked-sum test confirms the Time/Error Complexity index results. At a 99 percent confidence level, there is a statistically significant difference between the two methods: the present method is more complex than the indexation method in three out of the four decision frames and for all frames combined. ^ The complexity in current law pertaining to the capital gain and loss provisions examined in this study is greater than the complexity which would be introduced if an indexation method was adopted <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> gain taxation. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{difficulties}} of democratic welfare states in Europe are often ascribed to economic "globalization", {{that is to}} the world-wide integration of markets <b>for</b> <b>capital,</b> goods and services which has eliminated national control over boundary-crossing economic transactions, and which therefore exposes national producers to world-wide competition. In fact, however, globalization {{in the strict sense}} of the word is, at the most, realized only <b>for</b> speculative <b>capital</b> <b>transactions.</b> It is true that in all other areas of economic activity the intensity of international competition has increased as well. Nevertheless, even under the liberal regimes of GATT and WTO, governments have not abdicated their capacity for boundary control, and the freedom of world trade is still constrained by a wide variety of tariffs, quotas, "voluntary" restrictions and non-tariff barriers. All this is different within the European Union, where national governments have delegated control over external trade relationships to the Union, and where they have in fact abdicated boundary control over economic transactions within the internal European market. As a consequence, the competitive pressure on European welfare states originates mainly from the "regulatory competition" within the Union, and the frustrations of democratic governance in Europe mainly result {{from the fact that the}} range of feasible policy choices has been reduced at the national level while policy making at the European level still lacks democratic legitimacy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{passage of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 {{followed}} hard on the collapses of Enron and WorldCom. Waste makes haste. Official reports for US government agencies worried that the legislation may have impaired New York's competitiveness as a venue <b>for</b> international <b>capital</b> <b>transactions.</b> But a threat from a seemingly different direction – the subprime shakeout – exposed bigger issues. This paper aims to raise questions about many of the assumptions made in the discourse about the relative competitiveness of US and European capital markets. Design/methodology/approach – Building on Healy and Palepu's analysis of Enron, it compares the root issues at Enron with a preliminary view {{of the sources of}} the subprime crisis to build an outline for regulatory response. Findings – Remedies in Sarbanes-Oxley failed to address several of the ailments in evidence in Enron. The haste of making "Sarbox" may have led us to waste an opportunity to prevent or reduce the impact of the subprime debacle. Originality/value – The comparison of the seemingly unrelated cases reveals similar ethical gaps and regulatory lapses, suggesting a different type of legislative and regulatory response may be needed. It makes suggestions for further research to guide future policymaking. ...|$|R
40|$|Association, {{for some}} very helpful comments. Any errors are our own. We {{investigate}} {{the consequences of}} allowing <b>for</b> repeated <b>capital</b> market <b>transactions</b> in a model with asymmetric information between a firm and its investors. All firms in the model possess a profitable project {{that they need to}} raise cash to undertake. However, equilibria exist in which firms return cash to investors via share repurchases. Consistent with managerial accounts, some firms directly profit from repurchasing their stock. The ultimate source of these profits is that other firms buy “high ” in order to improve the terms of subsequent stock issues, which is again consistent with empirical evidence. Only equilibria with repurchases satisfy a mild refinement. Repurchases lower social welfare by reducing the fraction of firms that invest, even though repurchasing itself carries no deadweight cost. Our model generates a number of empirical predictions. An important idea in corporate finance is that firms have more information about their future cash flows than investors. A large body of research has studied the consequences of this asymmetric information <b>for</b> a firm’s <b>capital</b> market <b>transactions.</b> However, the vast majorit...|$|R

30|$|To {{examine the}} drivers that create social capital, Adler & Kwon (2002) {{proposed}} an “opportunity-motivation-ability” framework. The network of social ties {{of an actor}} creates opportunities <b>for</b> social <b>capital</b> <b>transactions.</b> External ties to others give actors in a particular region the opportunity {{to gain access to}} new markets, reduce operating costs, and generate greater profits. Coleman (1998) argued that the extent to which actors are connected or interact affect the strength of social capital. The motivating factors for actors to join together and develop social ties are trust and associability. Social capital transforms actors from taking individual action to collective action to achieve common benefits. Trust is essential for actors to work closely together to take collective action. In addition, associability (Leana & Van Buren 1999), which is defined as “the willingness and ability of actors to define collective goals that are then enacted collectively”, is important <b>for</b> social <b>capital.</b> From the perspective of social capital, ability refers to “competencies at the nodes of the network”. Associability comprises “the motivation and ability of a collectivity to define and enact its goals”. The abilities of actors in a network are complements to social capital (Poetes 1998). In the context of trade facilitation, ties to the shipping industry provide valuable opportunities for traders to rapidly obtain information on shipping operations to provide better services to transport goods. In the context of TCEs, the ability of logistics service providers to provide high quality and low cost logistics services is important for traders to conduct their trading activities in a specific location. Social capital is the resource that facilitates the development of TCEs and associated with economic performance.|$|R

The authors examine flows of foreign direct investment to 46 developing countries to test whether such flows are autonomous or accommodating vis-a-vis the current account and other capital flows.
