50|$|The British Government gave an {{indication}} of its proposals for the future structure of the Army in early 2008, in a press report stating that it was considering restructuring the Army into a force of three <b>deployable</b> divisional <b>headquarters</b> and eight 'homogenous or identical' brigades, each with a spread of heavy, medium and light capabilities. This report indicated that the existing 16 Air Assault Brigade would be retained as a high-readiness rapid reaction force.|$|R

The paper focusses on a concrete representative planning process as observed in a training exercise. The modelling approach, defined metrics, and state space analysis techniques are applicable also in other application domains for process modelling...|$|E
50|$|The Reserve Armies were a {{group of}} armies formed by the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II. Formed to control the {{training}} of newly formed units in the rear areas and provide army level headquarters to reconstitute destroyed armies or to form new armies.

50|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the number}} of {{divisions}} has fallen significantly as the Australian Army has concentrated its force generation at brigade level. Three divisions - the 1st, 2nd and 3rd - have existed during this time, but the 3rd Division was disbanded in 1991, and only two divisions currently remain active. The 1st Division is a skeleton organisation {{that acts as a}} <b>deployable</b> force <b>headquarters,</b> while the 2nd is a Reserve formation.|$|R

40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) is {{the primary}} point of development, direction, and {{coordination}} for all NATO Special Operations-related activities. NSHQ could enhance the effectiveness of NATO Special Operations Forces (SOF) and increase the probability of mission accomplishment when NATO SOF assets are collectively employed in a combined manner by adding an operational command and control capability. This {{would be in the}} form of a Special Operations Component Command (SOCC) "Core. " The SOCC Core is an advanced party of 70 - 150 personnel who provide an organic, rapidly <b>deployable</b> <b>headquarters</b> (HQ) capability for NSHQ. NSHQ does not currently have the ability to provide NATO with a rapidly deployable asset package, which would include a full suite of operational command, control, communication, computers, and intelligence (C 4 I) capabilities equipped with organic SOF and their enablers. The purpose of this thesis is to examine equipment and deployment configurations that will fulfill the mission requirements of the SOCC Core. An analysis of alternatives is conducted to determine which equipment types and configurations achieved the desired robust mission capability at the lowest possible cost. The focus is on the make-up of the four sub-components of the SOCC Core. These sub-components are the Operations Center (OPCEN), All-Source Center (ASC), Support Center (SUPCEN), and the Signals Center (SIGCEN). Possessing a rapidly deployable SOCC Core would be a sound step toward establishing and ensuring interoperability among allied SOF units and commands and would enhance the employment of NATO SOFs.

50|$|On 1 December 2000 the Projection Forces Command (COMFOP) ceded {{two of its}} brigades - the Parachute Brigade Folgore and Air Assault Brigade Friuli to the 1st Defence Forces Command.

However, {{in the same year}} the command began to build up a <b>deployable</b> division-level <b>headquarters.</b> Said headquarters became operational in October 2005 and was given the name Mantova Division Command.|$|R
40|$|While {{there are}} arguably {{sufficient}} reaction forces to support NATO Ministerial Guidance, {{there are numerous}} weaknesses that would, and have, inhibited the efficient and effective deployment of land forces in crises. There are insufficient <b>deployable</b> reaction <b>headquarters,</b> both at the corps and component command level that would support a commander of a NATO Combined Joint Task Force. Since 1991, standing and mobilization forces made available by nations to NATO have been steadily reduced, {{particularly in the case}} of land forces. Equally important have been the structures NATO has created into which national contributions would fall on deployment. Military Committee (MC) 317, accepted by nations in 1991, provides the framework by which NATO organizes its forces. However, the author argues that, while there are arguably sufficient reaction forces to support NATO Ministerial Guidance, there are numerous weaknesses that would, and have, inhibited the efficient and effective deployment of land forces in crises. More specifically, there are insufficient <b>deployable</b> reaction <b>headquarters,</b> both at the corps and component command level, that would support a commander of a NATO Combined Joint Task Force. The continued existence of what has become atavistic practices of nations impede and inhibit the employment of multinational land forces by an Allied commander. The author observes that the NATO Force Structure Review offers nations an opportunity to review these dated structures, organizations, and practices...|$|R

In June 2013, the Army announced plans to downsize to 32 active combat brigade teams by 2015 to match a reduction in active duty strength to 490,000 soldiers. Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno projected that the Army was to shrink to [...] "450,000 in the active component, 335,000 in the National Guard and 195,000 in U.S. Army Reserve" [...] by 2018. This plan however was scrapped by the new administration, and now the Army plans to grow by 16,000 soldiers to a total of 476,000 by October 2017. The National Guard and the Army Reserve will see a smaller expansion.|$|R

50|$|In {{fiscal years}} 2007-2009, the Army Reserve was realigned into a {{functional}} command structure. The majority of Army Reserve units are now assigned to operational and functional commands.

For instance, the 377th Sustainment Command (Theater) commands all Army Reserve sustainment units, while the 11th Aviation Command commands all Army Reserve aviation assets. Likewise, functional commands are responsible for command of units of the same or similar capabilities regardless of peacetime geographic location, but are not, as a <b>headquarters,</b> <b>deployable.</b>|$|R
