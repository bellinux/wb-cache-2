[...] According to an opinion piece in the Jerusalem Post newspaper, however, “While the qessotch Kessim and Beta Israel rabbis are pleased that the Sigd became an official Israeli state holiday in 2008, they would also like the holiday to {{become an integral part of}} the yearly Jewish <b>holiday</b> <b>cycle</b> and be embraced by more Jews, at least in Israel, rather than remain a holiday primarily celebrated by the Jewish community from Ethiopia.” ...|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be noted {{historically}} that while Byzantine officials and chroniclers were disconcerted by the ambiguities among the different dating and recording systems in the earlier centuries, these mattered little to most people who marked time by the orderly progression of agricultural seasons and church festivals, and by the regularity of <b>holidays,</b> weather <b>cycles,</b> and years that revealed the Divine order (Taxis) underlying the world.|$|R

40|$|The use of bicycle is {{substantially}} {{affected by the}} weather patterns, {{which is expected to}} change in the future as a result of climate change. It is therefore important to understand the resulting potential changes in bicycle flows in order to accommodate adaptation planning for cycling. We propose a framework to model the changes in bicycle flow in London by developing a negative binomial count-data model and by incorporating future projected weather data from downscaled global climate models, a first such approach in this area. High temporal resolution (hourly) of our model allows us to decipher changes not only on an annual basis, but also on a seasonal and daily basis. We find {{that there will be a}} modest 0. 5 % increase in the average annual hourly bicycle flows in London's network due to a changed climate. The increase is primarily driven by a higher temperature due to a changed climate, although the increase is tempered due to a higher rainfall. The annual average masks the differences of impacts between seasons though - bicycle flows are expected to increase during the summer and winter months (by 1. 6 %), decrease during the spring (by 2 %) and remain nearly unchanged during the autumn. Leisure cycling will be more affected by a changed climate, with an increase of around 7 % during the weekend and <b>holiday</b> <b>cycle</b> flows in the summer months...|$|E
40|$|Music and Entertainment in Post-Soviet Kazakhstani Holidays: Ideology and Legacy??? My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} interplay between ideology and entertainment {{as reflected in the}} <b>holiday</b> <b>cycle</b> of post-Soviet Kazakhstan. During a two-year ethnographic study of holiday celebrations and expressive culture in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China between 2004 and 2006, I attended state-sponsored celebrations as well as holiday events at religious establishments, children???s daycares and schools, and observed the social, familial watching of televised holiday programs. I conducted the bulk of my fieldwork in Almaty, the cosmopolitan former capital of Kazakhstan, with shorter stints in Kazakh areas of China and Mongolia. National and transnational ideologies and networks are intricately involved in celebrations in Kazakhstan and the Kazakhstani diaspora. My work examines how the state navigates between Kazakh nationalism and multiethnic harmony, a precarious balance that President Nazarbev has thus far has maintained fairly well, and how this managing of diversity dovetails with other important large-scale ideologies like Islam and globalism. In particular, I observe the use of calendars, zodiacs and habits of celebration as tools and reflections of nation building. In Central Asian New Year (Nauryz), for example, I look at the state???s effort to strengthen Kazakh nationhood, on the one hand, and the adherence to alternate identities on the other. The cosmopolitan nature of Almaty, where I conducted the bulk of my research, is reflected in celebrations such as Purim in the Almaty synagogue and Easter in a Korean church, both of which involve complicated, transnational networks of funding and religious leadership. In dramatic, musical, and dance performances staged during these holidays, conflicting narratives from home and abroad bring to life the concurrent, overlapping ideologies at play in such celebrations. Because I wanted this study to look both forward and back, I examine how both Soviet legacy and post-Soviet developments (particularly transnational religious, diasporic and business networks) have informed nationality policy, holiday celebrations and public cultural formations. My work on Kazakhstani celebrations of May 9 th (Victory Day, WWII) is particularly revealing of the lasting import of the Soviet legacy. Interviews reflect ambiguous and contrasting opinions on Kazakhstan???s involvement in WWII, and the ubiquitous May 9 th performances of romantic Soviet war songs reveal lasting loyalty to and nostalgia for the Soviet past...|$|E
50|$|Aramoana, Tuesday 13 November 1990. David Gray, an {{unemployed}} {{man in his}} 30s who lives in his parent’s small <b>holiday</b> home, <b>cycles</b> into town where he has an argument with staff at a bank over a minor issue. Unstable & angry, he returns home where he has a cache of fire-arms, including a semi-automatic rifle. Late in the afternoon, he notices children from a neighbouring house have wandered onto his yard and he angrily abuses them, sparking a heated verbal exchange with their father, Garry Holden. Gray goes inside his house and then quickly re-emerges armed with the SAR, shooting Holden dead. Holden’s two young daughters, Chiquita and Jasmine, and his girlfriend Julie-Anne’s adopted daughter Rewa, witness the murder and flee inside Holden's house, attempting to hide. Gray enters and soon locates them.|$|R

40|$|Like most Turkic peoples, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the Uyghur people are Muslim and belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. Islam is a contributing factor in Uyghur identity and is manifested in daily life by a number of regulations on food, observation of religious <b>holidays</b> and life <b>cycle</b> celebrations. The point of departure here is to try to describe the ziyara as an integral part of Muslim life in the region. The mazarserves as an important reference point in the day-to-day life of the Uyghur people. Regardless of whether it is a local place of worship or a shrine that attracts pilgrims from a larger geographical area, it is a breathing space where one may escape the hardships of everyday life. At the mazar the people have a saint with whom they can identify and be inspired. The mazar is a venue in which both men and women participate—both as participants and as religious leaders. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the behavioral factors underlying tourist intentions to use urban bike-sharing for cycling while on holiday. The analytical framework {{relied on the}} Theory of Planned Behavior relating tourist intentions to favorable attitudes toward cycling, interest in bicycle technology, favorable subjective norms toward cycling, and perceived cycling ease. The case-study focused on the new bike-sharing system in Copenhagen (Denmark) and questioned 655 potential tourists about a hypothetical holiday scenario. Structural equation models revealed: (i) {{a great interest in}} using bike-sharing, frequently and for multiple purposes; (ii) a relation between holiday cycling and living in a cycling-friendly country, past cycling experience, and habitual transport mode choice during daily life; (iii) an appeal of electric bicycles to tourists with high interest in bicycle technology, low perceived cycling ease, and weak favorable norms toward cycling; (iv) a relation between frequent and multi-purpose cycling intentions and favorable to stronger attitudes and norms toward cycling, and greater perceived likelihood that the <b>holiday</b> partners would <b>cycle...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the climate {{preferences}} of German tourists in terms of their demand for various countries. A survey of the holiday travel behaviour of German citizens during 1997 was segmented using three criteria: phase in the life <b>cycle,</b> <b>holiday</b> motivation and holiday activities, and region of origin. Statistical regression analysis was used to estimate 14 different demand equations, which included average monthly temperature, average monthly precipitation and the monthly frequency of wet days as explanatory variables. The results showed that there were indeed different preferences across age, activity groups, and regions. Optimal temperature ranged from 22 °C to 24 °C, and differences in the steepness of the climate-demand relationship could be seen. Spain had the highest climate index values for the month of August for all segments, and the segment swimming and sunbathing had the highest index values for all segments. This study provides useful information for the construction of tourism scenarios, which could be used to improve climate change impact studies...|$|R
5000|$|Humanistic Judaism is a {{movement}} in Judaism that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people and encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish <b>holidays</b> and life <b>cycle</b> events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvah) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature. Humanistic Judaism ordains {{both men and women}} as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, Tamara Kolton, who was ordained in 1999. Its first cantor was also a woman, Deborah Davis, ordained in 2001; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors. The Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, [...] "we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right {{to decide whether or not}} to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications." [...] They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the then-recent passage of the [...] "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act" [...] by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called [...] "a direct attack on a woman's right to choose". In 2012 they issued a resolution opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from generally applicable requirements mandating reproductive healthcare services to individuals or employees. In 2013 they issued a resolution stating in part, [...] "Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of Women's Equality Day on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow." ...|$|R
