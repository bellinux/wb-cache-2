5|$|The Marlins and Rockies {{used the}} {{expansion}} draft {{to build their}} teams using <b>different</b> <b>strategies.</b> As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended to provide more immediate impact. All three rounds of the draft were televised by ESPN.|$|E
5|$|The moult {{of their}} flight {{feathers}} can cause serious problems for birds, {{as it can}} impair their ability to fly. Different species have evolved <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> for coping with this, ranging from dropping all their flight feathers at once (and thus becoming flightless for some {{relatively short period of}} time) to extending the moult {{over a period of several}} years.|$|E
5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought three compounds to Bahrain, {{from which}} drivers {{were allowed to}} choose. The three options for the event were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds, {{the same as for}} the previous round in Australia. Frontrunners Mercedes and Ferrari opted for <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> in tyre allocation, as Mercedes took only one set of the harder medium tyres for both their drivers, while Ferrari chose three sets at the expense of soft compound tyres.|$|E
50|$|A {{one-shot}} deviation for {{player i}} from strategy σi is a <b>different</b> <b>strategy</b> σ~i {{for only one}} period. A profitable one-shot deviation {{is one in which}} using a <b>different</b> <b>strategy</b> for one period (a one-shot deviation) yields a higher payoff.A proof of how an unimprovable strategy must be optimal can also be done.|$|R

5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> are used. In some species, the {{transformation}} of the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|Workers use several <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> to {{deal with}} their dead, {{including}} burying, cannibalism, and avoiding a corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere. Which strategy is used depends {{on the nature of the}} corpse a worker is dealing with (i.e. the age of the carcass).|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Characters often have their own special attacks, which leads to <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> depending on which character the player selects. The control system is usually simple to learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Since the release of Double Dragon, many beat 'em ups have allowed two players {{to play the game}} cooperatively—a central aspect to the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.|$|E

40|$|For {{locating}} and ranking vibration {{sources and}} sinks on structures, the structural intensity (SI) technique is an essential tool. It can enumerate vibration fields by plotting a vector map of energy transmission on the structures. A <b>different</b> <b>strategy,</b> changing coordinate systems of orthotropic plate equations, is used to develop intensity formulation components in both x and y directions. The formulation is {{carried out in the}} frequency domain considering flexural waves. Orthotropic plate theory, far-field conditions, Fourier transform, and finite difference approximation are considered. The same intensity definition is obtained using this <b>different</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|R
5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have <b>different</b> <b>strategies</b> for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on <b>different</b> <b>strategies.</b> Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E

25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play <b>different</b> <b>strategies.</b> In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where playing the same strategy Pareto dominates playing <b>different</b> <b>strategies.</b> The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).|$|E

People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.|$|E
