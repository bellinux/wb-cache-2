This compensation method accounts for imperfect magnetic coupling between the vessel eddy currents, the diamagnetic loop, and the <b>plasma</b> <b>diamagnetic</b> currents, {{and it also}} corrects for a finite loading resistance on the diamagnetic loop.

There are several different plasma populations in the high-latitude geomagnetic tail lobes, including the lunar ions resulting from photoionization of lunar atmosphere neutrals, possible fluxes of polar-wind protons, low-energy particle events which consist of antisolar directed fluxes of 100 -eV protons, photoelectrons from the dayside lunar surface, and a high-energy thermal population...|$|R

The diamagnetic effects associated with these plasma inhomogeneities are observed in outer magnetospheres and magnetosheaths as dips or directional discontinuities in the magnetic field measurements. From the mean penetration distances of these <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> elements one can deduce a mean deceleration time, {{as well as an}} approximate value of the integrated Pedersen conductivity in the polar cusp of the earth and Jupiter...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate system level performance and design issues associated with magnetic flux compression devices for aerospace power generation and propulsion. The proposed concept incorporates the principles of magnetic flux compression for direct conversion of nuclear/chemical detonation energy into electrical power. Specifically a magnetic field is compressed between an expanding detonation driven <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> and a stator structure formed from a high temperature superconductor (HTSC). The expanding plasma cloud is entirely confined by the compressed magnetic field at the expense of internal kinetic energy. Electrical power is inductively extracted, and the detonation products are collimated and expelled through a magnetic nozzle. The long-term development of this highly integrated generator/propulsion system opens up revolutionary NASA Mission scenarios for future interplanetary and interstellar spacecraft. The unique features of this concept with respect to future space travel opportunities are as follows: ability to implement high energy density chemical detonations or ICF microfusion bursts as the impulsive <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> source; high power density system characteristics constrain the size, weight, and cost of the vehicle architecture; provides inductive storage pulse power with a very short pulse rise time; multimegajoule energy bursts/terawatt power bursts; compact pulse power driver for low-impedance dense plasma devices; utilization of low cost HTSC material and casting technology to increase magnetic flux conservation and inductive energy storage; improvement in chemical/nuclear-to-electric energy conversion efficiency and the ability to generate significant levels of thrust with very high specific impulse; potential for developing a small, lightweight, low cost, self-excited integrated propulsion and power system suitable for space stations, planetary bases, and interplanetary and interstellar space travel; potential for attaining specific impulses approaching 10 (exp 6) seconds, which would enable missions to the outer planets within ten years and missions at interstellar distances within fifty years...|$|E
40|$|The MHD {{equilibrium}} {{properties of}} neutral-beam-heated plasmas have been experimentally investigated in the Compact Helical System (CHS), a low-aspect-ratio (A_p ~ 5) heliotron/torsatron. This configuration {{is characterized by}} a strong breaking of helical symmetry. The radial profiles measured by various diagnostics have shown significant Shafranov shift due to plasma pressure. The deviation of the magnetic axis from its vacuum position has reached 50 % of the minor radius. When the three-dimensional equilibrium code VMEC is used to reconstruct the equilibrium from the experimental data, the result is in good agreement with the experimentally observed Shafranov shift as well as the <b>diamagnetic</b> pressure in <b>plasmas</b> with leq I. 2 % and beta_ 0 leq 3. 3 %. This beta value corresponds to half of the conventional equilibrium beta Iimit defined by the Shafranov shift reaching a value of half the minor radius.

40|$|The Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment (TIDE) and the Plasma Source Instrument (PSI) {{have been}} {{developed}} {{in response to the}} requirements of the ISTP Program for three-dimensional (3 D) plasma composition measurements capable of tracking the circulation of low-energy (0 - 500 eV) plasma through the polar magnetosphere. This plasma is composed of penetrating magnetosheath and escaping ionospheric components. It is in part lost to the downstream solar wind and in part recirculated within the magnetosphere, participating {{in the formation of the}} <b>diamagnetic</b> hot <b>plasma</b> sheet and ring current plasma populations. Significant obstacles which have previously made this task impossible include the low density and energy of the outflowing ionospheric plasma plume and the positive spacecraft floating potentials which exclude the lowest-energy plasma from detection on ordinary spacecraft. Based on a unique combination of focusing electrostatic ion optics and time of flight detection and mass analysis, TIDE provides the sensitivity (seven apertures of about 1 cm squared effective area each) and angular resolution (6 x 18 degrees) required for this purpose. PSI produces a low energy plasma locally at the POLAR spacecraft that provides the ion current required to balance the photoelectron current, along with a low temperature electron population, regulating the spacecraft potential slightly positive relative to the space plasma. TIDE/PSI will: (a) measure the density and flow fields of the solar and terrestrial plasmas within the high polar cap and magnetospheric lobes; (b) quantify the extent to which ionospheric and solar ions are recirculated within the distant magnetotail neutral sheet or lost to the distant tail and solar wind; (c) investigate the mass-dependent degree energization of these plasmas by measuring their thermodynamic properties; (d) investigate the relative roles of ionosphere and solar wind as sources of plasma to the plasma sheet and ring current...|$|R
30|$|The {{characteristics}} desired of {{the final}} product in an extrusion process depend on the rate of stretching and cooling. Hence, {{it is very important}} to have a controlled cooling environment where the flow over the stretching sheet can be regulated by external agencies like a magnetic field. An exponential variation of a magnetic field is used, among other applications, to determine the <b>diamagnetic</b> susceptibility of <b>plasma.</b> Steenbeck [20] determined the diamagnetic susceptibility of a cylindrical plasma for axial magnetic fields with various gas pressure and magnetic field strengths. Tonks [21] studied the effects of a magnetic field in the plasma of an arc. Pavlov [22] considered the magnetohydrodynamic flow of an incompressible viscous fluid over a linearly stretching surface. Sarpakaya [23] extended Pavlovâ€™s work to non-Newtonian fluids. Subsequent studies by Andersson [24], Lawrence and Rao [25], Abel et al. [26], Cortell [27] concerned the magnetohydrodynamic flow of viscoelastic liquids over a stretching sheet. Radiation effects on MHD flow past an exponentially accelerated isothermal vertical plate with uniform mass diffusion in the presence of a heat source was studied by Reddy et al. [28]. They observed that the velocity decreases with an increase in the magnetic parameter due to a resistive drag force which tends to resist the fluid flow and thus reduces the velocity. The boundary layer thickness was also found to decrease with an increase in the magnetic parameter.|$|R
40|$|On eight {{occasions}} the ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft registered peculiar plasma structures upstream of the earth's bow shock. The events {{exhibit a}} temporary, strong {{reduction in the}} magnitude of the magnetic field and strong enhancements of the field strength bordering the reduction zone. The low field strength regions featured temperatures from 1 - 10 million k and pressure an order of magnitude greater than the solar wind. The pressure gradients exceeded the magnetic tension around the structures, although the field of the cavities may be a closed structure. A model is proposed of hot, expanding <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> cavities with scales on the order of a few earth radii. Speculations on the interaction and origin or impetus for the cavities within the bow shock, foreshock, the magnetosphere and the solar wind are discussed. Similarities between the phenomena detected and signatures obtained with the AMPTE releases of chemicals in the solar wind are noted...|$|E
40|$|The {{desire for}} fast, {{efficient}} interplanetary transport requires propulsion systems having short acceleration times and very {{high specific impulse}} attributes. Unfortunately, most highly efficient propulsion systems which are within the capabilities of present day technologies are either very heavy or yield very low impulse such that the acceleration time to final velocity is too long to be of lasting interest, One exception, the nuclear thermal thruster, could achieve the desired acceleration but it would require inordinately large mass ratios to reach the range of desired final velocities. An alternative approach, among several competing concepts that are beyond our modern technical capabilities, is a pulsed thermonuclear device utilizing microfusion detonations. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of an innovative magnetic flux compression concept for utilizing microfusion detonations, assuming that such low yield nuclear bursts can be realized in practice. In this concept, a magnetic field is compressed between an expanding detonation driven <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> and a stationary structure formed from a high temperature superconductor (HTSC). In general, {{we are interested in}} accomplishing two important functions: (1) collimation of a hot <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> for direct thrust production; and (2) pulse power generation for dense plasma ignition. For the purposes of this research, it is assumed that rnicrofusion detonation technology may become available within a few decades, and that this approach could capitalize on recent advances in inertial confinement fusion ICF) technologies including magnetized target concepts and antimatter initiated nuclear detonations. The charged particle expansion velocity in these detonations can be on the order of 10 (exp 6) - 10 (exp 7) meters per second, and, if effectively collimated by a magnetic nozzle, can yield the Isp and the acceleration levels needed for practical interplanetary spaceflight. The ability to ignite pure fusion micro-bursts with reasonable levels of input energy is an equally challenging scientific problem. It remains to be seen, however, whether an effective ignition driver can be developed which meets the requirements for practical spaceflight application (namely high power density, compactness, low weight, and low cost). In this paper, system level performance and design issues are examined including generator performance, magnetic flux compression processes, magnetic diffusion processes, high temperature superconductor (HTSC) material properties, plasmadynamic processes, detonation plasma expansion processes, magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, magnetic nozzle performance, and thrust production performance. Representative generator performance calculations based on a simplified skin layer formulation are presented as well as the results of exploratory small-scale laboratory experiments on magnetic flux diffusion in HTSC materials. In addition, planned follow-on scientific feasibility experiments are described which utilize high explosive detonations and high energy gas discharges to simulate the plasma conditions associated with thermonuclear micro-detonations...|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} {{for the existence of}} negative-energy perturbations (which could be nonlinearly unstable and cause anomalous transport) are investigated in the framework of linearized collisionless Maxwell-drift kinetic theory for the case of equilibria of magnetically confined, circularly cylindrical plasmas and vanishing initial field perturbations. For wave vectors with a non-vanishing component parallel to the magnetic field, the plane equilibrium conditions (derived by Throumoulopoulos and Pfirsch [Phys Rev. E 49, 3290 (1994) ]) are shown to remain valid, while the condition for perpendicular perturbations (which are found {{to be the most important}} modes) is modified. Consequently, besides the tokamak equilibrium regime in which the existence of negative-energy perturbations is related to the threshold value of 2 / 3 of the quantity Î·_Î½ = âˆ‚ T_Î½/âˆ‚ N_Î½, a new regime appears, not present in plane equilibria, in which negative-energy perturbations exist for any value of Î·_Î½. For various analytic cold-ion tokamak equilibria a substantial fraction of thermal electrons are associated with negative-energy perturbations (active particles). In particular, for linearly stable equilibria of a paramagnetic plasma with flat electron temperature profile (Î·_e= 0), the entire velocity space is occupied by active electrons. The part of the velocity space occupied by active particles increases from the center to the plasma edge and is larger in a paramagnetic plasma than in a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> with the same pressure profile. It is also shown that, unlike in plane equilibria, negative-energy perturbations exist in force-free reversed-field pinch equilibria with a substantial fraction of active particles.

40|$|The {{question}} of sawtooth stabilisation {{at very high}} fast ion energy contents has been addressed in discharges {{carried out in the}} JET tokamak with ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating and varying plasma density, controlled by deuterium gas puffs. In these experiments dramatic differences in the sawtooth behaviour have been observed. When the plasma density n_e decreases below a certain threshold, the sawtooth frequency and the crash duration time increase by a factor of five. Since the fast-ion energy content increases with decreasing n_e due to the inverse proportionality of the fast-ion slowing-down time on n_e, the threshold in n_e corresponds to a threshold in the fast ion energy content. In the present experiments, this threshold is reached when the fast ion energy contribution to the total <b>plasma</b> <b>diamagnetic</b> energy content becomes larger than 45 %. The sawtooth activity with short sawtooth free period is accompanied by MHD activity, with a toroidal mode number n = 1 at frequencies between 55 - 65 kHz. This activity is interpreted as an energetic particle fishbone mode that is resonant with the ICRF-driven fast ions. The experimental results appear to be consistent with the stability diagram for sawtooth and fishbone modes [White, Theory of Tokamak Plasmas (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1989) ], exploring the part of the diagram with a very large fast ion population.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{high power}} helicon (HPH) is a compact plasma source that can {{generate}} downstream densities of 10 17 - 10 18 m - 3 and directed ion energies of 50 - 70 eV, {{without the need}} for grids that can corrode with use or requiring a larger engine diameter. Generating a quasi-neutral plasma beam that can stay collimated and impart significant power and momentum to a distant target in space has a variety of potential applications including beamed propulsion and the remediation of space debris. In order to understand and improve the coupling mechanism between the helicon source antenna and the downstream plasma, measurements were made in the plasma plume downstream of the propagating wave magnetic field and the diamagnetic perturbation of the background magnetic field with the presence of the plasma. This magnetic field perturbation (Î”B) peaks at more than 15 gauss in magnitude downstream of the plasma source and propagates tens of centimeters downstream, cancelling the base magnetic field provided by the experiment as it propagates. Taking the curl of this measured magnetic perturbation suggests a peak current density of 20 kA m - 2. These diamagnetic perturbations and electric currents were correlated with an increase in wave-plasma coupling and increased acceleration of the plasma particles downstream. In order to increase the energy coupled into the plasma and drive a larger diamagnetic perturbation a further distance downstream a second, larger radius antenna was added roughly one wavelength downstream co-axially with the first antenna and driven in phase with the first. This resulted in improved collimation of the plasma beam over a meter downstream, increased diamagnetic perturbation, and an increase in the ion energies downstream of more than 20 eV. This work includes the development of a high power plasma source that is capable of generating a dense, collimated plasma beam with exhaust velocities comparable to devices of similar power levels but in a compact size without the need of electric grids; as well as measuring <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>plasma</b> perturbations that are larger than in any similar plasma experiment previously published, suggesting new capabilities for studying high beta (but cold and directed) plasmas in a laboratory setting...|$|E
