5|$|In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who {{had been}} an auto {{mechanic}} and early aviator. Fleming had {{become involved in the}} film industry when a friend, Marshall Neilan, recommended Fleming to film director Allan Dwan as a good mechanic. (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a faulty <b>film</b> <b>camera.)</b> By 1916, Fleming had become a cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{started on}} 27 October 1952. Boral, a village near Calcutta, was {{selected}} in early 1953 {{as the main}} location for principal photography, and night scenes were shot in-studio. The technical team included several first-timers, including Ray himself and cinematographer Subrata Mitra, who had never operated a <b>film</b> <b>camera.</b> Art director Bansi Chandragupta had professional experience, having worked with Jean Renoir on The River. Both Mitra and Chandragupta went on to establish themselves as respected professionals.|$|E

50|$|In <b>film</b> <b>cameras,</b> {{the delay}} {{is caused by}} the {{mechanism}} inside the camera that opens the shutter, exposing the film. Because the process is mechanical, however, and relatively brief, shutter lag in <b>film</b> <b>cameras</b> is often only noticeable (and of any concern) to professionals. SLRs have slightly longer shutter lag than rangefinders, because of the need to lift the mirror. Point and shoot <b>film</b> <b>cameras</b> often have significant shutter lag.|$|R

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|Peter Jackson {{was nine}} years old when he first saw the 1933 film, and was in tears in front of the TV when Kong slipped off the Empire State Building. At age 12, he {{attempted}} to recreate the film using his parents' Super 8 mm <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> and a model of Kong made of wire and rubber with his mother's fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E

50|$|With some {{patience}} and ingenuity, most <b>film</b> <b>cameras</b> can be used. However, some cameras of the 1990s that used 35mm film have infrared sprocket-hole sensors that can fog infrared film (their manuals may warn {{against the use}} of infrared film for this reason).

50|$|The 35 mm format, {{or simply}} 35 mm, {{is the common}} name for the 36&times;24 mm film format or image sensor format used in photography. It has an aspect ratio of 3:2, and a {{diagonal}} measurement of approximately 43 mm. It has been employed in countless photographic applications including single-lens reflex (SLR) <b>cameras,</b> rangefinder <b>cameras</b> (<b>film</b> and digital), mirrorless interchangeable-lens digital cameras, digital SLRs, point-and-shoot <b>film</b> <b>cameras,</b> and disposable <b>film</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hitchcock {{shot for}} periods lasting up to 10 minutes (the {{length of a}} <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> magazine), {{continuously}} panning from actor to actor, though most shots in the film wound up being shorter. Every other segment ends by panning against or tracking into an object—a man's jacket blocking the entire screen, or {{the back of a}} piece of furniture, for example. In this way, Hitchcock effectively masked half the cuts in the film.|$|E
25|$|Renting an {{apartment}} in nearby Point Richmond, California, Kees {{took a job at}} the Langley Porter Psychiatric Clinic at the University of California, San Francisco, where he worked alongside the anthropologist Gregory Bateson making data films for a study of nonverbal communication.

25|$|One of {{the early}} {{problems}} for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't always good enough for broadcast. The embryo unit's first <b>film</b> <b>camera,</b> a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with petty cash by Desmond's assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes of Look. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Minox {{introduced}} a very compact (100mm × 61mm × 31mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, {{the first one}} in Minox 35mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob. The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|E
25|$|Lowy {{has been}} {{publicly}} defending cellphone photography since 2009, viewing {{it as an}} artistic choice, much like photographers who choose black and white film over color. He also feels the anonymity, ease of use and light weight of an iPhone is helpful when reporting in conflict zones. He appreciates that the resulting photos have a unique aesthetic, which helps bring attention for the war or social issues the images are documenting. In high intensity situations, Lowy typically carries two Canon DSLRs, and prime lenses {{with a variety of}} focal lengths, depending on the situation; a <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> that shoots 6x6; and his iPhone.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{how much}} energy he put into this venture, which {{he hoped would}} bring him some {{commercial}} success, Kees found time to produce a fine series of collages. He even had two more one-man shows in New York City as well as shows in San Francisco, including an impressive installation at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. He had also exchanged his <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> for a still camera, and began taking the photographs that would illustrate the book Nonverbal Communication (Berkeley:, University of California Press, 1956), which he wrote with Jurgen Ruesch, psychiatrist and semiotician. Many of these photographs would qualify as art photography as well as scientific data.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Turkish films {{produced}} before 1950 were projects {{initiated by}} import companies owned by local families, most notably İpek Film, a daughter {{company of the}} İpek Merchandise, an import company that was advertising in Ottoman literary journals such as Servet-i Fünun {{as early as the}} 19th century. Another important company in the early era of Turkish cinema was Kemal Film, a company whose continuous presence as a leading import company has been often overlooked for a few local films it produced during the 1920s. (It {{is interesting to note that}} the founders of Kemal Film bought their first <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> on loan from the Ipek Merchandise). Both companies would be the strongest film distributors until the 1950s and the only companies that were financially sound enough to produce films themselves, with low risks for financial failure as they already were in possession of a distribution system and theatre chains that guaranteed a return on investment.|$|E
25|$|Lucy and Desi had {{originally}} {{decided that the}} series would air on a biweekly basis, much like The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. Philip Morris, however, was insistent that the show air weekly, thus diminishing the possibility of Lucy continuing her film career alongside a television show. Another problem lay {{in the fact that}} Philip Morris wanted the series to originate from New York rather than Hollywood. At the time, most television shows were produced from New York with live broadcasts of the show airing for eastern and Midwest audiences. West Coast viewers were able to view live programs only through low-quality kinescopes, which derived their images by using a 35mm or 16 mm <b>film</b> <b>camera</b> to record the show from a television monitor. As videotape had not yet been developed, kinescopes seemed to be the only practical means to allow a live show to reach television markets on the West Coast. Complicating matters was that kinescopes were not available for immediate re-broadcast as in 1951 no coast-to-coast cable system was yet in service. Shows had to be sent to Hollywood, which delayed their airings for West Coast audiences by nearly a week. The process operated in the reverse for the few programs that originated live in Hollywood, such as The Ed Wynn Show, thus making blurry kinescopes of these shows the only available print for eastern audiences. Most sponsors, including Philip Morris, found this to be undesirable as most of the television audience lived east of the Mississippi at the time.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} areas where film {{may have some}} advantages. Modern <b>film</b> <b>cameras</b> are not as power-thirsty as modern digital cameras, and can last longer on smaller batteries. Some <b>film</b> <b>cameras,</b> {{especially}} older ones, can operate without batteries: some will function completely without batteries, while others may lose some functionality such as metering and some shutter speeds. Batteries that only have to power light meters are often very small and can last a long time. This can be a boon for those who may be spending a long time {{with little or no}} access to electricity or a source of batteries. <b>Film</b> <b>cameras</b> are sometimes used as backups for this reason.|$|R
