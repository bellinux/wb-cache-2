40|$|Fractional generalizations of the Poisson {{process and}} {{branching}} <b>Furry</b> <b>process</b> are considered. The link between {{characteristics of the}} processes, fractional differential equations and Levy stable densities are discussed and used for construction of the Monte Carlo algorithm for simulation of random waiting times in fractional processes. Numerical calculations are performed and limit distributions of the normalized variable Z=N/ are found for both processes. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Transition {{probability}} {{calculations of}} strong field particle <b>processes</b> in the <b>Furry</b> picture typically use fermion Volkov solutions. These solutions {{have a relatively}} complicated spinor due to {{the interaction of the}} electron spin with a strong external field, which in turn leads to unwieldy trace calculations. The simplification of these calculations would aid theoretical studies of strong field phenomena such as the predicted resonance behavior of higher order <b>Furry</b> picture <b>processes.</b> Here, Fierz transformations of Volkov spinors are developed and applied to a first-order and a second-order <b>Furry</b> picture <b>process.</b> Combined with symmetry properties, the techniques presented here are generally applicable and lead to considerable simplification of Furry picture analytic calculations...|$|R
