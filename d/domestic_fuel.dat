2500|$|Policies in the United States have {{included}} {{a decrease in}} the subsidies provided by the federal and state governments to the oil industry which have usually included $2.84 billion. This is more than what is actually set aside for the biofuel industry. The measure was discussed at the G20 in Pittsburgh where leaders agreed that [...] "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change". If this commitment is followed through and subsidies are removed, a fairer market in which algae biofuels can compete will be created. In 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a legislation seeking to give algae-based biofuels parity with cellulose biofuels in federal tax credit programs. The algae-based renewable fuel promotion act (HR 4168) was implemented to give biofuel projects access to a $1.01 per gal production tax credit and 50% bonus depreciation for biofuel plant property. The U.S Government also introduced the <b>domestic</b> <b>Fuel</b> for Enhancing National Security Act implemented in 2011. This policy constitutes an amendment to the Federal property and administrative services act of 1949 and federal defense provisions in order to extend to 15 the number of years that the Department of Defense (DOD) multiyear contract may be entered into the case of the purchase of advanced biofuel. Federal and DOD programs are usually limited to a 5-year period ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the extent to}} which technologies developed for the exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES) can be expected to substitute for fossil fuels, toward the goal of reducing usage of fossil fuels. We compare the changes in fuel mix for primary energy consumption and for electricity generation over the past decade between regions with large and small <b>domestic</b> fossil <b>fuel</b> resources. We conclude that for newly industrialized countries rich in <b>domestic</b> fossil <b>fuels,</b> there is only a moderate or no increase in primary energy from RES, coupled with significant increases in primary energy consumption from fossil fuels although recent but preliminary data show these trends to weaken. We use the notion of a "fossil fuel curse," which implies that it is not obvious that countries with large <b>domestic</b> fossil <b>fuel</b> resources will allow these assets to remain unexploited. This obviously imposes a tremendous threat to climate change mitigation leaving only two choices for fossil-rich economies: leave the fossil fuels in the ground and apply carbon capture technologies, both options calling for a sufficiently high cost to emit CO 2 or other policy intervention in order to take place...|$|R
