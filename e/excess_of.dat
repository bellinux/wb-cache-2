25|$|For example, some presolar grains (supernova grains) {{have very}} large <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> calcium-44, a stable isotope of calcium which {{normally}} composes only 2% of the calcium abundance. The calcium in some presolar grains is composed primarily of Ca-44, which is presumably {{the remains of}} the extinct radionuclide Ti-44, a titanium isotope which is formed in abundance in Type II supernovae such as SN 1987A after rapid capture of eight alpha particles by Si-28, after the process of silicon burning normally begins, and prior to the supernova explosion. However, Ti-44 has a half-life of only 59 years, and thus it is soon converted entirely to calcium-44. <b>Excesses</b> <b>of</b> the decay products of the longer lived, but extinct, nuclides Ca-41 (half life 350,000 years) and Al-26 (730,000 years) have also been detected in such grains.
