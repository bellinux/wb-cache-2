Same-sex sexual activity was previously legalized {{in the following}} countries or territories before German annexation or establishment of reichskommissariats: Bas-Rhin (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1791), Belgium (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1795), Belluno (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1890), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1890), Haut-Rhin (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1791), Luxembourg (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1795), Moselle (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1791), Netherlands (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1811), Nord (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1791), Pas-de-Calais (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1791), Poland (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1932), and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (<b>legal</b> <b>in</b> 1890). All countries and territories listed that where annexed or established into reichskommissariats by Nazi Germany during World War II where restored as independent countries or reincorporated into their previous countries during or {{after the war and}} thus re-legalized same-sex sexual activity in those areas.2In May 1973, the Libyan Arab Republic annexed the Aouzou Strip from Chad. Libya's laws against same-sex sexual activity where thus extended to the annexed Aouzou Strip. In August 1987, during the Toyota War between the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad, Aouzou fell to the Chadian forces, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive. The Aouzou dispute was concluded on February 3, 1994, when the judges of the International Court of Justice by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on April 15, 1994, and was completed by May 10, 1994. The formal and final transfer of the Aouzou Strip from Libya to Chad took place on May 30, 1994, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.3Same-sex sexual activity was never criminalized in the following countries and territories: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia Central African Republic, Chad (excluding Aouzou Strip), Clipperton Island, Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Gabon, Laos, Madagascar, Mali, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Niger, North Korea, Rwanda, South Korea, Vietnam, and Wallis and Futuna. Same-sex sexual activity had also never been criminalized in continent of Antarctica.|$|R

40|$|This study uses {{a set of}} firm-level {{data from}} Worldscope to {{examine the impact of}} {{national}} legal environments on audit markets across 39 countries. Our auditor choice and audit fee results support the legal cost hypothesis that Big Five auditors charge a higher risk premium {{and are more likely to}} turn away risky clients <b>in</b> strong <b>legal</b> environments than <b>in</b> weak <b>legal</b> environments. We also find that the complementary effect outweighs the <b>legal</b> cost effect <b>in</b> that strong <b>legal</b> environments do not reduce the market share of high quality auditors, but they enhance the development of capital markets, which in turn creates a higher demand for quality audit service. Our general sample results show that firms <b>in</b> strong <b>legal</b> environments, ceteris paribus, are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than their counterparts operating <b>in</b> weak <b>legal</b> environments. However, among the large firms in the sample, which are more likely to have international investors, we document evidence supporting the substitution effect hypothesis that firms <b>in</b> weak <b>legal</b> environments are more likely to hire Big Five auditors than firms <b>in</b> strong <b>legal</b> environments because external auditors may serve as a substitute for legal protection t...|$|R

5|$|As the {{independent}} state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution, {{the issue of}} a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political question. At the start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only language that was approved for use <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> and government business anywhere in the country. It was also the language of the economic and social elite, even in Flanders. By the 1860s, with Flemish dialects in decline, increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual, paralleling a similar decline in northern France. However, partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture, the Flamingant political movement began to develop, with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. By 1898, Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French <b>in</b> <b>legal</b> matters. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement (although not a united one), fully emerging during the First World War.|$|E
