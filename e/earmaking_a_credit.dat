The Act does not require that <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> agreement be in writing and signed by both parties, although this is implied throughout the Act. <b>A</b> <b>credit</b> agreement may be <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> facility, <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> transaction or <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> guarantee (or <b>a</b> combination of these).

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>credit</b> default swap {{index is}} <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> {{derivative}} used to hedge credit risk {{or to take}} a position on <b>a</b> basket of <b>credit</b> entities. Unlike <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> default swap, which is an over the counter <b>credit</b> derivative, <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> default swap index is <b>a</b> completely standardised <b>credit</b> security and may therefore be more liquid and trade at a smaller bid-offer spread. This means that it can be cheaper to hedge <b>a</b> portfolio of <b>credit</b> default swaps or bonds with a CDS index than it would be to buy many single name CDS to achieve a similar effect. Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting investors owning bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on changes in credit quality.|$|R

The credit freeze locks the data at the consumer reporting agency until an individual gives permission {{for the release of}} the data. Today, credit freezes are made possible by state laws as well as industry-initiated rules. Laws have been passed by nearly all the US states (see partial list below). The first state to pass <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> freeze law was California, with SB 1386 sponsored by Debra Bowen in 2003. In late 2007, all three of the major credit bureaus (following TransUnion's lead) announced that they would let consumers freeze their credit reports, regardless of the state of residency. State laws still apply, however, in instances where the cost or other details of the freeze are more favorable than they are under the industry-sponsored alternative.|$|R
