40|$|We {{study the}} {{contraction}} of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows in the United States {{during the recent}} financial crisis and show their unusual non-resiliency, which depends {{in part on the}} global nature of the economic recession, but also on the increases in the cost of financing FDI in the economies in which the flows originate. To formally study the effects of external financial conditions on FDI in the United States, we exploit the three dimensions of a panel of U. S. inward FDI flows organized by recipient U. S. industries, source countries, and years for the recorded flows. Changes in the cost of finance in the source countries have little or no effect on total inward flows (the sum of <b>equity,</b> debt, <b>and</b> <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings)</b> over the 2006 - 2010 period. However, U.

If FDI is not responsive to taxation, then {{it may be an}} appropriate target for taxation by the host country, which can raise revenue without sacrificing any economic benefits FDI produces. This paper examines the effects of taxation on FDI in Mexico. The empirical model used for this purpose distinguishes FDI finance by transfers and retained earnings and incorporates host and home country tax and non-tax factors including host country risk factors and credit status of multinationals. The paper concludes that empirical evidence on tax {{sensitivity of}} FDI in Mexico is quite strong. It suggests that FDI transfers <b>and</b> <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> respond negatively to the Mexican effective tax rate and to regulations. It is further dampened by the excess credit status of multinationals.

To evaluate the record two kinds of questions require answers. First, {{to what extent can}} one say that the substantial shifts which occurred in the observed patterns of U.

The problem is whether changing economic conditions at home and abroad could have produced similar patterns {{in the absence of the}} programs. Second, in what sense can the regulations then be said to have eased the U. S. balance of payments pressures? The answer here depends upon a complex of factors including, inter alia,, the extent to which capital outflows led to export surplus and whether putative savings on direct investment were squandered elsewhere. © 1971 JIBS.

5000|$|Most {{corporate}} laws empower directors, as part {{of their}} management functions, to determine which strategies will promote a corporation's success in the interests of all stakeholders. Directors will periodically decide whether and how much of a corporation's revenue should be shared among directors' own pay, the pay for employees (e.g. whether to increase or not next financial year), the dividends or other returns to shareholders, whether to lower or raise prices for consumers, whether to retain <b>and</b> <b>reinvest</b> <b>earnings</b> in the business, or whether to make charitable and other donations. Most states have enacted [...] "constituency statutes", which state expressly that directors are empowered to balance the interests of all stakeholders in the way that their conscience, or good faith decisions would dictate. This discretion typically applies when making a decision about the distribution of corporate resources among different groups, or in whether to defend against a takeover bid. For example, in Shlensky v Wrigley the president of the Chicago Cubs baseball team was sued by stockholders for allegedly failing to pursue the objective of shareholder profit maximization. The president had decided the corporation would not install flood lights over the baseball ground that would have allowed games could take place at night, because he wished to ensure baseball games were accessible for families, before children's bed time. The Illinois court held that this decision was sound because even though it could have made more money, the director was entitled to regard the interests of the community as more important. Following a similar logic in AP Smith Manufacturing Co v Barlow a New Jersey court held that the directors were entitled to make a charitable donation to Princeton University on the basis because there was [...] "no suggestion that it was made indiscriminately or to a pet charity of the corporate directors in furtherance of personal rather than corporate ends." [...] So long as the directors could not be said to have conflicting interests, their actions would be sustained.|$|R

Three main factors are examined: total FDI stock in the economy and its structure, the FDI rate of return and the FDI financial life cycle.

40|$|This paper investigates {{factors that}} {{influence}} the amount of foreign retained <b>earnings</b> permanently <b>reinvested</b> abroad <b>and</b> the market valuation of these earnings. I {{examine the effects of}} repatriation taxes and the difference between foreign and domestic profitability on the amount of foreign subsidiary <b>earnings</b> that firms <b>reinvest</b> abroad using the permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> designation as a proxy for foreign retained earnings. This extends prior work that examines the effect of repatriation taxes on repatriations by including both foreign and domestic profitability and by allowing the effects to vary by the firm's foreign tax credit position. The results are consistent with the hypotheses and indicate that foreign retained earnings increase with the difference between foreign and domestic after-tax-returns. Foreign retained earnings decrease with the foreign tax rate for firms in binding foreign tax credit positions, but are not related to the foreign tax rate for firms in nonbinding foreign tax credit positions. Next, I examine how earnings management incentives affect the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings designated as permanently reinvested, controlling for the effects of profitability and repatriation taxes. I examine whether firms that are close to debt covenant violation or that fail to meet their target earnings have higher permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings.</b> The permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> designation provides the opportunity to manage earnings because U. S. repatriation taxes need not be recognized in financial statement income if the earnings are designated as permanently reinvested. I find no evidence of earnings management to meet debt covenants; however, I do find evidence of earnings management to meet target earnings. Finally, I examine the market valuation of taxes on permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> whether this valuation differs for earnings managers and non-earnings managers. I hypothesize that because the tax estimate is undiscounted, the market values taxes on permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> more negatively for earnings managers than for non-earnings managers because it perceives the investment to be of a shorter duration. The results support this hypothesis and suggest that the market recognizes earnings management attempts and values the tax estimate as if the reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings by earnings managers is not permanent...|$|R

40|$|The {{income account}} of the US balance of {{payments}} has so far remained in surplus because {{of a very large}} differential in reported earnings on direct investment – US firms seem to enjoy a much higher rate of return than foreign firms in the US. There is little difference in terms of the rate of dividend payments; the difference is due to what is called ‘reinvested earnings’ (earnings minus dividends). Foreign firms report almost no <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> on their direct investment in the US whereas US firms report substantial <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> from their direct investment abroad, on average over $ 100 billion more p. a. than foreign firms report on their US investment. This anomaly is probably due to the desire of foreign firms to minimise their US taxes, whereas US firms do not face tax liabilities if they report high foreign profits to the US authorities. The procedure used to generate the data for <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> thus has a built-in bias to improve the US current account and – over time – its international investment position. The true picture is likely to be much worse. <b>Reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> appear in the balance of payments because returns from FDI are measured in a different way than returns from portfolio investment. Returns from FDI are calculated from a mix of firm-level accounting data and broad stock market indices to infer an average capital gain. This procedure will be misleading if, because of the different tax treatment they face, foreign controlled firm in the US report earnings on a different base than other US-owned firms. A more accurate method of measuring the returns from foreign direct investment in the US, by using the same procedure as for portfolio investment (i. e. using only stock market prices), leads to the result that the deficit of the US current account increases by over $ 100 billion per annum and the US net international debtor position worsens by over a trillion dollars.

This article presents an analytical review of the determinants of reinvestment, paying particular attention to the role played by taxation. We consider reinvestment as a form of marginal investment, and discuss six determinants grouped under three headings, namely, factors encouraging reinvestment, factors encouraging the repatriation of earnings and the influence of agency considerations on the financial management of the TNC. We also discuss issues of measurement, and the empirical testability of our conceptual model of reinvestment. We think that a better theoretical and empirical understanding of sequential flows of investment has great relevance for policies aimed at investment attraction, which have tended to focus on greenfield investment and have often failed to deliver the desired results in the past.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the multinational firm's choice of debt or internal funds {{as a method}} of financing depends upon the cost of using internal funds. I extend prior research by differentiating between the cost of using domestic versus foreign internal funds for additional investments for multinational enterprises. I predict that foreign funds are more costly than domestic funds because of potential differential costs, including repatriation tax costs and financial reporting costs. I find that my measure of total funds, the sum of cash and short-term receivables, is negatively related to issuing incremental debt. I also examine whether the proportion of total funds represented by foreign funds affects a firm's decision to use incremental debt financing. My proxy for foreign funds is a rough estimate using available Compustat data (foreign assets divided by total assets multiplied by total funds). I do not find significant results with this general measure of foreign funds. Additionally, I test whether firms' FTC positions affect incremental financing decisions. I do not find results with this measure of foreign funds. I further examine the impact of costly foreign funds on the incremental debt financing decision using alternative measures. I examine the differential costs of a subset of foreign funds with the designation and dollar level of permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings.</b> My results suggest that the change in debt is positively related to the dollar level of permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings.</b> In addition, in a model that includes the interaction between the dollar level of permanently <b>reinvested</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> non-binding FTC status, my results suggest that the magnitude {{of the relationship between the}} level of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings and incremental debt financing is greater for firms with non-binding FTC limitations than for firms with binding FTC limitations.
