50|$|Rinse {{water from}} {{maintenance}} operations flows into a storm drainage system and pesticide chemicals, which have previously contaminated soil and groundwater on the site, {{may have been}} introduced to the environment via this route. Contaminants include S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), <b>dicapthon,</b> and bromophosethyl. These contaminants {{have been found in}} wells owned by the Los Banos Community Water District within three miles (5 km) of the airport.|$|E
40|$|The aqueous {{solubility}} of 39 insecticidal {{and related}} compounds was determined at 20 ± 1. 5 ºC, using a previously described shaking and centrifugation method. Fenamiphos, fenthion and methidathion produced values substantially {{less than those}} {{reported in the literature}} whereas, aminocarb, diazinon, <b>dicapthon,</b> pirimiphos-ethyl and pirimiphos-methyl gave solubilities substantially greater than reported literature values...|$|E
30|$|Chloronitrophenols (CNPs) {{are typical}} representatives of {{chlorinated}} nitroaromatics, which are widely utilized in synthesizing pesticides, fungicides, drugs, dyes, among others (Arora et al. 2012 a, b). The natural formation of CNPs is extremely rare, {{and most of}} these xenobiotics in the environment are mainly coming from their manufacture and use, and the chemical or biological degradation of their derivatives. As the most common isomer of CNPs, 2 -chloro- 4 -nitrophenol (2 C 4 NP) is used for production of herbicide <b>dicapthon</b> and fungicide nitrofungin (Min et al. 2014). Due to its water solubility and high mobility, 2 C 4 NP has caused serious contamination to agricultural soils and water resources, and has caused severe health effects to humans and animals (Arora et al. 2014 a). Therefore, removal of 2 C 4 NP from the environment has recently aroused wide concern.|$|E
