The effect was {{dispersed}} vertically, unlike the Leslie that is dispersed horizontally, with grilles on the sides and top of the cabinet. With no built-in preamp, the Vibratone had to be powered by a separate guitar amplifier; in recording situations, microphones were placed next to the grilles in order for the effect to be heard. A crossover was also built-in, with the Vibratone handling the mid-range frequencies, and sending the high/low frequencies to the <b>driving</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E

Electrostatics of this type necessarily include a high voltage power supply to provide the high voltage used. The stators are connected to the remaining terminals of the transformer.

The interface between speaker and amplifier can be optimized, possibly offering greater control and precision, and advances in amplifier design have reduced the size and weight of the electronics significantly. The result has been that passive monitors have become far less common than powered monitors in project and home studios.|$|R

40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringCurrent {{steering}} {{digital to analog}} converter (DAC) always {{suffer from}} lots of problem like mismatch errors and timing related dynamic errors. Diverse studies from art-of-the-state suggest methods for compensate some of these errors. Typical examples of compensation methods are segmentation, quad-quadrant (Q 2) random walk and dynamic element matching (DEM). These compensation methods reduce lots of fundamental errors while used together with other proposed technique in this thesis. This thesis propose two structure. One structure is related with industrial applications. Industrial application usually requires 10 V swing for voltage driving and 20 mA swing for current driving. Conventional industrial DAC satisfy these swing requirement with high voltage <b>driving</b> <b>amplifier.</b> But <b>driving</b> <b>amplifier</b> consumes additional power and adds its own distortion to output signal. High voltage protection structure is proposed to satisfy industrial swing requirement and solve the problems of <b>driving</b> <b>amplifier</b> combined DAC. Proposed high voltage protection structure decrease cost of manufacturing by decreasing number of high voltage transistor. Proposed structure also increases linearity by changing effective output impedance and decreases additional current consumption while satisfying industrial swing requirement. The other proposed structure is related with resolution improving. Recent current steering DAC becomes fast enough to cover over GHz range with developing technologies. However resolution is still limited by matching properties. Current steering DAC with resolution improving sigma-delta (∑Δ) modulation is proposed. It increase resolution by noise shaping of ∑Δ modulation while sacrificing speed. It still fast because recent current steering DAC is very fast. ∑Δ modulator only randomize LSB side and shaping LSB related noise. Q 2 random walk and DEM are also included to randomize MSB side and reduce MSB related noise. Two version of test chips are tested. 12 bit random rotation-based binary-weighted (RRSB) DEM current steering DAC is implemented in 130 nm compliment metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. Test result shows the effect of MSB side randomizing DEM from art-of-the-state. Proposed 14 bit resolution improved DAC with high voltage protection is implemented in 180 nm bipolar + compliment + double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor (BCDMOS) process. Test result verify performance improvement in frequency domain. Operation voltage and resolution of DAC can be changed by each proposed method. DAC can be applied to various application that require various operation voltage and resolution by using both method properly. ope...|$|E

40|$|Successive-approximation (SAR) ADCs offer high resolution, {{excellent}} accuracy, and {{low power}} consumption. Once a particular precision SAR ADC has been chosen, system designers must determine the support circuitry needed {{to obtain the}} best results. The three principal areas to consider are the front end, which interfaces the analog input signal to the ADC, the voltage reference, and the digital interface. This article focuses on the circuit requirements and trade-offs in designing the front end. Useful information on the other areas, which are device- and system-specific, {{can be found in}} data sheets—and in this article’s references. The front end consists of two parts: the <b>driving</b> <b>amplifier</b> and the RC filter. The amplifier conditions the input signal—as well as acting as a low-impedance buffer between the signal source and the ADC input. The RC filter limits the amount of out-of-band noise arriving at the ADC input and helps to attenuate the kick from the switched capacitors in the ADC’s input. Choosing the right amplifier and RC filter for a SAR ADC can be a challenge, especially when the application needs to differ from the routine data sheet usage of the ADC. Looking at the various application factors that influence amplifier and RC choice, we provide design guidelines that lead to the best solution. Major considerations include input frequency, throughput, and input multiplexing. Selecting a Suitable RC Filter To select a suitable RC filter, we must calculate the RC bandwidth for single-channel or multiplexed applications, then select values for R and C. Figure 1 shows a typical amplifier, single-pole RC filter, and ADC. The ADC input presents a switched-cap load to the driving circuitry. Its 10 -MHz input bandwidth means that low-noise is needed over a wide bandwidth to get a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The RC network limits the bandwidth of the input signal and reduces the amount of noise fed to the ADC by the amplifier and upstream circuitry. Too much band limiting will increase the settling time and distort the input signal, however...|$|E
40|$|The most known {{accelerator}} at CERN is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), {{in which}} proton beams are accelerated {{to the highest}} energy {{in the world and}} then put in collision to probe into the heart of matter. However, the LHC top energy is gradually built up in a chain of accelerators of equal importance. Each machine boosts the energy of the particles beam, before injecting it into the next machine in the sequence. Since the quality of delivered beam from the injector chain determines greatly the overall performance of the LHC, studies are carried out to overcome eventual beam parameters limitations in the injectors, in the perspective of increasing the LHC beam brightness. In particular, in the Proton Synchrotron (PS), where the LHC protons longitudinal structure (bunch spacing) is determined {{as the result of a}} sophisticated series of Radio Frequency (RF) gymnastics, collective effects were identified as a major limitation to the achievable beam current delivered to the LHC. One major cause of collective effects is the beam coupling impedance, the quantity describing the effect of the fields induced by a beam passing through any accelerator device back on itself. Dedicated machine development studies pointed out the RF cavities to be one of the major source of instability in the PS. In particular, the 10 MHz RF system, responsible for beam acceleration, was identified as the most probable impedance source in the machine. The cavity impedance limits the circulating intensity in the accelerator since the beam-induced voltage could trigger longitudinal instabilities causing beam losses. For this reason, the cavity impedance seen by the beam must be kept as low as possible. This thesis focuses on the improvements of the wide band feedback system that encloses the 10 MHz cavities and their <b>driving</b> <b>amplifier.</b> It describes the upgrade it underwent to reduce the cavity impedance seen by the beam, avoiding a complete redesign of the amplifier-cavity system and keeping the present configuration of the vacuum tubes amplifier driving the cavity. This work describes the studies that were carried out to quantify the contribution of the 10 MHz RF system to the PS longitudinal impedance. It, indeed, summarizes the measurements and simulations that led to a full characterization and evaluation of the effective impedance of the eleven 10 MHz cavity-amplifier systems installed in the PS...|$|E
