25|$|Cardinal: The {{cardinal}} {{signs are}} Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly cardinal signs will {{not want to}} be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take charge of their own world. Their attention may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. Cardinal signs in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they <b>know</b> <b>best.</b> A subject lacking cardinal signs may feel they are never in control of their own lives, but are manipulated by people and circumstances beyond their control. They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

500|$|August Strindberg was {{familiar}} with Either/Or and this book made him [...] "forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful {{to the idea that}} art and knowledge must be [...] to life, and that life itself must be lived as we <b>know</b> <b>best,</b> chiefly because we are part of it and cannot escape from its promptings." [...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if he could come back to something [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. This is how he described Either/Or: ...|$|E

The Florida House again {{passed a bill}} to prevent the removal of [...] Schaivo's feeding tube. Peterman and Arthenia Joyner {{were two of the}} few Democrats who supported the bill. Most Republicans in the House had voted for it. Everett Rice and Leslie Waters were two Pinellas Republican representatives who voted against it. Waters was quoted as saying [...] "'Terri's family, Terri's doctors and clergy <b>know</b> <b>best.</b> Not people who have never met her.'" [...] That same year, the Legislature passed a Stand-your-ground law that had been strongly supported by the National Rifle Association. The law removed the a person's [...] "'duty to retreat'" [...] when attacked in a place outside the home they had a legal right to be, giving the individual [...] "'the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so, to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another.'" [...] Peterman was one of twenty state representatives, and the only Tampa Bay Area representative aside from Joyner, to oppose the bill, saying it would create a confrontational [...] "open season." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Franco-Israeli {{historian}} Saul Friedländer described The Foundations-with its {{theory of}} two [...] "pure" [...] races {{left in the}} world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other-as {{one of the key}} texts of [...] "redemptive anti-semitism". Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question", stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews. In taking this stance, Chamberlain was going beyond his hero Wagner. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma wrote:Wagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it with his customary charm, [...] "annihilate" [...] his Jewishness by repudiating his ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory a Jew could be a German…But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the national bloodstream. The more a Jew took on the habits and thoughts of his gentile compatriots, the more he was to be feared. Chamberlain did not advocate the extermination of Jews in The Foundations, indeed despite his determination to blame all of the world's problems on the Jews, Chamberlain never proposed a solution to this perceived problem. Instead Chamberlain made the cryptic statement that after reading his book, his readers would <b>know</b> <b>best</b> about how to devise a [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question". Friedländer has argued that if one were to seriously take up the theories of [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] proposed in The Foundations, and push them to their logical conclusion, then inevitably one would reach the conclusion that genocide might be a perfectly acceptable [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish Question". Friedländer argued that there is an implied genocidal logic to The Foundations as Chamberlain argued that Jews were a race apart from the rest of humanity; that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and so the Jews were born evil and remained evil until they died, indeed a Jew could never stop being evil even if he or she wanted to; and that for these biological reasons alone, the Jews would never cease their endless attempts to destroy all that was good within the world. Inspired by The Foundations, one völkisch writer Josef Remier published Ein Pangermanisches Deutschland in 1905, which used The Foundations to advocate that Germany conquer the Russian Empire, after which special commissions of doctors, anthropologists and [...] "breeding experts" [...] were to divide the population into three categories; ethnic Germans, those capable of being [...] "Germanized" [...] and those incapable of [...] "improvement" [...] with all Slavs and Jews being included in the last category. Field wrote that Remier's vision anticipated the [...] "war of extermination" [...] that was Operation Barbarossa in 1941 in [...] "many horrifying aspects".|$|E
