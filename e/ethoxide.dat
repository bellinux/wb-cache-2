50|$|By {{controlling}} the stoichiometry and steric {{properties of the}} alkoxide, such reactions can be arrested leading to metal-oxy-alkoxides, which usually are oligonuclear complexes. Other alcohols can be employed in place of water. In this way one alkoxide {{can be converted to}} another, and the process is properly referred to as alcoholysis (unfortunately, there is an issue of terminology confusion with transesterification, a different process - see below). The position of the equilibrium can be controlled by the acidity of the alcohol; for example phenols typically react with alkoxides to release alcohols, giving the corresponding phenoxide. More simply, the alcoholysis can be controlled by selectively evaporating the more volatile component. In this way, <b>ethoxides</b> can be converted to butoxides, since ethanol (b.p. 78 °C) is more volatile than butanol (b.p. 118 °C).|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of metal surfaces on inductive (or electrostatic field) substituent effect measurements for surface reactions has been evaluated using image charge theory. Substituent effects {{have been a}} valuable tool for determining the electronic properties of transition states for reactions in many environments but have not received much use or consideration on metal surfaces. An important mechanism by which substituents can alter the activation barrier of a reaction is through local dipole field effects on a charged reaction center. To evaluate the {{influence of}} a nearby metal surface, substituent field effects have been modeled by considering a point charge and a dipole, both positioned above a conductive surface, that interact electrostatically with their corresponding images at equal distances below the surface. It has been found that the magnitude of substituent effects for reactions on metal surfaces will be approximately equal to the gas-phase value for geometries in which the substituent is farther from the surface than the reaction center and both are above the image plane. This model was used to describe â-hydride elimination from <b>ethoxides</b> on Cu(111). This reaction has been found to have a substituent effect that correlates with the reaction energetics of gas-phase alcohol dehydrogenation, a result that is in agreement with the image charge model of the electrostatic influence of the metal. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{reaction}} of ethanol {{has been investigated}} on Ru/CeO 2 in steady state conditions {{as well as with}} temperature programmed desorption (TPD). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images indicated that the used catalyst contained Ru particles with a mean size of ca. 1. 5 nm well dispersed on CeO 2 (of about 12 – 15 nm in size). Surface uptake of ethanol was measured by changing exposure to ethanol followed by TPD. Saturation coverage is found to be between 0. 25 and 0. 33 of a monolayer for CeO 2 that has been prior heated with O 2 at 773 K. The main reactions of ethanol on CeO 2 during TPD are: re-combinative desorption of ethanol; dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde; and dehydration to ethylene. The dehydration to ethylene occurs mainly in a small temperature window at about 700 K and it is attributed to <b>ethoxides</b> adsorbed on surface-oxygen defects. The presence of Ru considerably modified the {{reaction of}} ceria towards ethanol. It has switched the desorption products to CO, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2. These latter products are typical reforming products. Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) conducted on Ru/CeO 2 indicated that optimal reaction activity is at about 673 K above which CO 2 production declines (together with that of H 2) due to reverse water gas shift. This trend was well captured during ethanol TPD where CO 2 desorbed about 50 K below than CO on both oxidized and reduced Ru/CeO 2 catalysts. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
30|$|The {{study of}} {{vanadium}} and tungsten oxides has been undertaken extensively {{in recent years}} due to their respective thermo-chromic and electro-chromic and hence gas-chromatic properties. Since {{the discovery of the}} metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) at 340 K of VO 2 in 1959 by Morin [1] and electro-chromism of WO 3 in 1975 by Faughnan [2, 3], and also {{due to the fact that}} the tungsten metal is, so far, the best known dopant in VO 2 to reduce the MIT temperature to room temperature, the study of the two materials together is expected to yield a good understanding of their MIT behaviours especially at the nano-scale as discussed by this group and others previously [4 – 6]. To date, self assembly of these materials has been achieved by a number of techniques, including: hydrothermal techniques [7], employing templates either with polymers or pre-assembled carbon nanotubes [8], CVD epitaxial growth [9], sol–gel [10], ion implantation [11], hot-wire CVD [12], sputtering [13] and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis [14 – 18]. Also V 2 O 5 capsules [19], WO 3 nano-rods and nano-wires and nano-arrays [20 – 22] have previously been obtained using several techniques. Laser synthesis methods have been of particular interest and have been followed by this group previously [23, 24]. The coherent, intense and almost monochromatic laser light allows it to be tuned to selectively dissociate specific bonds in a precursor molecule either by resonance between the laser frequency and the bond’s natural frequency or via multi-photon absorption. This leads to products that can be unique and different from those obtained by traditional thermal deposition techniques. In this work, we followed a process called laser solution photolysis (LSP) that has been used previously to obtain FePt ultra-fine powders [25]. Organo-metallic precursors containing Fe and Pt, respectively were employed in the presence of a polymer. The polymer was employed to reduce agglomeration of the nano-particles produced. Further examples of the technique include, gold nano-particles produced by UV light irradiation of gold chloride [26 – 28], iron-based nanoparticles produced by utilising UV light absorbing ferrocene and iron(II) acetylacetonate [29, 30] and laser ablation in a solid–liquid interface [31, 32]. In this study, we used, as precursors, metal <b>ethoxides</b> which were produced from metal chlorides.|$|R
40|$|The central {{topic of}} the {{research}} presented is the synthesis and characterization of ferroelectric materials derived from the sol-gel method. Special emphasis is put on the nonlinear optical properties, especially second-harmonic generation (SHG). The sol-gel method is a wet-chemical technique and the chemical reaction starts upon addition water to a solution of an alcoxide, alcohol and a catalyst. Colloidal nanoparticles are formed and dispersed in the solution. The particles agglomerate due to Brownian motion and establish a three dimensional open porous network. The liquid in the pores can be removed by special drying methods yielding so called xerogels or aerogels. In this research a focus was set on the synthesis of LiTaO 3, LiNbO 3 and KNbO 3 using lithium-, tantalum,- niobium,- and potassiumethoxide as starting materials. The wet gels are dried at 40 °C- 50 °. During the drying the gels shrink in volume. Since these materials exhibit a porosity between 5 %- 50 % they are called xerogels. Xerogels consist of networked amorphous particles with sizes in the nanometer range. To crystallize the amorphous nanograins the materials are sintered at different temperatures (700 °C- 1150 °C) and for various times (2 h- 192 h). During the sintering process the grains crystallize, the porosity sinks and their density increases. The grain sizes vary from approximately 250 nm- 1 µm. During the synthesis the chemical composition of the xerogels can be adjusted by {{the proportion of the}} <b>ethoxides</b> used. The samples are characterized by thermogravimetric (TGA), nitrogen adsorption (BET- and BJH-methods), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The aero- and xerogels typically have a specific surface area as measured by BET of 3 - 200 m²/g, pore sizes between 5 - 20 nm. During drying water and organic radicals evaporate until completion around 700 °C. X-ray diffraction and evaluation by the Rietveld method shows that in stoichiometric samples the expected ferroelectric phases appear on sintering. In non-stoichiometric samples additional non-ferroelectric phases appear. At very high sintering temperatures the samples start to decompose at the surface. For second-harmonic generation measurements a pulsed infrared laser was focused on the ferroelectric xerogels and the SHG-signal was measured in transmission. The sintered xerogels show a strong frequency doubling effect. The samples generate diffuse light because of the randomized electric polarization of each grain and the porous structure. The SHG-energy was measured {{as a function of the}} infrared energy, the sample thickness, the chemical composition and the grain sizes. The SHG-energy generated can be described by a polynomial of the incident infrared energy having a linear and a quadratic term. The linear response confirms for the first time theoretical models for the SHG effect in random media. The intensity of the generated light grows linearly with the sample thickness for constant incident energies. The SHG-efficiency increases with the grain size. In conclusion, ferroelectric xerogels can be prepared by the sol-gel method. The diameter of the ferroelectric grains can be increased by varying the sintering temperature and time. The SHG-efficiency can be adjusted by increasing the grain sizes, the sample length and the degree of stoichiometry...|$|R
