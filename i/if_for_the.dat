5|$|The {{final version}} of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, a company created by former Capcom staff members. As the new form of The 3rd Birthday had {{transformed}} into a third-person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO Yoichi Wada recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter , Tabata agreed to the collaboration. While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game as <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 3 home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP. During development, the team sought creative help from the team developing Final Fantasy XIII for the visual design. The team had previous experimented with shooters with , but this time they wanted to create something closer to a third-person shooter. The team was assembled by Tabata based on their development experience with action games. While working inside the control and hardware limitations of the title, the team created firearms and the lock-on mechanic as the fundamental attack action, instead of the free-roaming style of a standard third-person shooter. While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies. During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, to find out which of the planned features was popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy, which was used to emphasize her sexuality. Nomura {{was among the first to}} suggest this feature originally.|$|E

However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In earlier centuries it was common practice for a student to wear <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> length of his studies. Students occasionally slept in it when consumption of wine frustrated their efforts to reach home. The cape would {{get to the end of}} studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a deep cut for each girlfriend.

FCK made its first {{appearance}} in the European tournaments when it beat Swiss team Grasshoppers 2–1 in the 1992 UEFA Intertoto Cup. FCK won the Intertoto Cup that year and thereby qualified for the UEFA Cup, where it was eliminated {{in the second round}} by French team Auxerre. The club won the 1992–93 Superliga season one point ahead of Odense Boldklub and two points ahead of third-place Brøndby <b>IF.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> 1993–94 Superliga season, expectations were high. The season opened with a 0–6 thrashing at the hands of Italian team Milan in the 1993–94 Champions League qualification. FCK went on winter break after {{the first half of the}} Superliga season in third place. In the spring of 1994, Copenhagen gained on leading team Silkeborg IF. In the penultimate match of the season, the two teams met at the Parken Stadium. In front of a record-setting attendance of 26,679, FCK won the match 4–1. The club was one point ahead of Silkeborg, but because FCK lost 3–2 to Odense in the final game of the season, it had to settle for second place.|$|E
25|$|Life {{in his own}} monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard {{himself was}} partly responsible. He took a sort of {{malicious}} pleasure in irritating the monks. As <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of a joke, he cited Bede {{to prove that the}} believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard {{wrote a letter to the}} Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.|$|E

After a late league start in 1931, due to heavy snowing, the club ended up in 4th place yet again. IS Halmia won the league in 1932 and in a {{campaign}} in the local newspapers {{tried to get the}} better Halmstads BK players to join the team, this failed however, Halmstads BK defeated IS Halmia in a charity match for the city's unemployed, the swimmers also left the club and founded SK Laxen. Under the leadership of playing manager Gunnar Olsson Halmstads BK was able to reach Division 1, the top league at the time, in 1933 {{for the first time in}} the club's history, this after defeating BK Drott and Helsingborgs <b>IF</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> league title and then defeating Krokslätts FF with 4–0 totally. Unexpected the club won bronze their first season in the top league as when they finished in 4th place, Emil Carlsson also became the club first player in the Swedish national team. The club was unable to repeat last season's result and ended up in 9th place in 1935, handball was also made a part of the club this year. Halmstads BK left the top league in 1936 after ending up second last, the club would have been able to stay if they had won over IK Sleipner in the last game, however the team lost with 2–4. The club was able to return to Division 1 in 1937, but a defeat against top competitor Helsingborgs IF saw them come in 2nd, former English professional player Harry Bruce became the first non-Swedish manager for the club. 1938 was a middle year for Halmstads BK as they ended up in 6th position at the end of the season, English club Sheffield United played a friendly against the club and won with 5–2.

500|$|The 1925 {{edition of}} In Our Time is {{considered}} one of Hemingway's masterpieces. Reviewers and critics noticed, and the collection received positive reviews on its publication. The New York Times described the language as [...] "fibrous and athletic, colloquial and fresh, hard and clean, his very prose seems to have an organic being of its own".

He said that for women who were really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that {{they would be able to}} re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again.

He noted that the song [...] "I Get It" [...] "has a relatively lighter underbelly than the rest, which is a nice change of pace, but it's ultimately too little, too late". [...] "Well Enough Alone", the first single from the album, was written about the departure of Joe Loeffler, and reached No.4 on the Mainstream rock charts. Chevelle toured with Evanescence, Finger Eleven, and Strata during March and April 2007, followed by a headlining tour with the latter two bands in May and June. The second single from the album, [...] "I Get It", was released on June 12, 2007, and a video for the song debuted on MTV on November 27, 2007.

On the tour in Australia, Chevelle's band manager Rose died of cancer, much to the distress of the band.|$|E

500|$|A Dutch {{opinion poll}} {{conducted}} in October 1947 placed Han van Meegeren’s popularity {{second in the}} nation, behind only the Prime Minister's and slightly ahead of Prince Berhard, the husband of Princess Juliana. The Dutch people viewed Van Meegeren as a cunning trickster who had successfully fooled the Dutch art experts and, more importantly, Hermann Göring himself. In fact, according to a contemporary account, Göring was informed that his [...] "Vermeer" [...] was actually a forgery and [...] " [...] looked as <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time he had}} discovered there was evil in the world". Lopez indicates that Han van Meegeren's defense during his trial in Amsterdam was a masterpiece of trickery, forging his own personality into a true Dutchman eager to trick his critics and also the Dutch people by pretending that he sold Christ and the Adulteress, a fake Vermeer, to Göring because he wanted to teach the Nazi a lesson. Van Meegeren {{remains one of the most}} ingenious art counterfeiters of the 20th century.

500|$|Holowka {{credits the}} {{multiplayer}}'s party game feel {{to the many}} hours of local multiplayer testing it received in Thorson's homes in Vancouver. Thorson lived with a developer he met through 's community and the two eventually moved in with Holowka in [...] "Indie House", a Vancouver house whose occupants are all indie developers. The close community of indie gamers and their interest in trying new game ideas was both a product and generator of their living arrangements. Though Holowka dropped back from the project shortly after the game jam, leaving the project to Thorson, he stepped in to demo the game at the 2013 Game Developers Conference {{at the last minute}} when Thorson's passport was expired. With an increase in press attention following an exhibition at PAX East, Thorson entered an agreement with Ouya's Kellee Santiago to release exclusively on the microconsole. Critics saw this as being the action the new console needed to compete with existing consoles, and Thorson felt the release for Ouya to be less [...] "intimidating" [...] than <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 3. The game also fit Ouya's emphasis on couch co-op gaming. Thorson originally did the artwork himself but was not satisfied with the results and hired MiniBoss to finish the graphics. Holowka composed the music, and Thorson hired Power Up Audio to make the sound effects.|$|E
500|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is {{the first}} entry in the Devil Summoner series, which forms {{part of the larger}} Megami Tensei series: as with other entries, its {{narrative}} {{takes the form of a}} modern-day detective story as opposed to the series' more prevalent post-apocalyptic settings. The concept for Devil Summoner originated during the development of Shin Megami Tensei II and Shin Megami Tensei <b>If...</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Super Famicom. During the development of II, series producer Kouji Okada considered creating a more imposing sequel, but instead created If... as a smaller-scale spin-off title. The positive reaction to If... gave Okada the freedom to realize long-held concepts for a [...] "parallel world" [...] as an extension of the original concept for If.... Odaka was the game's director, while the script was written by regular Megami Tensei writer Ryutaro Ito. The story and atmosphere drew on themes from detective fiction, particularly the melancholic and hardboiled fiction of Raymond Chandler. One of Ito's favorite pieces of dialogue was the opening segment, where the protagonist is dragged about by Kumiko on her errands, during which the protagonist's personality is determined by the player. The name of the game's setting, Hirasaki City, was constructed using kanji taken from the names of places in Kanagawa Prefecture. The city's name also served as a reference to Heijo City, a location in Patriotic Squadron Dai-Nippon.|$|E

500|$|The Persona {{series was}} first {{conceived}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei <b>If...</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Super Famicom. As the high school setting of If... had been positively received, Atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on the inner struggles of young adults. The focus on high school life was also decided upon due to the experiences of the series' creators, Kouji Okada and Kazuma Kaneko: according to them, as nearly everyone experiences being a student {{at some point in their}} lives, it was something everyone could relate to, representing a time of both learning and personal freedom. In their view, this approach helped players accept the series' themes and the variety of ideas included in each title. Kaneko in particular tried to recreate his experiences and the impact it had on him during his time with the series. The main concept behind the first game was a Megami Tensei title that was more approachable for new and casual players than the main series. The abundance of casual games on the PlayStation reinforced this decision. The game's title, [...] represented the title's status as a direct spin-off from the series. It was later dropped to further define Persona as a standalone series. After the success of Persona, Innocent Sin began development, retaining many of the original staff. During the writing of Innocent Sin, it was decided that the world of Persona 2 needed a different perspective than that of the current protagonist. This decision laid the groundwork for Eternal Punishment. Following this, the Persona series entered a hiatus while focus turned to other projects, including [...]|$|E

2500|$|To {{the use of}} {{lots and}} auguries, they are {{addicted}} beyond all other nations. Their method of divining by lots is exceedingly simple. From a tree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small pieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, and throw them at random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the community, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> public the lots are consulted, or {{the father of a}} family about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the Gods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and having done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made. If the chances have proved forbidding, they are no more consulted upon the same affair during the same day: even when they are inviting, yet, for confirmation, the faith of auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the known practice of divining events from the voices and flight of birds. But to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions divine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same sacred woods and groves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly labour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest and the King, or the Chief of the Community, who both carefully observed his actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and assurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles, even by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods, and the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another method of divination, whence to learn the issue of great and mighty wars. From the nation with whom they are at war they contrive, it avails not how, to gain a captive: him they engage in combat with one selected from among themselves, each armed after the manner of his country, and according as the victory falls to this or to the other, gather a presage of the whole.|$|E
