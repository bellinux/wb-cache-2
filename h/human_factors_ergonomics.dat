40|$|AbstractThe {{discipline}} of systems engineering, {{over the past}} five decades, has used a structured systematic approach to managing the “cradle to grave” development of products and processes. While elements of this approach are typically used to guide the development of information systems that instantiate a significant user interface, it appears to be rare for the entire process to be implemented. In fact, a number of authors have put forth development lifecycle models that are subsets of the classical systems engineering method, but fail to include steps such as incremental hazard analysis and post-deployment corrective and preventative actions. In that most health information systems have safety implications, we argue that the design and development of such systems would benefit by implementing this systems engineering approach in full. Particularly with regard to bringing a human-centered perspective to the formulation of system requirements and the configuration of effective user interfaces, this classical systems engineering method provides an excellent framework for incorporating <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> (<b>ergonomics)</b> knowledge and integrating ergonomists in the interdisciplinary development of health information systems...|$|E
40|$|Designing the User Interface is {{intended}} primarily for designers, managers, and evaluators of interactive systems. It presents a broad survey of designing, implementing, managing, maintaining, training, and refining the user interface of interactive systems.

These researchers may have backgrounds in computer science, psychology, information systems, library science, business, education, <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> or industrial engineering, all share a desire to understand the complex interaction of people with machines. Students in these fields also will benefit from the contents of this book. It is my hope that this book will stimulate the introduction of courses on user-interface design in all these and other disciplines. Finally, serious users of interactive systems will find that the book gives them a more thorough understanding of the design questions for user interfaces. My goals are to encourage greater attention to the user interface and to help develop a rigorous science of user-interface design. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{debate on}} the quality and safety of {{healthcare}} {{has been dominated by}} a measure and manage administrative rationality. More recently, this rationality has been overlaid by ideas from <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics</b> and systems engineering. Little critical attention has been given in the nursing literature to how risk of harm is understood and actioned, or how patients can be subjectified and marginalised through these discourses. The problem of assuring safety for particular patient groups, and the dominance of technical forms of rationality, has seen the word ‘unavoidable’ used in connection with intractable forms of patient harm. Employing pressure injury policy as an exemplar, and critically reviewing notions of risk and unavoidable harm, we problematise the concept of unavoidable patient harm, highlighting how this dominant safety rationality risks perverse and taken-for-granted assumptions about patients, care processes and the nature of risk and harm. In this orthodoxy, those who specify or measure risk are positioned as having more insight into the nature of risk, compared to those who simply experience risk. Driven almost exclusively as a technical and administrative pursuit, the patient safety agenda risks decentring the focus from patients and patient care...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} con-cern about and {{interest}} in the ethical design and regulation of au-tonomous lethal robot-ics [1], [2], [4], [6], [19]. While these concerns are justifi ed, and their implications {{for the design of}} autonomous systems important, it is not merely the autonomous nature of lethal robotics that raises ethical is-sues in design. Indeed, the design of any safety-critical system that relies upon human decision making, and thus the design of any tele-operated weapons system, has signifi cant implications for the ethical deci-sion making of users. As such, the design of that system should raise ethical considerations for engineers. This is especially true in the design of any weapons system that utilizes sophisticated information process-ing, data representation, graphical displays, and user controls to man-age the use of lethal force. The fields of <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> and human-computer interface design have long been en-gaged in analyzing the implications of various design choices on human performance. More recently, Cum-mings [9], [10] has argued that eth-ical decision making is an aspect of human performance that should receive attention in the design of weapons systems interfaces.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that incidents, accidents and disasters tend to result from complex socio-technical failures, rather than just 'human error' on the one hand, or simple technical failures on the other. For the reduction of accidents, therefore, {{it is necessary to}} deal with systems factors, in which both technical and human-factors elements play an equal and complementary role. However, many of the existing techniques in ergonomics and risk management concentrate on plant/technical issues and downplay human factors and 'subjectivity'. The present text describes a body of theory and data which addresses this issue squarely, drawing on systems theory and applied psychology, and which stresses the importance of human agency within systems. The central roles of social consensus and reliability, and the nature of verbal reports and 'functional discourse' are explained in some detail. This book therefore presents a new, 'Qualitative Systems Approach' to safety management, offering both greater safety and economic savings. It presents a series of methodological 'tools' whose reliability and validity have been shown through extensive work in the rail and nuclear industries and which allow organisational and systems failures to be analysed much more effectively in terms of quantity, precision and usefulness. This is a textbook for undergraduate and graduate students in occupational psychology, <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics</b> and HCI, and the sociology of disasters and risk. It is also useful for safety managers and professionals in many safety critical firms and organisations, reliability engineers, risk managers, and human factors specialists...|$|E
40|$|Human {{factors and}} {{ergonomics}} (HFE) is an applied scientific discipline {{with a strong}} emphasis on evidence-based practice. However, in reality, there is often a ‘research-practice gap’. This is characterised by ongoing tension between researchers and practitioners, and low research utilisation in practice. A series of studies were conducted to examine {{the nature and extent of}} this issue. Study 1 was an international survey of 587 HFE professionals to examine the nature of the research-practice gap. Results showed that practitioners are more likely to perceive access and applicability of research to be barriers to applying research findings in practice compared to researchers. Study 2 and Study 3 then examined the extent of the research-practice gap in an international survey of 309 HFE professionals. Study 2 investigated HFE professionals’ evaluations of journal article attributes, and Study 3 investigated their selection of journal articles in an online setting. Results of Study 2 and Study 3 showed that both researchers and practitioners in HFE perceive journal article attributes relating to practical significance to be much more important than attributes relating to theoretical significance, and researchers and practitioners make similar selections of journal articles to read. These results suggest that the research-practice gap may not be as large as previously thought. More importantly, these results suggest the possibility of a theory-research gap in HFE. Study 4 examined trends in the research published in HFE peer-reviewed academic journals. A content analysis of 425 journal articles published in <b>Human</b> <b>Factors,</b> <b>Ergonomics,</b> and Applied Ergonomics from 1960 to 2010 was conducted. Despite increased contribution from researchers, the published research has a stronger focus on practical applications compared to theoretical implications. Thus publication practices in HFE could be improved to enhance both the use of theory and specification of the practical application of findings. These results suggest that the heavy emphasis on the link between research and practice may have been misguided, and more attention should be given to the link between theory and research to ensure that HFE practice rests on firm scientific foundations...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation {{of warning}} label design {{does not always}} include the {{perspectives}} of researchers or graphic designers and legally, warning labels hold no responsibility for changing human behavior. Over the past two decades, much attention to warning label design has come from fields such as <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> and social psychology, but scholarship on abstract visuals in technical communication is not emphasized. Warning labels use generalized abstract bodies to depict the risk of great and potential hazards, demonstrating a removal from physical reality. This paper will look at warning labels {{through the lens of}} abstraction. Abstraction is a non-mimetic form of an object or an idea, and its interpretation greatly depends on the context and culture it is observed in. Arnheim 2 ̆ 7 s theory of abstraction can help designers create effective designs that communicate cross-culturally based on a system of symbols, signs and pictures. The range of abstraction is evident in hybrid warnings that employ both symbols and pictures. Historical uses of warning labels have been subtly reshaped over the years from highly modernized images to ones that contain symbolic images that aid context and understanding of risk. To analyze the way culture shapes warning images, vending machine warnings were analyzed to understand how context and culture affects the abstraction. A selection of wet floor signs was also analyzed for the cultural influences observed in the abstract representations of human figures. Even though the images are standardized, the international images uncovered links between the designs of the warnings and their current usage that suggested they were influenced by prominent art movements during the 20 th century. While standardization is the surest way to represent ideas across all audiences, the images analyzed in this paper demonstrate that warning label designers can stretch the boundaries of standard designs. Very few of the images remained constant between signs that demonstrate the same warnings, which suggests that viewers are responding well to localized images...|$|E
40|$|Educators’ {{perceptions}} influence academic protocols {{regarding the}} level at which evidence-based design is introduced to design students. Evidence-based design, a research methodology based on quantitative and qualitative inquiry that informs design decisions, permeated healthcare design {{to the point that the}} two are almost synonymous (Hamilton 2 ̆ 6 Watkins, 2009; Nussbaumer, 2009). As this research based approach spreads throughout the profession, multiple specialty areas in architecture and interior design adopt evidence-based design into their methodologies (Hamilton 2 ̆ 6 Watkins, 2009). These “developments in design practice now impinge directly upon education” (Zuo, Leonard, 2 ̆ 6 MaloneBeach, 2010, p. 269). Teaching evidence-based design to design students prepares entry-level designers for the workplace (Nussbaumer, 2009). This research study explores and explains educator perceptions about teaching evidence-based design to beginning design students through surveys administered to National Conference on the Beginning Design Student 2011 attendees and Interior Design Educators Council members. Results showed numerous views. Those in favor of introducing evidence-based design to beginning design students present the method along with the design process. These educators believe evidence-based design forms a basis for design and is an important research/design methodology. Educators against introducing evidence-based design to beginning design students believe the method requires too much information to cover at the beginning level and stifles creativity. Other educators either had little knowledge or were unaware of evidence-based design. Most educators surveyed teach <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> anthropometrics, and Proxemics, but are not aware that evidence-based design includes these topics. Many state they have no plans to incorporate evidence-based design into their beginning design courses because it is taught in upper-level courses. Educators conveyed openness toward introducing evidence-based design to beginning design students, especially if proven beneficial to the students. Most educators rely on colleagues and teaching publications to learn about evidence-based design. Overall, educators perceive the most significant factor regarding future introduction of evidence-based design to beginning design students to be faculty related. This research acknowledged limitations and future research directions...|$|E
40|$|The ExoHab 1 project aims at {{providing}} a bench technology for testing the technology/knowledge spin-in and spin-out for a laboratory/habitat module in extreme environment from entities {{that work for}} space and other extreme environments outside the space sector, such as disaster management. The laboratory/habitat should be set up quickly immediately after a disaster as a safe location from where to operate in autonomy from, for example, contaminated area. The technologies applied in ExoHab 1 aim to increase laboratory/habitat autonomy in terms of resources, communication, and safety. Water, energy, and communications are the main areas of focus from the technological side, while research on human factors design is also applied for the safety performance and comfort of the user. The habitat system {{is supposed to be}} as regenerative as possible to achieve maximum autonomy and also support the best interaction with the user. This technology will refer to the improvement of the ISS's space habitat system. Not only the technology will be tested and transferred from and to space, but also the knowledge and the research done in the areas of <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> design, psychology, architecture testing, as well as cultural application. In particular, the first step of the Exohab 1 project is presented here, achieved with the testing of a mission simulation performed with the ExoLab module - appositely developed as a first functional mock-up - and the ExoHab habitat module, which has already been operational since 2009 at ESA ESTEC (European Space Research and Technology Centre in the Netherlands). This paper also presents the first results of the possibility for design development developed at Politecnico di Milano. The goal of this phase is to get multidisciplinary experts from the engineering, scientific and artistic fields involved in the development, testing, finalization, and optimization of the habitat (minimum space, time, and costs). In the next step, the operational habitat will be used to test procedures and technologies for living and working in extreme environments. The Exohab 1 project targets the capability to address large organizations, such as aid agencies that need to work in disaster environments, and is intended to be applied for testing technology spin-in and new know-how in the space sector...|$|E
