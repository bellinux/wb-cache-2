5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did.

5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to <b>get</b> <b>across,</b> all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did <b>get</b> <b>across.</b> on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the Busu on 14 September.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of the}} German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E

5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England.

5|$|The Commandos {{were forced}} {{to spend the night}} {{freezing}} in the open in a ditch. The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed to erect a temporary bridge across the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced across the open ground and into the centre of the town.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|The {{aggressive}} Weyrother persuaded Archduke John and Lauer {{to launch}} an offensive. The Austrian chief of staff planned to strike {{in the direction of}} Landshut. From there, the Austrians would either wheel left to smash the French left flank or possibly <b>get</b> <b>across</b> their enemies' line of communications to the west of Munich. However, in the last days of November, the Austrian army proved unable to advance with the necessary speed to turn the French north flank. Aware that their adversaries were also advancing, Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the flank march into a direct advance on Munich.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E

5|$|Since Wellington {{was anxious}} {{not to bring}} on an engagement, he tried to flank Soult out of position. He sent Beresford to cross the Gave de Pau {{downstream}} at Lahontan and circle around Soult's right flank. At the same time, Hill's corps moved directly toward Orthez. By 25 February, Soult had massed his army at Orthez and courted battle with the Allies. The French marshal counted 33,000 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 48 field guns. Wellington could bring 38,000 infantry, 3,300 cavalry, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 54 artillery pieces against the French. Five battalions were absent: 1/43rd Foot and 1/95th Rifles from the Light Division, 2nd Provisional from 4th Division, 79th Foot from 6th Division and 51st Foot from 7th Division. Confronted with Soult in a fighting mood, the British commander planned to send Beresford to break Soult's right flank while Picton and three divisions kept the French center busy. Meanwhile, Hill's corps was to attack Orthez, <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the Gave de Pau and envelop the French left flank. With luck, Soult would be crushed between Beresford and Hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting their bikes. Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway. With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E
5|$|The 30th Infantry Division {{began its}} advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy {{artillery}} to target German pillboxes; {{even then it}} took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox. The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press {{on to the next}} pillbox, the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers). Fighting in the town of Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor {{had not been able to}} <b>get</b> <b>across</b> the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division's diversionary attacks on their flank, leading the Germans to believe that that was the Americans' main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.|$|E

25|$|The US Department of Homeland Security {{and some}} {{advocacy}} groups have criticized {{a program of}} the government of the state of Yucatán and that of a federal Mexican agency directed to Mexicans migrating to and residing in the United States.
