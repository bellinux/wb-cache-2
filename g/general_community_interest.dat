40|$|For {{identification}} purposes this is {{a simple}} question commonly asked {{as one of the}} defining physical features, along with skin and hair colour. How an answer is phrased to this question is not so straightforward as you many think, for it immediately brings in the contentious issue of how to classify eye colouration.

Compensation of the nonaffiliated member is permissable only when it does not jeopardize the member’s status as a nonaffiliated member. Compensation varies but is normally limited to payment for travel and related expenses, such as parking and meals, to modest monetary payments for participation. The dollar amount of compensation, if any, should not be so substantial as to be considered {{an important source of}} income or to influence voting on the IACUC. The regulations provide for four specific roles within the Animal Care and Use Program...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} {{a case study of}} an urban {{development}} project in Nordhavn, Copenhagen, Denmark. In the project the strategies, structures and visions that underlie the development of Århusgade-quarter, one of Nordhavnens quarters, will be analyzed and discussed based on David Harvey's theory and criticism of the development strategy Urban Entrepreneurialism. The aim is to study whether the development of Nordhavnen benefits the <b>general</b> Copenhagen <b>Community</b> and <b>interests,</b> or whether it is an attempt to generate favorable conditions for market and economic growth. The study shows that the urban development project of Nordhavn consists of elements that resembles the elements of the development strategy Urban Entrepreneurialism. This consistence of Urban Entrepreneurialsm, as well as the market mechanisms, will over time have a polarizing and socially distorting effect on Copenhagen...|$|R
5000|$|While already {{famous as}} an {{economic}} entomologist, Forbes undertook studies of massive fish mortality in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. He showed the connection of algae blooms and lake physics to fish kills, and embarked on a remarkable research program into lake ecology and river ecology. Many of his insights about lake ecology were collected in an influential paper, [...] "The Lake as a Microcosm". Notable for both conceptual creativity {{and the use of}} innovative quantitative methods, his work foreshadowed the ecosystem concept as well as modern ideas of behavioral ecology and food web dynamics. On top of this, Forbes introduced the concept of a [...] "community of interest" [...] that emphasized two major points: [...] "the first that of a <b>general</b> <b>community</b> of <b>interests</b> among all the classes of organic beings here assembled, and the second that of the beneficent power of natural selection which compels such adjustments of the rated of destruction and of multiplication of the various species as shall best promote this common interest." [...] Stephen Alfred Forbes in 1880 advocated an ecological approach and combinations of resurgence of primary pests, selection of strains of pests resistant to insecticides and general contamination of the environment. Although the term pest management looks new in controlling pests but it is based on decades of development. Stephen Alfred Forbes {{is said to be the}} first to work on the pest management.|$|R
40|$|Corvallis Public Library {{administrators are}} {{spending}} National Library Week {{debating whether to}} allow a local man to use the main display case to show books and other materials about revisionist history. The books that Masker wants to display challenge whether the Holocaust ever happened. According to Masker Kay Salmon, the head librarian, gave him permission to mount his display but later {{told him that the}} library staff needed more time to decide on the matter. Salmon and his supervisors have spent most of their usual meetings discussion Masker’s display without reaching any decisions. They plan to take it up with the head librarian, Martin Stephenson, but until then Masker says that he will be at the library on May 1 to set up his display. Masker says the California-based Institute for Historical Review is a legit organization and said that {{if you are going to}} have a display case open to the public then you can’t discriminate as to who uses it. The library policy prohibits the display of posters of religious or political nature inside the library, but the policy doesn’t say anything about the display case other than exhibits “shall be of <b>general</b> <b>community</b> <b>interest,</b> preferably having some educational or cultural value. ” Before next week’s meeting the library plans to contact the ALA and other libraries in Oregon to discuss the issue...|$|E

40|$|Robert Putnam (1993) has {{developed}} a theory of social capital to explain the effect of decreasing community participation and civic engagement on declining institutional performance. Subsequently, {{there has been much}} speculation as to whether emerging virtual communities can counteract this trend. We apply the findings of computer-mediated communication and virtual communities to the networks, norms, and trust of social capital and also examine the possible effects of virtual communities on the privatization of leisure time. We conclude that social capital and civic engagement will increase when virtual communities develop around physically based communities and when these virtual communities foster additional <b>communities</b> of <b>interest.</b> Through a preliminary analysis, we identified potential <b>communities</b> of <b>interest</b> including education, exchange of <b>general</b> <b>community</b> information, and opportunities for government and political participation. We conclude with a discussion of current trends and research needs. The lack of citizen participation in the community has recently come under scrutiny...|$|R

50|$|When a not-for-profit {{community}} group {{applies to the}} regulating body (the Australian Communications and Media Authority) for a community broadcasting licence, it specifies the <b>community</b> <b>interest</b> it intends to serve.

The Broadcast Services Act establishes the requirement to continue to represent the licensed <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> and the requirement to encourage participation from the licensed <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> in the provision and selection of programs as key conditions of the licence. Provisions for Temporary Community Radio Liceneces in the Act allow, where spectrum is available, for aspirant {{community group}}s to develop their facilities and financial and programming models before the regulator considers making a permanent licence available.|$|R
