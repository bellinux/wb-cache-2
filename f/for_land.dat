5|$|Despite American hunger <b>for</b> <b>land,</b> the {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory did not actually want to remove the Sioux from the territory. Federal subsidies to the tribes were heavily siphoned by the U.S. settlements and removal of the tribes from the territory would have meant loss of this income.|$|E

5|$|A {{ministry}} is usually {{composed of a}} headquarters {{and a number of}} departments, boards or other subordinate entities, and statutory boards. For instance, as of May 2007 the Ministry of Law had three departments (the Chief Information Officer's Office, Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office and Legal Aid Bureau), three boards and tribunals (the Appeals Board <b>for</b> <b>Land</b> Acquisitions, Copyright Tribunal and Land Surveyors Board), and two statutory boards (the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore and Singapore Land Authority).|$|E

5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a {{prime example}} of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle <b>for</b> <b>land</b> rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set up in some areas of Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>land</b> speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|By 1851, {{however, the}} {{reduction}} {{system of the}} missions had disappeared. Mestizos who {{had moved to the}} area in their quest <b>for</b> <b>land</b> began to outnumber the original indigenous population. Starting with the creation of the Province of José Miguel de Velasco in 1880, the Chiquitania was split into five administrative divisions. With the rubber boom {{at the turn of the}} century, more settlers came to the areas and established large haciendas, moving the economic activities together with the native peoples out of the towns.|$|E

5|$|By 1851, {{treaties}} between Native American {{tribes and}} the U.S. government had opened much of Minnesota to U.S. settlement. Fort Snelling {{was no longer}} a frontier outpost. Efforts to establish Minnesota as a prominent future state in the Union were swift. In 1851 territorial legislature petitioned the U.S. Congress <b>for</b> <b>land</b> to build a railroad between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Saint Paul. That same year the legislature incorporated the University of Minnesota and established its endowment (though the University would not admit students until many years later).|$|E
5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} {{sent by the}} Venetian bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and Cyprus. In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy was sent to Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate cession of Cyprus. Although some voices were raised in the Venetian Signoria advocating the cession of the island in exchange <b>for</b> <b>land</b> in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} that Ransom Township, Newton Township, {{and the city}} of Scranton include protection of Keyser Creek in their comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances <b>for</b> <b>land</b> use, zoning, and subdivision. The creek is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation's priority list and the Lackawanna River Corridor Association's priority list for the Lackawanna River watershed.|$|E

5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need <b>for</b> <b>land.</b> Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{stood for}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade {{candidate}} for Bourke in 1891, but was defeated; he contested the seat again in 1894 and won.

5|$|On 16 November 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the DR gave notice of another bill which sought a further extension of time <b>for</b> <b>land</b> purchases. The DR was also to stand guarantor for the W and to lease the W's undertakings, in effect taking over the W This was granted under the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1915 on 24 June 1915. War-time restrictions prevented any construction and so extensions to the earlier acts were granted each year from 1918 to 1922 to give a final date of 26 July 1924 for completion of the compulsory purchase.|$|E

Her plans include creating a new residential college and increasing grants awarded from the National Institutes of Health past the US$100 million mark.

5|$|The King {{traveled}} with no security guards; {{only a small}} group of personal friends made the journey with him. Except <b>for</b> <b>land</b> transportation in cities, and two loaned ships in China and the US, his modes of transportation were seldom reserved exclusively for him. He shared regularly scheduled steamships and rail transport with fare-paying passengers. On the Red Sea, he played cards and danced with other passengers. Like other tourists, he visited the white elephants of Siam, the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, tourist sites in India, and museums in Europe. Along the way, he exceeded his original budget, went shopping anyway, and sent letters back home.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand <b>for</b> <b>land.</b> As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E
