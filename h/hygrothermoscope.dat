The system of remote multipoint temperature control is composed of the host machine and slave machine; the host system for display and control, the slave system is responsible for collecting temperature data. Between master machine and slave machine communicate through the RS- 485 bus, can realize the distant control room of the scene monitoring. The STC 89 C 54 MCU is used as the controller and DHT 11 is used as the temperate and humidity transducer. The hardware and software of the system are outlined. The system has realized multiple measuring points, easy expansion, and high reliability, anti-interference. The whole system has the advantages of simple circuit, reliable, {{and can be used}} for measuring temperature, humidity, temperature of building air conditioning control temperature and humidity monitoring and other fields...|$|E
