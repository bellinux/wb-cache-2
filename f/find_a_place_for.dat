5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning {{that the end of}} civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E

25|$|Czartoryski was {{disappointed}} when his hopes held {{as late as}} the Congress of Vienna, that Alexander's might undertake reforms, failed to materialize. His subsequent thoughts were distilled in a book, completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Essai sur la diplomatie (Essay on Diplomacy). This book, according to the historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, is indispensable {{to an understanding of the}} Prince's many activities conducted in Paris following the ill-fated Polish November 1830 Uprising. Czartoryski wanted to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Poland in the Europe of the time.

25|$|The {{borough of}} Stamford was re-chartered in February 1685 {{to place it}} firmly under court influence. Lord Exeter was ousted as {{recorder}} in favor of Peregrine's eldest brother, Lord Lindsey, and Peregrine and Charles were named aldermen of Stamford. Peregrine was also appointed an alderman of Boston, {{and was a member}} of both corporations until October 1688. Both brothers were returned as members for Stamford in the Loyal Parliament, probably without a contest. Peregrine served on six committees in that Parliament, and was made a freeman and bailiff of Oxford in 1687. The Berties, like many Tories, were attached to the Church of England, and forced into opposition by the religious policies of James II. After the dissolution of Parliament, Lindsey suggested that the corporation would return Charles and William Hyde, the latter's candidacy conciliating Lord Exeter's interest. Lindsey attempted to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Peregrine at Grantham on the interest of the Earl of Rutland, who had married their niece Catherine Noel and was recorder of the town. However, it was the sitting MP and alderman, Thomas Harrington, who in fact dominated the Grantham corporation and rejected Peregrine's candidature.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Harmonix {{had already}} {{established}} {{itself as a}} company that made game products that focused on music interactivity. Born out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, the first product made by Harmonix was The Axe: Titans of Classic Rock for DOS-based computers, challenging the player to use four keys on the keyboard to match notes in several songs. Looking to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> this type of game, Harmonix' founders Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy looked to Japan where music games like PaRappa the Rapper were becoming popular. This {{led to the creation}} of Frequency and its sequel Amplitude for the PlayStation 2; both games featured the concept of matching notes for specific instrument tracks along lanes. However, in retrospect, Harmonix found that players had initially difficulty understanding the game, as the presentation was an abstract concept that did not immediately connect the gameplay to the music. The idea of making an easy connection between the game and the music was used as a basis for their Karaoke Revolution games, which including using avatars singing and dancing in time to the music to strengthen the connection; this series was financially successful and helped grow the company.|$|E

Having {{taken part in}} most of the games in Birmingham's League Cup run, he was omitted from the first leg of the semi-final at Ipswich Town in favour of loan player Steve Jenkins. When Jenkins returned to his owning club, Gary Rowett said that Gill should be given a run of games in the Birmingham first team, suggesting that [...] "if anything, he's too nice. He doesn't complain a lot and it's easy for people not to take notice of you. Perhaps if he moaned a bit more he'd get a start!" [...] Recalled for the second leg, he produced an excellent performance, making a goal-line clearance from a header which would have left Birmingham two goals adrift had it crossed the line. Yet {{when it came to the}} final, manager Francis was unable to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Gill even among the substitutes, preferring Eaden and McCarthy, making only his second start after recovering from a broken leg, in the starting eleven and David Holdsworth, a defender unavailable since the previous November due to serious illness, on the bench.

I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet.

2500|$|In {{making the}} case that the naturalist method also results in an {{epistemological}} and moral scepticism, Schiller looks to show this method's inadequacy at moving from the cold, lifeless lower world of atoms to the higher world of ethics, meanings, and minds. As with abstract metaphysics, Schiller attacks naturalism on many fronts: (1) the naturalist method is unable to reduce universals to particulars, (2) the naturalist method is unable to reduce freewill to determinist movements, (3) the naturalist method is unable to reduce emergent properties like consciousness to brain activity, (4) the naturalist method is unable to reduce God into a pantheism, and so on. Just as the abstract method cannot <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the lower elements of our world inside the higher, the naturalist method cannot <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the higher elements of our world inside the lower. In a reversal of abstract metaphysics, naturalism denies the reality of the higher elements to save the lower. Schiller uses the term [...] "pseudo-metaphysical" [...] here instead of naturalism—as he sometimes does—because he is accusing these naturalist philosophers of trying to solve metaphysical problems while sticking to the non-metaphysical [...] "lower" [...] aspects of the world (i.e. without engaging in real metaphysics): ...|$|E
