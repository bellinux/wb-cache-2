5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for <b>falconry</b> use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of <b>falconry.</b> The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate <b>falconry</b> bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E

5|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for <b>falconry</b> and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for <b>falconry</b> in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for <b>falconry</b> in over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Raptors from eagles {{to small}} falcons have for centuries {{been used in}} <b>falconry,</b> often to catch other birds, whether for {{pleasure}} or for food.|$|E

5|$|Animals, and {{products}} made from them, {{are used to}} assist in hunting. People have used hunting dogs to help chase down animals such as deer, wolves, and foxes; birds of prey from eagles to small falcons are used in <b>falconry,</b> hunting birds or mammals; and tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus {{performed}} the song during the Gypsy Heart Tour. She also {{performed the}} song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. She {{wore a black}} sequined bra and furry monochrome chaps with <b>falconry</b> gloves during the performance. She was also accompanied by an enormous replica of her dog, Floyd. The performance received positive reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} entertainment, raptors {{have been used}} in <b>falconry,</b> while cagebirds have been kept for their song. Other birds have been raised for the {{traditional}} sports of cockfighting and pigeon racing. Birdwatching, too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.|$|E
5|$|Migratory raptors {{native to}} the United States are {{protected}} by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, so American kestrels are illegal to possess without a permit (such as a <b>falconry</b> permit) in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a well}} respected <b>falconry</b> bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, {{and in recent years}} availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species from small to large.|$|E
5|$|The American kestrel is {{a common}} bird used in <b>falconry,</b> {{especially}} by beginners. Though not as strong a flyer as many other larger falcons, proper training and weight control by the falconer allows many American kestrels to become effective hunters of birds in the size range of sparrows and starlings, with occasional success against birds up to approximately twice their own weight.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{was popular}} during the Middle Ages with it used for <b>falconry</b> {{and as a}} {{settling}} dog for net hunting. They became a favourite of French Royalty and Kings and Princes at the royal courts of Versailles favored them over other breeds of hunting dogs. In addition, Catherine I of Russia (16841727) was known to have owned a French Spaniel named Babe. During this period, the French Spaniel was known to have split into several regional types.|$|E
5|$|The last sub-book of {{the text}} {{discusses}} recreation through horticulture {{and the art of}} creating gardens, painting, perfumery, architecture and the training and breeding of horses, elephants, lavakki (a type of quail), and other wildlife. A chapter is devoted to the royal sport of hunting deer or other wild game. It deals with 35 ways of game hunting of deer, in addition to hunting with dogs, <b>falconry</b> and fishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired <b>falconry</b> bird, and {{has been used in}} <b>falconry</b> for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in <b>falconry</b> include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E
5|$|Anne's early {{education}} was typical {{for women of}} her class. In 1513, Anne was {{invited to join the}} schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing. She developed domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, needlework, and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess, and dice. She was also taught archery, <b>falconry,</b> horseback riding, and hunting.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{has been}} used in <b>falconry</b> for centuries and was favoured by Emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605) of the Mughal Empire. There is a tradition of using migrant Eurasian sparrowhawks to catch common quail in Tunisia and Georgia, where there are 500 registered bazieri (sparrowhawkers) and a monument to bazieri in the city of Poti. Eurasian sparrowhawks are also popular in Ireland. At Cap Bon in Tunisia, and in Turkey, thousands are captured each year by falconers and used for hunting migrant common quails. Although they were formerly released {{at the end of the}} season, many are now kept because of the scarcity of migrants.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} Accipitridae, the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a member}} of the large genus Accipiter, which consists of small to medium-sized woodland hawks. Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks. The species' name dates back to the Middle English word sperhauk and Old English spearhafoc, a hawk which hunts sparrows. The Old Norse name for the Eurasian sparrowhawk, sparrhaukr, was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered <b>falconry</b> in England. English folk names for the Eurasian sparrowhawk include blue hawk, referring to the adult male's colouration, as well as hedge hawk, spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or <b>falconry,</b> both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} <b>falconry</b> have been traced to Mesopotamia and the {{earliest}} record {{comes from the}} reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC). <b>Falconry</b> made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the East after invasions by the Huns and Allans. Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194–1250) learned about Arabian <b>falconry</b> during wars {{in the region and}} obtained an Arabic treatise on <b>falconry</b> by Moamyn. He had this work translated into Latin and also conducted experiments on birds in his menagerie. By sealing the eyes of vultures and placing food nearby, he concluded that they found food by sight, and not by smell. He also developed methods to keep and train falcons. The studies that he undertook over nearly 30 years, were published in 1240 as De Arte Venandi cum Avibus (The Art of Hunting with Birds), considered one of the earliest studies on bird behaviour, and the first work known to include illustrations of birds.|$|E

Through Genghis Khan's Great Mongol empire, this custom was introduced to China, Korea, Japan, Europe as well as Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Khalid was {{described}} as warm and cheerful and adored by his sisters and brothers, and as attentive and devout. <b>Falconry</b> and horse-riding were Khalid's favorite pastimes, leading to the description {{of him as a}} man of the desert. He bought the first Toyota Landcruiser in 1955 for <b>falconry.</b> In December 1975 Khalid bought the then longest Cadillac at 25 feet and 2 inches long. Khalid bought Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate for £1.9 million in March 1977.|$|E

25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the US, <b>falconry</b> in Great Britain is permitted without a special license. However, a restriction exists of using only captive-bred birds. In the lengthy, record-breaking debates in Westminster during the passage of the 1981 Wildlife & Countryside Bill, efforts were made by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and other lobby groups to have <b>falconry</b> outlawed, but these were successfully resisted. After a centuries-old but informal existence in Britain, the sport of <b>falconry</b> was finally given formal legal status in Great Britain by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which allowed it to continue provided all captive raptors native to the UK were officially ringed and government-registered. DNA-testing was also available to verify birds' origins. Since 1982 the British government's licensing requirements have been overseen by the Chief Wildlife Act Inspector for Great Britain, who is assisted by a panel of unpaid assistant inspectors.|$|E
