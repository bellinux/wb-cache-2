40|$|AbstractIf {{we want to}} {{keep the}} number of {{necessary}} characterisation measurements within acceptable limits, we need to be confident that a <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> design reacts in a predictable and straightforward way to systematic influences. In this paper, the important systematic influences for an ultrasonic flow meter (UFM) for feed water flow are identified to decide which characterisations have to be carried out in addition to a typical baseline calibration with water at 20 °C. In heat metering applications where there are temperatures up to 120 °C it is for example known that the temperature influence on the <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> is important and this also applies to higher temperatures such as in the feed water control of power plants. One of the critical systematic temperature influences that affects most flow instruments is the thermal expansion of the meter body. From June 2009 to March 2010, the “Heat and Vacuum” department of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt conducted a measurement campaign to characterise the influence of thermal expansion of a meter body on the calibration of an 8 inch (DN 200) five chord UFM for feed water application in the temperature range from 4 °C to 85 °C and flow range from 50 m 3 h− 1 to 900 m 3 h− 1.

40|$|This PhD is {{concerned}} with fluid flow through porous media and fluid diversion in oil reservoirs, through the understanding of rheology, colloid science and porous flow experiments. The aim is to better understand porous flow and apply the findings to address field questions {{such as how to}} rheologically deliver fluids to low permeability zones, and what are the effects of shear-thinning and shear-thickening on porous flow. This was approached with both rheometric and porous flow studies on six chemical systems. Rheometric studies were conducted on the Malvern Bohlin CVO and TA AR- 1000 N rheometers with a cone and plate geometry. A porous <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> was designed, built and tested, where Ballotini spheres were used as the porous media. Two Newtonian systems, sucrose solutions and silicone oils were used for the porous <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> calibration. Four non- Newtonian systems of varying rheological behaviours were used {{to examine the effects of}} rheology on porous flow. These systems were the shear-thinning Xanthan and HMHEC, thixotropic Laponite and shear-thinning and -thickening PEO/silica mixtures. The experimental data were examined with Darcy's Law, the Hagen- Poiseuille equation, the Cross, Herschel Bulkley, and the Power-Law model, Reynolds number and the Kozeny-Carman equation, as well as empirical models proposed by the author. An empirical shear-rate / volumetric flow rate relationship was formulated. This allowed for pressure drop / flow rate relationship predictions based on rheometric viscosity / shear rate data. A new approach to modeling porous flow is also proposed. It is hoped that the findings and proposals can provide a better understanding of porous flow, predict fluid behaviour in porous media, and ultimately translated for field applications, namely the 'heel and toe' problem.

An average heat flow of 56. 9 mW/m** 2 is computed from the resulting temperature profile. This value is in close agreement with the theoretical heat flux of 53. 0 mW/m** 2 determined from the general heat flow-age relationship. The temperature profile at Site 587 is nonlinear.

40|$|Abstract- Ultrasonic {{blood flow}} sensing is a {{non-invasive}} method for measuring blood flow velocity. The {{objective of this}} work is to produce a low-cost ultrasonic blood <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> utilizing Doppler shifted signals and enhanced signal processing methods. The instrument transmits a single-frequency signal into circulatory tissues and receives a signal that is Doppler shifted in proportion to velocity. Subsequent processing techniques produce an audio feedback signal whereby the user “hears ” the flow characteristics. The circuit used consists of a transmitter, receiver, and frequency shifter. Signal processing is performed externally to produce velocity profiles of arterial blood flow using Matlab ™ to create spectrograms and low-pass filtering on the recorded feedback signals. Spectrogram provide mapping of the velocity profiles. Resultant mapping indicate that velocity profiles have a roughly parabolic shape and that filtering is required to reduce high frequency noise.

Some of these <b>flow</b> <b>instruments</b> include the <b>Flow</b> Indicator (FI), Flow Transmitter (FT) and the Flow Controller (FC). Flow {{is of paramount importance}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} because flow, as a major process variable is essentially important in that its understanding helps engineers come up with better designs and enables them to confidently carry out additional research. Mohan et al (1999) [...] carried out a research into the design and development of separators for a three-phase flow system. The purpose of the study was to investigate the complex multiphase hydrodynamic flow behaviour in a three-phase oil and gas separator. A mechanistic model was developed alongside a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator. These were then used to carry out a detailed experimentation on the three-phase separator. The experimental and CFD simulation results were suitably integrated with the mechanistic model. The simulation time for the experiment was 20 seconds with the oil specific gravity as 0.885, and the separator lower part length and diameter were 4-ft and 3-inches respectively. The first set of experiment became a basis through which detailed investigations were used to carry out and to conduct similar simulation studies for different flow velocities and other operating conditions as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{the present}} study is to expand current approaches to assessing task absorption and subjective experience by assessing two brief measures of flow: (1) ‘short’ flow, reflecting an aggregate or global measure drawn from the ‘long’ multi-item multi-factor <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> and (2) ‘core’ flow reflecting the phenomenology of the subjective flow experience itself. We propose that short and core flow have complementary but non-overlapping merits, purposes, and applications. Study 1 examines ‘short’ flow in work (N = 637), sport (N = 239), and music (N = 224). Study 2 examines ‘core’ flow in general school (N = 2, 229), extracurricular activity (N = 2, 229), mathematics (N = 378), and sport (N = 220) contexts. With few exceptions, both flow measures demonstrated: (a) acceptable model fit, reliability, and distributions, (b) associations with motivation in hypothesized ways, and (c) invariance in factor loadings across diverse samples. Where common data are available, both short and core flow are positively correlated, but with approximately half the variance unexplained they are clearly not the same construct, and so we offer guidance regarding which measure/s to use under particular circumstances.

The magnitude of mitral regurgitation was altered by phenylephrine infusion. Several technical variables, including the type of color <b>flow</b> <b>instrument</b> (Irex Aloka 880 versus Toshiba SSH 65 A), transducer frequency, pulse repetition frequency and gain level, were studied. Significant increases in the color flow area, but not in color jet width measurements, were seen after phenylephrine infusion for each regurgitant orifice. For matched levels of mitral regurgitation, an increase in gain resulted in a 125 % increase in color flow area. An increase in the pulse repetition and transducer frequencies resulted in a 36 % reduction and a 28 % increase in color flow area, respectively. Jet area for matched regurgitant volumes was larger on the Toshiba compared with the Aloka instrument (5. 2 ± 3. 1 versus 3. 2 ± 1. 2 CMZ, p < 0. 05). Color flow imaging of mitral regurgitant jets is dependent on various technical factors and the magnitude of regurgitation.

The research prototype is based on the novel concepts of combining vector Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) sensor (for measuring dispersed-phase velocity and fraction) with an electromagnetic flow metre (EMF, for measuring continuous-phase velocity with the EIT input) and a gradiomanometer flow-mixture density metre (FDM), in addition to on-line water conductivity, temperature and absolute pressure measurements. EIT–EMF–FDM data fusion embedded in the research prototype, including online calibration/compensation of conductivity change due to the change of fluids' temperature or ionic concentration, enables the determination of mean concentration, mean velocity and hence the mean flow rate of each individual phase based on the measurement of dispersed-phase distributions and velocity profiles. Results from first flow-loop experiments conducted at Schlumberger Gould Research (SGR) will be described. The performance of the research prototype in flow-rate measurements are evaluated by comparison with the flow-loop references.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} inside {{rectangular}} intake air duct of 300 MW lignite {{coal-fired power plant}} is investigated in order to analyze and reduce overall inlet system pressure drop. The system consists of the 45 -degree inlet elbow, the <b>flow</b> <b>instrument,</b> the 90 -degree mitered elbow and fans, respectively. The energy loss in each section can be determined by Bernoulli’s equation and ASHRAE standard table. Hence, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is {{used in this study}} based on Navier-Stroke equation and the standard k-epsilon turbulence modeling. Input boundary condition is 175 kg/s mass flow rate inside the 11 -m 2 cross sectional duct. According to the inlet air flow rate, the Reynolds number of airstream is 2. 7 x 106 (based on the hydraulic duct diameter), thus the flow behavior is turbulence. The numerical results are validated with the real operation data. It is found that the numerical result agrees well with the operating data, and dominant loss occurs at the flow rate measurement device. Normally, the air flow rate is measured by the airfoil and it gets high pressure drop inside the duct. To overcome this problem, the airfoil is planned to be replaced with the other type measuring instrument, such as the average pitot tube which generates low pressure drop of airstream. The numerical result in case of average pitot tube shows that the pressure drop inside the inlet airstream duct is decreased significantly.

40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{are highly}} variable {{both in their}} characteristics and their concentration. Aircraft-based sampling provides a means of characterizing such a complex and variable constituent. To maximize the potential of aircraft sampling, improvements in existing aerosol instrumentation and development of new instruments is necessary. A new approach to inversion of differential mobility analyzer (DMA) data has been developed that improves the accuracy with which accelerated size distribution measurements can be made. Extensive testing of this inversion has demonstrated that it accurately recovers initial distributions of actual aerosols sampled directly by a commonly used detector, actual aerosols analyzed with a scanning DMA, and test-case aerosols. To expand upon the measurable size range of the DMA, a new technique has been employed in which the associated flow rates are varied {{in conjunction with the}} applied voltage. The performance of the instrument was evaluated theoretically through detailed flow and trajectory modeling, and experimentally through comparison with a constant <b>flow</b> <b>instrument.</b> By varying the flow rates by an order of magnitude, it was shown that measurable size range could be increased by a factor of four. During the Second Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE- 2), aerosol size distributions were measured using a DMA and two optical particle counters (OPCs) during 21 missions flown on the CIRPAS Pelican. These data were combined with chemical composition measurements to derive a range of associated optical properties, which were compared with simultaneous direct measurements by a sunphotometer and three nephelometers. Agreement between derived and measured quantities varied, but was generally within calculated uncertainties. A similar payload to that used during ACE- 2 was employed for the Southern California Ozone Study (SCOS). Physical and chemical aerosol properties were analyzed to provide a three-dimensional description of the Los Angeles aerosol.
