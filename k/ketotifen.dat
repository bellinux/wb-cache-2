50|$|Severe {{reactions}} can be {{seen with}} exposure to cold water; swimming in cold water {{is the most common}} cause of a severe reaction. This can cause a massive discharge of histamine, resulting in low blood pressure, fainting, shock and even loss of life. Cold urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing an ice cube against the skin of the forearm for 1 to 5 minutes. A distinct hive should develop if a patient suffers cold urticaria. This is different from the normal redness that {{can be seen}} in people without cold urticaria. Patients with cold urticaria need to learn to protect themselves from a hasty drop in body temperature. Regular antihistamines are not generally efficacious. One particular antihistamine, cyproheptadine (Periactin), has been found to be useful.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} interaction between <b>ketotifen</b> fumarate and anhydrous theophylline in aqueous media of various pH. Methods: By using Job’s continuous-variation analysis and Ardon’s spectrophotomeric methods, the values of stability constants of theophylline with <b>ketotifen</b> were determined at a fixed temperature (37 0 C) at each of the medium pH. In vitro study of protein (bovine albumin, fraction v) binding was carried out by equilibrium dialysis method at pH 7. 4 to ascertain the influence of <b>ketotifen</b> on the protein binding of theophylline. Results: Stability constant, ranging between 5. 07 and 6. 35, were derived from Ardon’s plot, indicating that complexes formed, as a result of interaction between the drugs, were comparatively stable.

However, there are safety concerns regarding {{the frequency and}} severity of adverse events during food OIT. Objective To evaluate the effect of <b>Ketotifen</b> premedication on adverse reactions during peanut OIT. Methods A randomized single blind placebo controlled pilot study was performed. Peanut OIT was performed using a previously published protocol. <b>Ketotifen</b> was up-titrated to 2  mg twice daily over two weeks (week - 2 to 0), followed by a peanut OIT initial escalation day (day 1). <b>Ketotifen</b> was administered from week 0 – 4 of peanut OIT; reactions to peanut OIT doses were recorded by clinic staff and subject diary. Results Six subjects (median age 10  years, peanut IgE > 100 kUA/L) were enrolled, 4 randomized to <b>Ketotifen,</b> 2 to placebo. The most common side effect of <b>Ketotifen</b> was fatigue (9 % during up-titration). The rate of reaction per peanut OIT dose was lower for subjects on <b>ketotifen</b> (K) compared to placebo (P) during initial escalation on day 1 (K: 22 % (8 / 36) vs. P: 67 % (12 / 18)); week 0 – 4 build-up doses (K: 75 % (3 / 4) vs. P: 100 % (2 / 2)); and week 0 – 4 home doses (K: 50 % (54 / 108) vs. P: 82 % (27 / 33)). The rate of gastrointestinal symptoms per peanut OIT dose was also lower for subjects on <b>ketotifen</b> during initial escalation on day 1 (K: 17 % (6 / 36) vs. P: 61 % (11 / 18)); week 0 – 4 build-up doses (K: 75 % (3 / 4) vs P: 100 % (2 / 2)); and week 0 – 4 home doses (K: 46 % (50 / 108) vs. P: 82 % (27 / 33)).

Twenty animals were equally divided into two experimental groups: <b>ketotifen</b> and control. At seven weeks of age, all animals received an intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Animals from <b>ketotifen</b> group received <b>ketotifen</b> in drinking water (1 mg/Kg; 7 days/week; for 18 weeks). At the sacrifice, mammary tumors were fixed and histologically evaluated.

The histamine HI-receptor antagonist, <b>ketotifen,</b> is available orally and as eye drops for the treatment of allergic symptoms. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible effect of <b>ketotifen</b> on constitutive eosinophil apoptosis and on interleukin (IL) - 5 -mediated eosinophil survival.
