5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> behind the falling water. The <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{developments}} for the Sampaloc campus are ongoing. The Plaza Mayor {{in front}} the Main Building, {{together with the}} Quadricentennial Square which will feature the Tetraglobal sculpture, the Quadricentennial <b>Fountain,</b> <b>and</b> the Quadricentennial Alumni Walkway were constructed in 2006. To accommodate the needs of extra space for {{the growing number of}} student activities, the UST Tan Yan Kee Student Center was built in front of the Miguel de Benavides Library. The more-than-80-year-old Main Building, and the artifacts and art works in the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences were recently placed under the preservation of the UST Heritage Conservation program in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{other main}} parks are Mapleton Park in the city's north end, Irishtown Nature Park (one {{of the largest}} urban nature parks in Canada) and St. Anselme Park (located in Dieppe). The {{numerous}} neighbourhood parks throughout the metro Moncton area include Bore View Park (which overlooks the Petitcodiac River), and the downtown Victoria Park, which features a bandshell, flower gardens, <b>fountain,</b> <b>and</b> the city's cenotaph. There is an extensive system of hiking and biking trails in Metro Moncton. The Riverfront Trail {{is part of the}} Trans Canada Trail system, and various monuments and pavilions can be found along its length.|$|E

Morgan is last seen wondering about the significance of the <b>Fountain</b> <b>and</b> whether it really was the Fountain of Youth, and is seen refilling his empty canteen from the water of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Dataran Bandaraya {{was built}} after Johor Bahru was proclaimed as a city. The site {{features}} a clock tower, <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> a large field. The Laman Tun Sri Lanang (Tun Sri Lanang Park), named after Tun Sri Lanang (Bendahara {{of the royal}} Court of the Johor Sultanate in the 16th and 17th centuries) {{is located in the}} centre of the city. The Wong Ah Fook Street is named after Wong Ah Fook. The Tam Hiok Nee Street is named after Tan Hiok Nee, who was the leader of the former Ngee Heng Kongsi, a secret society in Johor Bahru. Together with the Dhoby Street, both are part of a trail known as Old Buildings Road; they feature a mixture of Chinese and Indian heritages, reflected by their forms of ethnic business and architecture.|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{was widely}} {{considered}} to be the world's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain's greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (<b>Fountain</b> <b>and</b> Flow) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E
50|$|After he graduated, he apprenticed under sculptors Richard Brooks, Robert Baker and Solon Borglum. He {{worked as}} a carpenter, shipbuilder, {{dishwasher}} and chimney sweep. He fashioned architectural decorations, including figures for <b>fountains</b> <b>and</b> {{now and then a}} few commissioned portraits. He returned to Boston by the early 1920s and began to exhibit his own works and get commissions for portraits, <b>fountains</b> <b>and</b> reliefs.|$|R

5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life. The scene featured seventeen figures with nine depicting the Holy Family, the Magi, and the shepherds. The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent Pallotti for the nativity at Rome's Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually {{found their way to}} the Vatican. They are dressed anew each year for the scene. The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> a hearth representing regeneration and light. The same year, the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, Gordon {{partnered with}} Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios, hiring David Hayter {{to write and}} direct. Hayter and the {{producers}} left Universal due to creative differences, and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios. The project did not hold together at Revolution Studios and subsequently fell apart. In July 2004, it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they attached Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Aronofsky left to focus on The <b>Fountain</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by Paul Greengrass. Ultimately, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround.|$|E
5|$|Starting from George M. Ewing's {{original}} design {{of an office}} tower, Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. turned the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters into a , nine-story low horizontal block. At the corner of 6th Street and Market Street, two blocks away from Independence Hall, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters front facade runs parallel along 6th Street looking towards the Independence Mall. The reinforced concrete framed building sits on flaring concrete columns and is set back from the street by a raised plaza. The landscaped plaza cuts {{through the middle of}} the ground level of the building, opening up to a larger plaza with a <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> small pool. The plaza behind the building allows public access to an alley that leads to Seventh Street.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist, {{known to}} the locals as Sveti Yani or Sveti Yan, is located on a high cliff on the western {{outskirts}} of Asenovgrad, which belong to the old town. To allow its construction, the terrain around its foundations had to be reinforced. The church lies close to several less ancient chapels, such as Saint Barbara's, Saint George's and Chapel of the Entry of the Most Holy Mother of God into the Temple. Nearby are also a 17th-century water <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> remains of medieval fortifications which date to the 11th–13th century. Together, these buildings contribute {{to that part of}} Asenovgrad's medieval atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was well}} {{developed}} by this time, and was reached through three gates positioned across the wider estate, called Nethergate, Redgate and Dernegate. The castle itself had four stone towers protecting {{the entrance to}} the inner bailey and the keep, called Auditorstower, Maidenstower, Constabletower and Oxfordtower. Elizabeth built a chamber for her own use at the castle between 1346-7. A substantial water-garden, forming part of the moat to the east, existed at the castle during this period; it may have included a <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> probably had a geometric form, possibly similar to the garden at nearby St Benet's Abbey in Norfolk. Vineyards and orchards surrounded the property. The castle's three parks continued in active use, and, as part of the local rearing programme, the local deer were moved between them as the animals grew older.|$|E
5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E

5|$|In July 2004, it was {{announced}} Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on The <b>Fountain,</b> <b>and</b> Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Paddy Considine, was involved in negotiations for Rorschach. Jude Law (a fan of the comic) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct Watchmen teaser website that had a message board as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director {{he did not think}} the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including Watchmen, were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmens budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount’s CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround, again.|$|E
5|$|Soho {{is an area}} first {{developed}} in the 1670s which, since the construction of theatres along Shaftesbury Avenue in the 19th century, has had a strong association with the entertainment industry. In {{the south of the}} district stands Leicester Square, the public sculpture of which has had an eventful history. From 1748 the square had as it centrepiece an equestrian figure of George I, but this deteriorated and was sold off {{at the beginning of the}} following century. In 1874 the square was bought by Albert Grant, a company promoter and MP, who had its gardens made over to a design by James Knowles. In this refurbishment the Shakespeare <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> busts of four historical residents of the locale were installed, the latter positioned near the sites of their former homes. A renovation of the square carried out between 2010 and 2012 was criticised for its removal of all of the sculptures on the square except for that of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water <b>fountain</b> <b>and</b> reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E
