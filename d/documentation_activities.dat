Urban planners and designers strive for ways to secure information, and in this regard reach out for specialists in data recording and documentation. A case in point has materialized in the context of planning urban areas in Bahrain during 2005 - 06. A collaborative undertaking between the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Ministry of Municipal Affair and Agriculture of Bahrain (MoMAA) called for revitalization of urban areas in Manama and Muharraq, the largest cities with conspicuous heritage assets. The initial phase of the undertaking has culminated with a comprehensive report reflecting the expertise of several international consultants in specialty areas of planning including land use, economics, and information technology. The second phase of the undertaking involved urban design projects where consultants completed pilot designs. The authors acted as documentation consultants to provide congruent information for urban design activities. In this capacity, they implemented documentation work in service of the “pilot ” project Urban Design of the City of Manama Cultural Heritage Area. The <b>documentation</b> <b>activity</b> for the Manama project involved stretches of street facades.

40|$|Design Reuse' {{is one of}} {{the hopeful}} {{techniques}} to increase the productivity in ECAD frameworks. To support this reuse we propose a formal model to describe design objects, design processes, and requirement specifications. Using this model we introduce a measure to determine reuse candidates from the design database. We address the consideration of special CAD properties and discuss appearing problems. 1. Introduction The reuse of designs or parts of designs seems to be "the key enabler for system design in the 90 's" [DAC 94]. This reuse should comprehend all design informations: design objects as well as specifications, <b>documentations,</b> <b>activities,</b> and whole design processes. To turn this effort into reality we need an adequate formalization of the whole design. Even if our goal must be to support the reuse of all design data, we will mainly focus on the reuse of design objects and design specifications in this paper. In section 2, we gather the requirements of a comprehensive reuse i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{software}} engineering, {{technical documentation}} {{is one of}} the activities that play an important role for the success of software projects. When developing software systems a lot of time is spent not only implementing your own solutions into the code but also understanding and maintaining the code solution produced by others. However with an emerging agile community the priority and engagement in documentation may stagnate and effort invested into those activities may to some extent be considered inherently wasteful. Therefore, the current perception for many software engineers may be that technical documentation is incomplete and not updated. An important aspect of the issue of producing documentation is the motivation of the developers who are responsible for its completion. A question that might be asked is if documentation overall is an activity that the software community would be better off without, or if it is a neglected activity with room for improvement. For that reason this exploratory multiple case study aims to identify some of the issues to shed some light on why technical documentation has got into such an unfavourable position in the software industry. The study investigate the motivation affecting software engineers when producing software documentation, how this motivation evolves over time and why there is a difference compared to other activities in the software industry. The study consider prospect theory as an explanatory theory for how improvements in outcomes are perceived in terms of value. In addition this study also analyses how experiences are remembered and evaluated, as it relates to how excitement is considered for similar tasks in the future. The study can affirm that software engineers’ motivation seems to be affected by excitement and value dimensions when it comes to producing technical documentation. Additionally, in the long term, receiving constructive feedback can improve the excitement and the perceived value of writing technical documentation. The study finally observes that developers to a higher extent seem intrinsically motivated by the coding <b>activity</b> than the <b>documentation</b> <b>activity,</b> which the study points out as a primary enabler for the difference in behaviour between the coding and <b>documentation</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

The analysis of these transitional artifacts in four different clinical workflows shows that the EMR system’s inability to document procedural information, capture key information, and present information according to the actual clinical workflow are accountable for leading to the use of transitional artifacts. The findings of this study call for designing EMR system not only for keeping patients’ formal records, but also for documenting transitional information in the chart-writing process...|$|E

40|$|Design {{decisions}} crucially {{influence the}} success of every software development project. Consequently, {{a considerable amount of}} time in the development activities is usually spent to discuss design decisions and their possible outcomes. While the results of the design decisions are often documented quite well, the situation is usually different for the decision making processes themselves. Usually, little or no effort is spent to track the decision process and its findings, although this could be relevant and helpful information for future decisions in related projects. This report deals with the question, how to document design decisions in software development projects in general and within the demonstrator development in the BelAmi project in special. Usually design decisions have to consider the interests of various stakeholders. This holds especially in the Ambient Intelligence domain. Consequently, a design <b>documentation</b> <b>activity</b> focusing on the avoidance of misunderstandings and shortcomings in the stakeholders' intercommunication is, in our context, mandatory.
