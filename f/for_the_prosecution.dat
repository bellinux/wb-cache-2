5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|Kerr {{experienced}} a career resurgence {{on television in}} the early 1980s when she {{played the role of}} the nurse—played by Elsa Lanchester in the 1957 movie—in Witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecution.</b> Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in Reunion at Fairborough. She also took {{on the role of the}} older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of Barbara Taylor Bradford's A Woman of Substance. For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{suspected}} that the Miguel who had recruited the mercenaries was Michel Dominguez, a Spanish police officer of French origin who worked with Amedo. In April 1990 a waiter at Londres Hotel and a security employee at the Kursaal casino in San Sebastián both stated that they had seen Amedo and Dominguez on various occasions {{in the company of}} Mattei and other GAL mercenaries.|$|E

50|$|William Lansing Downing (born August 1, 1949) is a {{judge of}} the Superior Court of Washington for King County (Seattle) and a former deputy prosecutor. He is famous for his ruling that {{same-sex}} marriages are legal in Washington, as well as <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> of <b>the</b> Wah Mee massacre killers.|$|R
5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is unnecessary {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5|$|The Dennis {{decision}} {{paved the}} way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of hundreds of other Communist party members. The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld. The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on 20 July 1931 before Mr Justice Wright, with Sir William Jowitt, D. N. Pritt and Eustace Fulton <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> Sir John Simon, J. E. Singleton and Wilfred Lewis for Lord Kylsant, and Hastings, Stuart Bevan, Frederick Tucker and C. J. Conway for John Morland. Both {{defendants}} pleaded not guilty.|$|E

5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> and her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E

5|$|At {{the trial}} in 1884, {{prosecutors}} implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, {{as well as that}} of Thomas Higgins, with which they were officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide evidence against other conspirators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> in exchange for leniency was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|During the Trial of Gotovina et al {{before the}} International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia, Reynaud Theunens {{compared}} Operations Mistral 2 and Storm {{in his capacity as}} an expert witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Theunens pointed out that civilian property and infrastructure at less risk in the aftermath of Operation Mistral 2, as Gotovina had issued much more strict orders in that respect, establishing companies specifically tasked with security and imposing a curfew in Jajce. The HV and the HVO sustained losses of 74 killed and 226 wounded in the operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although {{roots of}} {{criminal}} prosecutions are traced {{back in the}} 17 th and 18 th century but newly emerged discipline of international law namely international criminal law gained its scope after adoption Rome Statute. However, statute {{has not yet been}} universally accepted and various discrepancies have been raised by various states regarding the Jurisdiction and applicable procedure of International Criminal Court (ICC). Prior to the establishment of ICC, initially various international tribunals were established <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> of perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression, particularly after World War II. However, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were subjected to serious criticism not only by the states representing the accused persons rather by the prosecuting states as well, on the grounds that all <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were partial in natur...|$|R
5|$|In {{front of}} a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd {{and should not be}} {{displayed}} in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W.W.Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, September Morn had to be banned. Other witnesses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young {{and the head of the}} Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E

50|$|Zachary W. Carter (born March 19, 1950) is {{the current}} {{corporation}} counsel of New York City and the former United States Attorney <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Eastern District of New York. He was appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014. His term as U.S. Attorney was notable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> of <b>the</b> police officers in the Abner Louima case, Jordan Belfort, and {{those involved in the}} death of Yankel Rosenbaum during the Crown Heights riot of 1991. Between his tenures in government service, Carter was a partner at Dorsey & Whitney.|$|R
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
