ATP, in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system to oppose hydrolysis during incubation, inhibited glibenclamide binding to SUR 1 and SUR 2 B(Y 1206 S) by ∼ 60 %, to SUR 2 A(Y 1206 S) by 21 %). <b>Inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> for the SUR 2 (Y 1206 S) isoforms were monophasic with IC 50 values of 5 – 10 μM; the curve for SUR 1 was biphasic (IC 50 values 4. 7 and 1300 μM). Glibenclamide <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> for ADP, performed in the presence of an ATP-consuming system to oppose ATP formation from ADP, were generally shifted rightwards and showed positive cooperativity, in particular with the SUR 2 (Y 1206 S) isoforms.

The Schild regression allows one to determine the parameter of the Schild-slope, which represents a powerful diagnostic tool when investigating the nature of an antagonist and, consequently, to evaluate its potency. Nevertheless, in functional pharmacology, often practical reasons lead the experimenter to obtain an <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve</b> for the antagonist and calculate its potency by means of equations, which {{can be considered as}} a derivation of the Cheng-Prusoff analysis. This approach is considered theoretically invalid, because it does not allow to know the exact nature of the antagonism, and thus the evaluation of the antagonist dissociation constant can be meaningless. In this paper, a new method is proposed, which, by means of an equation closely similar to the Schild one, permits one to obtain a linear regression analysis, giving a slope value absolutely equivalent to the Schild-slope. This method allows us to determine both the nature and the potency of an antagonist, and requires an experimental procedure substantially analogous to the one performed to obtain an <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve...</b>|$|E

The assays involve inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), which normally incorporates radiolabeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates into a synthetic template primer. For the 3 TCTP assay, a preincubation procedure was added whereby 3 TCTP becomes incorporated before [3 H]dCTP. At a 1 : 400 template primer dilution, control product formation was reduced by 88. 0 % with 0. 8 pmol of 3 TCTP. Standard 3 TCTP <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> were performed using this procedure. For the CBVTP assay, 0. 1 pmol of CBVTP inhibited control product formation with and without the use of a preincubation step, so <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> were constructed using both procedures. However, reduced template primer stability with assays using preincubation steps led to a single-incubation procedure being adopted for future studies. The presence of PBMC extracts interfered with the 3 TCTP assay. However, this was overcome by the addition of CuSO 4. PBMC extracts did not interfere with the CBVTP assay. Intracellular 3 TCTP and CBVTP concentrations were determined in PBMCs from HIV-infected patients over 24 h or greater. Peak concentrations were obtained 6 to 8 h after dosing, and the half-lives of the anabolites suggested the possibility of once-daily dosing.

Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed 22 HIV- 1 common mutation complexes. IC 50 and slope of 10 representative approved drugs and a novel agent against these mutations were measured to determine the resistance phenotypes. The values of new parameter incorporating both the IC 50 and the slope of the <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve</b> were calculated, and the correlations between parameters were assessed. Depending on the class of drug, there were intrinsic differences in how the resistance mutations affected the drug parameters. All of the mutations resulted in large increases in the IC 50 s of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The effects of the mutations on the slope were the most apparent when examining their effects on the inhibition of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. For example, some mutations, such as V 82 A, had no effect on IC 50, but reduced the slope. We proposed a new concept, termed IIPatoxic, on the basis of IC 50, slope and the maximum limiting concentrations of the drug. The IIPatoxic values of 10 approved drugs and 1 novel agent were calculated, and were closely related to the IIPmax values (r > 0. 95, p < 0. 001). This study confirms that resistance mutations cannot be accurately assessed by IC 50 alone, because it tends to underestimate the degree of resistance. The slope parameter is of very importance in the measurement of drug resistance and the effect can be applied to more complex patterns of resistance. This is the most apparent when testing the effects of the mutations on protease inhibitors activity. We also propose a new index, IIPatoxic, which incorporates both the IC 50 and the slope. This new index could complement current IIP indices, thereby enabling predict the efficacy of pre-clinical drugs for which human pharmacokinetic is not available...|$|E

[³H]C₁₆-PAF identified receptor densities in GPLM of 200 fmol/mg protein and in RPM of 1922 fmol/mg protein. In both tissue preparations binding of inhibited to the same maximum degree by C₁₆-PAF, C₁₈-PAF, WEB 2086, and RP 52770, all with pseudo-Hill coefficients of unity. The PAF antagonist [³H]WEB 2086 identified a receptor density similar to that of [³H]C₁₆-PAF. The binding of [³H]WEB 2086 was inhibited to the same degree by C₁₆-PAF, C₁₈-PAF, WEB 2086 and RP 52770, indicating WEB 2086 and PAF interact at the same receptor sites in both GPLM and RPM. Although <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> for antagonists yielded pseudo-Hill coefficients of unity, inhibition by agonists yielded shallow <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> suggesting two types or states for the PAF receptor. The PAF antagonist [³H]RP 52770 was found to be an unsuitable ligand because it labeled a much larger density of binding sites (1200 fmol/mg protein in GPLM, and 10105 fmol/mg protein in RPM) and was inhibited to little or no extent by C₁₆-PAF, C₁₈-PAF, WEB 2086 or lyso-C₁₆-PAF. studies of signal transduction suggest that the binding affinity of the agonists C₁₆-PAF and C₁₈-PAF (but not for the antagonist WEB 2086) is regulated by GTPgamroa- S and Na⁺, providing indirect evidence that the PAF receptor in both tissue preparations is coupled to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. However, agonist binding retained shallow <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> indicating heterogeneity of sites with respect to this regulation.

DHEA inhibition of G 6 PD was only found to occur at concentrations above 10 microM; at these high concentrations, the growth curve was parallel to the enzyme <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve</b> in both cell lines. In contrast, at concentrations in the in vivo breast tissue concentration range, neither cell growth nor enzyme activity was inhibited. The results failed to confirm DHEA's putative anti-tumor action on breast cancer through G 6 PD inhibition, as the enzyme blockade only becomes apparent at pharmacological concentrations of the steroid...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the binding of 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT) and GR 43175 (3 -(2 -dimethylamino) ethyl-N-methyl- 1 H-indole- 5 -methane sulphonamide) to 5 -HT 1 D sites labelled with [3 H]- 5 -hydroxytryptamine [(3 H]- 5 -HT) in neonatal porcine caudate membranes. In competition studies, 5 -CT produced shallow inhibition curves (Ki 138 nM, slope 0. 31), indicating binding site heterogeneity, while GR 43175 interacted with a single population of binding sites (Ki 251 nM, slope 0. 98), producing a maximum of only 52 % inhibition of [3 H]- 5 -HT binding compared to 100 % for 5 -HT or 5 -CT. In the presence of excess GR 43175 (10 microM), 5 -CT produced a monophasic <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve</b> with a Ki value of 800 nM for the remaining sites (slope 0. 89). These preliminary data suggest that under the conditions employed, GR 43175, {{and to a lesser}} extent 5 -CT, may discriminate between two sub-populations of 5 -HT 1 D binding sites in porcine brain...|$|E
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to a possible relationship between lysosomal function and stimulation of secretory processes in endocrine cells. The last few years it has become increasingly evident that the secretion of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cell is the result of a very complex cascade of events, the details of which are far from elucidated and indeed may include the participation of the lysosomal system. We report here, with a combined in vitro and in vivo approach, that selective inhibition of islet lysosomal glycogenolytic acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase activity by the long-acting 1 -deoxynojirimycin derivative emiglitate induces a profound suppression of nutrient-induced insulin release. In islet homogenate emiglitate strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the activity of acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase (EC 50 approximately 10 (- 6) M) without affecting other classical lysosomal enzyme activities. The emiglitate-induced <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve</b> for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets was remarkably similar to the <b>inhibition</b> <b>curve</b> for acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase. Moreover, insulin release stimulated by the nonglucose nutrient secretagogues, leucine, and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) was totally suppressed by emiglitate. In contrast, receptor activated insulin secretion induced by the insulinotropic hormone cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) was unaffected by the drug. Further, parenteral pretreatment of mice with emiglitate markedly suppressed the insulin secretory response to an iv injection of glucose or KIC, whereas the response to an iv injection of CCK- 8 was unaffected. In accordance with this, islets isolated from emiglitate-treated mice showed a reduced activity of acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase and, moreover, such islets incubated in vitro, secreted less insulin in response to glucose than did control islets. Finally, pretreatment of mice with purified fungal acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase, enzyme replacement, brought about a markedly increased insulin secretory response after an iv injection of KIC, whereas the insulin response after CCK- 8 injection was unaffected. Taken together with previous observations, the present data strongly suggest that islet lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidehydrolases are involved in the multifactorial process of nutrient-induced insulin secretion. The existence of hitherto unresolved and complex interactions between different beta-cell organelles in the insulin secretory processes should be thoroughly reevaluated...|$|E
40|$|Tech ReportA {{model is}} {{developed}} for the vagal control of SA nodal activity in the heart and consists essentially of a modified bonhoeffer-Van der Pol (BVP) model of the "free-running" SA node and a lumped model of the neural terminations in that region. The model is capable of mimicing both the driven transient behavior of the node in terms of pacemaker and <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves,</b> as well as steady-state entrainment phenomena. The model data also agrees very well with experimental data from dog experiments performed in our laboratory. The model is described {{by a set of}} nonlinear, third-order, ordinary differential equations and provides a relatively uncomplicated functional model of heart period changes due to vagal stimulation patterns.

40|$|In several monoamine {{receptor}} systems, agonist but not antagonist binding {{is found}} to be associated with both a high- and a low-affinity state of the receptor. Guanine nucleotides, like GTP, can eliminate the high-affinity receptor state such that only the low-affinity state of the receptor is present. Since [3 H] 5 -hydroxytryptamine ([3 H} 5 -HT) is an agonist, its binding may also be associated with multiple states of a receptor. To evaluate this, the binding of [3 H] 5 -HT to rat frontal cortical membranes was measured in the absence and presence of GTP. Three different types of binding experiments were performed: (a) saturation experiments, (b) dissociation experiments, and (c) competition experiments with 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) agonists. When all three types of binding experiments were carried out in the absence of GTP, results from either graphical representations or computer analysis of the data indicated that a two-component model of binding described the data better than a single-component model. By contrast, in the presence of GTP, a one-component model adequately described the data obtained from either saturation or dissociation experiments. Competition of [3 H] 5 -HT (15 nM) binding by three 5 -HT agonists (5 -methoxytryptamine, 5 -HT, and d-lysergic acid diethylamide) was adequately described by a single-component system in the presence of GTP as well, even though all three agonists produced biphasic <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> {{in the absence of the}} guanine nucleotide. These experimental results are consistent with the idea that the binding of [:IH] 5 HT in the absence of GTP is associated with multiple receptor states. Since the presence of multiple states can confound the interpretation of <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> of [aH] 5 HT binding caused by agonists, it is important to eliminate the high-affinity state of the receptor by including GTP in the binding assay...|$|R
30|$|A {{library of}} {{synthetic}} promoters of various strengths, specifically constructed for Streptomyces species, was cloned in the promoter-probe plasmid pIJ 487, upstream of the promoter-less aphII gene that confers resistance to neomycin. The survival rates conferred by promoters were assessed {{in the presence}} of 100 μg.ml− 1 neomycin. The correlation between the transcriptional activity of the aphII gene (estimated by RT-PCR) and the resistance to neomycin (expressed as survival rate) indicated a sigmoid rather than a linear correlation. In this issue, we propose a tentative explanation for this sigmoidal pattern of resistance in relation with the level of aph II gene expression. Beyond this specific example, our model might constitute a sound explanation for the generally observed but never explained sigmoidal shape of classical <b>inhibition</b> <b>curves</b> obtained {{in the presence of}} linearly increasing antibiotic concentrations.|$|R
