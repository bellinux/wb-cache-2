In this paper a new relation for the optimum spacing between rectangular fins is proposed. The relation was obtained keeping into account non-unitary fin efficiency.

An original method to evaluate radiative heat flux is proposed too. The method allows to obtain an original simple radiative heat flux equation.

They establish, as a standard of excellence with which other boilers may be compared, a simple boiler consisting of a single drum and a single U-tube. The paper consists of three parts. Part I describes the nature of the change from water to steam j in part I 1 the flow in the simple U-tube boiler is calculated; and in part I 11 the features of various departures from the standard U-tube, met with in practice, are discussed. An improved type of tube, approaching very nearly to the standard U-tube, is evolved, allowing much simplification of boiler design, with the advantages of excellent circulation, high gas speeds, and higher <b>heat</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rates.</b> Other rational simplifications and improvements are also rendered possible, which enable substantial reductions {{to be made in the}} cost of manufacturing, installing, and maintaining boilers of any pressure and capacity, for any service, ashore or afloat.

One fundamental challenge is {{to ensure the quality}} of service (QoS) of the primary link while maximizing the achievable <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> of the cognitive radio user. In this paper, we investigate the cooperation based spectrum access at the cognitive radio networks.
