40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Erythrocytic {{inclusion}} body syndrome (EIBS), a viral disease of salmon, was investigated. Reliable artificial infections {{were established in}} coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) via intraperitoneal injection of homogenized kidney, spleen, and blood from naturally infected animals. By examining the exposed fish periodically for viral inclusion bodies and <b>hematocrits,</b> the disease progression for EIBS was determined. Erythrocytic {{inclusion body}} syndrome had four stages which were incubation, inclusion body formation, lysis, and recovery. After an incubation period, circulating erythrocytes developed cytoplasmic inclusions and the numbers of infected cells increased to a maximum. The lysis stage followed and was characterized by lysis of erythrocytes with inclusions, lower <b>hematocrits,</b> and an accompanying anemia. When <b>hematocrits</b> were lowest, no cells with inclusions were observed. Following the anemia, the fish began to recover as indicated {{by an increase in}} circulating lymphocytes and immature erythrocytes. When the fish had recovered, their <b>hematocrits</b> were normal, serum was protective in passive immunization experiments, the fish showed resistance to reinfection, and tissues from the recovered fish were no longer infectious. The four stages of EIBS were discerned in infected fish held at temperatures of 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 C but as the temperature increased, the incubation time, time to maximum inclusions, duration of the inclusion stage, and the time to recovery decreased. Numbers of inclusions were highest in fish held at 6 and 9 C. In histological analysis, cells of the liver, anterior kidney, and spleen from infected fish were not necrotic. Hemosiderin, a protein-iron pigment accumulated in the spleen following cell lysis. Utilizing the artificial infection, rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and cutthroat (Oncorhynchus clarki) trout were determined to be susceptible, but the disease was much less severe in these species than in chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon, the natural hosts of the virus. Additional results indicated EIBS is transmitted horizontally and that infected fish may be immunosuppressed. Staining of blood smears with acridine orange has indicated the genome of the virus is single stranded nucleic acid...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{thalassemia}} major often {{report that}} they do not maintain their usual pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration during the summer season. We collected 3977 pretransfusion hemoglobin values, amount of blood transfused, and intertransfusion intervals for 94 patients with thalassemia major from 4 centers worldwide. We also assessed the <b>hematocrits</b> of blood donors, the hemoglobin content of units transfused in one center, and the local mean monthly temperatures during the periods of data collection. Pretransfusion hemoglobin levels were significantly lower during the summer in all centers except the one center where monthly temperatures have the least variation throughout the year. A similar relationship to temperature was observed for the <b>hematocrits</b> of blood donors and the hemoglobin content of donor units. This study confirms that pretransfusion hemoglobin levels in patients with thalassemia major are lower in the summertime. Possible mechanisms include expansion of plasma volume with resultant hemodilution in the patient and lower hemoglobin content in donor blood. © 2006 by The American Society of Hematology...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising <b>hematocrit)</b> and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E
5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a glandular epithelium. The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation. At about 50%, <b>hematocrit</b> (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E

40|$|Atrial {{thrombosis}} is {{a common}} lesion in female Taconic Swiss mice fed a high-fat (28 %), low-protein (8 %), hypolipotropic diet for 10 wk or longer.

In mice receiving injections of lysed red cells, plasma or saline, respectively 75, 54 and 82 % of those surviving for 10 wk had developed atrial thrombosis. <b>Hematocrits</b> were 9. 3 % or below in these groups. <b>Hematocrits</b> were maintained at an average of 33. 0 % in the erythropoietin group and 32. 4 % in the transfused (packed erythrocytes) group.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{public health}} {{significance}} of intestinal parasitism among migrant farmworkers has been poorly defined. We report a three-part {{study in which}} we attempted to provide population-based estimates and identify risk factors for infection. METHODS. Parasite prevalence and incidence were estimated from two cross-sectional studies and a longitudinal study. We used questionnaires and clinical measurements such as <b>hematocrits</b> to examine risk factors and health effects. RESULTS. In the 1987 convenience sample (n = 265), parasite prevalence ranged from 28 % among the US born to 86 % among the Central American born, with {{no significant difference between}} the prevalence of pathogens among US-born (14 %) and Mexican-born (24 %) subjects (P =. 12, chi 2 test). High prevalences were also found in the 1988 random sample. An annual incidence of 9. 5 % (n = 74) was demonstrated in 1988. Symptoms such as abdominal pain were associated with infection, and lower <b>hematocrits</b> were associated with hookworm infection (P =. 02, t test). CONCLUSIONS. Infection with intestinal parasites appears to be an occupational hazard of farmwork, necessitating improved working and living conditions and greater clinical awareness...|$|R
25|$|In general, <b>hematocrit</b> is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in {{circulation}} and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. <b>Hematocrit</b> may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in <b>hematocrit</b> are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase <b>hematocrit</b> is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing <b>hematocrit</b> in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of hypoxia inducible factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).|$|E
25|$|While {{increasing}} <b>hematocrit</b> {{means that}} the blood can carry a larger total amount of oxygen, a possible advantage during hypoxia, {{increasing the number of}} RBCs in the blood can also lead to certain disadvantages. First, A higher <b>hematocrit</b> results in more viscous blood (especially in cold water) increasing the amount of energy the cardiac system requires to pump the blood through the system and secondly depending on the transit time of the blood across the branchial arch and the diffusion rate of oxygen, an increased <b>hematocrit</b> may result in less efficient transfer of oxygen from the environment to the blood.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys {{measure the}} oxygen content (mmolO2/liter blood, {{rather than the}} partial {{pressure}} of O2) of the arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low, as at high altitude, the oxygen-sensitive kidney cells secrete erythropoietin (often known only by its abbreviated form as EPO) into the blood. This hormone stimulates the red bone marrow to increase its rate of red cell production, which leads {{to an increase in}} the <b>hematocrit</b> of the blood, and a consequent increase in its oxygen carrying capacity (due to the now high hemoglobin content of the blood). In other words, at the same arterial partial pressure of O2, a person with a high <b>hematocrit</b> carries more oxygen per liter of blood than a person with a lower <b>hematocrit</b> does. High altitude dwellers therefore have higher hematocrits than sea-level residents.|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in central blood volume in microgravity {{may result in}} increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). In this study, it was determined whether ANF increases capillary permeability to plasma protein. Conscious, bilaterally nephrectomized male rats were infused with either saline, ANF + saline, or hexamethonium + saline over 2 h following bolus injections of (I- 125) -albumin and (C- 14) -dextran of similar molecular size. Blood pressure was monitored, and serial determinations of <b>hematocrits</b> were made. Animals infused with 1. 0 microg/kg per min ANF had significantly higher <b>hematocrits</b> than animals infused with saline vehicle. Infusion of ANF increased the extravasation of (I- 125) -albumin, but not (C- 14) -dextran from the intravascular compartment. ANF also induced a depressor response in rats, but the {{change in blood pressure}} did not account for changes in capillary permeability to albumin; similar depressor responses induced by hexamethonium were not accompanied by increased extravasation of albumin from the intravascular compartment. ANF may decrease plasma volume by increasing permeability to albumin, and this effect of ANF may account for some of the signs and symptoms of space motion sickness...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Folic {{acid and}} ascorbic acid status have been {{assessed}} in twenty non-institutionalized elderly subjects {{with respect to}} both hematological and dietary aspects.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the performance-enhancing drugs crisis in cycling following the 1998 Tour de France, Riis acquired the nickname of Mr. 60%, a suggestion that he has used doping.

It has been published, but never proven, that Riis had a <b>hematocrit</b> level of 56% during one test in July 1995; well above typical natural levels, as well as his published reading of 41% in the offseason earlier that year. The earliest mention of the nickname can be traced to interviews with riders of Festina in 1998–2000, who apparently suggested that if they had been doped above 50%, then Riis must have been doped to at least 60%, since he was able to win the Tour de France in 1996 ahead of the Festina rider Richard Virenque: in Willy Voet's book Breaking the Chain, he mentions that Festina's team doctor would not allow EPO to be administered if a rider's <b>hematocrit</b> level was near 55%.|$|E

Dosages of the extracts were 250 mg/kg BW and 500 mg/kg BW used for both dewa leaves and temu ireng rhizome. Extracts were given orally to the tested animals for seven continuous days. The number of trombocytes, erythrocytes, and hematocrites level were examine at day 7 using sysmex XE- 5000 hematology analyzer. The result showed that the rat groups which were treated with dewa leaves extract at 500 mg/kgBW; temu ireng Rhizomes extract at 250 mg/kgBW and 500 mg/kgBW dosages had significant differences (α = 0. 05) on number of thrombocytes. The percentages of thrombocytes number enhancement for temu ireng rhizomes extract 500 mg/kgBW, temu ireng rhizomes extract 250 mg/kgBW, dewa leaves extract 500 mg/kgBW were 26. 98 %, 24. 48 %, 19. 44 % respectively. The rats group which were treated with temu ireng Rhizomes extract at 500 mg/kgBW, dewa leaves extract at 250 mg/kgBW and 500 mg/kgBW had significant differences (α = 0. 05) on erythrocytes number and <b>hematocrits</b> level enhancement. The percentages of erythrocytes number enhancement for dewa leaves extract at dose of 500 mg/kgBW and 250 mg/kgBW, temu ireng rhizomes extract 500 mg/kgBW were 9. 59 %, 9. 11 %, 9. 02 % respectively. The highest percentages of <b>hematocrits</b> level enhancement was given by dewa leaves extract at dose of 500 mg/kgBW (10, 97 %), suggesting that the extracts treatment would not trigger plasma leakage.

25|$|A unique {{characteristic}} of the northern elephant seal {{is that it has}} developed the ability to store oxygenated red blood cells within its spleen. In a 2004 study researchers used MRI to observe physiological changes of the spleens of 5 seal pups during simulated dives.

Also, a delay was observed between contraction of the spleen and increased <b>hematocrit</b> within the circulating blood, and attributed to the hepatic sinus. This fluid-filled structure is initially expanded due to the rush of RBC from the spleen and slowly releases the red blood cells into the circulatory system via a muscular vena caval sphincter found on the cranial aspect of the diaphragm. This ability to slowly introduce RBC into the blood stream is likely to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in <b>hematocrit.</b>|$|E

Hematological tests included red and white blood cell (RBC and WBC) counts, <b>hematocrits,</b> blood hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte fragility. Infected fish had lower RBC counts, <b>hematocrits,</b> and hemoglobin concentrations, higher WBC counts, and more fragile erythrocytes than control fish. Other blood parameters calculated from the hematology data indicated that the erythrocytes of infected fish had higher mean corpuscular volumes, depressed mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, and slightly lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Erythrocytic inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm of RBC of infected fish, and unnucleated cells were observed by week 2. In this experiment, severity of infection progressed steadily through week 4, after which the fish appeared to be recovering. In a second study, fish were infected with ENV, held for three weeks, and recovery from exercise was measured. Plasma glucose and osmolality were higher in infected fish, while plasma cortisol and blood lactate levels were only slightly elevated.
