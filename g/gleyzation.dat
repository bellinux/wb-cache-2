40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the soils in an area situated at the western edge of Ploie ş ti city (the central-eastern part of the Ploie ş ti Plain). In order to map the 58 hectares expected to be turned into a municipal park we perfo rmed five soil profiles, which were analyzed both morphologically (color, texture, structure, ne oformations, skeleton, <b>gleyzation,</b> pseudo- <b>gleyzation,</b> morphological thickness, consistency in dry state and compactness) and analytically (calcium carbonate, pH, organic carbon and total hu mus content). Based on our findings, we were able to divide the soils into two ecological gro ups (chernozems soils and thin soils), which reflect properly their physical, chemical and biolo gical properties, as well as their specific utilization and management (Florea, 2003) ...|$|E
40|$|Gravelly clay loamy and clayey soils {{developed}} from the derivatives of ultramafic rocks of the dunite-harzburgite complex of the Rai-Iz massif in the Polar Urals have been studied. They are represented by raw-humus pelozems (weakly developed clayey soils) under conditions of perfect drainage on steep slopes and by the gleyzems (Gleysols) with vivid gley color patterns in the eluvial positions on leveled elements of the relief. The magnesium released from the silicates with the high content of this element (mainly from olivine) specifies the neutral-alkaline reaction in these soils. Cryoturbation, the accumulation of raw humus, the impregnation of the soil mass with humic substances, <b>gleyzation,</b> and the ferrugination of the gleyed horizons are also clearly pronounced in the studied soils. Despite the high pH values, the destruction of supergene smectites in the upper horizons and ferrugination (the accumulation of iron hydroxides) in the microfissures dissecting the grains of olivine, pyroxene, and serpentine, and in decomposing plant tissues take place. The development of these processes {{may be related to}} the local acidification (neutralization) of the soil medium under the impact of biota and carbonic acids. The specificity of <b>gleyzation</b> in the soils developing from ultra-mafic rocks is shown in the absence of iron depletion from the fine earth material against the background of the greenish blue gley color pattern...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of automorphic cultivated soils of the Fayette series (the order of Alfisols) —close analogues of gray forest soils in the European part of Russia—was studied by {{the method of}} agrosoil chronosequences in the lower reaches of the Iowa River. It {{was found that the}} old-arable soils are characterized by an increase in the thickness of humus horizons and better aggregation; they are subjected to active biogenic turbation by rodents; some alkalization of the soil reaction and an increase in the sum of exchangeable bases also take place. These features are developed against the background of active eluvial-illuvial differentiation and <b>gleyzation</b> of the soil profiles under conditions of a relatively wet climate typical of the ecotone between the zones of prairies and broadleaved forests in the northeast Central Plains of the United States...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} {{land use}} evolution in Rebricea basin, mainly with {{insights into the}} dynamics of the forested surfaces, which are easier to interpret on diverse sets of cartographic materials. Thus the study compares cartographic materials from different periods (1769 – up to the present) : the map of the Russian general F. G. Bawr, 1 : 280, 000; the Russian map scaled 1 : 420, 000 from 1828 - 1829, published in 1835; the topographic map from 1915, 1 : 200, 000 and the topographic maps from 1972 - 1974, 1 : 200, 000. The dynamics of the forested surface is very clear, the materials indicating a constant decrease of the forest surface. Nowadays,the analyzed basin is dominated by arable terrains, mainly in {{the central part of the}} basin, on divides and structural surfaces that offer better conditions for the development of crops. Areas less favorable are occupied by pastures, mainly in the floodplains, frequently affected by <b>gleyzation</b> or salinization, or the upper parts of the slopes, with higher declivities and thus erosion processes. Forests occupy the higher parts of the landscape, mainly in the northern part of the basin, but also with extensions on the divide between Vasluieţ and Rebricei. Bushes also occupy consistent surfaces, in the areas of recent deforestations...|$|E
40|$|Soil cover {{transformation}} and changes of morphological and chemical properties of Albeluvisols in clear-cuttings of middle taiga spruce forests were studied. The observed changes in structure and properties of podzolic texturally-differentiated soils at cuttings of spruce {{forests in the}} middle taiga subzone do not cause their transition to any other soil type. Soil cover of secondary deciduous-coniferous forests which replace cut forests are characterized with a varied soil contour and {{a combination of the}} main type of podzolic soils under undisturbed spruce forests. The increased surface hydromorphism in cut areas causes formation of complicated sub-types of podzolic texturally differentiated soils (podzolic surface-gley soils with microprofile of podzol) and enlarges their ratio (up to 35 – 38 %) in soil cover structure. Temporary soil over-wetting at the initial (5 – 10 years) stage of after-cutting self-restoring vegetation succession provides for soil <b>gleyzation,</b> improves yield and segregation of iron compounds, increases the migratory activity of humic substances. Low content and resources of total nitrogen in forest litters mark anthropogenic transformation processes of podzolic soils at this stage. Later (in 30 – 40 years after logging), soils in cut areas still retain signs of hydromorphism. Forest litters are denser, less acidic and thick with a low weight ratio of organic carbon as compared with Albeluvisols of undisturbed spruce forest. The upper mineral soil horizons under secondary deciduous-coniferous forests contain larger amounts of total iron, its mobile (oxalate-dissolvable) components, and Fe-Mn-concretions...|$|E
40|$|The Caspian Sea {{is subject}} to {{alternating}} transgressions and regressions that exert a strong impact on the topography, sediments, vegetation, and soils in coastal zones. The last transgression of the Caspian Sea (1978 - 1995) caused {{the development of a}} marsh-lagoon system along the accumulative seashore of the Central Dagestan. Salt marshes are complex and dynamic systems highly vulnerable to sea level fluctuations; therefore, they may be considered as a regional model of rapid environmental changes. Hazards in coastal zones may critically change the soil geochemistry affecting agricultural potential of large areas. Assessments of risks of the natural hazards in coastal zones are extremely difficult unless the end-to-end understanding of all natural factors. The research in the Caspian region shows the impact of extreme events in the coastal zones. Detailed landscape-geochemical investigations of the Caspian salt marshes were carried out in 1995 - 1996 (during the final stage of the transgression period) and in 2001 - 2003 (during the period of the sea level stabilization). These coastal areas are influenced by different landscape-geochemical processes, such as sulfidization, <b>gleyzation,</b> ferrugination, humus accumulation, halogenesis, and changes of alkali-acidic conditions. The development of the processes characterizes different stages of the Caspian Sea level fluctuations. This paper presents a discussion on stages and rates of landscape-geochemical processes, formation of geochemical barriers, and trace elements distribution in soils of the salt marshes.

40|$|One of {{the three}} {{strategic}} objectives of the Europe 2020 Agenda is to ensure the sustainable management {{of the natural resources}} and to fight against climate changes. Considering water to be not only a valuable natural resource for any type of landscape, but also the vital environmental component that ensured a minimum of productivity for the people working the unproductive salinization and <b>gleyzation</b> affected soils in the Jiu-Corabia enclosure, using embankment dams to breake the link between the Danube and the flood organism it created over a timespan of millenia has proven in the last 50 years to be an economic and ecological failure. Since the December 1989 events in Romania, after most of the socialist institutions have proven to be too resource consuming, thus unprofitable or maladaptive, the Jiu-Corabia locals have individually experimented with various land cultivation patterns, all of them based on draught-resistant crops, such as peanuts. In spite of it being the original natural landuse, lake usage has only been scarcely mentioned as a project after the 2006 flood, but after being institutionally rejected, its benefits in terms of ecological restoration, financial productivity have not been further looked into. The current article aims to identify different height level scenarios of lake usage in the Jiu-Corabia enclosure, using GIS technique. Lake volumes are calculated for each scenario with the aim of assessing the volume of water this enclose can absorb during flooding periods, as well as of estimating fish production for when the waters are low and it is not needed as a controlled flood chamber. Other benefits, such as providing a source of humidity for precipitations which will aid the crops nearby, have not been monetized, but contribute to the regional development efforts. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTechnogenic soil (technozem) {{was created}} {{on the surface}} of the former sludge pond of the iron-ore quarry in the course of land rehabilitation. The upper chernozemic layer in the technozem was {{underlain}} by sandy or loamy layers. The soil land reclamation constructions were created 20 years ago: the chernozemic 60 -cm layer with classical granular fine and medium-size aggregates (1 - 5 mm) was sprinkled on the deep layer of sand. This construction was in agricultural use during the last 20 years. At present, the layers of prismatic coarse peds (> 50 mm) bounded by flat to rounded vertical faces and columnar, very thick, vertically oriented blocks (> 100 mm) have been formed at the depths 20 - 40 and 40 - 60 cm. The water regime of these soils differed from that of the background automorphic natural soils and was characterized by periods of water stagnation at the boundary between the two layers. In the course of 20 years, this type of water regime resulted in the development of a columnar structure in the lower part of the chernozemic layer. The coatings on the ped faces in this part of the profile had an increased content of Fe and Ca ions. There was no differentiation of the carbon of organic substances and carbonates in the soil profile. Field studies of water flows in this soil based on starch label and laboratory experiments on infiltration of salt solutions though the soil columns with determination of breakthrough curves demonstrated the existence of preferential water flows in technozem. Rapid infiltration of water through preferential water paths in chernozemic layer after abundant rainfalls and during the snowmelt season leads to the development of perched water above the textural boundary. This preferential water and matter flows are generated along the faces of the peds and form the perched water layer on the sand. Such kind of water phenomenon with preferential flows and perched water table formation transforms the granular aggregates into columnar blocks by the temporary <b>gleyzation</b> process...|$|E
40|$|Following {{an initial}} {{study of a}} {{tropical}} lateritic hillside system showing little iron isotope fractionation despite a strong accumulation within the soil profile, the present work investigates iron isotope signatures within the organic matter rich swamp system that represents 20 % of the studied watershed surface (from Nsimi, South Cameroon). This study considers the soil-plant-water continuum {{in order to better}} understand the Fe elemental and isotopic transfer out of the ecosystem. Within the swamp system, the iron isotope compositions of gleysol samples (delta Fe- 57 (IRMM- 14) similar to+ 0. 6 parts per thousand) are significantly heavier than both the continental crust baseline and the reference lateritic soils from the hillslope (delta Fe- 57 (IRMM- 14) = + 0. 1 parts per thousand). This enrichment towards heavy isotopes is attributed to a preferential removal of light iron isotopes during soil forming processes. Pedogenic transformations (i. e., <b>gleyzation,</b> organic complexation of metal and leaching) are responsible for the reductimorphic features observed in ferralitic horizons (i. e., incomplete degradation of organic matter in surface and soil whitening favored by good draining conditions). The organic carbon-rich waters of the swamp system are prone to redox processes and strong metal chelation. The dissolved iron (i. e., fraction < 0. 22 mu m) of the Mengong stream shows positive delta Fe- 57 signatures, with a down-stream enrichment in heavy isotopes, from + 0. 511 +/- 0. 266 parts per thousand to + 1. 076 +/- 0. 240 parts per thousand. The binding of iron (Fe-III) with organic matter can explain the observed enrichment in heavy isotopes in the dissolved fraction. On the contrary, plant leaves are significantly enriched in light Fe (delta Fe- 57 of - 0. 665 +/- 0. 035 and - 1. 119 +/- 0. 080 parts per thousand) relative to (i) the litter compartment (- 0. 166 +/- 0. 078 to - 0. 262 +/- 0. 013 % for delta Fe- 57) and (ii) the most superficial soils. Iron isotopic compositions in plants and litter vary as a function of both plant species and season. Hence, the differences in Fe isotopic compositions between the various studied compartments suggest that Fe isotopes can be used (i) to study elemental transfers during soil pedogenesis in tropical environment and (ii) to better appraise and constrain iron biogeochemical cycle between surface horizon of soils, surface waters and the vegetation...|$|E
