40|$|For {{establishment}} of a general theory on the formation process of flood hydrographs in riverchannel networks, {{it will be one}} of the necessary things to grasp the statistical properties of struc-ture of a river basin geometry. From this point of view, statistical analysis of a river basin geometry was carried out mainlyto clarify the characteristics of the frequency distributions of planimetric properties of stream. Links, which are structural elements of a river basin geometry, for sub-basin of River Daido ofShiga Prefecture, Japan, using some other published data for comparison. The main results are as follows: 1) The characteristics of frequency distributions of plani-metric properties of interior links are clearly differs from those of exterior links. 2) The lognor-mal distribution fits the data of <b>exterior</b> <b>link</b> lengths and associated areas reasonably well. 3) The gamma or Weibull distribution fits the data of interior link lengths. 4) The Weibulldistribution may fit the data of interior associated areas. 5) Any known mathematical dis-tribution dose not fit the data of drainage densities and shape indices of links...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Empirical {{observations}} {{have established}} connections between river network geometry and various hydrophysical quantities of interest. Since rivers can be decomposed into basic components known as links, one {{would like to}} understand the physical processes at work in link formation and maintenance. The author develops a natural stochastic geometric model for this problem, for the particular type of <b>link</b> known as <b>exterior</b> <b>links.</b> In the model, the distribution of distance from a uniformly distributed point to a fixed graph is computed. This model yields an approximate expression for the distribution of length of <b>exterior</b> <b>links</b> that incorporates junction angles and drainage density, and compares favorably with observed length distributions. The author goes on to investigate related mathematical questions of independent interest, such as the case where the previously mentioned graph is itself a realization of a random process, {{and in so doing}} derives a formula for the first contact distribution of a general random Voronoi tesselation (also associated with the names of Dirichlet and Thiessen). Since this random tesselation is a natural starting point for modelling spatial processes {{in a wide variety of}} fields, these results should find immediate applications. It is also shown how these results can be interpreted as a generalization of a classical problem considered by Buffon...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of morphometric parameters of two drainage networks derived from different sources {{was done to}} {{determine the influence of}} sub-basins to flooding on the main channel in the Havran River basin (BalIkesir-Turkey). Drainage networks for the sub-basins were derived from both topographic maps scaled 1 : 25. 000 and a 10 -m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) using geographic information systems (GIS). Blue lines, representing fluvial channels on the topographic maps were accepted as a drainage network, which does not depict all <b>exterior</b> <b>links</b> in the basin. The second drainage network was extracted from the DEM using minimum accumulation area threshold to include all <b>exterior</b> <b>links.</b> Morphometric parameters were applied to the two types of drainage networks at sub-basin levels. These parameters were used to assess the influence of the sub-basins on the main channel with respect to flooding. The results show that the drainage network of sub-basin 4 -where a dam was constructed on its outlet to mitigate potential floods-has a lower influence morphometrically to produce probable floods on the main channel than that of sub-basins 1, 3, and 5. The construction of the dam will help reduce flooding on the main channel from sub-basin 4 but it will not prevent potential flooding from sub-basin 1, 3 and 5, which join the main channel downstream of sub-basin 4. Therefore, flood mitigation efforts should be considered {{in order to protect the}} settlement and agricultural lands on the floodplain downstream of the dam. In order to increase our understanding of flood hazards, and to determine appropriate mitigation solutions, drainage morphometry research should be included as an essential component to hydrologic studies. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The random {{topology}} model approximately predicts all orientation-free empirical laws of channel network planform. Explanation of the model’s {{success has}} crucial significance for research direction. Shreve [1975] proposed the explanation that random factors dominate network development. An alternative {{explanation is that}} these geomorphologic laws are insensitive to topologic variability. Kirchner [1993] tested {{the sensitivity of the}} Horton ratios to particular types of topologic distribution. We extend the work of Kirchner to all orientation-free empirical laws of channel network planform. We test the sensitivity of the topologic analog of each law using non–topologically random network test samples. One type of sample is obtained with the stochastic variableparameter “Q model ” of network growth, used as a test example, where the probability of tributary development on interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>links</b> is allowed to vary. We show that the coefficients of all channel network planform laws vary with model parameter Q. Itis possible that these laws are sensitive also to other models of network growth. We conclude that the success of the random model in approximately predicting geomorphologic laws may not be due to the insensitivity of these laws and is a result that remains unexplained. 1...|$|R

40|$|Three {{threshold}} {{conditions for}} channel initiation are evaluated by using gridded elevation data {{derived from a}} detailed lidar survey, a reliable algorithm for the determination of surface flow paths, and accurate field observations of channel heads for a study area located in the eastern Italian Alps. These three threshold conditions are determined by considering part of the observed channel heads and computing for them the related values of (1) the drainage area A, (2) the monomial area-slope function AS 2 of the drainage area A and the local slope S, and (3) the Strahler order ω* of surface flow paths extracted from gridded elevation data. Attention {{is focused on the}} dependence of the obtained threshold values on the size of grid cells involved, and on the ability of threshold conditions to predict channel heads. The results indicate that (i) the uncertainty in the threshold values of the Strahler order ω* is significantly smaller than that affecting the threshold values of the drainage area A and the area-slope function AS 2, (ii) threshold values of A, AS 2, and ω* are all significantly dependent on grid cell size, and (iii) the threshold values of the Strahler order ω* follow quite well a power function relationship of grid cell size. The comparison between predicted and observed channel heads, performed on three different drainage basins, indicates that Strahler classification of surface flow paths and pruning of <b>exterior</b> <b>links</b> provide a sound basis for the determination of channel heads formed essentially by surface erosion. In addition, it reveals that more comprehensive methods are needed to predict channel heads affected by groundwater seeping upwards in areas characterized by strong geologic controls...|$|R
