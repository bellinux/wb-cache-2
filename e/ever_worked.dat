5|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, released March 2013, Cudi confirmed he was working closely with ASAP Rocky, while also revealing Haim, an all-female indie rock band, would appear on the album on a song produced by high-profile American record producer Hit-Boy and himself. On April 2, 2013 Hit-Boy, claimed besides Cudi, {{he was the only}} other person to provide production on the album. Cudi later confirmed the statement via Twitter. Cudi and Hit-Boy had been working on the aforementioned song since January 2011. The track is also the first record the two of them <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> on together.|$|E
5|$|Throne of Fire was {{designed}} by Mike Singleton, known for designing other fantasy games such as Lords of Midnight, Doomdark's Revenge, and Dark Sceptre. It was developed under Consult Computer Systems, {{who worked on the}} programming, graphics, and music and was published by Melbourne House. Jim Bagley was given the position of programmer for the game, the first game he <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> on. The game was released in April 1987 on the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. A Commodore 64 port was also planned, but was never released.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other people were in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|E

25|$|In April 2005, Cotswold Rail {{acquired}} three locomotives, all {{of which}} had been out of service for a number of months. The fleet later grew to eight, and were intended to work charter trains, for spot-hire contracts and a new possible intermodal traffic flow. They were based at Oxley depot in Wolverhampton. However the fleet saw very little use; only two <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> a train (87007 and 87008), both having been repainted into Cotswold Rail livery, and in July 2006 the locomotives went off-lease.|$|E
25|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Haughmond {{was granted}} to Edward Littleton, who {{sold it to}} Sir Rowland Hill, the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London. Hill's heiress at Haughmond was his sister Elizabeth, who married John Barker. The {{resulting}} branch of the Barker family lived at Haughmond, using part of the monastic buildings. It seems that the Barkers acquired advowson of their local church, as a Mr Barker is named as his patron by Fisher in a letter. This was John's grandson, Walter Barker of Haughmond, High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1621 and a Parliamentarian {{from the beginning of}} the Civil War. Entries in CCEd indicate that Fisher was appointed as Rector of Upton Magna on 21 July 1635. This was recorded both in William Laud's Register and in the Liber cleri, recording Bishop Wright's visitation of 1639. The death and burial at Withington of the previous rector, Lawrence Lee, are recorded in the register, on 1 May and 10 May 1635 respectively. Bishop Wright's 1639 visitation found Thomas Blake serving as curate of Tamworth, Staffordshire, a post he had held since at least 1629, a year before Fisher's ordination. The word curate in this case was used to indicate a vicar, rector or other incumbent who had cure of souls, not an assistant minister, although it could be used equally well for either. The database gives no indication that Fisher <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> as an assistant to Blake, or that Blake <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> at Upton Magna, although such records can never be exhaustive. However, there is a record in the 1639 Liber cleri of an additional curate, Richard Drayton, in this case presumably an assistant to Fisher, at Upton Magna.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, {{until the}} age of 16. LaVey claimed he left high school to join a circus and later carnivals, first as a roustabout and cage boy in an act with the big cats, then as a musician playing the calliope. LaVey later claimed to have seen that many of the same men attended both the bawdy Saturday night shows and the tent revival meetings on Sunday mornings, which reinforced his increasingly cynical view of religion. In the foreword to the German language edition of The Satanic Bible, he cites this as the impetus to defy Christian religion as he knew it. He explains why church-goers employ double moral standards. Journalist Lawrence Wright investigated LaVey's background and found no evidence LaVey <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> in a circus either as a musician or a cage boy.|$|E

25|$|United Artists {{broke from}} this tradition. It was solely a {{distribution}} company, offering independent film producers {{access to its}} own screens {{as well as the}} rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded. After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.|$|E
25|$|The main cast were {{designed}} by manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima, {{who at the time}} was working on the long-running manga series Oh My Goddess!. Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff. There was resistance from Fujishima's editors due to his heavy work load, including his commitment to Oh My Goddess!. Sakura Wars was the first time Fujishima had <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> with Sega or been associated with a Sega property, and he was skeptical due to state the project was in when he was first approached, being in a very early stage of development before story or gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place {{at a time when it}} was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant that Fujishima would be character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project by the end of 1994, with his first design being for Sakura. His initial sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears, and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right person. The positive reception of Fujishima's work, together with his understanding for the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.|$|E
25|$|She had {{her first}} leading role in an American movie in James Gray's The Immigrant, {{starring}} as the Polish immigrant Ewa Cybulska, who wants to experience the American dream in 1920's New York, starring opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Jeremy Renner. James Gray wrote the movie especially for Cotillard after meeting her at a French restaurant with her boyfriend. Gray stated that Cotillard is the best actor he's <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> with. Cotillard had to learn 20 pages of Polish dialogue for her role. Her performance was widely acclaimed at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival where the film premiered. The Immigrant was released in the U.S. on May 2014, exactly one year after its Cannes premiere, and was highly praised by American critics, especially Cotillard's performance, which was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the National Society of Film Critics Award, the Toronto Film Critics Association Award and {{was nominated for a}} Spirit Award for Best Actress in 2015. She then co-starred in Guillaume Canet's Blood Ties, alongside Clive Owen, Billy Crudup and her Rust and Bone co-star Matthias Schoenaerts, the film premiering at Cannes in the same week that The Immigrant premiered. Cotillard also had a cameo in , acting opposite Jim Carrey as a Canadian anchor in the battle scene between rival news teams.|$|E
