50|$|The {{church of}} Saint George (Սուրբ Գեւորգ Եկեղեցի; {{pronounced}} Surp Gevork) is located centrally {{in the village}} of Garnahovit, Aragatsotn Province, Armenia. Its <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> dominates the surrounding village and landscape.|$|R
50|$|The Perry County Courthouse is a {{historic}} government building {{in the village of}} New Lexington, Ohio, United States. Built {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century after the end of a county seat war, it is the fifth courthouse to serve the citizens of Perry County, and it has been named {{a historic}} site because of its <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} finally {{acquired}} by Weston Homes Plc in 2014 {{who are now}} proud {{to be part of}} history and return Preston Hall back to the original residential use of the mansion, retaining many of the historical features to offer stunning spacious homes with <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> that combine history with all the facilities required for modern living.|$|R
25|$|The site in Sliema and the {{whereabouts}} saw major development during the Crown Colony of Malta, when British and Maltese developed the place from a fishing village to a vibrant town of differing architecture. The most prominent Maltese acquired plots in the whereabout {{of the current}} villa and built stately homes with <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture,</b> {{as a symbol of}} their position and for personal commodities.|$|R
5|$|The decorations were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with geometrical and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. The decorations were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> and decoration of Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader.|$|R
60|$|Long ago the haunt of rank, the Latin Quarter still retains {{many old}} {{buildings}} whose <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> singularly {{contrasts with the}} unassuming habits of their present occupants. In some parts its general air is dreary and dim; monastic and theurgic. In those lonely narrow ways--long-drawn prospectives of desertion--lined with huge piles of silent, vaulted, old iron-grated buildings of dark gray stone, one almost expects to encounter Paracelsus or Friar Bacon turning the next corner, with some awful vial of Black-Art elixir in his hand.|$|R
5|$|Due to its <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture,</b> Senate House {{is popular}} with the film and {{television}} industries as a shooting location; often for official buildings. Films that have featured the building include the 1995 version of Richard III (Interior of a government building), Nineteen Eighty-Four (Exterior of the Ministry of Truth where the main character, Winston Smith works), Blue Ice (a hotel), Spy Game (lobby of CIA Headquarters), Batman Begins (Lobby of a Court), The Dark Knight Rises (a costume ball), Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang (a war office) and Fast & Furious 6 (Moscow Interpol HQ).|$|R

50|$|Haraz is {{as famous}} for the beauty of its landscapes as for its {{fortified}} villages clinging to nearly inaccessible rocky peaks. Their <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> meets two needs, defending the villagers while leaving plenty of space for crops. Each town is built like a castle; the houses themselves form the wall, equipped {{with one or two}} easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are perfectly integrated into the landscape {{and it is difficult to}} tell where the rock and the village begins or ends. The mountain is divided into terraces of a few acres or more, separated by walls sometimes several meters high. On these remarkable terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and qat.|$|R

50|$|Isabella d’Aragona, {{princess of}} Naples and widow of the Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, {{enlarged}} the castle, which {{she made her}} residence, 1499-1524. After the death of Queen Bona Sforza, of Poland, Bari came {{to be included in}} the Kingdom of Naples and its history contracted to a local one, as malaria became endemic in the region. Bari was awakened from its provincial somnolence by Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. As Napoleonic King of Naples, Murat ordered the building in 1808 of a new section of the city, laid out on a rationalist grid plan, which bears his name today as the Murattiano. Under this stimulus, Bari developed into the most important port city of the region. The legacy of Mussolini can be seen in the <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> along the seafront.|$|R
50|$|The {{total cost}} {{incurred}} {{in the construction}} of this church was Rs. 91,000. The <b>imposing</b> <b>architecture</b> of this church is inspired by Magdalene College, Oxford. Above the main door of the church, situated in the west, is a tall tower which houses the church bell.The main design of the church was prepared by Mr. Ransom, but after he moved to England, the subsequent engineers made a few changes to the design. The tower was constructed a little shorter than it was originally intended and the side walls were also reduced in thickness and height, so that some savings could be done. The quadrangle of the church is also quite large and has seating areas made out of ply. The prominent feature of these seats is that every bench has a niche for keeping guns on the upper-back side.|$|R

50|$|In the 5th century BC, the Samnites conquered it (and all {{the other}} towns of Campania); the new rulers <b>imposed</b> their <b>architecture</b> and {{enlarged}} the town. After the Samnite Wars (4th century BC), Pompeii was forced to accept the status of socium of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy. In the 4th century BC, it was fortified. Pompeii remained faithful to Rome during the Second Punic War.|$|R
50|$|A {{process could}} {{allocate}} and use multiple extra data segments (XDS) {{of up to}} 64KB each. While the Classic <b>architecture</b> <b>imposed</b> a limit of 65,535 extra data segments system-wide, other limitations would usually restrict that to a somewhat smaller limit.|$|R
50|$|Instead, he {{appointed}} Palmer & Turner for another design. This second design {{was constructed in}} the Renaissance style of Scottish lodges and built between 1900 and 1902. The building was described by the media as the most <b>imposing</b> and handsome <b>architecture</b> on the Peak.|$|R
50|$|The lighthearted {{themes and}} {{intricate}} designs of Rococo presented themselves best {{at a more}} intimate scale than the <b>imposing</b> Baroque <b>architecture</b> and sculpture. It is not surprising, then, that French Rococo art was at home indoors. Metalwork, porcelain figures and especially furniture rose to new pre-eminence as the French upper classes sought to outfit {{their homes in the}} now fashionable style.Rococo style took pleasure in asymmetry, a taste that was new to European style. This practice of leaving elements unbalanced for effect is called contraste.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the open space}} of the Theresienwiese and the {{existing}} <b>imposing</b> and symbolic <b>architecture</b> were readily used for propagandistic staging, for example for the mass events connected with the pompous May Day celebrations which took place until the outbreak of World War II, as is evident in accounts written by the tightly controlled press.|$|R
25|$|The {{three top}} layers in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must <b>impose</b> monolithic <b>architecture</b> above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.|$|R
50|$|The Upper and Lower Pontalba Buildings, which {{line the}} St. Ann and St. Peter Street sides of Jackson Square, {{were built in}} 1850 by Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba, the {{daughter}} of Don Andres Almonaster y Rojas, the Spanish colonial landowner appointed to the Cabildo for life, and who built the Cathedral and Presbytere. Inspired by the <b>imposing</b> Parisian <b>architecture</b> the Baroness favored, the distinctive row houses were intended to serve as both elegant residences and fine retail establishments. In 1921 the Pontalba family sold the Lower Pontalba Building to philanthropist William Ratcliff Irby who subsequently, in 1927, bequeathed it to the State Museum.|$|R
