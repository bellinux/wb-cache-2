5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

But it's still called the Australian cricket team.|$|E
500|$|Rakim is {{credited}} with influencing rappers including the Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Nas, who cited Paid in Full {{as one of his}} favorite albums. 50 Cent told NME that Paid in Full was the first album he bought: [...] "I used to get my grandmother's tape recorder – the one she used to tape church services – and record hip-hop off the radio. And, with Eric B. & Rakim, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the first moment where I felt like, 'I've got to own this. This is crucial." ...|$|E

500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He {{once said to me}} that everything started to go wrong from [...] time on, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Wickson {{resigned}} and May {{retired from the}} USAF soon after Fogleman's investigation was completed. Lawrence Tracy retired immediately after Wang's court-martial on an early (15-year) retirement option. As of May 2005 Jim Wang was still serving in the USAF, but he remained at the rank of captain, having been denied promotion. Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, [...] "Jim (Wang) {{and all of us}} at first were held up as scapegoats. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill something because it had been ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis played {{through a}} {{shoulder}} injury early in the 1993 season. Defensive end Reggie White, who signed with the Green Bay Packers following the 1992 season after spending eight seasons with the Eagles and earned seven Pro Bowl selections, said that he believed he destroyed Davis' confidence as a rookie and second-year player, as Davis had to go up against White in practice every week. White said [...] "there are some guys who get very discouraged because they can't block you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the situation at times with Antone." [...] Davis, however, disputed White's statements as the Eagles played against the Packers in {{the second week of}} the season. Dave Goldberg, a writer for the Associated Press, named Davis to his [...] "all-" [...] team after his performance against White. Davis started in every game for the Eagles at right tackle in 1993.|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Rippy {{began writing}} {{music for the}} game in April 2007. [...] "Some of the plot points of Halo Wars revolve around discovery, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my {{favorite}} idea to write to—that sense of, 'no one's seen this before,'" [...] he said. The first two tracks combined repurposed elements from past projects with his efforts to convey the Halo sound. [...] "Flollo" [...] contained musical ideas Rippy had experimented with since his last project, [...] [...] "Bad Here Day" [...] was the first piece in which he tried to incorporate the [...] "Halo sound". Rippy felt it important to avoid repeating too many old themes because he wanted the game {{to have its own}} identity; however, he wanted to continue to incorporate choir and piano, elements he believed to be integral to the sound of previous Halo games. In adherence to an Ensemble Studios tradition, the tracks are often named after coined phrases and inside jokes, rather than in-game events.|$|E
500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{first meeting}} Lennon, Jim warned Paul {{that he would}} get him [...] "into trouble", {{although}} he later allowed The Quarrymen to rehearse in the dining room at Forthlin Road in the evenings. Jim was reluctant to let the teenage Paul go to Hamburg with The Beatles until Paul said the group would earn £15 per week each. As this was more than he earned himself, Jim finally agreed, but only after a visit from the group's then-manager, Allan Williams, who said that Jim should not worry. Jim was later present at a Beatles' concert in Manchester when fans surrounded drummer Pete Best, and ignored the rest of The Beatles. Jim criticised Best by saying, [...] "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> very selfish of you". Bill Harry recalled that Jim was probably [...] "The Beatles' biggest fan", and was extremely proud of Paul's success. Shelagh Johnson—later to become director of The Beatles' Museum in Liverpool—said that Jim's outward show of pride embarrassed his son. Jim enlisted Michael's help when sorting through the ever-increasing sacks of fan letters that were delivered to Forthlin Road, with both composing [...] "personal" [...] responses that were supposedly from Paul. Michael would later have success on his own with the group The Scaffold.|$|E
500|$|Best's {{popularity}} with fans {{was a source}} of friction, as many female fans considered him to be the band's best-looking member. Radio Merseyside presenter Spencer Leigh wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous. In the 31 August 1961 issue of Bill Harry's Mersey Beat music publication in Liverpool, Bob Wooler reported on the Beatles' local musical impact and singled out Best for special praise, calling the group [...] "musically authoritative and physically magnetic, example the mean, moody magnificence of drummer Pete Best – a sort of teenage Jeff Chandler." [...] During the Teenagers' Turn showcase in Manchester, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed. Afterwards, attentive females surrounded Best at the stage door, while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs. McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, was present at the time and admonished Best: [...] "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> very selfish of you". Lennon called the accusations of jealousy a [...] "myth," [...] and claimed that Best was recruited only because they needed a drummer to go to Hamburg, saying, [...] "We were always going to dump him when we found a decent drummer." ...|$|E

500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{family moved}} often {{as his father}} worked at jobs along the West Coast, {{although}} they did not move at all between 1940 and 1949. Settled in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each parent drove their own car. Clint attended Piedmont Junior High School. Shortly before he was to enter Piedmont High School, he rode his bike on the school's sports field and tore up the wet turf; this resulted in his being asked not to enroll. Instead, he attended Oakland Technical High School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores and scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, {{although it is not}} clear if he ever did. [...] "Clint graduated from the airplane shop. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> his major," [...] joked classmate Don Kincade. Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed [...] "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere." [...] "I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school," [...] explained Fritz Manes, a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s. Biographer Patrick McGilligan notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.|$|E

In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film The Christmas Wish, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in Dangerous Beauty, and provided some voice work for [...] She {{said in an interview}} in 2012, [...] "That really should not be on my résumé! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> early on in the day, when I was trying to beef up my résumé.

[...] In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.|$|E

500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like waiting around. But you know what? It's the easiest thing to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of}} the Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
