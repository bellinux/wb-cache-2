Sales totaled 24,660 units in 2015, consisting of 10,420 all-electrics and 14,190 plug-in hybrids. The {{rate of growth of}} the Japanese plug-in segment slowed down from 2013, with annual sales falling behind Europe, the U.S. and China during 2014 and 2015. The decline in plug-in car sales reflects the Japanese government and the major domestic carmakers decision to adopt and promote <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> instead of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Romm, {{the author}} of The Hype About Hydrogen (2005), devoted two {{articles}} in 2014 to updating his critique {{of the use of}} fuel cells in cars. He stated that FCVs still had not overcome the following issues: high cost of the vehicles, high fueling cost, and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure. [...] "It would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades." [...] Most importantly, he said, [...] "FCVs aren't green" [...] because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced, as 95% of it is, using the steam reforming process. He concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet [...] "either now or in the future."
