(Although Fairey had negotiated a license for the D-12, {{in the end it}} built no engines, with 50 engines being imported.)

[...] Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, Post Office. As a measure of respect for Martin's financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise owing to Martin's business acumen and editorial skills. [...] An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.|$|E
