However, {{as a result of the}} passage of Auditing Standard No. 5, which the SEC has since approved, external auditors are no longer required to provide an opinion on management's assessment of its own internal controls.|$|E

The first step {{on the road to the}} initial iteration of the code was the publication of the Cadbury Report in 1992.

The committee was formed in 1991 after Polly Peck, a major UK company, went insolvent after years of falsifying financial reports. Initially limited to preventing financial fraud, when BCCI and Robert Maxwell scandals took place, Cadbury's remit was expanded to corporate governance generally.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{increasing}} role of <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> in the fight against government sector fraud and financial mismanagement in Ghana, Africa. Using a Foucauldian-inspired theoretical framing, the paper explores the growing cases of fraud in the Ghanaian public sector and the technologies of government that have been enlisted to combat it. The paper also discusses the particular interests that are likely served by the push for financial audits as the preferred weapon for fighting government sector fraud in the country. Design/methodology/approach – The approach of the paper is qualitative involving the use of a variety of archival material and interviews with employees of the Ghana Audit Service, the Controller and Accountant-General's Department, and global agencies like the World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Findings – The paper finds that contrary to the view of “auditing as an alien phenomenon in most parts of the Third World, certainly Africa,” <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> is the preferred approach to fighting government sector fraud in Ghana. The paper also shows that <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> is privileged over other technologies of government, in this context, largely because it reinforces the hegemony of international development agencies like the World Bank and the imperialism of the big four accounting firms. Originality/value – The paper adds insight into the increasing role of <b>financial</b> <b>auditing</b> in the fight against government sector fraud and financial mismanagement in Ghana.
