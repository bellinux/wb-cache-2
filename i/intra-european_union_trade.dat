40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, European Union members have {{experienced}} {{a dramatic increase in}} imports. This increase was accompanied by a strong {{growth in the number of}} imported goods and trading partners, indicating positive welfare gains for consumers via an extended set of consumption possibilities, as pointed out in the "New Trade Theory". In this paper, we apply the methodology developed by Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006) to estimate structurally the gains from imported variety for the 27 countries of the European Union using highly disaggregated trade data at the HTS- 8 level from Eurostat for the period of 1999 to 2008. Our results show that, within the European Union, especially “newer” and smaller member states exhibit high gains from newly imported varieties. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of the gains from variety for consumers stem from <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>trade.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the year}} of 1999 a new {{monetary}} experiment commenced – {{the birth of the}} euro. Over the years more countries have joined the new currency and it was expected to be a continuously growing community. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to measure the effect of European membership, the currency of euro and the financial crisis on trade between the countries located in Europe. For the task of this paper the gravity model is used to study the bilateral trade flows in the European Union from 1995 - 2011. It additionally investigates, besides the correlation between GDP and distance, the effect of shared border, shared language and coastal access. The results showed that the euro did indeed have a positive impact on trade in the introduction year to later significantly have a negative impact on trade. Moreover, a membership in the European Union results showed to promote <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>trade</b> at the cost of extra-European Union trade and have its largest impact in the beginning and end of the study years. The conclusion is that other factors than increased trade were the main reasons to join the European Union, such as enhancing the role of Europe in the world market and to turn into a unified market. Finally, the effect of the financial crisis was found to have a negative impact on trade, concluded that it exposed the failures and lack of coordination between and within countries. It was also shown that the physical distance, and not specifically distances in i. e. social culture and languages, boosted the trade between countries...|$|E
30|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{properties}} of the productive structure of a region and national economies within the region. We use input–output data to calculate and compare input–output linkages and complex network measures of centrality to identify the most important sectors. We found that the most important sectors in each country are also the most important sectors in the European Union as a whole. Moreover, these sectors are the most <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>traded</b> goods and services. Finally, we computed the effect of a sectoral shock and its diffusion throughout the economy. We found that the most central sectors have the best diffusion of the effect of a shock and also a high aggregate impact in the economy. This gives evidence that centrality measures provided additional information that allowed to identified key sectors that have high linkages and good diffusion of effects. Therefore, the computation of centralities provides an alternative method to identify key sectors and formulate economic policies, complementing input–output analysis.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between environmental stringency and <b>intra–European</b> <b>Union</b> (EU) <b>trade</b> flows. Two main hypotheses are tested. First, we test whether the stringency of a country's environmental regulations may result in pollution havens. Second, we test whether the results differ by industry and by the EU membership tenure (EU- 15 vs. the newly added Central East European Countries). An augmented gravity model is estimated using panel data for 21 countries during the period from 1999 to 2013 for the full sample and also separately for the Central East European Countries and the EU- 15 members. Our results show weak support for the pollution haven hypothesis for some dirty industries, mainly for net exports from western EU countries to the rest. Instead, support for the “Porter hypothesis” is found for trade in clean goods.

Furthermore they argue that with increasing globalization, there is a greater need than ever for systematic analysis of the world's wine markets. This work will appeal to students enrolled in wine marketing and business courses, those studying industrial organization, and economists and other social scientists interested in case studies of globalization at work. As well, wine industry participants interested in understanding the reasons behind the recent dramatic developments in the industry will find this book of great value. BOOK JACKET. 1.

40|$|The book “The World’s Wine Markets - Globalization at Work” {{edited by}} Kym Anderson {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} global wine industry. The book has two primary components. The first evaluates trends in global wine production, consumption, and trade. The second evaluates these trends for major wine-producing and wine-consuming countries. The book offers {{a detailed analysis of}} the wine industry {{at the beginning of the}} XXI century focusing the factors that should influence the future direction of such industry, in the framework of an increasing complexity of the competitive scenario, as the geography of production and consumption is rapidly evolving. Indeed, the book including an in-depth look at the growth and impact of New World wine production on the Old World producers, reveals that between 1990 and 2001, the New World’s combined share of world wine exports grew from 4 to 18 per cent, or from 10 to 35 per cent when <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>trade</b> is excluded. Original essays, by economists from each of the major wine producing and consuming regions in the world, analyse recent developments and future trends, and conclude that globalization of the industry is set to continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore they argue that with increasing globalization, there is a greater need than ever for systematic analysis of the world’s wine markets. Inside the book, the chapter Italy (A. Corsi; E. Pomarici; R. Sardone) is structured in three parts. The first one offers a detailed view of the evolution of the Italian wine sector from 1970 to 2000. The second analyses the structure of the Italian wine sector, focusing wine-growing, winemaking and wine distribution and consumption. The third part analyses the international competitiveness of Italian wine sector; using the Traill and Pitts approach (1998) to the analysis of competitiveness in the food industry are identified the factors which determines the export performance and are outlined the condition for a further enhancement of competitiveness.

Growing numbers of posted workers, or <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> work migrants employed via transnational subcontractors, are segmenting the labour market, by competing with domestically domiciled workers whose employment is more tightly regulated. In Finland, the construction worker's union has had a far more assertive and successful approach to enforcing wage norms than the union in shipbuilding.

The geography of migration flows is changing, however. Mobile people will be increasingly attracted by faster-growing economies. Therefore, some traditional destinations in western Europe will face stronger competition for skilled labour-not least from countries like China where the working-age population will shrink after 2020.

In many respects, and counter-intuitively given the Brexit result, London has already become a “Eurocity”: a magnet for young people, both highly educated and less educated, from all over Europe who, especially {{since the turn of}} the millennium, have flocked to the city and its wider region to work, study, and play. Now, these erstwhile open-ended migration trajectories have been potentially disrupted by a referendum result that few anticipated, and whose consequential results are still unclear. The main theoretical props for our analysis are the notions of “liquid migration,” “tactics of belonging,” “whiteness,” “privilege,” and “affect. ” Data are drawn from 60 in-depth interviews with Irish, Italian, and Romanian young-adult students and higher and lower skilled workers, carried out in late 2015 and early 2016, plus 27 reinterviews carried out in late 2016, post-Brexit. Results indicate participants' profound and generally negative reaction to Brexit and, as a consequence, a diversity of uncertainties and of plans over their future mobility: either to stay put using “tactics of belonging,” or to return home earlier than planned, or to move on to another country. Finally, we find evidence that new hierarchies and boundaries are drawn between <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> migrants as a result of Brexit...|$|R

VAT is a tax levied on newly created value during the implementation process of goods or services. The tax is levied on the consumption thereof and the group of turnover taxes. The VAT model under Bulgarian law follows the common VAT regime within the EU model, where personal expenses are taxable by applying the credit (invoice) method. According to this method, each stage of production of goods or services and the implementation thereof to end users is chargeable with VAT on the entire value of the supply, such that through the mechanism of tax credit the final price of the goods or services includes a single VAT charge in the amount of the respective tax rate.A taxable person is any person who independently carries out an economic activity, whatever the purpose and results of that activity, as well as any person who performs accidental onerous <b>intra-European</b> <b>Union</b> supplies of new transport vehicles. „Independent economic activity” are the activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services, including mining and agriculture, as well as the practice of a liberal profession, including as private enforcement agents and notaries.|$|R
