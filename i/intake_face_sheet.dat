40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandwich plates used {{in marine}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} laminated <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> bonded to a structural foam core. Low-velocity impact by a stiff indenter may cause local deflection of the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and permanent deformation or crushing of an underlying volume of the foam core. Upon unloading, the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> tends to spring back, while the permanent strain in the core gives rise to residual stresses that may nucleate local interfacial cracks. Extension of such interfacial cracks by applied loads can compromise structural integrity. This article examines the protective effect of thin, ductile interlayers, inserted between the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and the foam core, that absorb the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> deflection and thus prevent or reduce the extent of damage to the foam core. Finite element solutions are obtained for a stiff, incompressible, and very ductile polyurethane (PUR) interlayer, and also for a compliant and compressible elastomeric foam (EF) layer, in a sandwich plate made of quasi-isotropic AS 4 / 3501 - 6 laminated <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and H 100 PVC core. Loading is applied by a concentrated force acting on a rigid cylindrical indenter. Results show that the PUR interlayer better supports the impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> than does the foam core or the EF interlayer. The PUR layer also reduces the extent of permanent deformation of the foam core. At a given magnitude of applied load, the energy release rate for cracks extended by residual stresses at the interface between the foam core and either interlayer is much lower than that at the interface between the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and the foam core in the conventional design.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} for predicting the in-plane compression strength of impact damaged sandwich structures. For developing these methods uniaxial in-plane compression tests of impact damaged unsymmetrical sandwich coupons are conducted. The specimens {{were made of}} two CFRP <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> of different thickness and an embedded honeycomb core. Low velocity impacts from 1 J up to 15 J caused varying amounts of core and <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage and {{a dent in the}} impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet.</b> While increasing the in-plane compression in the residual strength tests, the dent grew in depth and transverse to the loading direction until final failure of the impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> occurred. This phenomenological observation is reproduced in computational simulations. The simulations use either an efficient finite element model or a semi-analytical Ritz approach including non-linear displacement-strain relations and progressive damage growth in the core. For the latter stress-based failure criteria and stiffness degradation models are applied. Residual strength criteria are developed depending on the numerical solver. The comparison of simulation and test results demonstrates that the presented methods are able to predict the damage tolerance of unsymmetrical sandwich structures. For damages due a high-energy impact the simulations show that the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage has {{to be included in the}} model. Including the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage into the semi-analytical model increases the computational time tremendously. Therefore, the semi-analytical model should be used only for impact damages with negligible <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage. ...|$|R

Marine, automotive and aerospace industries are continually trying to optimize material performance {{in terms of strength}} and weight. Success has been achieved through the growth of high performance materials, including fibrous composites such as ceramics, new alloys, and carbon fiber composites and through the use of structural concepts such as sandwich composite panel construction.

The composite <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> exhibits a bilinear response, which results from the SiC matrix not being cracked on fabrication. In addition, the structure exhibits damage tolerance under impact with projectiles, showing no penetration to the back <b>face</b> <b>sheet.</b> These attributes make the composite ideal for leading edge structures and control surfaces in aerospace vehicles, {{as well as for}} acreage thermal protection systems and in high-temperature, lightweight stiffened structures. By tailoring the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of a carbon fiber containing ceramic matrix composite (CMC) <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> to match that of a ceramic foam core, the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> and the core can be integrally fabricated without any delamination. Carbon and SiC are woven together in the reinforcing fabric. Integral densification of the CMC and the foam core is accomplished with chemical vapor deposition, eliminating the need for bond-line adhesive. This means {{there is no need to}} separately fabricate the core and the <b>face</b> <b>sheet,</b> or to bond the two elements together, risking edge delamination during use. Fibers of two or more types are woven together on a loom. The carbon and ceramic fibers are pulled into the same pick location during the weaving process.

Results revealed that collapse of the multilayer beams is dominated by two basic modes: indentation (ID) and core shear (CS).

The failure of the sandwich beams depends on if the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> show ID mode in the multilayer beams or otherwise. If a multilayer beam is dominated by ID mode, the sandwich beams with similar <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and same core thickness would also show ID characteristic. If a multilayer beam fails fully by CS mode, no ID characteristic would appear in similar <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> single-core sandwiches. Beams failed by ID mode have a potential to consume more bending deformation energy than those dominated by CS mode.
