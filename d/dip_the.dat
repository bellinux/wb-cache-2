In 1917, <b>Dip</b> <b>the</b> Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, it is {{recommended}} to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> Sabbath bread in salt.|$|E

30|$|By simple {{numerical}} simulations, it {{was found}} that the maximum eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor points to a high-density causative body and that the minimum eigenvector points to a low-density causative body. In addition, {{it was found}} that <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> maximum eigenvector of the tensor closely follows <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> normal fault and that <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> minimum eigenvector closely follows <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> reverse fault.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{estimated}} fault <b>dip</b> {{would be}} <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> near <b>the</b> surface because the method employs the gravity gradient tensor, which {{is sensitive to}} subsurface structures near the surface. Since {{it is important to}} know quantitatively which depth <b>the</b> estimated fault <b>dip</b> is, in <b>the</b> future, it would be necessary to develop a technique estimating the depth of <b>the</b> estimated <b>dip</b> or <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> in <b>the</b> arbitrary depth.|$|R
30|$|In addition, it {{was found}} that <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> minimum {{eigenvector}} of the gravity gradient tensor gave <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> reverse fault. As to the reason why <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of reverse fault was given by the minimum eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor, I considered that {{the lower part of the}} boundary structure (fault) exists inside the high-density area more than its upper part. Namely, because this structure was considered a low-density body that intruded into the high-density layer, <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> reverse fault was given by <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> minimum eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor.|$|R

Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the <b>dip.</b> <b>The</b> clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to eat the}} challah or {{bread with}} salt, although the specific practice varies. Some <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> bread into salt before the blessing on bread.

A crash was averted by his <b>dip.</b> <b>The</b> officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{discovered}} and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used {{as a replacement for}} the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was to <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> meat in pyroligneous acid or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach did, or brush it over with them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.|$|E

It then joins the River Nene at Upton, west of Northampton. The Grand Union Canal and its Northampton arm, built in 1815 passes nearby. There is a marina just off the road to Gayton. There are 17 locks on the arm, taking the canal downhill into Northampton and to join the River Nene east of the town. It takes about two hours for a boat to travel through.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{his more}} notable oddities {{included}} a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and baked beans. Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day. He used to <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> tea bag in once, add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix, soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once spent every night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth, ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chewing gum}} {{can be traced}} back to civilizations around the world, the {{modernization}} and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States. The American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees. The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. In this way, the industrializing West, having forgotten about tree gums, rediscovered chewing gum through the First Americans. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax, which is a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. To sweeten these early gums the chewer would often make use of a plate of powdered sugar, which they would repeatedly <b>dip</b> <b>the</b> gum into to maintain sweetness. William Semple filed an early patent on chewing gum, patent number 98,304, on December 28, 1869.|$|E
25|$|Russia's {{mountain}} ranges are located principally along its continental <b>dip</b> (<b>the</b> Ural Mountains), along the southwestern border (the Caucasus), {{along the border}} with Mongolia (the eastern and western Sayan Mountains and the western extremity of the Altay Mountains), and in eastern Siberia (a complex system of ranges in the northeastern corner of the country and forming the spine of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and lesser mountains extending along the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan). Russia has nine major {{mountain ranges}}. In general, the eastern half of the country is much more mountainous than the western half, the interior of which is dominated by low plains. The traditional dividing line between the east and the west is the Yenisei River valley. In delineating {{the western edge of the}} Central Siberian Plateau from the West Siberian Plain, the Yenisey runs from near the Mongolian border northward into the Arctic Ocean west of the Taymyr Peninsula.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>dips</b> of {{boundaries}} in faults and caldera walls {{play an important}} role in understanding their formation mechanisms. <b>The</b> fault <b>dip</b> is a particularly important parameter in numerical simulations for hazard map creation as <b>the</b> fault <b>dip</b> affects estimations of the area of disaster occurrence. In this study, I introduce a technique for estimating <b>the</b> fault <b>dip</b> using <b>the</b> eigenvector of the observed or calculated gravity gradient tensor on a profile and investigating its properties through numerical simulations. From numerical simulations, it was found that the maximum eigenvector of the tensor points to the high-density causative body, and <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> maximum eigenvector closely follows <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> normal fault. It was also found that the minimum eigenvector of the tensor points to the low-density causative body and that <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> minimum eigenvector closely follows <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> reverse fault. It was shown that the eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor for estimating fault dips is determined by fault type. As an application of this technique, I estimated <b>the</b> <b>dip</b> of <b>the</b> Kurehayama Fault located in Toyama, Japan, and obtained a result that corresponded to conventional fault dip estimations by geology and geomorphology. Because the gravity gradient tensor is required for this analysis, I present a technique that estimates the gravity gradient tensor from the gravity anomaly on a profile.|$|R
