5|$|The Good Campaign opens {{after the}} Fellowship of the Ring has {{set out on}} their mission to unmake the One Ring of Power, with Elrond and Glóin {{planning}} the War in the North. The Elven hero Glorfindel discovers an impending attack on the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell. Thanks to the early warning, Elrond's forces in Rivendell manage to repel the Goblins' attacks. Following the battle, Elrond realizes that the Elves and Dwarves must join forces to purge the threat of Sauron's forces in the North. The next battle {{takes place in the}} Goblin capital of Ettenmoors, where the Goblin fortress is destroyed, and Gorkil the Goblin King is killed. After their victory, the heroes are informed that the Goblins, on Sauron's command, enlisted the service of a Dragon named Drogoth who <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> waste to the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. The heroes {{make their way to the}} Blue Mountains and help the Dwarven army defeat Drogoth and his Goblins.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E

5|$|The Crusader army under Goffredo <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> siege to Jerusalem, {{where the}} Saracen king Argante is {{confined}} with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings {{of the coming}} victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms {{that she will be}} Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly {{in a cell}} in a wax honeycomb, {{produced}} and shaped by the worker bees. Using her spermatheca, the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she <b>is</b> <b>laying,</b> usually depending on into which cell she <b>is</b> <b>laying.</b> Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with royal jelly produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and pupating.|$|E

The Chabahar port project is Iran's chance to end its US-sponsored economic isolation and benefit from the resurgent Indian economy. Along with Bandar Abbas, Chabahar is the Iranian entrepot on the North-South corridor. A strategic partnership between India, Iran and Russia is intended to establish a multi-modal transport link connecting Mumbai with St Petersburg, providing Europe and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia access to Asia and vice versa.|$|E

Inside the city, the Bastard of Orléans {{approaches}} Charles {{and tells}} him {{of a young woman}} who claims to have seen visions and knows how to defeat the English. Charles summons the woman, Joan la Pucelle, (i.e. Joan of Arc). To test her resolve, he challenges her to single combat. Upon her victory, he immediately places her in command of the army. Outside the city, the newly arrived Bedford negotiates the release of Talbot, but immediately, Joan launches an attack. The French forces win, forcing the English back, but Talbot and Bedford engineer a sneak attack on the city, and gain a foothold within the walls, causing the French leaders to flee.|$|E

25|$|After the Persian {{conquest of}} Egypt, the Persian {{commander}} in Egypt, Megabyzus, forces the Egyptians to fight as expendable soldiers in Xerxes armies. Inaros trains soldiers for the Persian army, but has {{never thought of}} rebellion because he knows the Persians are much stronger than the Egyptians. The only thing that gives him comfort is his lover Meritaton. However, when Megabyzus abducts Meritaton, Inaros is moved to begin a rebellion. As news of the rebellion spreads throughout Egypt, Megabyzus begins slaughtering innocent citizens. Inaros heads to Elbo to recruit the Nubians, and then to Libya to urge the Libyans to join him. After they pledge their support, word reaches Inaros that Leonidas has arrived in Egypt and <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> siege to Sais. Inaros aligns himself with Leonidas and the Spartans against the Persians, helping Leonidas conquer Sais, before heading to recruit more Egyptians into the rebellion, and arranging to meet the Greeks and Libyans near Memphis. After defeating a Persian force in Athribis, Inaros rescues Leonidas from a trap, and rendezvouses with the Libyans. Together, the Egyptians, Spartans and Libyans attack Memphis, killing Megabyzus. Inaros is reunited with Meritaton, as the Egyptians celebrate their freedom.|$|E

500|$|The vocalisations of emus mostly {{consist of}} various booming and {{grunting}} sounds. The booming {{is created by}} the inflatable throat pouch; the pitch can be regulated by the bird and depends {{on the size of}} the aperture. Most of the booming is done by females; it is part of the courtship ritual, is used to announce the holding of territory and is issued as a threat to rivals. A high-intensity boom is audible [...] away, while a low, more resonant call, produced during the breeding season, may at first attract mates and peaks while the male is incubating the eggs. Most of the grunting is done by males. It is used principally during the breeding season in territorial defence, as a threat to other males, during courtship and while the female <b>is</b> <b>laying.</b> Both sexes sometimes boom or grunt during threat displays or on encountering strange objects.|$|E

Phyllis Nagy's screenplay emphasises their steeliness and self-reliance. In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> bare the tensions {{in a society that}} refuses to acknowledge 'difference' of any sort." [...] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote: [...] "From its opening shots of the autumnal, rain-swept streets of New York sometime {{in the middle of the}} last century, director Todd Haynes’ magnificent new film [...] "Carol" [...] establishes a mood of mournful romance, half nostalgic and half ominous, that never lets go." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star said: [...] "Everything clicks into place for this gorgeous achievement. Cinematographer Ed Lachman shot on Super 16 mm film to achieve era-specific muted colours and softer textures. Precise production design and a palette steeped in shades of green and red (appropriate to the Yuletide setting) make watching it seem like stepping inside an Edward Hopper painting." [...] Mark Kermode wrote in The Guardian: [...] "This superb adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel The Price of Salt doesn't put a foot wrong. From Phyllis Nagy's alluringly uncluttered script to Cate Blanchett's sturdily tremulous performance as a society woman with everything to lose, this brilliantly captures the thrills, tears and fears of forbidden love." ...|$|E

The concept behind the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] revolves around Beyoncé leading a revolution. The video begins with quick shots of a desolate parking lot. Beyoncé then appears with a balaclava which she uses to cover her face up to the eyes. She is seen walking slowly towards the camera, as other people start joining her with flags and bats in their hands. Later in the video, she takes the mask off and the people surrounding her set [...] various objects on fire using Molotov cocktails, write graffiti on walls, and break a car. Beyoncé is later seen holding a man with a mask who <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> on the ground. The end of the video sees the protesting group facing a line of SWAT policemen.

500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who <b>is</b> <b>laying</b> on a table, apparently unconscious.
