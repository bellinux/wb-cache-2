50|$|The {{historical}} {{school of}} economics was an approach to academic economics and to public administration {{that emerged in the}} 19th century in Germany, and held sway there until well into the 20th century. The professors involved compiled massive <b>economic</b> <b>histories</b> of Germany and Europe. Numerous Americans were students. The school was opposed by theoretical economists. Prominent leaders included Gustav von Schmoller (1838-1917), and Max Weber (1864-1920) in Germany, and Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883-1950) in the United States.|$|R

Eurozone countries cannot devalue their currency.|$|E
5|$|Innis got {{his first}} taste of {{university}} teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22. Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and Anne (1933). Mary Quayle Innis was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, An <b>Economic</b> <b>History</b> of Canada, was published in 1935. Her novel, Stand on a Rainbow appeared in 1943. Her other books include Mrs. Simcoe's Diary (1965), The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times (1966) and Unfold the Years (1949), {{a history of the}} Young Women's Christian Association. She also edited Harold Innis's posthumous Essays in Canadian <b>Economic</b> <b>History</b> (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his Empire and Communications.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1920s, Lacour-Gayet was {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Revue des deux mondes, Revue de Paris, Revue d'histoire diplomatique, and L'Actualité économique, among other publications. In the United States, he contributed articles to the Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York and the American Journal of Economics and Sociology, as well as book reviews to the Catholic Historical Review. He was the author, co-author, or editor of nineteen books, ranging from <b>economic</b> <b>histories</b> of France to popular histories of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and the United States.|$|R

5|$|Born in North Sydney, New South Wales, Madgwick {{trained as}} a schoolteacher before {{attaining}} degrees in economics and <b>economic</b> <b>history</b> from the University of Sydney and University of Oxford. Appointed as a lecturer at the University of Sydney, Madgwick worked in the school's extension program which gave him experience and interest in adult education. With the onset of World War II, Madgwick and his colleagues proposed an adult education plan for the Australian Army. The government accepted the plan and, from 1941 to 1946, Madgwick served on active duty as Director of the Australian Army Education Service, which provided adult education services to the Army's 250,000 members during the conflict.|$|E

However, areas of Deptford are being gradually re-developed and gentrified - and the local council has plans to regenerate the riverside and the town centre. A large former industrial site by the Thames called Convoys Wharf is scheduled for redeveloping into mixed use buildings. This will involve the construction of around 3,500 new homes and {{an extension of the}} town centre northwards towards the river.|$|E
5|$|The Icelandic {{financial}} crisis {{was a major}} economic and political event in Iceland that involved the default of {{all three of the}} country's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008, following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in <b>economic</b> <b>history.</b> The crisis led to a severe economic depression in 2008–2010 and significant political unrest.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} degree would {{consist of}} courses not only in agricultural economics, but also agriculture, land economics, farm management, rural sociology, statistics, mathematics, <b>economic</b> <b>history,</b> and economic policy. After a delay spent obtaining funding for the new program, the faculty was established and began instruction in March 1958. Between 1960 and 1985, 450 students graduated from the program. In 1980, the Commonwealth government named New England as a Key Centre for Advanced Training in Agricultural Economics.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{also made}} {{a variety of other}} {{contributions}} in <b>economic</b> <b>history,</b> as well as economic theory and methodology. Weber's analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the Frankfurt School. After the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the <b>economic</b> <b>history</b> of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General <b>Economic</b> <b>History</b> (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E
