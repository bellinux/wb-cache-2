5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> down MiGs.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

500|$|The {{team was}} formed in August 1995 when Scott Antol signed a WCW {{contract}} and was placed with [...] "tag team specialist" [...] Marcus Alexander Bagwell. In the process, both men changed their ring names, Antol changing his last name to [...] "Riggs" [...] and Bagwell shortening his name to simply Marcus Bagwell. Once together, they both wore short shorts and leather vests [...] (later wrestling tights and suspenders) to the ring and began clapping their hands over their head in time with their entrance music, which sang their praises between choruses of the team name being repeated over and over. They wrestled on the first episode of Nitro, defeating World Tag Team Champions Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck in a non-title match. [...] Their first major appearance together came at the Fall Brawl pay-per-view, where they defeated The Nasty Boys in a match that aired on Main Event. Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine stated that the team [...] "work well as a unit and could soon challenge for the belts". Bagwell commented on the team in a scripted interview, saying that he believed that his previous tag teams had failed because they were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> win the title belts and {{that he planned to}} work slowly toward a title victory with Riggs.|$|E

2500|$|The first nonindigenous person {{recorded}} as visiting {{the region was}} Lt. John Murray, who commanded the brig [...] After anchoring outside Port Phillip Heads (the narrow entrance to Port Phillip, onto which both Geelong and Melbourne now front), on 1 February 1802, he sent a small boat with six men to explore. Led by John Bowen, they explored the immediate area, returning to the Lady Nelson on 4 February. On reporting favourable findings, the Lady Nelson entered Port Phillip on 14 February, and did not leave until 12 March. During this time, Murray explored the Geelong area and, whilst {{on the far side}} of the bay, claimed the entire area for Britain. He named the bay Port King, after Philip Gidley King, then Governor of New South Wales. Governor King later renamed the bay Port Phillip after the first governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip. Arriving not long after Murray was Matthew Flinders, who entered Port Phillip on 27 April 1802.

2500|$|Harry and the Potters is the eponymous debut studio album by indie {{rock band}} Harry and the Potters, {{released}} on 21 June 2003. The album {{was inspired by}} the first four novels in the Harry Potter book series. It has been released on CD and digital download. In April 2003, the brothers wrote an entire album's worth of songs. The brothers split songwriting responsibilities between the two of them: Joe was responsible for songs dealing with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, whereas Paul was responsible for songs dealing with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and the Potters was recorded [...] at the DeGeorge Family Living Room in Massachusetts. According to Melissa Anelli, Paul wrote the majority of the instrumental tracks on his Casio keyboard, whereas Joe conceptualized most of the vocal tracks. Vocalist Paul DeGeorge later said, [...] "We were pretty much writing songs and then recording them on the spot". This statement emphasizes the band's do-it-yourself amateurishness as an essential aspect of the album. In recording Harry and the Potters, the band aimed to release the album shortly before the fifth book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released. According to Paul, [...] "We were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> get that stuff done before the 5th book release" [...] and this instinct supports claims it took only two weekends to record the album. Despite the band's purported rush to finish the album, Paul and Joe worked particularly hard on the song [...] "These Days are Dark." [...] Paul DeGeorge used $1,200 of his own money to finance the pressing of the CDs.|$|E
2500|$|Lobelia (Bracegirdle) Sackville-Baggins: (2918–3020) The {{daughter}} of Blanco Bracegirdle and Primrose Boffin (a distant relation of Bilbo Baggins). She married Otho Sackville-Baggins (Bilbo's cousin) {{and had an}} only child, Lotho (b. 2964). Portrayed as unpleasant and grasping, Lobelia was {{from an early age}} an active adherent of the Sackville-Bagginses' ambition to acquire the manor smial of Bag End and its contents. Their first attempt had been made in 2942, when Bilbo was absent on the Quest of Erebor, and presumed dead. At that time Lobelia was not yet married into the Sackville-Bagginses [...] (she was 24, too young for a Hobbit to wed). Nonetheless she seems to {{have been involved in the}} disappearance of Bilbo's silverware, discovered by Bilbo on his unexpected return. Many years later Bilbo invited Lobelia to his Farewell Party (indeed she and her family were among his 144 special guests), but he gave Lobelia a box of silver spoons labelled [...] "For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo, as a present." [...] After a further 17 years, in which time her husband Otho died, Lobelia finally obtained Bag End when Frodo sold it to her (either for a great profit or below fair market value - accounts vary), as he was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> leave the Shire with the One Ring. A shift in Lobelia's character occurs when Frodo is away on his quest. Lobelia opposed Saruman's ruffians, verbally and physically, and was imprisoned in the Lockholes of Michel Delving for her actions. This feat earned her popularity among the Shire-folk for the first time in her life. Freed after the Scouring of the Shire but greatly weakened, Lobelia deeded Bag End back to Frodo, ending the generation-long feud between Bilbo and Frodo and the Sackville-Bagginses. Devastated by her son Lotho's murder, Lobelia moved back with her original family, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. She died in 3020, and was over 100 years old. [...] She bequeathed what remained of her money to helping hobbits made homeless during Saruman's regime.|$|E

60|$|There {{is in the}} Midlands a {{single-line}} tramway {{system which}} boldly leaves the county town and plunges off into the black, industrial countryside, up hill and down dale, through the long ugly villages of workmen's houses, over canals and railways, past churches perched high and nobly over the smoke and shadows, through stark, grimy cold little market-places, tilting away in a rush past cinemas and shops down to the hollow where the collieries are, then up again, past a little rural church, under the ash trees, on <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the terminus, the last little ugly place of industry, the cold little town that shivers {{on the edge of}} the wild, gloomy country beyond.

6000|$|On Christmas Day {{the gentleman}} who tells the tale in a {{scientific}} journal created some sensation at the breakfast-table by solemnly asserting {{that he had seen}} the ghost. Most of the men present scouted his story, which may be condensed into a few words. He had retired to his bedroom at a fairly early hour, and as he opened the door his candle-light was blown out. He tried to get a light from the fire, but it was too low, and eventually he went to bed in the semi-darkness. He was wakened--he did not know at what hour--by the clanging of a bell. He sat up in bed, and the ghost-story came <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> his mind. His fire was dead, and the room was consequently dark; yet by and by he knew, though he heard no sound, that his door had opened. He cried out, [...] "Who is that?" [...] but got no answer. By an effort he jumped {{up and went to the}} door, which was ajar. His bedroom was on the first floor, and looking up the stairs he could see nothing. He felt a cold sensation at his heart, however, when he looked the other way. Going slowly and without a sound down the stairs, was an old man in a dressing-gown. He carried a candle. From the top of the stairs only part of the hall is visible, but as the apparition disappeared the watcher had the courage to go down a few steps after him. At first nothing was to be seen, for the candle-light had vanished. A dim light, however, entered by the long, narrow windows which flank the hall door, and after a moment the on-looker could see that the hall was empty. He was marvelling at this sudden disappearance of the steward, when, to his horror, he saw a body fall upon the hall floor within a few feet of the door. The watcher cannot say whether he cried out, nor how long he stood there trembling. He came to himself with a start as he realized that something was coming up the stairs. Fear prevented his taking flight, and in a moment the thing was at his side. Then he saw indistinctly that it was not the figure he had seen descend. He saw a younger man, in a heavy overcoat, but with no hat on his head. He wore on his face a look of extravagant triumph. The guest boldly put out his hand toward the figure. To his amazement his arm went through it. The ghost paused for a moment and looked behind it. It was then the watcher realized that it carried a pistol in its right hand. He was by this time in a highly strung condition, and he stood trembling lest the pistol should be pointed at him. The apparition, however, rapidly glided up the stairs and was soon lost to sight. Such are the main facts of the story, none of which I contradicted at the time.|$|E
