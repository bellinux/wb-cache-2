40|$|This study reports evolved {{resistance}} to <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> {{in a population}} of sprangletop from a rice field in Thailand (BLC 1). After eight applications of <b>fenoxaprop-P,</b> the herbicide appeared no longer effective. To confirm herbicide resistance in the BLC 1 population, three experiments were conducted. First, glasshouse experiments revealed that the BLC 1 population survived 600 g ai ha- 1 of <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> without visual injury. Second, the BLC 1 population was treated with <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> and other acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicides (quizalofop-P, cyhalofopbutyl, and profoxydim) under field conditions; BLC 1 exhibited {{resistance to}} all of these herbicides. Third, seeds of susceptible SLC 1 and resistant BLC 1 were germinated on 0. 6 % (v/v) agar across a range of herbicide concentrations. The resistant BLC 1 population exhibited 61 -, 44 -, 9 - and 8 -fold resistance to <b>fenoxaprop-P,</b> cyhalofop, quizalofop-P, and profoxydim, respectively, compared with a susceptible SLC 1 population. At the enzyme level, ACCase from the resistant BLC 1 exhibited 30, 24, 11, 4, and 5 times resistance to fenoxaprop, cyhalofop-butyl, haloxyfop, clethodim, and cycloxydim, respectively. The spectrum of resistance at the whole plant level correlated well with resistance at the ACCase level. Hence, the mechanism of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in this biotype of sprangletop is a herbicide-resistant ACCase. The specific mutation(s) of the ACCase gene that endows resistance in this population remains to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the dose response of some grass weeds of wheat fields to different <b>Fenoxaprop-p</b> ethyl formulations, field experiments were conducted in Khouzestan, Golestan and greenhouse experiments were conducted in Tehran, during 2003 - 2004. Experimental factors were three formulations of <b>Fenoxaprop-p</b> ethyl (Golsam, Giya and Bieser feld), each applied at four doses (0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 8 L/ha). Dose response curves of the percent of reduction in number of weeds and their dry weight compared to the untreated control were fitted. Weed floras included winter wild oat (Avena ludoviciana Dur.), canary grass (Phalaris minor Retz.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in Khouzestan, and the same weed flora but less canary grass in Golestan and winter wild oat in the greenhouse study. Results {{indicated that there was}} no significant difference between Giya and Bieser feld formulations. The efficacy of these formulations was better than Golsam. Also, the reduction in dry weight of narrow leaf weeds was similar in field studies but not in greenhouse study. Dose response of narrow leaf weeds to all <b>Fenoxaprop-p</b> ethyl formulations was not satisfactory at the recommended dose (1 L/ha) indicating that this herbicide should be applied at higher doses or be replaced with another narrow leaf herbicide like Clodinafop-propargil...|$|E
40|$|Black-grass is {{a common}} grass weed, widely spread in Northern Europe and also in Belgium. For ages, {{it has been an}} {{increasing}} problem in industrial crops, especially winter cereals. Therefore, farmers started to spray herbicide intensively and soon cases of failure occurred for different molecules and different modes of action. Black-grass populations have been tested in greenhouses to assess the influence of an herbicide treatment as to the resistance level regarding three different herbicides: chlortoluron, <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> and mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron. Black-grass seeds were collected in field trials in six locations in Belgium, on individuals which have survived the herbicide treatment. Each population comes from trial plots, measuring 2 meters wide by 5 meters long and characterized by a single or a combination of products. Herbicides sprayed were isoproturon, flufenacet+diflufenican, ACCase inhibitors and ALS inhibitors. Seeds were also collected in the untreated plots. The population present in these last ones corresponds to the former population, before the herbicide selection pressure was applied. In the glasshouse assay, this population was used as the standard population to compare with other populations issued from the same field. The 'R' rating system was set up with this population to assess the evolution of resistance level, year in, year out. Rothamsted and Peldon populations were also included as cross-reference. Each field population presented different behaviours towards herbicide applied in greenhouses and some cases of resistance can be highlighted. Generally, a reduction of treatment efficiency between field and greenhouse results was clearly visible for the whole of studied active ingredients. Indeed, a distribution shift of the populations towards higher resistance classes could be observed. This is particularly remarkable for active ingredients sharing the same mode of action. For example, it has been found that populations already sprayed with <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> on the field showed a higher resistance level to <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> than to mesosulfuron in the greenhouse test.

40|$|The {{impact of}} various {{herbicide}} strategies on populations of Alopecurus myosuroides is investigated in a longterm field trial situated in Wendhausen (Germany) since 2009. In the initial {{years of the}} field experiment, resistant populations were selected by means of repeated application of the same herbicide active ingredients. For the selection of different resistance profiles, herbicides with actives from different HRAC groups were used. The herbicide actives flupyrsulfuron, isoproturon und <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> were applied for two years on large plots. In a succeeding field trial starting in 2011, it was investigated if the now existing resistant field populations could be controlled by various herbicide strategies. Eight different strategies consisting of various herbicide combinations were tested. Resistance evolution was investigated by means of plant counts and molecular genetic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Underseeding {{red clover}} in winter wheat is a {{beneficial}} agronomic practice. Still, many growers tend to forgo this approach. One {{reason is that}} herbicides used on winter wheat may injure un-derseeded red clover, reducing its biomass and the subsequent benefits it provides. Therefore, the effect of winter wheat herbicides on underseeded red clover needs to be evaluated. The objectives of this research were to assess the crop tolerance of underseeded red clover to ten winter wheat herbicides used in Ontario, Canada and determine if red clover tolerance differed when the herbi-cides were applied at various winter wheat growth stages. Experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 at four different Ontario locations. Each herbicide treatment was either applied at an early, normal or late timing. Overall, red clover was not affected by herbicides applied at the early timing. The likelihood of herbicides causing injury and reducing biomass of underseeded red clover increased when they were applied at the more advanced winter wheat growth stages. If timing is a constraint, the three herbicides bromoxynil/MCPA, tralkoxydim, and <b>fenoxaprop-p...</b>|$|E
40|$|Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important weeds in Europe. Because of the development and distribution of herbicide resistant populations the control of this weed has become a serious challenge in agriculture. In recent years a reduced efficacy of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl towards A. myosuroides has been observed. To investigate the degradation of the active substance fenoxaprop-P-ethyl in A. myosuroides, four populations were grown in the greenhouse: One herbicide sensitive population, two populations with a non-target-site resistance (NTSR) and one population with a target-site resistance (TSR). For dose response studies the plants were treated with different dosages of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and dry weight was determined after three weeks. For the NTSR populations resistance factors of 76 and 2 could be calculated based on ED 50 values. The development of the TSR plants was not restricted by the herbicide treatment, not even with the highest dosage. For the degradation and metabolism studies plants were treated with fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and harvested for laboratory analysis 2, 8, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment. The active substance degraded within 96 hours without any significant differences between the populations. Two hours after herbicide treatment a metabolite could be identified and quantified in all populations. The mean contents at eight and 24 hours after treatment differed significantly between the populations. Results have shown that the metabolism of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl to <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> is very similar in the tested populations although they have different resistance mechanisms. Further studies are intended to show if the populations differ in the formation of other unknown metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} {{is the result}} of an evolutionary process where a population gradually changes from being susceptible to being resistant to an herbicide. The resistance mechanism is usually a change in the biochemistry of the weed, but in some cases changes in morphology or growth rhythm. The change is caused by random mutations. Two resistance mechanisms are found in black-grass; target site resistance and metabolic resistance. Black-grass is a tufty, winter annual grass weed, which is mainly found in milder climates. Black-grass is a big problem in Southern Europe. In Sweden, it has its main extension in Skåne, Öland and Gotland. Herbicide {{resistance is}} increasing on a global level, especially in farming systems that strongly rely on chemical spraying. Four major factors affecting the build up of resistance are; length of life cycle, spreading, methods of weed control and also the seed bank in the soil. Integrated weed management is required for long-term control of black-grass. A varied chemical spraying should be complemented by other methods, e. g. in crop rotation and tillage methods, increased mechanical methods, clean machines etc. It’s important to alternate between different modes of action, since one reason for increased resistance is that the same herbicide or a few modes of action recurs frequently. There are several methods for testing herbicide resistance. This thesis includes a germination test in petri dishes. Four herbicide from different herbicide groups are tested in seven populations of black-grass, from three different countries. The experiment is a part of a comparative study between laboratories in several Nordic and Baltic countries. The evaluation of the test includes three methods; visual assessment of the coverage, frequency of the number of shoots over 1 cm and a dry matter test. The herbicides are; <b>fenoxaprop-P</b> (in the herbicide Event Super), cycloxydim (Focus Ultra), sulfometuron (Oust) and pendimethalin (Stomp). The result matched with the expected resistance level for some of the populations and herbicides, but not for all. This may be due to experimental mistakes. A repeating of the test would be optimal, to secure more accurate conclusions about the robustness of the test. Through this work I {{have come to the conclusion}} that it’s difficult to find a robust and fast method to detect metabolic resistance. Seed tests to detect target site resistance are often good, but as metabolic resistance usually occurs later in plant development, dose-response-tests in pots are preferred...|$|E
