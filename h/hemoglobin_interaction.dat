The first use of computers was in a study on <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>interaction</b> in sickle-cell fibres. This was followed in 1978 by work on the trypsin-BPTI complex. Computers discriminated between good and bad models using a scoring function which rewarded large interface area, and pairs of molecules in contact but not occupying the same space. The computer used a simplified representation of the interacting proteins, with one interaction centre for each residue. Favorable electrostatic interactions, including hydrogen bonds, were identified by hand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>interaction</b> of <b>hemoglobin</b> with {{phospholipid}} bilayer vesicles (liposomes) {{has been}} analyzed in several studies {{to better understand}} membrane–protein interactions. However, not much is known on <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>interactions</b> with the aminophospholipids, predominantly localized in the inner leaflet of erythrocytes, e. g., phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC). Effects of cholesterol, largely abundant in erythrocytes, have also not been studied in great details in earlier studies. This work therefore describes {{the study of the}} <b>interactions</b> of different <b>hemoglobin</b> variants HbA, HbE and HbF and the globin subunits of HbA with the two aminophospholipids in the presence and absence of cholesterol. Absorption measurements indicate preferential oxidative interaction of HbE and alpha-globin subunit with unilamellar vesicles containing PE and PS compared to normal HbA. Cholesterol was found to stabilize such oxidative interactions in membranes containing both the aminophospholipids. HbE and alpha-globin subunits were also found to induce greater leakage of membrane entrapped carboxyfluorescein (CF) using fluorescence measurements. HbE was found to induce fusion of membrane vesicles containing cholesterol and PE when observed under electron microscope. Taken together, these findings might be helpful in understanding the oxidative stress-related mechanism(s) involved in the premature destruction of erythrocytes in peripheral blood, implicated in the hemoglobin disorder, HbE/beta-thalassemia...|$|R

They have appeared under the form of hemoglobin variants or thalassemias, the variant types S and C and the alpha and beta thalassemias being more common, {{all of them in}} heterozygote form.

The goal {{of the present study was}} to verify which abnormal hemoglobin types show greater diagnostic difficulty. The samples came from 24 cities in twelve states.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the intermolecular interactions of oxygenated sickle hemoglobin molecules in cells and in cell-free solutions, and have compared the results with similar data for liganded normal adult hemoglobin. The experiments involve {{the measurement of}} the spin-lattice relaxation time T 1 of protons of solvent water molecules, {{as a function of}} an externally applied static magnetic field. From such data, one can derive a correlation time tauc, for each sample, which {{is a measure of the}} time taken for a hemoglobin molecule to randomize its orientation due to Brownian motion. Thus tauc is a measure of the freedom of rotational motion, on a molecular or microscopic level, of <b>hemoglobin</b> molecules. Intermolecular <b>interactions</b> will reduce this freedom of motion and lengthen tauc. We find that oxygenated sickle hemoglobin molecules have an additional intermolecular interaction not found for normal <b>hemoglobin.</b> This extra <b>interaction</b> is increased by the presence of either inorganic phosphate or diphosphoglycerate, and is greater for sickle hemoglobin within cells than in cell-free solutions. By comparing the present results with published data on the viscosity of oxygenated sickle and normal hemoglobin, we conclude that, at concentrations comparable to intracellular values, oxygenated sickle hemoglobin molecules form aggregates several tetramers in size. The possibility exists that these aggregates are the earliest stage of fiber formation itself, the physical basis of the sickling phenomena...|$|R

40|$|An {{enhanced}} hemoglobin–membrane {{association has}} been previously documented in sickle cell anemia. However, {{it is not known}} how this interaction is modified during the hemoglobin S polymerization process. In this work, we use a model of reconstituted erythrocytes from ghost membranes whose cytoskeleton proteins had been previously labeled with the 4 -maleimido Tempo spin label, and that were subsequently resealed with hemoglobin S or A solutions. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the time dependence of the spectral W/S parameter, indicative of the conformational state of cytoskeleton proteins (mainly spectrin) under spontaneous deoxygenation, with the aim of detecting the eventual effects due to hemoglobin S polymerization. The differences observed in the temporal behavior of W/S in erythrocytes reconstituted with both hemoglobins were considered as experimental evidence of an increment in <b>hemoglobin</b> S–membrane <b>interaction</b> {{as a result of the}} polymerization process of hemoglobin S under spontaneous deoxygenation.

40|$|A {{precise and}} rapid {{procedure}} employing gel filtration on Superose- 12 {{to measure the}} tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of some natural and recombinant hemoglobins in the oxy conformation is described. Natural sickle hemoglobin was chosen to verify {{the validity of the}} results by comparing the values with those reported using an independent method not based on gel filtration. Recombinant sickle hemoglobin, as well as a sickle double mutant with a substitution at the Val- 6 (beta) receptor site, had approximately the same dissociation constant as natural sickle hemoglobin. Of the two recombinant hemoglobins with amino acid replacements in the alpha 1 beta 2 subunit interface, one was found to be extensively dissociated and the other completely dissociated. In addition, the absence of an effect of the allosteric regulators DPG and IHP on the dissociation constant was demonstrated.

40|$|AbstractHemoglobin A (HbA), {{the oxygen}} {{delivery}} system in humans, comprises two α and two β subunits. Free α-hemoglobin (αHb) is unstable, and its precipitation {{contributes to the}} pathophysiology of β thalassemia. In erythrocytes, the α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds αHb and inhibits its precipitation. The crystal structure of AHSP bound to Fe(II) -αHb reveals that AHSP specifically recognizes the G and H helices of αHb through a hydrophobic interface that largely recapitulates the α 1 -β 1 interface of <b>hemoglobin.</b> The AHSP-αHb <b>interactions</b> are extensive but suboptimal, explaining why β-hemoglobin can competitively displace AHSP to form HbA. Remarkably, the Fe(II) -heme group in AHSP bound αHb is coordinated by the distal but not the proximal histidine. Importantly, binding to AHSP facilitates the conversion of oxy-αHb to a deoxygenated, oxidized [Fe(III) ], nonreactive form in which all six coordinate positions are occupied. These observations reveal the molecular mechanisms by which AHSP stabilizes free αHb...|$|R

40|$|Objective— We {{investigated}} whether {{red cell}} infiltration of atheromatous lesions promotes the later stages of atherosclerosis. Methods and Results— We find that oxidation of ferro (FeII) hemoglobin in ruptured advanced lesions occurs generating ferri (FeIII) hemoglobin and via more extensive oxidation ferrylhemoglobin (FeIII/FeIV=O). The protein oxidation marker dityrosine accumulates in complicated lesions, {{accompanied by the}} formation of cross-linked hemoglobin, a hallmark of ferrylhemoglobin. Exposure of normal red cells to lipids derived from atheromatous lesions causes hemolysis and oxidation of liberated <b>hemoglobin.</b> In the <b>interactions</b> between <b>hemoglobin</b> and atheroma lipids, hemoglobin and heme promote further lipid oxidation and subsequently endothelial reactions such as upregulation of heme oxygenase- 1 and cytotoxicity to endothelium. Oxidative scission of heme leads to release of iron and a feed-forward process of iron-driven plaque lipid oxidation. The inhibition of heme release from globin by haptoglobin and sequestration of heme by hemopexin suppress hemoglobin-mediated oxidation of lipids of atheromatous lesions and attenuate endothelial cytotoxicity. Conclusion— The interior of advanced atheromatous lesions is a prooxidant environment in which erythrocytes lyse, hemoglobin is oxidized to ferri- and ferrylhemoglobin, and released heme and iron promote further oxidation of lipids. These events amplify the endothelial cell cytotoxicity of plaque components...|$|R
