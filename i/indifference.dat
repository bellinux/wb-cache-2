40|$|Global COE Program Math-for-Industry Education & Research HubグローバルCOEプログラム「マス･フォア･インダストリ教育研究拠点」In two-sided {{matching}} markets, {{the concept}} of stability proposed by Gale and Shapley (1962) {{is one of the}} most important solution concepts. In this paper, we consider a problem related to the stability of a matching in a two-sided matching market with <b>indifferences</b> (i. e., ties). The introduction of ties into preference lists dramatically changes the properties of stable matchings. For example, stable matchings need not have the same size. Furthermore, it is known that stability do not guarantee Pareto efficiency that is also one of the most important solution concepts in two-sided matching markets. This fact naturally leads to {{the concept of}} Pareto stability, i. e., both stable and Pareto efficient. Erdil and Ergin (2006, 2008) proved that there always exists a Pareto stable matching in a one-to-one/many-to-one matching market with <b>indifferences</b> and gave a polynomial-time algorithm for finding it. Furthermore, Chen (2012) proved that there always exists a Pareto stable matching in a many-to-many matching market with <b>indifferences</b> and gave a polynomial-time algorithm for finding it. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the problem of finding a Pareto stable matching in a many-to-many matching market with <b>indifferences.</b> Our algorithm is an alternative proof of the existence of a Pareto stable matching in a many-to-many matching market with <b>indifferences...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the core of an {{exchange}} market with indivisible goods is always non empty, although it may contain Pareto inefficient allocations.

On the other hand, when <b>indifferences</b> are allowed, the core or the strict core may fail to be stable sets, in the von Neumann and Morgenstern sense. We introduce a new solution concept that improves the behaviour of the strict core, {{in the sense that it}} solves the emptiness problem of the strict core when <b>indifferences</b> are allowed in the individuals' preferences and whenever the strict core is non-empty, our solution is included in it.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the extent to which {{allowing}} for individuals to be indifferent among alternatives may alter the qualitative results that are obtained in social choice theory when domain restrictions are defined on profiles of linear orders. The general message is that <b>indifferences</b> require attention and careful treatment, because the translation of results from a world without <b>indifferences</b> to another where agents may be indifferent among some alternatives is not always a straightforward exercise. But the warning is not one-directional: sometimes <b>indifferences</b> complicate the statement of results, but preserve their essential message. Sometimes, they help to create domains where some rules work better than in the presence of linear orders. In other cases, however, their presence destroys the positive results that would apply in their absence. I provide examples of these three situations. Most of the positive results in social choice theory apply to families of preference profiles that satisfy some special conditions. Maybe the best known among these conditions is Duncan Black’s notion of single peakedness 1, a property that guarantee...|$|R
