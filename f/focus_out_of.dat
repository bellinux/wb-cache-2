Unfortunately, staying in sync with a video while {{trying to use the}} target application at the same time requires users to repeatedly switch from the application to the video to pause or scrub backwards to replay missed steps. We present Pause-and-Play, a system that helps users work along with existing video tutorials. Pauseand-Play detects important events in the video and links them with corresponding events in the target application as the user tries to replicate the depicted prodedure. This linking allows our system to automatically pause and play the video to stay in sync with the user. Pause-and-Play also supports convenient video navigation controls that are accessible from within the target application and allow the user to easily replay portions of the video without switching <b>focus</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the application. Finally, since our system uses computer vision to detect events in existing videos and leverages application scripting APIs to obtain real time usage traces, our approach is largely independent of the specific target application and does not require access or modifications to application source code. We have implemented Pause-and-Play for two target applications, Google SketchUp and Adobe Photoshop, and we report on a user study that shows our system improves the user experience of working with video tutorials.

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{emphasis on}} maintaining road assets {{to a high}} standard, the need for fast accurate inspection for road distresses is becoming extremely important. Surface distresses on roads are essentially three dimensional (3 -D) in nature. Automated visual surveys are the best option available. However, the imaging conditions, in terms of lighting, etc., are very random. For example, the challenge of measuring {{the volume of the}} pothole requires a large field of view with a reasonable spatial resolution, whereas microtexture evaluation requires very accurate imaging. Within the two extremes, there is a range of situations that require 3 -D imaging. Three-dimensional imaging consists of a number of techniques such as interferometry and depth from <b>focus.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> these, laser imagers are mainly used for road surface distress inspection. Many other techniques are relatively unknown among the transportation community, and industrial products are rare. The main impetus for this paper is derived from the rarity of 3 -D industrial imagers that employ alternative techniques for use in transportation. In addition, the need for this work is also highlighted by a lack of literature that evaluates the relative merits/demerits of various imaging methods for different distress measurement situations in relation to pavements. This overview will create awareness of available 3 -D imaging methods in order to help make a fast initial technology selection and deployment. The review is expected to be helpful for researchers, practicing engineers, and decision makers in transportation engineering...|$|E

40|$|Penelope’s use of {{trickery}} {{to delay}} {{her marriage to}} one of the persistent suitors of The Odyssey is, on the surface, exemplified by a ruse which is effective in its simplicity. The weaving, and subsequent un-weaving, of Laertes’ shroud is a brilliant ploy which successfully keeps the suitors at bay until the trick is revealed by one of her maids. This, however, is not the only example of Penelope’s ability to deceive. Although {{much has been made of}} the cunning and resourceful means by which Penelope, as the good wife, attempts to preserve the memory and physical household of her husband, it seems that little attention has been paid to her role her deceit plays in preserving her own status within the oikos. By raising my <b>focus</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the physical boundaries of Odysseus’ palace and to a more abstract consideration of the concept of the oikos in Homer’s text it is my intent that this dissertation will overcome this barrier by focussing on Penelope’s actions in light of a marked distinction between her spiritual and physical presence. Deceit, I will argue, is the vessel by which Penelope remains both loyal to the abstract understanding of Odysseus’ oikos and empowered within its physical walls. As one of the primary themes of The Odyssey, my research will focus specifically on the examples of deceit which in some manner pertain to the notion of household integrity. It is by these means that I hope to establish a “Morality of Deceit” for instances where lying and deception are employed by the perpetrator solely to contribute to the integrity of the oikos. Placing Penelope in this context will allow an exploration of how both her fidelity and deceit, whilst morally in the service of the oikos, serve to sustain her domestic control over Odysseus’ physical household...|$|E
40|$|ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of {{financial}} Transactions for the Aid of Citizens) is a fast growing transnational movement that mainly aims towards democratic {{control over the}} financial markets. ATTAC was founded in France in 1998 and has now spread to more than 35 countries in Europe, Latin- America, Asia and Africa. ATTAC Norway (ATTAC Norge/Noreg) was formally established in of May 2001. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the identification processes that legitimate and motivate collective action during the establihment phase of ATTAC Norway. I explore {{to what extent the}} identification processes are influenced by the fact that ATTAC is a transnational social movement. I also scrutinise to what extent the identification processes are influenced by Norwegian political practices and cultural meanings. Towards the end of the thesis I lift the <b>focus</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ATTAC Norway and explore the identification processes ATTAC is involved in when operating on transnational political arenas On the basis of fieldwork conducted at several levels of the organisation during 2001 I argue that the identification processes during the establishment of ATTAC Norway were influenced by a Norwegian political culture where the ideology of equality has a strong position. At the same time the establishment was hugely inspired by the transnational ATTAC movement with its political platform, slogans, symbols etc. ATTAC, in fact, becomes a transnational imagined community for many members of ATTAC Norway. I conclude my study that ATTAC Norway has emerged in the crossroads between the transnational and the local. The transnational ATTAC movement has played a vital part in shaping collective identities within ATTAC Norway. And when members of ATTAC Norway operate on transnational arenas, they become part of a wider transnational community of social movements united in their opposition to neo-liberal globalisation. At the same time the forming of ATTAC Norway is rooted in the how s and why s of Norwegian political context and cultural meaning...|$|E
40|$|Comparative correlatives, like "the {{longer you}} stay {{out in the}} rain, the colder you'll get," are {{prolific}} in the world's languages (i. e., {{there is no evidence}} of a language that lacks comparative correlatives). Despite this observation, the data do not present a readily apparent syntax. What is the relationship between the two clauses? What is the main verb? What is English's "the" which obligatorily appears at the start of each clause? This thesis reviews prior analyses of comparative correlatives, both syntactic and semantic (Fillmore, 1987; McCawley, 1988; McCawley, 1998; Beck, 1997; Culicover & Jackendoff, 1999; Borsley, 2003; Borsley, 2004; den Dikken, 2005; Abeillé, Borsley & Espinal, 2007; Lin, 2007). A formal syntactic analysis of comparative correlatives is presented which accounts for its syntactic behaviors across several languages. Most notably, it challenges the assumption that constructions are essential primitives for the successful derivation and interpretation of the data (Fillmore, 1987; McCawley, 1988; Culicover & Jackendoff, 1999; Borsley, 2003; Borsley, 2004; Abeillé, Borsley & Espinal, 2007). The analysis is framed within the goals of the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1993, 1995 a), specifically with respect to endocentricity and Bare Phrase Structure (Chomsky 1995 b). Crosslingustically, the first clause is subordinate to the second clause, the main clause. A'-movement (e. g., Topicalization, wh-movement, <b>Focus)</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> each clause proceeds successive-cyclically and, in the case of the subordinate clause, via sideward movement (Nunes 1995, 2004; Hornstein, 2001). In English, the word the which obligatorily appears at the start of each clause in English is a Force 0. This provides an explanation for the ban on Subject-Aux Inversion (SAI) in the entire expression. The degree phrases which are present in each clause of a comparative correlative crosslinguistically contain a quantifier phrase in Spec,DegP; this quantifier is phonetically null in English. This thesis concludes by presenting conceptual arguments against constructions as primitives in the grammar. Bare Phrase Structure (BPS) (Chomsky, 1995 b) is included in the system by virtue of virtual conceptual necessity (VCN). Since constructions do not meet the criteria of (VCN), their existence would compromise the principles of BPS. Further, when applied carefully, BPS renders constructions unable to be defined...|$|E
