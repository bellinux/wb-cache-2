40|$|<b>Intentional</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in {{providing}} accurate income tax returns, {{also known as}} ‘tax evasion’ or ‘intentional error’, has been studied from both attitudinal and socio-demographic perspectives. A significant portion of previous research employs {{a common set of}} indicators, which we can exploit by pooling meta-analytically with the hopes of obtaining a unified, well-predicting model of intentional error. Towards this end, we turn to a large, nationally representative data source, namely the Census Bureau’s Public-Use Microdata Samples (PUMS), as our source of covariance between the socio-demographic covariates of interest. Additionally, the same source offers data on potential opportunities of evasion for each PUMS respondent (or agent), in certain line item/taxpayer categories, allowing us to construct distinct error models for these categories. Furthermore, we extend the error model to include attitudinal meta-analysis, by linking the General Social Survey (GSS) to the PUMS through imputation of a GSS covariate that identifies respondents who are more likely to break the law. Our meta-analysis requires an in-depth re-analysis of the selection of previously published results on non-compliance. The result is a comprehensive model of non-complianc...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLow {{rates of}} {{compliance}} with medication pose a major challenge to the effective management of most chronic diseases, including asthma. The high medical and social costs of non-compliance, and the apparent lack of effective methods for dealing with it, has stimulated renewed interest in this complex issue. Two broad categories of non-compliance have been identified, namely unintentional (or ‘accidental’) and intentional (or ‘deliberate’). Unintentional non-compliance may result from poor doctor-patient communication {{or a lack of}} ability to follow advice. <b>Intentional</b> <b>non-compliance</b> occurs when the patient knows what is required but decides not to follow this to some degree. Healthcare professionals {{need to be aware of}} the various issues affecting compliance in all patients. The reasons for non-compliance are many and varied, and include factors such as complexity of the treatment regimen, administration route, patient beliefs about therapy and other psychological factors. Improvement in patient compliance with therapy will require better doctor-patient communication, improved patient education, the tailoring of therapy to the individual and possible novel strategies such as offering feedback to the patients on their level of compliance...|$|E
40|$|When signatories of {{international}} agreements fail to comply unin-tentionally, sanctioning rules designed to deter <b>intentional</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are tested. To provide signatories {{with the best}} treaty value, we find that remedies in case of unilateral defection must account for {{the nature of the}} inequality between treaty partners, as well as the type of mixed motive game they are engaged in. Trig-ger type schemes, that rely on punishment by mutual defection, are the norm for sanctioning in treaty texts. Inequality is addressed by proposing that the process leading to retaliation be accelerated when a weaker partner faces the noncompliance of a stronger partner. Our analysis suggests instead that the prescrip-tion depends on the source of the inequality. If inequality stems from differences in the costs associated to compliance, the stronger partner, with the lower compliance costs, should be given more time, not less, to settle {{in the shadow of the}} law if he deviates. Despite their prevalence, trigger schemes are not well suited to the handling of Chicken or Called Bluff games that may define the stakes in environmental accords. This motivates our analysis of an alternative sanctioning scheme that builds in redress for the victim of a unilateral defection. In addition to its ability to handle alter-native game structures, we find that this scheme provides better The listing order of the authors ’ names is not indicative of their respective contributions, which they con-sider to be equal...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of computer and internet technology has greatly improved the way businesses operate. However {{the risk to}} the confidentiality, integrity and availability of organizational data and systems has greatly increased too. Information security is an ever present concern for all organizations. Financial estimates {{of the impact of}} security breaches to information and technology resources range from hundreds of billions to over one trillion dollars each year worldwide (D'Arcy et al., 2011 b). Organizations have therefore developed a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to reduce this risk (D'Arcy et al., 2011 a). Administrative measures include the development of information security policies, which are statements of the roles and responsibilities of the employee to safeguard the information technology resources of their organizations (Bulgurcu et al., 2010). Information security policy provisions include guidelines to employees on what they should do when interacting with information systems so as to secure the data and technology resources of their respective organizations. Unfortunately, cases of employee <b>intentional</b> and non-intentional <b>non-compliance</b> with information security policies have been documented, with some security experts concluding employees are th...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{containment}} {{is to prevent}} reintroduction of wild polioviruses from laboratories into polio-free communities. In order to achieve global commitment to laboratory containment the rationale should be clear and compelling; the biosafety levels should be justified by the risks; and the objectives should be realistic. Absolute containment can never be assured. Questions of <b>intentional</b> or unintentional <b>non-compliance</b> can never be wholly eliminated. Effective laboratory containment is, however, a realistic goal. Prevention of virus transmission through contaminated laboratory materials is addressed by WHO standards for biosafety. The principal challenge is to prevent transmission through unrecognized infectious laboratory workers. Such transmission is possible only if the following conditions occur: infectious and potentially infectious materials carrying wild poliovirus {{are present in the}} laboratory concerned; a laboratory operation exposes a worker to poliovirus; a worker is susceptible to an infection that results in the shedding of poliovirus; and the community is susceptible to poliovirus infections. At present it is difficult to envisage the elimination of any of these conditions. However, the risks of the first three can be greatly reduced so as to create a formidable barrier against poliovirus transmission to the community. Final biosafety recommendations must await post-eradication immunization policies adopted by the international community...|$|R
