40|$|Abstract Background Most <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> for whole genome {{association}} {{studies are}} non-graphical, purely text based programs {{originally designed to}} run with UNIX-like operating systems. Graphical output is often not intended or supposed to be performed with other command line tools, e. g. gnuplot. Results Using the Microsoft. NET 2. 0 platform and Visual Studio 2005, we have created a <b>graphical</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> to analyze data from microarray whole genome association studies, both for a DNA-pooling based approach as well as regular single sample data. Part of this package was made to integrate with GenePool 0. 8. 2, a previously existing software suite for GNU/Linux systems, which we have modified to run in a Microsoft Windows environment. Further modifications cause it to generate some additional data. This enables GenePool to interact with the. NET parts created by us. The programs we developed are GPFrontend, a graphical user interface and frontend to use GenePool and create metadata files for it, and GPGraphics, a program to further analyze and graphically evaluate output of different WGA analysis programs, among them also GenePool.
