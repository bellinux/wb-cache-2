5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of galaxies have been catalogued, {{but only a few}} have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of <b>Galaxies</b> <b>and</b> of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of <b>Galaxies)</b> <b>and</b> UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies).

5|$|Although {{it appears}} that {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the first}} stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Clusters {{of galaxies}} consist of {{hundreds}} {{to thousands of}} galaxies bound together by gravity. Clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy, which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> adds their mass to its own.|$|E
5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> a planetary nebula observable with amateur telescopes.

5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert <b>galaxies,</b> <b>and</b> BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and <b>galaxies,</b> <b>and</b> it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} Milky Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the local group of <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E

5|$|Luminous {{infrared}} galaxies or LIRGs are galaxies with luminosities, {{the measurement}} of brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRGs are more abundant than starburst galaxies, Seyfert <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> quasi-stellar objects at comparable total luminosity. Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than at all other wavelengths combined. A LIRG's luminosity is 100 billion times that of our Sun.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> clusters of <b>galaxies,</b> <b>and</b> a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
40|$|We present initial {{results of}} a program to obtain and analyze HST WFPC 2 images of galaxies {{identified}} in an imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in fields of HST spectroscopic target QSOs. We measure properties of 87 galaxies, of which 33 are associated with corresponding Lyα absorption systems and 24 do not produce corresponding Lyα absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits. Considering only <b>galaxy</b> <b>and</b> absorber pairs {{that are likely to}} be physically associated <b>and</b> excluding <b>galaxy</b> <b>and</b> absorber pairs within 3000 km s − 1 of the background QSOs leaves 26 <b>galaxy</b> <b>and</b> absorber pairs <b>and</b> seven <b>galaxies</b> that do not produce corresponding Lyα absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits. Redshifts of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>and</b> absorber pairs range from 0. 0750 to 0. 8912 with a median of 0. 3718, and impact parameter separations of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>and</b> absorber pairs range from 12. 4 to 157. 4 h − 1 kpc with a median of 62. 4 h − 1 kpc. The primary result of the analysis is that the amount of gas encountered along the line of sight depends on the <b>galaxy</b> impact parameter <b>and</b> B-band luminosity but does not depend strongly on the galaxy average surface brightness, disk-to-bulge ratio...|$|R

5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some <b>galaxies,</b> <b>and</b> astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between <b>galaxies</b> <b>and</b> their central black holes.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} objects outside our galaxy is {{a branch of}} {{astronomy}} concerned with the formation and evolution of Galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active <b>galaxies,</b> <b>and</b> at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies.

5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way.

These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of <b>galaxies,</b> <b>and</b> by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
