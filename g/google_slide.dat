40|$|In Singapore, {{at the end}} of 2015, the {{smartphone}} penetration {{stood at}} 148. 4 % while the total wireless broadband population penetration rate was 184. 8 % (Inforcomm Development Authority of Singapore, 2015). Mobile and digital technology, in tandem with the extensive WiFi networks available {{in all parts of the}} country, provide opportunities to implement collaborative learning via cloud drives in adult training classes. The author, who specializes in training adult instructors and trainers, implemented computer-mediated collaborative learning for her workshops. The teaching strategy focused on cooperative learning structures underpinned by Vygotsky's sociocultural theory of learning, and the facilitative nature of learning in Knowles theory of adult learning. She introduced Google Drive as the online platform in her workshops, eschewing paper handouts in favour of softcopy handouts available to all participants on the cloud drive. She guided the participants to access <b>Google</b> Docs, <b>Google</b> <b>Slides</b> and <b>Google</b> Sheets on their laptops, tablets and smartphones for collaborative learning purposes. Reading and discussion activities were designed with Google Drive as the platform for mediating instruction and learning. She started by having participants, in cooperative learning groups access softcopy handouts for reading and discussion, with the discussion points put up on group <b>Google</b> <b>Slides</b> for presentation. Participants moved from merely accessing softcopy handouts to searching for information online for solving problems related to the specific workshop content to discussing and putting together group reports and presentations, all via Google Drive. Participants experienced both face-to-face and online discussion via Google Drive. Almost all participants were new to the online collaborative learning processes experienced in the workshops. However, familiarity with the personal digital equipment brought by each participant to the workshops enabled the participants to overcome the initial disruption of the newness of the learning strategy. Participants appreciated the personal autonomy the collaborative learning process gave to their learning journey...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of lecturers are experimenting with innovative computer-mediated approaches to foreign languages teaching (FLT), dramatically altering the ways students interact with learning content. This comparatively common acceptance of digital learning technologies has enlarged the integration of multimedia teaching and learning tools into the traditional, face-to-face classroom setting, thus blended approach to content supply in FLT has experienced extensive progress in higher education. The article deals with the practice of usage {{of the most popular}} multimedia technological tools, such as Prezi, <b>Google</b> <b>Slides,</b> PowerPoint, in foreign languages teaching at higher educational institutions. In the course of research surveys were made to determine the types of collaboration and evaluation preferred by the students, their expectations from foreign language learning process, which, in their turn, gave grounds to point out the factors promoting intensification of the teaching process in the context of blended learning...|$|R

40|$|Workshop {{presentation}} {{given at}} Libraries Research & Innovative Practice Forum, June 8 th, 2017. Original format: <b>Google</b> <b>Slides.</b> For many undergraduate students, accessing academic library resources {{is a new}} experience and can feel overwhelming. While the Teaching and Learning Services instructors work to relieve research anxiety during one-shot information literacy sessions, these sessions generally take place early in the semester, and may not come {{at the time of}} the students’ greatest need. To address this issue, Teaching and Learning Services has developed a series of research workshops spaced throughout the semester to provide timely interventions for students engaged in the research process. Varying workshop topics help students learn effective search strategies, evaluation of sources, citing and integrating sources, and more. This program, entering its 4 th semester, is constantly adapting and growing. Each semester has brought changes to the workshops, whether in the form of new collaborations, more robust materials, or simple time/location changes. Student and teacher feedback has helped us discover how helpful the workshop program could be for underserved student populations as well. In our conference lightning talk presentation we will share our learning materials and discuss our successes, challenges, and plans moving forward in the future...|$|R

30|$|Per Fig.  3, the {{students}} are given time between the two successive classes {{to work on the}} content, which they add to the collaborative <b>Google</b> <b>Slides</b> presentation and present at the first following class. Discussion ensues, during which missing points are addressed by the class and revisions suggested. Revisions {{are an integral part of}} the content co-creation and can take place either during class 2, right after they are being proposed, or as a homework between classes 2 and 3, or both. As shown in Table  2, the quality of the content turned out to have improved when {{the students}} had more time to do the corrections and when they did them outside the classroom. To prevent the awkward silence due to hesitation to voluntarily offer a critique of the classmates’ contents, a rotation was reinforced, so that everybody was put on spot to highlight pros and cons and advise addendums after a classmate’s presentation. For a single slide, presentations should be short and adjusted to the class size, typically ranging between 2 and 3  min for a class comprising a dozen students. Individual classes were 2.5  h long, as they allowed more time for presentation, discussion, and in-class content revisions than the 50 -min single credit university standards. The final acquaintance with the content occurs during class 3, when students briefly present their revisions to the class (Fig.  3). A farewell to this portion of the total content is waved at this time, albeit temporarily, as the students will encounter it at the first following exam.|$|R

3000|$|Fleming and Mills (2001) {{proposed}} the VARK model that encodes different learning styles. The model comprises four modalities: Visual, which covers preferences for learning using graphic material, such as maps, charts, diagrams, symbolic arrows, hierarchies, and so on, but excludes still pictures, movies and slides; Aural covers preferences for “information that is ‘heard or spoken.’”, which include lectures, group discussions, email, among other mediums; Read/write, which covers preferences for “information displayed as words”, such as manuals, reports, essays, assignments, PowerPoint <b>slides,</b> <b>Google</b> and Wikipedia; and Kinesthetic, {{which refers to}} the “perceptual preference related {{to the use of}} experience and practice (simulated or real)”. This modality encodes a preference to learn through experience, demonstrations, practice and simulations. Because each modality is assigned and [...] independent score, this model supports multimodality. Even if the student types found in the literature apply, we don’t know if they are the most relevant within a gamified learning experience, given the lack of studies to assess its applicability in this field.|$|R
