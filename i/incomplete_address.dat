METHODS: Information on victims attended {{at the emergency}} room of a public hospital {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, from January 1, 2002 to January 11, 2003 were obtained from hospital records. The spatial distribution of 3, 540 events was recorded and a uniform random procedure was used to allocate records with <b>incomplete</b> <b>addresses.</b> Point processes and wavelet analysis technique were used to {{estimate the}} spatial intensity, defined as the expected number of events by unit area. RESULTS: Of all georeferenced points, 59 % were accidents and 40 % were assaults. There is a non-homogeneous spatial distribution of the events with high concentration in two districts and three large avenues in the southern area of the city of São Paulo. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital records combined with methodological tools to estimate intensity of events are useful to study urban violence. The wavelet analysis is useful in the computation of the expected number of events and their respective confidence bands for any sub-region and, consequently, in the specification of risk estimates {{that could be used in}} decision-making processes for public policies...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to find out the sequences that are used by Yoyong to open and to close the telephone conversation, the most frequent sequences and the common style of language variety in the opening and closing sequences. For that purpose, the writer uses the theory of Telephone Conversation by Schegloff (1968), Standard and Non Standard Language by Holmes (1992), Kridalaksana (1978) and Lumintaintang (1998). For the methodology, the writer uses qualitative-descriptive approach. In collecting the data, the writer records fifteen telephone conversations and then she transcribes it so that the writer can analyze it. From the findings the writer finds out that Yoyong uses identification and greetings sequences to open the conversation, while for the closing, he uses closing sequence. Additionally, Yoyong uses non-standard Indonesian in opening and closing the telephone conversation. The language variety in opening are the use of Javanese language like monggo and Arabic language like walaikumsalam, the use of <b>incomplete</b> <b>address</b> term Pak or Bu, the use of greetings and asking the name of the caller dengan?. While the language variety in closing are the use of Javanese language like enjih, monggo, thanking in Indonesian makasih, and greetings in Indonesian like Pagi or Arabic language walaikumsalam. Finally, the writer concludes that the language which Yoyong used in opening and closing was the appropriate language for the presenter and the callers. The use of nonstandard Indonesian did not mean impolite. It can be a sign of good relationship and intimacy...|$|E

Censorship prevents a full account of one's activities and destinations, and letters could take months to arrive. This visual essay, drawn from images in his official archive at Georgetown University and from his sea-chest at home in Brighton at Lewes Crescent, focusses on the wartime correspondence of Michael Richey. His brother Paul Richey wrote the classic account Fighter Pilot (published anonymously during the war), while Mike’s own story of the HMS Goodwill, ‘Sunk by a Mine’, won the very first Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize for Literature in 1942. Post-war, Michael Richey went on to have a distinguished career as the first director of the (Royal) Institute of Navigation, and became a legend for his single-handed sailing adventures in the famous little boat Jester.

40|$|Objective—To {{evaluate}} {{the differences among}} each state’s Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) form and the legibility of data on paper ICVIs used to support disease tracing in cattle. Design—Descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study. Sample—Examples of ICVIs from 50 states and 7, 630 randomly sampled completed paper ICVIs for cattle from 48 states. Procedures—Differences among paper ICVI forms from all 50 states were determined. Sixteen data elements were selected for further evaluation of their value in tracing cattle. Completed paper ICVIs for interstate cattle exports in 2009 were collected from 48 states. Each of the 16 data elements was recorded as legible, absent, or illegible on forms completed by accredited veterinarians, and results were summarized by state. Mean values for legibility {{at the state level}} were used to estimate legibility of data at the national level. Results—ICVIs were inconsistent among states in regard to data elements requested and availability of legible records. A mean ± SD of 70. 0 ± 22. 1 % of ICVIs in each state had legible origin address information. Legible destination address information was less common, with 55. 0 ± 21. 4 % of records complete. <b>Incomplete</b> <b>address</b> information was most often a result of the field having been left blank. Official animal identification was present on 33. 1 % of ICVIs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—The inconsistency among state ICVI forms and quality of information provided on paper ICVIs could lead to delays and the need for additional resources to trace cattle, which could result in continued spread of disease. Standardized ICVIs among states and more thorough recording of information by accredited veterinarians or expanded usage of electronic ICVIs could enhance traceability of cattle during an outbreak...|$|E

One of the fundamental problems in TB control is a high defaulter rate among the registered TB cases in the public sector. In 1999, a cross-sectional {{study was designed to}} identify the determinants of low compliance for the TB treatment in two rural districts in Sindh. Methods: Before the actual data collection, a pilot testing was planned in a secondary level care hospital. Fourteen defaulters for TB treatment were identified but none could be contacted due to <b>incomplete</b> <b>addresses.</b> Other alternatives were explored with the health facility team to reach them including a field-based search through Lady Health Workers of the National Health Program but all endeavors went into vain. The pilot testing propelled us to postpone the cross-sectional study but we continued scrutinizing the follow up problem for TB patients in other health facilities. Not surprisingly, more or less a similar picture was found in those health facili-ties. Principal conclusions: The study concludes that the public health care system in Pakistan lacks even the basic requirements for an effective TB control program, that is, a viable information system and the functional integra-tion of program with rest of the health care delivery system.

40|$|This Article {{compares the}} {{development}} of cross-border solutions for resolving and reorganizing commercial entities to those solutions available for financial institutions. This Article argues that the resolution regime for financial institutions needs to move forward from the existing international best practices approach, embodied in the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Key Attributes for Resolution Regimes, to a more formal legal framework for cross-border resolution, similar to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law for Cross-Border Insolvency. In doing so, this Article identifies {{a gap in the}} international infrastructure for resolutions. While UNCITRAL promulgated a model law to provide for cross-border insolvencies in 1997, there has been reluctance to take a similar path with regard to the resolution of international financial institutions, even though the stakes are very high. This Article addresses possible reasons for this reluctance, draws lessons from the commercial sphere, and explores the relevance of the UNCITRAL Model Law framework to financial institutions. This Article also analyzes the recent FSB initiative on cross-border resolution and the recently promulgated International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Resolution Stay Protocol that seek to promote certainty in the application of resolution measures across borders. This Article argues that these primarily contract-based initiatives are important contributions to the standardization and improvement of the standards on the treatment of financial contracts in insolvency and resolution.
