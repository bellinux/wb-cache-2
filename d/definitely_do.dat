25|$|Pain in babies, {{and whether}} babies feel pain, {{has been the}} subject of debate within the medical {{profession}} for centuries. Prior to the late nineteenth century it was generally considered that babies hurt more easily than adults. It was only in the last quarter of the 20th century that scientific techniques finally established babies <b>definitely</b> <b>do</b> experience pain – probably more than adults – and has developed reliable means of assessing and of treating it. As recently as 1999, it was commonly stated that babies could not feel pain until they were a year old, but today it is believed newborns and likely even fetuses beyond a certain age can experience pain.|$|E

2500|$|The {{argument}} that {{a minimum wage}} decreases employment {{is based on a}} simple supply and demand model of the labor market. A number of economists (for example Pierangelo Garegnani, Robert L. Vienneau, and Arrigo Opocher & Ian Steedman), building on the work of Piero Sraffa, argue that that model, even given all its assumptions, is logically incoherent. Michael Anyadike-Danes and Wynne Godley argue, based on simulation results, that little of the empirical work done with the textbook model constitutes a potentially falsifiable theory, and consequently empirical evidence hardly exists for that model. Graham White argues, partially on the basis of Sraffianism, that the policy of increased labor market flexibility, including the reduction of minimum wages, does not have an [...] "intellectually coherent" [...] argument in economic theory.Gary Fields, Professor of Labor Economics and Economics at Cornell University, argues that the standard textbook model for the minimum wage is ambiguous, and that the standard theoretical arguments incorrectly measure only a one-sector market. Fields says a two-sector market, where [...] "the self-employed, service workers, and farm workers are typically excluded from minimum-wage coverage... one sector with minimum-wage coverage and the other without it ," [...] is the basis for better analysis. Through this model, Fields shows the typical theoretical argument to be ambiguous and says [...] "the predictions derived from the textbook model <b>definitely</b> <b>do</b> not carry over to the two-sector case. Therefore, since a non-covered sector exists nearly everywhere, the predictions of the textbook model simply cannot be relied on." ...|$|E
