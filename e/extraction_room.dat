A method used was an extraction method with a solvent system of three components (chloroform, methanol and water) in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 0. 8. Samples were extracted with an extraction time of 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes and with two extraction methods (cold <b>extraction,</b> <b>room</b> temperature and hot extraction at 40 oC). The extraction result was a biphase solution; the upper layer was a methanol-water extract and the bottom layer was a chloroform extract, which was a lipid fraction.

40|$|Abstract — This papers {{proposes a}} novel climate control {{strategy}} for mine <b>extraction</b> <b>rooms</b> {{based on the}} receding horizon optimal control scheme. Being a model-based procedure, {{the development of a}} pertinent prediction model is one of the keystones. According to recent technological advances, we consider that distributed measurements are available and provided by a wireless network. An enhanced modeling approach, based on stratification and sigmoid description of concentrations in the <b>extraction</b> <b>rooms,</b> is then proposed and allows for an optimal use of information provided by the wireless sensor network (WSN). The complexity of the resulting model, due to the nonlinearities, different time scales and time-delays, is handled by using an on-line shape prediction, included in the design of an optimal sequence of control actions over a finite horizon. Physical and communication constraints are successfully handled at the design stage and the resulting closed-loop system is robust with respect to variations in the pollutant dynamics. I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} regulating the air quality in underground <b>extraction</b> <b>rooms</b> for mining industry.

This is clearly a challenging control problem where the flow dynamics, the interconnections between subsystems and the time-varying topology have {{to be taken into account}} along with real-time computation constraints. In this paper, we first describe a real-time simulator based on simplified flow dynamics, which is used in a state-feedback control scheme that motivates model-based control strategies. An online parameter estimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the control-oriented model (pressure dynamics) output to the distributed measurements.

Our work is focused on the deep pit part of the ventilation system, which brings fresh air at a specified pressure to the extraction levels. The flow interactions and main automation elements are first presented, with a real-time engineering model of the complete mine ventilation system. A novel control-oriented model focused on the pressure dynamics is then introduced, as a convective-resistive partial differential equation (PDE) with multiple inputs where the time-varying transport coefficients are estimated based on the distributed measurements. A fast predictive controller (FPC) is finally proposed to compensate the pressure losses due to friction and multiple flow exhausts thanks to the ventilation pit input pressure regulation.

In case of cyanophytes the extent of difference between these two solvents is higher than with diatoms.

When humic amendments are to be obtained at a commercial scale, in contrast, yield considerations may never be secondary. Thus, harsh extraction conditions are usual. For instance, KOH is used at high concentrations (1  M or higher) to reach high extractions of humic matter, {{at the price of}} obtaining highly saline humic products, even though this is a minor problem because commercial humic products are largely diluted when applied to crops. With some exceptions (e.g., Garcia et al. 1994), it is usually observed that yields of extracted humic matter increase with temperature, at the price of shifts in the chemical characteristics of the extracted humic matter (Yefimov and Vasil’kova 1970; Cegarra et al. 1974; Garcia et al. 1994). Under these conditions, the obtained alkaline extracts may be partly artifactual, as well as their humic character.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe freeze gelcasting of {{hydrogenated}} vegetable oil-in-aqueous alumina slurry (HVO-in-AAS) emulsions of HVO to AAS volume ratios in {{the range}} of 1. 34 – 2. 69 prepared from slurries of various alumina concentrations were studied to prepare macroporous ceramics of high porosity. The compressive strength (20 – 150 kPa) and Young's modulus (120 – 1550 kPa) of the gelled emulsion bodies increased with an increase in alumina slurry concentration and HVO to AAS volume ratio. Easy HVO removal from gelled emulsion bodies by <b>extraction</b> at <b>room</b> temperature with petroleum ether, a less toxic solvent, was achieved. The highest porosity achieved at a HVO to AAS volume ratio of 2. 69 increased from 84 to 92. 5 % when the alumina concentrations in the slurry decreased from 30 to 10 vol. %. The cell size and cell interconnectivity of the ceramics depended on the alumina slurry concentration and HVO to AAS volume ratio. The Young's modulus of the macroporous ceramics modelled using the equation proposed by Gibson and Ashby showed large deviation in the model parameters, n and C, from the proposed values...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{verification}} {{of the analysis}} of precursors or degradation products of toxic compounds {{in the air and}} water through GC/MS by method of the thermal desorption or combination of methods "spray & trap" followed by the thermal desorption transfer the sample into the analyzer. Toxic compounds triethyl phosphate (TEP) and diisopropylmethyl phosphonate (DIMP) were choosen for the analysis. For choosen compounds has been optimized desorption time, for TEP 240 seconds and DIMP 210 seconds. Then the calibration curve was made for different concentrations of compounds DIMP and TEP. On the basis of these measurements was tested the possibility of determining the concentration of the compound in water sample using of method "spray & trap“. Thanks to the high solubility of compounds TEP and DIMP in water, higher boiling temperatures in comparison with boiling temperature of water, and <b>extraction</b> at <b>room</b> temperature, {{it was not possible to}} detect used compounds. Therefore, the analysis of compounds DIMP and TEP in the water by method "spray & trap“ seems inappropriate...|$|R

40|$|The fungitoxicity of hexane and {{methanol}} extracts of copaiba {{plants were}} evaluated by biological tests against the phytopathogens Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Bipolaris sorokiniana. These extracts were chosen because they presented the highest yields in the <b>extraction</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. The biological material {{was obtained from the}} Department of Phytopathology of the UFLA, transplanted in BDA (C. gloeosporioides) and PCA (B. sorokiniana) culture media and incubated in a germination chamber with control of light and temperature. Five treatments (0 / 100 / 200 / 400 / 800 ppm) were used with three repetitions of each, and four mutually perpendicular radii, were measured in centimeters from the mycelial center. The formula for the Mycelial Growth Index (MGI) was applied to the values obtained for statistical analyses. A 32 % reduction in the growth of B. sorokiniana was observed {{in the presence of the}} methanol extract, while the hexane extract was effective against both of the phytopathogens, resulting in a 49 % reduction in the growth of B. sorokiniana and an 18 % reduction in the growth of C. gloeosporioides...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{separation}} {{technology at}} room temperature for traditional Chinese medicines was proposed in this work by adding magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (M-MIPs) into extraction solution and sample matrix. The M-MIPs show a more adsorption capacities and higher selectivity for the template than magnetic non-molecularly imprinted polymers (M-NMIPs) without the specific binding sites. Addition of the M-MIPs to the extraction solution provides one-step extraction and cleanup, the improvement of extraction rate and extraction yields of three tanshinones (from 0. 40, 0. 23 and 0. 12 mg g(- 1) in 240 min by solvent extraction to 0. 52, 0. 27 and 0. 19 mg g(- 1) in 5 min by 200 mg sorbent), and reusability of extraction solvent. The extraction yields of three tanshinones by this technology {{at room temperature}} in 5 min were higher than those by ultrasonic extraction in 30 min, by heat reflux extraction in 45 min and by solvent <b>extraction</b> at <b>room</b> temperature in 4 h. The integrated technology has the advantages of one-step extraction and cleanup, high extraction efficiency, low solvent consumption and room temperature.
