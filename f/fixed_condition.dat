Possibly, I might have got interested in the old iron and wood-shavings; and become an engineer or a carpenter: but for the children of to-day, accustomed, from the instant they are out of their cradles, to the sight of this infinite nastiness, prevailing as a <b>fixed</b> <b>condition</b> of the universe, over the face of nature, and accompanying all the operations of industrious man, what is to be the scholastic issue? unless, indeed, the thrill of scientific vanity in the primary analysis of some unheard-of process of corruption--or the reward of microscopic research in the sight of worms with more legs, and acari of more curious generation than ever vivified the more simply smelling plasma of antiquity.|$|E
60|$|Here was {{a sudden}} change in what had long been a <b>fixed</b> <b>condition</b> of human life, the maximum rate of land transport. After the Russian disaster, Napoleon {{travelled}} from near Vilna to Paris in 312 hours. This was a journey of about 1,400 miles. He was travelling with every conceivable advantage, and he averaged {357} under 5 miles an hour. An ordinary traveller {{could not have done}} this distance in twice the time. These were about the same maximum rates of travel as held good between Rome and Gaul in the first century A.D. Then suddenly came this tremendous change. The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary traveller to less than forty-eight hours. That is to say, they reduced the chief European distances to about a tenth of what they had been. They made it possible to carry out administrative work in areas ten times as great as any that had hitherto been workable under one administration. The full significance of that possibility in Europe still remains to be realized. Europe is still netted in boundaries drawn in the horse and road era. In America the effects were immediate. To the United States of America, sprawling westward, it meant the possibility of a continuous access to Washington, however far the frontier travelled across the continent. It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would otherwise have been impossible.|$|E

60|$|Finally, {{as we have}} seen, various {{considerations}} lead to {{the conclusion}} that with the greater number of brilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera it is the male which has been chiefly modified through sexual selection; the amount of difference between the sexes mostly depending on the form of inheritance which has prevailed. Inheritance is governed by so many unknown laws or conditions, that it seems to us to act in a capricious manner (28. The 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,' vol. ii. chap. xii. p. 17.); and we can thus, to a certain extent, understand how it is that with closely allied species the sexes either differ to an astonishing degree, or are identical in colour. As all the successive steps in the process of variation are necessarily transmitted through the female, a greater or less number of such steps might readily become developed in her; and thus we can understand the frequent gradations from an extreme difference to none at all between the sexes of allied species. These cases of gradation, it may be added, are much too common to favour the supposition that we here see females actually undergoing the process of transition and losing their brightness for the sake of protection; for we have every reason to conclude that at any one time the greater number of species are in a <b>fixed</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
60|$|Let me shew {{you another}} {{experiment}} {{with a piece}} of iron. It will serve two purposes--shewing you what the blowpipe does as a source of heat, and what it does by sending that heat where it is wanted. I have taken iron in contrast with silver or other metals, that you may see the difference of action, and so be more interested in the experiment. Here is our fuel, the coal-gas; and here our oxygen. Having thus my power of heat, I apply it to the iron, which, as you see, soon gets red-hot. It is now flowing about like a globule of melted mercury. But observe, I cannot raise any vapour: it is now covered with a coat of melted oxide, and unless I have a great power in my blowpipe, it is hardly possible to break through it. Now, then, you see these beautiful sparks: you have not only a beautiful kind of combustion, but you see the iron is being driven off, not producing smoke, but burning in a <b>fixed</b> <b>condition.</b> How different this is from the action of some other metals--that piece of antimony, for instance, which we saw just now throwing off abundance of fumes. We can, of course, burn away this iron by giving plenty of air to it; but with the bodies which Deville wants to expose to this intense heat he has not that means: the gas itself must have power enough to drive off the slag which forms {{on the surface of the}} metal, and power to impinge upon the platinum so as to get the full contact that he wants for the fusion to take place. We see here, then, the means to which he resorts--oxygen, and either coal-gas or water-gas[19], or pure hydrogen, for producing heat, and the blowpipe for the purpose of impelling the heated current upon the metals.|$|E
60|$|Various facts {{support the}} {{conclusion}} that with the greater number of brilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera, it is the male which has been modified; the two sexes having come to differ from each other, or to resemble each other, according to which form of inheritance has prevailed. Inheritance is governed by so many unknown laws or conditions, {{that they seem to}} us to be most capricious in their action;[524] and we can so far understand how it is that with closely-allied species the sexes of some differ to an astonishing degree, whilst the sexes of others are identical in colour. As the successive steps in the process of variation are necessarily all transmitted through the female, a greater or less number of such steps might readily become developed in her; and thus we can understand the frequent gradations from an extreme difference to no difference at all between the sexes of the species within the same group. These cases of gradation are much too common to favour the supposition that we here see females actually undergoing the process of transition and losing their brightness for the sake of protection; for we have every reason to conclude that at any one time the greater number of species are in a <b>fixed</b> <b>condition.</b> With respect to the differences between the females of the species in the same genus or family, we can perceive that they depend, at least in part, on the females partaking of the colours of their respective males. This is well illustrated in those groups in which the males are ornamented to an extraordinary degree; for the females in these groups generally partake to a certain extent of the splendour of their male partners. Lastly, we continually find, as already remarked, that the females of almost all the species in the same genus, or even family, resemble each other much more closely in colour than do the males; and this indicates that the males have undergone a greater amount of modification than the females.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{specimen}} of this bushwhacking, that [...] "shoe strike." [...] Now be it understood that I do not pretend {{to know all}} about the matter. I am merely going to speculate a little about some of its phases. And at the outset, I am {{glad to see that}} a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to work under all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay them or not! I like the system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. One of the reasons why I am opposed to slavery is just here. What is the true condition of the laborer? I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So, while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no <b>fixed</b> <b>condition</b> of labor for his whole life. I am not ashamed to confess that twenty-five years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a flatboat--just what might happen to any poor man's son! I want every man to have a chance--and I believe a Black man is entitled to it--in which he can better his condition; when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally to hire men to work for him! That is the system. Up here in New England, you have a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and yet where will you find wealthy men so wealthy, and poverty so rarely in extremity? There is not another such place on earth! I desire that if you get too thick here, and find it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may have a chance to strike and go somewhere else, where you may not be degraded, nor have your families corrupted, by forced rivalry with negro slaves. I want you to have a clean bed and no snakes in it! Then you can better your condition, and so it may go on and on in one endless round so long as man exists {{on the face of the}} earth! ...|$|E

Here, we employ Event-Related Potentials to provide electrophysiological evidence that action errors during a Go/No-go task can result either from sustained attention failures, or from failures of response inhibition, and that these two processes are temporally and physiologically dissociable, even though the behavioural error ? a non-intended response ? is the same. Thirteen right-handed participants performed a version of a Go/No-go task in which stimuli were presented in a fixed and predictable order thus encouraging attentional drift and a second version in which an identical set of stimuli were presented in a random order thus placing greater emphasis on response inhibition. Electro-cortical markers associated with goal maintenance (late positivity, alpha synchronisation) distinguished correct and incorrect performance in the <b>fixed</b> <b>condition</b> while errors in the random condition were linked to a diminished N 2 /P 3 inhibitory complex.
