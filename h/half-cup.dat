5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a <b>half-cup</b> of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E
5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building a neat <b>half-cup</b> mud nest {{with a soft}} lining. Both adults incubate the two to four eggs and feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large population mean that there are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form.

The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E
5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a <b>half-cup</b> of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E

Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen.

500|$|This rockfowl builds its nest {{onto the}} sides of rocks, {{normally}} in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest.

40|$|Phagocytosis is {{the process}} by which cells {{internalize}} particulate material, and is of central importance to immunity, homeostasis and development. Here, we study the internalization of immunoglobulin G-coated particles in cells transfected with Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) through the formation of an enveloping phagocytic cup. Using confocal microscopy, we precisely track the location of fluorescently tagged FcγRs during cup growth. Surprisingly, we found that phagocytic cups growing around identical spherical particles showed great variability even within a single cell and exhibited two eventual fates: a cup either stalled before forming a <b>half-cup</b> or it proceeded until the particle was fully enveloped. We explain these observations in terms of a mechanical bottleneck using a simple mathematical model of the overall process of cup growth. The model predicts that reducing F-actin concentration levels, and hence the deforming force, does not necessarily lead to stalled cups, a prediction we verify experimentally. Our analysis gives a coherent explanation for the importance of geometry in phagocytic uptake and provides a unifying framework for integrating the key processes, both biochemical and mechanical, occurring during cup growth...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of {{nutrient}} rich {{foods such}} as beans and peas is recommended because these foods provide key nutrients and relatively little energy. Many consumers are unfamiliar with dried beans or {{do not have the}} time to prepare them. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare nutrient density and nutrient-to-cost among dried cooked, canned (liquid and solids), and canned/drained black, garbanzo, kidney, lima, pinto, white beans, and black-eyed peas. Prices were obtained from 60 grocery stores in January 2009. Nutrient content per 100 g was calculated using the U. S. Department of Agriculture Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22, and Nutrition Data System for Research (for canned/drained). Nutrient density scores were estimated using the Nutrient Rich Food Index 9. 3 (NRF 9. 3). Nutrient-to-cost ratio (NTCR) was computed as the NRF 9. 3 score (per 100 kcal) divided by the cost per <b>half-cup</b> servings per package (12) or per can (3. 5). Compared to canned beans, dried cooked beans were significantly more energy dense, contained more protein, fiber, iron, potassium and magnesium; and less sodium than canned beans (p < 0. 05 for all). Canned/drained beans contained more sodium than cooked beans (p < 0. 05). NRF 9. 3 scores were 7. 3, 2. 8, and 4. 8 for cooked, canned, and canned/drained beans, respectively. NTCR for cooked, canned, and canned/drained beans was 63. 4, 8. 9, and 15. 2, respectively. Results highlight the benefits of choosing dried beans and also illustrate that canned beans, when drained, provide a healthy alternative. Beans, regardless of type/form, are a nutrient rich food and should be encouraged as part of an overall healthy diet...|$|E
