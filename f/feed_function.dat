40|$|News <b>feed</b> <b>function</b> {{becomes very}} popular in many social network-ing {{services}} and news aggregators, as it delivers the messages from users ’ subscribed sources. More recently, location has been intro-duced to the news <b>feed</b> <b>function,</b> which returns the news items rel-evant to the user’s location. However, with {{the large number of}} the news items generated by the sources, existing news feed systems opt to return the top-k most recent ones, which completely over-looks the messages ’ spatial relevance and may end up in missing more geographically close ones. In this paper, we present Geo-Rank, an efficient location-aware news feed ranking system that provides top-k new feeds based on (a) spatial proximity, (b) tem-poral proximity, and (c) user preferences. GeoRank encapsu-lates spatio-temporal pruning techniques to improve its response time and efficiency. GeoRank is composed of two main modules, namely, query processor and message updater. The query proces-sor module is triggered by the user, upon logging on to the system, to provide the top-k ranked location-based news feeds. The mes-sage updatermodule is a process running in the background, which keeps maintaining statistics used by the query processor module. Extensive experimental results, based on real and synthetic data sets, show the scalability and efficiency of GeoRank...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device and {{a process for}} the conveyance of material, in particular wire- or bar-shaped welding filler material, of different diameters or cross-sectional measurements having one or several permanently integrated feed rollers, i. e. without changing rollers. Said device {{is characterized by the}} fact that the profiles of a drive and an associated counterpressure roller are matched to each other in such a way that the frictional connection is not only ensured with large cross-sectional measurements (e. g. large diameters) of the material to be fed, but also for small cross-sectional measurements (e. g. small wire thicknesses) by the intermeshing of the profiles of the two rollers. This is achieved, for example, by a V groove and a trapezoidal mating profile. The main advantages are the guidance function exerted simultaneously with the <b>feed</b> <b>function,</b> the comparably low deformation op the conveyed material and the adjustable feed velocity which is almost indepedent of the cross-sectional measurements (e. g. wire diameters) of the material as a result of the suitable design of the roller diameter and the roller profiles...|$|E

This paper examines the potential factors and its relative impact on influencing the effectiveness of using Facebook as a knowledge-sharing tool during students’ professional education. A case study was implemented to study a group of university students’ perspectives on using Facebook in their internship. The findings are presented in 4 dimensions, ranging from Human, Policy, Technology, and Knowledge aspects as the theoretical framework with 17 potential factors identified. Among the findings, Social Tie got the highest impact in Human aspects as Facebook could create a peer support network among students. Scaffolding reflections has the highest impact among Policy factors because guidance can assist students to formulate content for their reflective journals. Facebook’s News <b>Feed</b> <b>function</b> has been recognized as the highest influence among Technology factors because this function enables students to be updated instantly and frequently on the latest development within the internship activities. Explicit knowledge transfer reached the highest impact among Knowledge factors as students can apply Information Management related model into their working situations. All in all, {{the findings of the}} study also proved that factors from the literature are applicable to the professional experience internship context. This study provides insights for universities to better utilize Facebook to support knowledge transfer in students’ internships. The theoretical framework used in this study may serve as a basis for further research on the use of Facebook for knowledge transfer.

Aging is not a factor that directly influences mastication performance, whereas masticatory performance is greatly influenced by tooth loss, and associated with occlusal force, hyposalivation and oral stereognostic ability.

40|$|Studies of pigeon {{behavior}} in which magazine-cycle duration is varied suggest that many researchers assume that feeders of different designs dispense food {{at roughly the}} same rate. However, Epstein (1981) showed that, with a commonly used feeder, the amount of grain a pigeon consumes is a negatively accelerated function of magazine-cycle duration. The present experiment shows that, with a different commonly used feeder, amount consumed is roughly a linear function of magazine-cycle duration. At a duration of 60 seconds, the second feeder dispenses roughly 10 times as much food as the first.

Irrespective of <b>feeding</b> <b>function,</b> the species composition and dominance structure of benthic invertebrate communities were determined by local abiotic variables such as exposure, depth and sediment type. Regional weather variables (average southerly winds, salinity, water temperature, ice conditions) either separately or interactively contributed to the variability of benthic invertebrates. Nutrient loading had significant effects on benthic invertebrates only in interactions with local abiotic or regional weather variables. Herbivores, deposit feeders and suspension feeders exhibited a stronger response to the studied environmental variables than carnivores. All this suggests that (1) the dynamic coastal habitats studied in this work are not very sensitive to shifts in nutrient loading and (2) local abiotic conditions and weather patterns largely define the observed biotic patterns.

In general, fusion occurred earlier in neurocranial sutures than in the splachnocranium, although rostral sutures never became fused.

These modifications occur during the first year, from the late juvenile stages, when individuals are similar to adults in general appearance and body size as well as in skull size. However, it was noted that basicranial synchondroses became fused in the adult stages, indicating that longitudinal growth could extend until this latter time.
