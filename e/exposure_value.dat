25|$|In photography, {{dynamic range}} is {{measured}} in <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> (EV) differences (known as stops). An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling {{of the amount of}} light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.|$|E
500|$|In photography, {{exposure}} values are {{measured in terms}} of the binary logarithm of the amount of light reaching the film or sensor, in accordance with the Weber–Fechner law describing a logarithmic response of the human visual system to light. A single stop of exposure is one unit on a base- logarithmic scale. More precisely, the <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> of a photograph is defined as ...|$|E
2500|$|In photography, stops {{are also}} a unit used to {{quantify}} ratios of light or exposure, with each added stop meaning a factor of two, and each subtracted stop meaning a factor of one-half. The one-stop unit {{is also known as}} the EV (<b>exposure</b> <b>value)</b> unit. On a camera, the aperture setting is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps, known as f-stops. Each [...] "stop" [...] is marked with its corresponding f-number, and represents a halving of the light intensity from the previous stop. This corresponds to a decrease of the pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of 1/ or about 0.7071, and hence a halving of the area of the pupil.|$|E

For simplicity, they are rounded to the nearest integer, and they omit numerous considerations described in the ANSI exposure guides from which they are derived. Moreover, they take no account of color shifts or reciprocity failure. Proper use of tabulated <b>exposure</b> <b>values</b> is explained in detail in the ANSI exposure guide, ANSI PH2.7-1986.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{combinations}} of shutter speed and f-number {{can give the}} same <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> (E.V.). According to <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> formula, doubling the exposure time doubles the amount of light (subtracts 1 EV). Reducing the aperture size at multiples of one over the square root of two lets half as much light into the camera, usually at a predefined scale of f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, and so on. For example, f/8 lets 4 times more light into the camera as f/16 does. A shutter speed of 1/50 s with an 4.0 aperture gives the same <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> as a 1/100 s shutter speed with an 2.8 aperture, and also the same <b>exposure</b> <b>value</b> as a 1/200 s shutter speed with an 2.0 aperture, or 1/25th second at f/5.6.|$|E

40|$|In {{the western}} part of the Philippines, in the Palawan province, studies have shown that large {{quantities}} of mercury are spread to the surrounding area during heavy rainfall. In addition, mercury is spread to rice fields and bioaccumulated in marine fish and seafood. The mercury originates from the abandoned Palawan Quicksilver Mine. Since mercury is toxic for the human body and new studies have shown that mercury accumulates in rice, it is important to investigate human exposure from mercury in rice. This project investigates the total amount of mercury and methylmercury (MeHg) accumulated in rice, soil and water from four different rice fields in Palawan. The soil samples have been taken directly from the fields and water samples have been taken from nearby streams and springs. Rice grains harvested earlier this year from the same fields have been collected from farmers. The soil, water and rice samples were analyzed in Manila and rice samples were as well analyzed in Sweden and China. Furthermore, this project contains a dietary survey and calculation of daily <b>exposure</b> <b>values</b> of MeHg. The survey investigates how often people eat fish and rice and if they have dental amalgam. It also investigates possible health problems related to mercury exposure from rice and fish consumption. The analyses from China show that rice samples from all barangays contain total mercury and MeHg. Analyses from Sweden also show that rice from the barangays contains total mercury but the levels were found to be higher than the ones analyzed in China. Furthermore, the health problems found in the diet survey were hard to relate to mercury exposure from rice since the health problems can be caused by other factors. When calculating daily <b>exposure</b> <b>values,</b> the values were found to be as high as the recommended maximum acceptable daily intake in one of the barangays. There might therefore be a risk of eating rice from these four barangays. It is important to consider that these daily <b>exposure</b> <b>values</b> were only based on MeHg exposure from rice consumption, not taking dental amalgam and fish consumption into consideration. This means that the daily <b>exposure</b> <b>values</b> might be even higher than the ones calculated in this study...|$|R
