40|$|Policies to {{effectively}} reduce deforestation are discussed within a land rent (von Thünen) framework. The {{first set of}} policies attempts to reduce the rent of extensive agriculture, either by neglecting extension, marketing, and infrastructure, generating alternative income opportunities, stimulating intensive agricultural production or by reforming land tenure. The second set aims to increase either extractive or protective <b>forest</b> <b>rent</b> and—more importantly—create institutions (community forest management) or markets (payment for environmental services) that enable land users to capture {{a larger share of}} the protective <b>forest</b> <b>rent.</b> The third set aims to limit forest conversion directly by establishing protected areas. Many of these policy options present local win–lose scenarios between forest conservation and agricultural production. Local yield increases tend to stimulate agricultural encroachment, contrary to the logic of the global food equation that suggests yield increases take pressure off forests. At national and global scales, however, policy makers are presented with a more pleasant scenario. Agricultural production in developing countries has increased by 3. 3 – 3. 4 % annually over the last 2 decades, whereas gross deforestation has increased agricultural area by only 0. 3 %, suggesting a minor role of forest conversion in overall agricultural production. A spatial delinking of remaining forests and intensive production areas should also help reconcile conservation and production goals in the future...|$|E

Data collected from 250 households were used for OC estimation. REDD+ payment was estimated as the net present value (NPV) of agricultural rent and <b>forest</b> <b>rent</b> during land clearing, minus net returns from sustainable wood harvest, divided by the corresponding reduction in carbon stock. The median compensation required to protect the current carbon stock in the two vegetation types ranged from USD 1 tCO 2 e− 1 for the montane forest to USD 39 tCO 2 e− 1 for the degraded miombo woodlands, of which up to 70 % and 16 %, respectively, were for compensating OCs from <b>forest</b> <b>rent</b> during land clearing. The figures were significantly higher when the cost of farmers’ own labor was not taken into account in NPV calculations. The results also highlighted that incentives in the form of sustainable harvests could offset up to 55 % of the total median OC to protect the montane forest and up to 45 % to protect the miombo woodlands, depending on the wage rates. The findings suggest that given the possible factors that can potentially affect estimates of REDD+ payments, avoiding deforestation of the montane forest would be feasible under the REDD+ scheme. However, implementation of the policy in villages around the miombo area would require very high compensation levels.

But, unlike companies in developed countries, the Ukrainian practice faces significant problems connected with recording of data and results of their use. Having examined the standards of domestic and foreign regulatory accounting of individual objects of nature, we can state that natural resources have the characteristics of property, but at the same time, there are significant differences. The author suggests three options for managing accounting of natural resources and appropriate rent from them, to create a special standard; improve existing standards of accounting for fixed assets, costs and revenues; make a link to a special standard, which reveals the methodology of natural resources accounting. Natural rent is the income derived from ownership or use of certain natural resources (land, water, forests, minerals and mining area).

Malaysia has the highest ratio of agricultural imports to total land-based sector imports, the rise in agricultural prices thus hits Malaysian consumers the hardest. We find that terms of trade effect omitted from the partial equilibrium framework may reduce the welfare calculations for Malaysia and Indonesia in the forest sector trade by as much as 106 and 58 %, respectively. This points to the importance of general equilibrium modelling in the logging industry. The same applies to other sector specific analyses where trade is concentrated between few countries.

40|$|The {{diversification}} model {{proposed in}} Chapter 1 emphasizes ecological change {{after a few}} decades of quasi-monoculture. Is it also a primary determinant of diversification for the world's leading producer of cocoa? In the early-to-mid 2010 s, cocoa production in Côte d'Ivoire is above 1. 5 million tonnes per year. This growth dynamic is mainly explained by the universal model of cocoa economies: new migrations leading to massive clearing of forests. The decline of the old cocoa farms rarely appears in statistics due to the massive new planting mostly {{at the expense of}} the last pockets of forests. However, in the old cocoa and coffee regions, the lure of rubber and oil palm cultivation has increasingly gone hand in hand with lower cocoa yields, the fight against insect damage and diseases, and difficulties of replanting. It has led to the clearing of cocoa plantations or the cultivation of rubber in the understory of old cocoa trees waiting to be felled. In addition to factors of price and public policy (for example, the creation of a hybrid oil palm and clonal rubber sectors in the 1960 s), the process of diversification was partly driven by deforestation and exhaustion of the <b>forest</b> <b>rent.</b> For many smallholders, even more than markets and cocoa prices which need a serious stimulus, and besides the land conflicts, the answer rests on the ability of research and the chocolate industry to come up with technological advances applicable at low cost to help them to solve the universal problems of cocoa replanting.

40|$|Under REDD+, the {{enhancement}} of carbon stocks through reforestation and restoration of degraded forest landscapes offers considerable potential benefits. In the Asia-Pacific region, however, many previous reforestation and forest restoration initiatives have exacerbated existing inequities by concentrating resources among powerful political and economic actors, often {{to the detriment of}} forest-dependent communities. Both in design and implementation, tree-planting programs have been guided by <b>forest</b> <b>rent</b> distribution practices of state forestry bureaucracies and by corporate accumulation strategies linked to increasingly globalized commodity chains. This article examines the political economy of reforestation and forest restoration programs in Asia-Pacific and highlights governance challenges these pose. In various contexts, they have: consolidated the control of state agencies and corporate actors over 'degraded' forest landscapes, often resulting in the displacement of rural communities; exacerbated economic disparities by channeling large capital subsidies and resource rents to companies with close ties to state elites; facilitated corruption and financial fraud, in some cases on a grand scale; accelerated biodiversity loss by creating perverse incentives for the conversion of 'degraded' secondary forests; and generated mixed results for rural small-holders, at times locking them in inequitable agreements with plantation companies, and in other cases, offering enhanced tenure security. To avoid the negative results of earlier reforestation schemes. REDD+ must incorporate: (1) rightsbased spatial planning; (2) equitable and accountable distribution of financial incentives: (3) improved financial governance to prevent corruption and fraud; (4) policy reform to remove perverse incentives for forest conversion; (5) strengthening of economic benefits and safeguards for small-holders...|$|E

40|$|Land-based {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide derive from the interface of forest and agriculture. Emission estimates require harmonization across forest and non-forest data sources. Furthermore, emission reduction requires understanding of the linked causes and policy levers between agriculture and forestry. The institutional forestry traditions dominated the emergence of the discourse on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) whilemore holistic perspectives on land-based emissions, including agriculture, found a home in international recognition for Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). We tested the hypothesis that, at least for Indonesia, the NAMA framework provides opportunities to resolve issues that REDD+ alone cannot address. We reviewed progress on five major challenges identified in 2007 by the Indonesian Forest Climate Alliance: 1) scope and ‘forest’ definition; 2) ownership and tenurial rights; 3) multiplicity and interconnectedness of drivers; 4) peatland issues across forest and non-forest land categories; and 5) fairness and efficiency of benefitdistribution mechanisms across conservation, degradation and restoration phases of tree-cover transition. Results indicate that the two policy instruments developed in parallel with competition rather than synergy. Three of the REDD+ challenges can be resolved by treating REDD+ as a subset of the NAMA and national emission reduction plans for Indonesia. We conclude that two issues, rights and benefit distribution, remain a major challenge, and require progress on a motivational pyramid of policy and polycentric governance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} analyzing tropical deforestation and reforestation using the von Thunen model as its starting point: land is allocated to the use which yields the highest rent, and the rents of various land uses are determined by location. Forest cover change therefore becomes a question of changes in rent of forest versus non-forest use. While this is a simple and powerful starting point, more intriguing issues arise when this is applied to analyze real cases. An initial shift in the rent of one particular land use generates feedbacks which affect the rent of all land uses. For example, a new technology in extensive agriculture should make this land use more profitable and lead to more forest clearing, but general equilibrium effects (changes in prices and local wages) can modify or even reverse this conclusion. Another issue is how a policy change or a shift in broader market, technological, and institutional forces will affect various land use rents. The paper deals with three such areas: technological progress in agriculture, land tenure regimes, and community forest management. The {{second part of the}} paper links the von Thunen framework to the forest transition theory. The forest transition theory describes a sequence over time where a forested region goes through a period of deforestation before the forest cover eventually stabilizes and starts to increase. This sequence {{can be seen as a}} systematic pattern of change in the agricultural and forest land rents over time. Increasing agricultural rent leads to high rates of deforestation. The slow-down of deforestation and eventual reforestation is due to lower agricultural rents (the economic development path) and higher <b>forest</b> <b>rent</b> (the forest scarcity path). Various forces leading to these changes are discussed and supported by empirical evidence from different tropical regions.

40|$|As with cocoa a {{combination}} of available land and centres with fairly dense population {{is a prerequisite for}} a boom. But in the case of rubber the boom has been far more progressive than that for cocoa due to 3 main factors. Firstly, Sumatra and Kalimantan islands were almost empty {{at the turn of the}} century with population density inferior to 5 inhabitants/km². It took time for migrants (mainly from neighbouring Java in the case of Sumatra) as well as indigenous population (local Dayak and Chinese migrants in Kalimantan) to conquest the vast central plains of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Secondly, however the demand was very strong and rubber prices very attractive, first planting have been physically limited by both distances and seeds availability. The main rubber cropping system has been the jungle rubber system based on the use of unselected seedlings. Seeds were collected in Estates, mainly located in North-Sumatra and West-Java, and then distributed or sold to farmers through networks of traders or missionaries. Another constraint was that seed production was limited to 1 month per year and seeds have to be planted within 4 weeks after harvest. Last, infrastructure and trade were not as developed in the first half of the century as they were in the second half when the cocoa boom occurred (in particular since the 1980 's). Rubber has been immediately seen by local farmers as a very promising crop mainly due to its ability to be combined with the secondary forest regrowth in a complex agroforestry system called jungle rubber (Penot 2001). With unselected rubber seedlings (at no cost), no inputs (no fertilisers nor herbicide [...] ) and a very limited labour requirement for planting after upland rice, jungle rubber is very easy to implement as it does profit directly from the “forest rent” (Ruf 1987). The lack of capital requirement fo establishment and the very progressive migrations enable us to define jungle rubber as a typical indigenous agroforestry. Jungle rubber being very close to secondary forest in terms of bio-mass and structure, one can consider that jungle rubber do maintain the <b>forest</b> <b>rent</b> and create a sustainable and permanent “agroforest rent “. These areas were inhabited by Malayu close to rivers and Kubus people in the primary forests in Sumatra, and by dayaks peoples in in hinterland when the coasts were populated with Malayu, Banjar or Javanese peoples in Kalimantan. Harvesting time may not be adapted to recommended planting periods for rubber as harvest and climatic conditions differ significantly between North and South-Sumatra due to their respective position around the Equator. Indonesia is now the second largest producer behind Thailand. ...|$|E

40|$|This infobrief {{provides}} {{key points}} that in exploring the link from forests to poverty alleviation, two key questions arise: What role can forests and forestry {{play in the}} efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries? And {{to what extent do}} forests help prevent extreme hardship, even when they don’t reduce poverty? A striking gap exists between, on the one hand, the neglect of forests in economic development and poverty reduction strategies and on the other, the high (and sometimes unrealistic) expectations regarding the role for forest products in parts of the forest literature. From a macro-level perspective, economic growth normally does trickle down to the poor, at least over time and at aggregate scales. The forest literature tends to ignore this effect, including the impact of <b>forest</b> <b>rents</b> flowing into other sectors. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) serve subsistence needs, can have important ‘gap filling’ fnctions and sometimes provide regular cash income. However, there is a strong association between poverty and NTFP dependence. Paradoxically, the same characteristics that make NTFPs important and attractive to the poor, also limit their potential for increasing incomes. Timber has traditionally been the rich man’s lot but the current trends of increased local control over natural forests, smallholder tree growing and small scale, wood-based enterprises may somewhat modify this picture. The realm of payments for ecological services is expanding rapidly and has a huge potential but {{the extent to which the}} poor will benefit remains uncertain. The choices relating to livelihood and poverty definitions, concepts and indicators clearly influence policy and project design, as well as research results and interpretations. Particularly promising topics for future study are identified within the fields of: assessing current forest-based benefits to the poor; exploring emerging market opportunities; and evaluating cross-cutting institutional and extra-sectoral issues...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{employed}} an econometric framework of land-use shares at {{the scale of}} a district to analyse the effects of different socio-economic, bio-physical and climatic factors on land-share allocations to agriculture, forest and grass shrubland in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s Region of Ethiopia. The results of the empirical analysis confirmed the significant role played by access to credit, access to markets, population density and road density in the allocation of land to competing uses. The results {{have important implications for}} the sustainability of current agricultural intensification policies and rural development strategies in Ethiopia, such as the sustainable land management (SLMP) initiative. For example, it is important to include densely populated regions in the SLMP target areas, as high population pressure remains a major cause of land conversion to agriculture and hence needs to be addressed. It will be necessary to create income and employment opportunities outside farming to reduce the pressure of population growth on land. Care must be taken in identifying routes for the construction of rural road networks with minimal environmental impact. Credit provision must consider other, more capital-intensive technologies such as the irrigation needed to reduce pressure on the land through improved productivity. In addition to the promotion of higher adoption of modern technologies to levels that allow the realisation of the land-saving effects of intensification and productivity gains, strategies and policies are needed to encourage intensification of agricultural production in non-forested land. Furthermore, forest policies that facilitate the capturing of <b>forest</b> <b>rents</b> are important for the preservation of forests. Programmes and strategies to exploit multiple benefits from the various forest ecosystems’ services, such as clear and secure land and forest property rights, and land use and forest policies that give carbon rights to land users and allow communal administration of forests, are prerequisites to enhance forest benefits as the main incentive for conservation.
