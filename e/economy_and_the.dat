Given this growth, telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the world <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> global telecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012.

5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away.

In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories.

The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews).
