40|$|Summary PhD thesis Sandra J. A. van Kuijk Carbohydrates {{in plant}} cell walls are highly {{fermentable}} {{and could be}} used as a source for ruminant nutrition or biofuel production. The presence of lignin in cell walls hampers the utilization of these carbohydrates and should thus be removed. In this thesis, the possibilities of a <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> of lignocellulosic biomass are investigated. A review of the scientific literature focusing on the potential of fungal treatments to increase the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass in ruminants feed ingredients is presented in Chapter 2. A prerequisite to the effective use of high lignocellulose feed ingredients is lignin removal, since lignin is negatively correlated to in vitro rumen degradability. Selective lignin degrading fungi have proven to increase in vitro rumen degradability with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Pleurotus eryngii showing the greatest potential. The effectiveness of <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> is not only dependent on the choice of fungal strain, but also on the choice of substrate and culture conditions. Based on the literature review, four different edible fungal species, i. e. Ganoderma lucidum, Lentinula edodes, P. eryngii and P. ostreatus were chosen to treat four different substrates, i. e. miscanthus, rice straw, wheat straw and wood chips. The results of these fungal-substrate combinations are described in Chapter 3 and confirm that fungal species, substrate and incubation time are important factors in <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment.</b> The most promising fungus-substrate combinations are L. edodes treatment of wheat straw and L. edodes treatment of wood chips. These two fungus-substrate combinations were used in a more detailed characterization of changes in lignin upon <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment.</b> In Chapter 4, a study is described where L. edodes treated wheat straw and wood chips are analyzed by pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) confirming the selective lignin degradation as determined with the detergent fiber analysis. Structural changes in lignin were observed with preferential degradation of syringyl (S) lignin units over guaiacyl (G) lignin units by L. edodes. Upon fungal delignification, a number of degradation products of lignin were observed. The building blocks in the original lignin consist of phenolic groups with 3 C-atoms in the side chain, while degradation products consist of phenolic groups with 0 to 2 C-atoms in the side chain. The ratio between side chain degradation products and original compounds was increasing in both wheat straw and wood chips upon L. edodes treatment. Besides side chain degradation, L. edodes modified the Cα-atom of the side chain by oxidation. Although correlations were found, a clear relationship between lignin composition and in vitro rumen degradability could not be demonstrated. The safety of a <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> of ruminant feed ingredients requires the used fungus to have a Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) status. The literature data compiled in Chapter 2 indicates C. subvermispora, which does not have a GRAS status, as one of the most promising fungi for <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment.</b> For this reason this fungus was included in the remaining chapters. This fungus was researched in Chapter 5 with the substrates wheat straw and wood chips and compared to L. edodes. Both fungi selectively degraded lignin and improved in vitro rumen degradability and the amount of sugar released upon enzymatic saccharification. L. edodes continuously grew on wheat straw and wood chips while degrading lignin and hemicellulose at the same time. C. subvermispora colonized the wheat straw within the first week of treatment and starts degrading lignin and hemicellulose thereafter. Growth continued again after 5 weeks, which was accompanied by cellulose degradation. On wood chips, C. subvermispora stopped growing after the first week of treatment, while lignin degradation continued until 4 weeks of treatment. From 5 weeks onwards, no chemical changes were observed in wood chips. One of the explanations for this lack of change is the dense structure of the wood as observed with light microscopy. Both fungi degraded hemicellulose simultaneously with lignin. The loss of carbohydrates during <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> and the long treatment times of up to 8 weeks represent a major disadvantage of <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> of lignocellulosic biomass. In Chapter 6, the incubation of C. subvermispora and L. edodes with wheat straw and wood chips were supplemented with urea to stimulate growth, and manganese and linoleic acid to stimulate lignin degradation via the enzyme manganese peroxidase produced by the fungi. Addition of manganese increased the selectivity of C. subvermispora treatment of wheat straw within the first 4 weeks of treatment. Addition of 150 µg manganese per g substrate improved lignin degradation and in vitro rumen degradability the most. A combination of manganese and linoleic acid did not show synergistic effects. In Chapter 7 the particle size of wheat straw and wood chips, and the amount of C. subvermispora or L. edodes at the start of the treatment was varied. The amount of fungus added at the start of the treatment did not have an effect on colonization rate, lignin degradation or in vitro rumen degradability. L. edodes treatment of wheat straw chopped to 2 cm particles resulted in a higher lignin degradation and in vitro rumen degradability compared to L. edodes treatment of wheat straw chopped to a length of 0. 5 cm. The particle size of wood chips did not have an effect on C. subvermispora treatment. In C. subvermispora treated wheat straw and L. edodes treated wood chips, a reduced growth was observed, which was unexpected based on results from previous experiments. A toxic compound to fungi (fungicide) was identified. This thesis describes the potential of <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> to increase utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. <b>Fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in an increased in vitro rumen degradability, and thus an increased cellulose accessibility. The same theory applies for biofuel production in which <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> results in an increased accessibility of cellulose for enzymes. The major disadvantages of this low cost, relatively simple and environmentally-friendly biotechnological treatment are the loss of carbohydrates during the relatively long process of fungal incubation. Future studies should focus on optimization of the <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> to enable large scale application.  ...|$|E
40|$|Soils {{that are}} {{contaminated}} {{with the most}} recalcitrant organic contaminants, such as high molecular weight polyaromatic hydrocarbons (HMW PAH) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F), cannot be degraded efficiently by conventional composting. The only available treatment method for these soils, which destroys the contaminants, is combustion at high temperature. This thesis examines three alternative fungal methods to treat these soils: 1) treatment with fungal enzymes, 2) treatment with fungal inoculum, and 3) <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> used as a pre-treatment to improve the energy efficacy in combustion. Manganese peroxidase (MnP), which belongs to lignin-modifying enzymes (LME), was produced and used to treat PCDD/F-contaminated soil in the laboratory scale. Nevertheless, no degradation with a MnP preparation was observed, although {{a substantial amount of}} MnP activity was found in the soil still after 10 days of incubation. Both PAH- and PCDD/F- contaminated soils were treated with fungal inoculum in the laboratory scale. HMW PAHs were degraded significantly more by the fungi than by the indigenous microbes alone in the laboratory experiments, where the PAH concentration of soil was 3500 mg kg - 1 (sum of 16 PAH). Treatment with Phanerochaete velutina (inoculum) resulted to degradation of 96 % of 4 - ring PAHs and 39 % of 5 - and 6 -ring PAHs in three months. With PCDD/F-contaminated soil, no degradation was observed in the control, but the degradation of PCDD/Fs with fungal treatments was significant (P. velutina : 62 %, Stropharia rugosoannulata : 64 % of WHO-TEQ value). <b>Fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> of PAH-contaminated soil was also applied in the field scale (2 t). However, both P. velutina (inoculum) and control treatment resulted in equal degradation in soil with lower PAH concentration (1400 mg kg - 1, sum of 16 PAH) : 94 % of the 16 PAHs were degraded in three months. <b>Fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> was even applied as a pre-treatment for contaminated soil with high organic matter content, and which will be later combusted. In the pilot-scale (300 kg), 13 % degradation of the original organic matter content was obtained in 6 months. To conclude, <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> is reasonable to apply for soils with organic contaminants that cannot be bioremediated by composting. With soils contaminated by chlorinated dioxins, this is always the case, but also PAH-contaminated soils with high total concentration or high proportion of HMW-PAHs.

Fermented sugar beet pulp inoculated with Trichoderma viride was supplemented to PH at rates of 5. 0, 10. 0 and 15. 0 g/ 100 g air dry of PH andmixed well before aerobic incubation for 21 days. Organic matter (OM) content of PH declined with increased levels of fermented sugar beet pulp inoculums, while crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and ash increased. Fiber contents were decreased with both treatments of fermented sugar beet pulp and urea. Total N of PH increased with urea treatment, which reduced the true protein N to total protein N ratio. In sacco degradabilities of dry matter (DM), OM, and CP with urea treatment increased compared with <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment.</b> The DM intake of peanut hulls treated with fungus (PHF) was higher (P < 0. 05) than with peanut hulls treated with urea (PHU). Digestibility of OM, CP, neutral detergent fiber, and non-fiber carbohydrate by native breed Ossimi sheep with PH were higher (P < 0. 05) than with PH or urea treated PH. The intakes, losses, and balance of N increased (P < 0. 01) with PHF versus PH feeding. Feeding PHF increased (P < 0. 01) ruminal concentrations ofNH 3 -N, acetic acid, butyric acid, and the acetic to propionic acid ratio.

40|$|Background: The present work {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} lignin content and composition in the <b>fungal</b> <b>treatment</b> of lignocellulosic biomass {{in order to improve}} rumen degradability. Wheat straw and wood chips, differing in lignin composition, were treated with Lentinula edodes for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 wk and the changes occurring during fungal degradation were analyzed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and detergent fiber analysis. Results: L. edodes preferentially degraded lignin, with only limited cellulose degradation, in wheat straw and wood chips, leaving a substrate enriched in cellulose. Syringyl (S) -lignin units were preferentially degraded than guaiacyl (G) -lignin units, resulting in a decreased S/G ratio. A decreasing S/G ratio (wheat straw: r = − 0. 72, wood chips: r = − 0. 75) and selective lignin degradation (wheat straw: r = − 0. 69, wood chips: r = − 0. 88) were correlated with in vitro gas production (IVGP), a good indicator for rumen degradability. Conclusions: L. edodes treatment increased the IVGP of wheat straw and wood chips. Effects on IVGP were similar for wheat straw and wood chips indicating that lignin content and 3 D-structure of cell walls influence in vitro rumen degradability more than lignin composition.

Quantification of lignins, reducing sugars, pentoses and enzyme assays for cellulase, &# 0946;-glucosidase and xylanase were performed. Lignin content increased from 36 % in untreated waste to 63 % in autoclaved substrate. Lignin degradation of 9 % and 4. 2 % {{was achieved by}} P. chrysogenum and A. niger, respectively. Reducing sugars decreased by 1. 2 and 0. 7 kg/m 3 in T. harzianum and P. citrinum cultures, respectively. Pentose utilization was also considerable across all cultures. Cellulase and xylanase activities were higher in A. niger cultures at 45 U and 335 U, respectively. It also showed high &# 0946;-glucosidase activity of 155 U, marginally less than P. citrinum (180 U).

Fungal identity {{may therefore}} be a crucial factor determining stream food-web structure and complexity {{and extend the}} impact of microbial diversity to effects up through the food web. 2. In this study, we examined if shredder feeding {{is affected by the}} identity of fungi on leaves (bottom-up effects) and if preferences of shredders for particular fungi affect the composition of fungal assemblages (top-down effects). Oak leaf discs were conditioned in microcosms with six individual fungal species previously reported as highly palatable (P), unpalatable/rejected (R) and intermediate (I). Additionally, three microcosms were inoculated with three mixtures of four fungal species, each consisting of a different subset of the six species. 3. Colonised discs were offered to three detritivores with different feeding strategies: Proasellus sp. (Isopoda), Echinogammarus meridionalis (Amphipoda) and Schizopelex festiva (Trichoptera). When offered leaves colonised by single fungal species, consumption rates by E. meridionalis and S. festiva were higher on I, followed by P and, finally, R species. Consumption rates by Proasellus sp. were sim- ilar across <b>fungal</b> <b>treatments.</b> Consumption rates by the three invertebrates were also similar across all <b>fungal</b> multispecies <b>treatments,</b> suggesting that invertebrate preferences for, or rejection of, a given fungal species may be masked when it grows in proximity to other fungi.
