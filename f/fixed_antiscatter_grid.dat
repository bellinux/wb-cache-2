40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the performance of an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> and its potential benefit on image quality for a full-field digital mammography (FFDM) detector geometry at energies typical for temporal subtraction contrast-enhanced (CE) breast imaging. The signal intensities from primary, scatter, and glare were quantified in images acquired with an a-Si∕CsI(Tl) FFDM detector using a Rh target and a 0. 27 mm Cu filter at tube voltages ranging from 35 to 49 kV. Measurements were obtained at the center of the irradiation region of 20 – 80 mm thick breast-equivalent phantoms. The phantoms were imaged with and without an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid.</b> Based on these data, the performance of the <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> was determined by calculating the primary and scatter transmission factors (TP and TS) and Bucky factors (Bf). In addition, glare-to-primary ratios (GPRs) and scatter-to-primary ratios (SPRs) were quantified. The effect of the <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> on the signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) was also assessed. It was found that TP increases with kV but does not depend on the phantom thickness; TP values between 0. 81 and 0. 84 were measured. TS increases with kV and phantom thickness; TS values between 0. 13 and 0. 21 were measured. Bf decreases with kV and increases with phantom thickness; Bf ranges from 1. 4 to 2. 1. GPR is nearly constant, varying from 0. 10 to 0. 11. SPR without an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> (SPR−) ranges from 0. 35 to 1. 34. SPR− decreases by approximately 9 % from 35 to 49 kV for a given phantom thickness and is 3. 5 times larger for an 80 mm thick breast-equivalent phantom than for a 20 mm thick breast-equivalent phantom. SPR with an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> (SPR+) ranges from 0. 06 to 0. 31. SPR+ increases by approximately 23 % from 35 to 49 kV for a given phantom thickness; SPR+ is four times larger for an 80 mm breast-equivalent phantom than for a 20 mm breast-equivalent phantom. When imaging a 25 mm PMMA plate at the same mean glandular dose with and without an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid,</b> the SDNR is 4 % greater with a grid than without. For an 75 mm PMMA plate, the SDNR is 20 % greater with a grid. In conclusion, at the higher x-ray energy range used for CE-DM and CE-DBT, an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> significantly reduces SPR and improves SDNR. These effects are most pronounced for thick breasts...|$|R

40|$|Scattered photons—shortly scatter—are {{generated}} by interaction processes when photon beams interact with matter. In diagnostic radiology, they deteriorate image quality since they add an undesirable signal that lowers the contrast in projection radiography and causes cupping and streak artefacts in computed tomography (CT). Scatter {{is one of}} the most detrimental factors in cone beam CT owing to irradiation geometries using wide beams. It cannot be fully eliminated, nevertheless its amount can be lowered via scatter reduction techniques (air gaps, <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids,</b> collimators) and its effect on medical images can be suppressed via scatter correction algorithms. Aim: Develop a tool—a virtual tomograph—that simulates projections and performs image reconstructions similarly to a real CT scanner. Use this tool to evaluate the effect of scatter on projections and reconstructed images in cone beam CT. Propose improvements in CT scanner design and image reconstruction algorithms. Methods: A software toolkit (CTmod) based on the application development framework ROOT was written to simulate primary and scatter projections using analytic and Monte Carlo methods, respectively. It was used to calculate the amount of scatter in cone beam CT for anthropomorphic voxel phantoms and water cylinders. Configurations with and without bowtie filters, <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids,</b> and beam hardening corrections were investigated. Filtered back-projection was used to reconstruct images. Automatic threshold segmentation of volumetric CT data of anthropomorphic phantoms with known tissue compositions was tested to evaluate its usability in an iterative image reconstruction algorithm capable of performing scatter correction. Results: It was found that computer speed was the limiting factor for the deployment of this method in clinical CT scanners. It took several hours to calculate a single projection depending on the complexity of the geometry, number of simulated detector elements, and statistical precision. Data calculated using the CTmod code confirmed the already known facts that the amount of scatter is almost linearly proportional to the beam width, the scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) can be larger than 1 for body-size objects, and bowtie filters can decrease the SPR in certain regions of projections. Ideal <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids</b> significantly lowered the amount of scatter. The beneficial effect of classical <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids</b> in cone beam CT with flat panel imagers was not confirmed by other researchers nevertheless new grid designs are still being tested. A simple formula estimating the effect of scatter on the quality of reconstructed images was suggested and tested. Conclusions: It was shown that computer simulations could calculate the amount of scatter in diagnostic radiology. The Monte Carlo method was too slow for a routine use in contemporary clinical practice nevertheless it could be used to optimize CT scanner design and, with some enhancements, it could become a part of an image reconstruction algorithm that performs scatter correction...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies on}} {{performance}} evaluation of digital radiographic systems have primarily {{focused on the}} assessment of the detector performance alone. However, the clinical performance of such systems is also substantially impacted by magnification, focal spot blur, the presence of scattered radiation, and the presence of an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate an experimental methodology to assess the performance of a digital radiographic system, including those attributes, and to propose a new metric, effective detective quantum efficiency (eDQE), a candidate for defining the efficiency or speed of digital radiographic imaging systems. The study employed a geometric phantom simulating the attenuation and scatter properties of the adult human thorax and a representative indirect flat-panel-based clinical digital radiographic imaging system. The noise power spectrum (NPS) was derived from images of the phantom acquired at three exposure levels spanning the operating range of the clinical system. The modulation transfer function (MTF) was measured using an edge device positioned at the surface of the phantom, facing the x-ray source. Scatter measurements were made using a beam stop technique. The eDQE was then computed from these measurements, along with measures of phantom attenuation and x-ray flux. The MTF results showed notable impact from the focal spot blur, while the NPS depicted a large component of structured noise resulting from use of an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid.</b> The eDQE was found to be an order of magnitude lower than the conventional DQE. At 120 kVp, eDQE(0) was in the 8 %– 9 % range, fivefold lower than DQE(0) at the same technique. The eDQE method yielded reproducible estimates of the system performance in a clinically relevant context by quantifying the inherent speed of the system, that is, the actual signal to noise ratio that would be measured under clinical operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{proliferation}} of cone-beam CT (CBCT) has created interest in performance optimization,with x-ray scatter identifie among the main limitations to image quality. CBCT often contends with elevated scatter, but {{the wide variety}} of imaging geometry in different CBCT configuration suggests that not all configuration are affected to the same extent. Graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are employed over a range of imaging geometries to elucidate the factors governing scatter characteristics, effica y of <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids,</b> guide system design, and augment development of scatter correction. Methods: A MC x-ray simulator implemented on GPU was accelerated by inclusion of variance reduction techniques (interaction splitting, forced scattering, and forced detection) and extended to include x-ray spectra and analytical models of <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids</b> and flat-pane detectors. The simulator was applied to small animal (SA), musculoskeletal (MSK) extremity, otolaryngology (Head), breast, interventional C-arm, and on-board (kilovoltage) linear accelerator (Linac) imaging, with an axis-todetector distance (ADD) of 5, 12, 22, 32, 60, and 50 cm, respectively. Each configuratio was modeled with and without an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> and with (i) an elliptical cylinder varying 70 – 280 mm in major axis; and (ii) digital murine and anthropomorphic models. The effects of scatter were evaluated in terms of the angular distribution of scatter incident upon the detector, scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR), artifact magnitude, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and visual assessment. Results: Variance reduction yielded improvements in MC simulation efficien y ranging from ∼ 17 -fold (for SA CBCT) to ∼ 35 -fold (for Head and C-arm), with the most significan acceleration due to interaction splitting (∼ 6 to ∼ 10 -fold increase in efficien y). The benefi of a more extended geometry was evident by virtue of a larger air gap—e. g., for a 16 cm diameter object, the SPR reduced from 1. 5 for ADD = 12 cm (MSK geometry) to 1. 1 for ADD = 22 cm (Head) and to 0. 5 for ADD = 60 cm (C-arm). Grid efficien y was higher for configuration with shorter air gap due to a broader angular distribution of scattered photons—e. g., scatter rejection factor ∼ 0. 8 for MSK geometry versus ∼ 0. 65 for C-arm. Grids reduced cupping for all configuration but had limited improvement on scatterinduced streaks and resulted in a loss of CNR for the SA, Breast, and C-arm. Relative contribution of forward-directed scatter increased with a grid (e. g., Rayleigh scatter fraction increasing from ∼ 0. 15 without a grid to ∼ 0. 25 with a grid for the MSK configuration) resulting in scatter distributions with greater spatial variation (the form of which depended on grid orientation). Conclusions: A fast MC simulator combining GPU acceleration with variance reduction provided a systematic examination of a range of CBCT configuration in relation to scatter, highlighting the magnitude and spatial uniformity of individual scatter components, illustrating tradeoffs in CNR and artifacts and identifying the system geometries for which grids are more beneficia (e. g., MSK) from those in which an extended geometry is the better defense (e. g., C-arm head imaging). Compact geometries with an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> challenge assumptions of slowly varying scatter distributions due to increased contribution of Rayleigh scatter.

In this study, the EOS system was characterised using the eDQE in imaging conditions similar to those used in clinical practice: with phantoms of different widths placed in the X-ray beam, for various incident air kerma and tube voltages corresponding to the phantom thickness. Scatter fractions in EOS images were extremely low, around 2 % for all configurations. Maximum eDQE values spanned 9 - 14. 8 % for a large range of air kerma at the detector plane from 0. 01 to 1. 34 µGy.

The choice of appropriate grid or its removal requires a good knowledge of grid characteristics, especially for pediatric digital imaging. The aim of this work is to understand the relation between grid performance parameters and some numerical image quality metrics for digital radiological examinations. The grid parameters such as bucky factor (BF), selectivity (Σ), Contrast improvement factor (CIF), and signal-to-noise improvement factor (SIF) were determined following the measurements of primary, scatter, and total radiations with a digital fluoroscopic system for the thicknesses of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm polymethyl methacrylate blocks at the tube voltages of 70, 90, and 120 kVp. Image contrast for low- and high-contrast objects and high-contrast spatial resolution were measured with simple phantoms using the same scatter thicknesses and tube voltages.

40|$|Objective: This study aims at {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} replacing an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> with an air gap to achieve dose reduction for lumbar spine radiography while retaining image quality at an acceptable diagnostic level. Methods: Frontal and lateral projections of lumbar spine radiographic examinations were performed on an anthropomorphic phantom. Nongrid images of both the computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) systems with air gap thickness ranging from 0 to 25 cm were produced and compared with their corresponding grid images. Dose measurements using thermoluminescent dosimeters at the ovary and testes regions of the phantom were conducted. The image quality of all the images was evaluated by five radiographers using image quality score and visual grading analysis tests. Data on dose measurements and image quality tests were input for statistical analysis. The dose area product (DAP) of all the examinations was recorded and input for the computation of effective doses using a PC-based Monte Carlo program (PCXMC 2. 0; STUK, Helsinki, Finland). Results: Significant dose reduction effects on the ovaries of 60. 2 %- 74. 1 % and 55. 1 %- 73. 3 % were found, respectively, at the frontal and lateral projections of nongrid lumbar spine examinations compared with their corresponding grid ones in both the CR and DR systems. Results on the image quality score and visual grading analysis tests showed that nongrid images with 10 -cm and 5 -cm of air gap thicknesses respective to the frontal and lateral images of the lumbar spine were rated with the highest scores. In general, a dose reduction effect using the air gap method {{was found to be}} more pronounced in the CR system compared with the DR system. Nevertheless, the CR system delivered a 2. 4 - 4. 5 times higher ovary dose respective to the frontal and lateral projections of lumbar spine examinations compared with the DR system. Conclusions: Ten and 5 centimeters were found to be the optimal air gap thicknesses respective to the frontal and lateral lumbar spine radiographic examinations of the tested Rando phantom (Alderson Laboratories, Stamford, CT) in both the CR and DR systems. Significant dose reduction effects on both the ovary and testes regions of the nongrid examinations were shown. The effective dose computed from PCMCX 2. 0 reflected that the risk of cancer induction was halved when an <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> was replaced by the nongrid method with an optimal air gap thickness in the tested examinations.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{establish}} local diagnostic {{reference levels}} (DRL) for typical radiographic examinations in a fully digital imaging institution. MethodsThe initial survey included 6 standard radiographic projections performed in 19 computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) rooms. Because {{of the expected}} difference in the performance, the local reference levels were analysed separately for those 2 modalities. Data of 226 average size adult patients {{were included in the}} analysis. Entrance surface dose (ESD) was calculated from the recorded radiographic techniques and tube radiation output measurements. After observing wide variations in the results of the patient survey, the examinations were repeated by using anthropomorphic phantoms. Initial efforts to understand the reasons for dose variations were focused on CR chest, abdomen, pelvis, and lumbar spine examinations. ResultsThe average size patient doses for similar examinations were lower in the DR rooms than in the CR rooms by factors that ranged from 1. 2 to 3, {{with the exception of the}} chest examination. Standardization of the CR exposure index value allowed us to decrease ESD by 21 %- 30 %. Detector sensitivity had an insignificant effect (2 %) on ESD; proper collimation lowered the dose by 17 %. However, the major effect, up to 46 % difference, was found because of <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids</b> cutoff. ConclusionModality specific local diagnostic reference levels for standard examinations have been established in a large digital imaging department with hybrid modalities. Typically the local reference values were lower than those recommended in Safety Code 35, except for CR chests. Factors that affect the dose variations have been investigated and determined...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{estimate}} {{the increase in}} effective dose from diagnostic x-rays for overweight and obese adult patients compared with „lean‟ reference phantoms. Materials and Methods: Relative effective doses, E/E[subscript 0], for chest and abdomen radiographs were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory adult phantoms with (E), and without (E[subscript 0]), subcutaneous adipose tissue added to the phantom torso for five distinct fat distributions. Total anterior plus posterior fat thicknesses ranged from 0 to 38 cm. Results: For 30 cm of additional fat E/E[subscript 0] values for 120 kVp chest and 80 kVp abdomen radiographs ranged from approximately 2 to 31 and 83 for males, respectively, and 2 to 45 and 76 for females, depending upon the type of fat distribution and patient orientation in the x-ray beam (AP or PA). E/E[subscript 0] was minimized by orienting the patient with the thinnest fat layer facing away from the x-ray tube, and was well approximated by E/E[subscript 0] = [B(t) /B[subscript 0]]exp(kt[subscript DF]) where B(t) and B 0 are the <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grid</b> Bucky factors for patient thicknesses of t and t= 20 cm, respectively, k a constant, and t[subscript DF] the distal (beam exit) fat layer thickness. Reductions in E/E[subscript 0] reached 14 % and 20 % for the thickest phantoms when x-ray tube kilovoltages were increased by 10 and 20 kV, respectively, for an abdominal exam in the male. Conclusions: Effective doses from radiographic examinations in the extremely obese can exceed 100 mSv from {{only a small number}} of abdominal exams and should be minimized to the extent possible and monitored. Exponential dose increases from increased subcutaneous fat thicknesses can be significantly reduced by positioning the patient so that the thinnest fat layer (anterior or posterior) is closest to the image receptor. Increasing the kVp will also reduce dose, but to a much lesser extent...|$|R
40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to study and}} optimise the design of <b>antiscatter</b> <b>grids</b> in diagnostic radiology. The imaging chain including X-ray energy spectra, phantom (representing the patient), grid and image receptor is simulated. Image quality is quantified in terms of contrast (conventionai screen-film imaging) and signal-to-noise ratio, SNR (digital imaging) and the radiation detriment to the patient (risk) by the mean absorbed dose in the phantom. The advantages of using fibre instead of aluminium for grid interspaces and covers are quantified. Compared to aluminium grids, the absorbed dose is reduced by 10 - 50 %, contrast is improved by 0 - 10 % and SNR by 10 - 40 % (digital radiography). The advantages are larger at low tube potentials and for grids with high ratio and low strip density. Commercial grids, with different interspace materials, strip density, strip width and grid ratio, are compared in paediatric, lumbar spine and chest examinations. The differences in dose increase and contrast improvement factors obtained with these grids are mainly due {{to the use of}} different materials in the grid interspaces, but the strip design is also important. In a global optimisation of grid design and tube potential at fixed contrast, it is found that grids of different strip density and ratio all can have good performances provided that they are used with appropriate strip width and tube potential. In the paediatric examination, low ratio grids need thinner strips than used today to be optimal. A small air gap could alternatively be used. In examinations with more scatter (adult AP), present commercial grids are optimal (r= 12 - 16, d= 30 - 50 µm). In the lateral view (even more scatter), grids with ratios larger than 16 are optimal provided the grid can be accurately aligned in the beam. The optimization is performed with grids with fibre interspaces and covers since low atomic number materials should preferably be used for materials between the patient and the receptor. Optimal grids with aluminium for these components have lower grid ratio and higher strip densities than optimal fibre grids...|$|R

40|$|Medical linear {{accelerator}} mounted cone beam CT (CBCT) scanner provides useful soft tissue contrast {{for purposes of}} image guidance in radiotherapy. The presence of extensive scattered radiation has {{a negative effect on}} soft tissue visibility and uniformity of CBCT scans. <b>Antiscatter</b> <b>grids</b> (ASG) are used in the field of diagnostic radiography to mitigate the scatter. They usually do increase the contrast of the scan, but simultaneously increase the noise. Therefore, and considering other scatter mitigation mechanisms present in a CBCT scanner, the applicability of ASGs with aluminum interspacing {{for a wide range of}} imaging conditions has been inconclusive in previous studies. In recent years, grids using fiber interspacers have appeared, providing grids with higher scatter rejection while maintaining reasonable transmission of primary radiation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of one such grid on CBCT image quality. The grid used (Philips Medical Systems) had ratio of 21 : 1, frequency 36 lp/cm, and nominal selectivity of 11. 9. It was mounted on the kV flat panel detector of an Elekta Synergy {{linear accelerator}} and tested in a phantom and a clinical study. Due to the flex of the linac and presence of gridline artifacts an angle dependent gain correction algorithm was devised to mitigate resulting artifacts. Scan reconstruction was performed using XVI 4. 5 augmented with inhouse developed image lag correction and Hounsfield unit calibration. To determine the necessary parameters for Hounsfield unit calibration and software scatter correction parameters, the Catphan 600 (The Phantom Laboratory) phantom was used. Image quality parameters were evaluated using CIRS CBCT Image Quality and Electron Density Phantom (CIRS) in two different geometries: one modeling head and neck and other pelvic region. Phantoms were acquired with and without the grid and reconstructed with and without software correction which was adapted for the different acquisition scenarios. Parameters used in the phantom study were t(cup) for nonuniformity and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for soft tissue visibility. Clinical scans were evaluated in an observer study in which four experienced radiotherapy technologists rated soft tissue visibility and uniformity of scans with and without the grid. The proposed angle dependent gain correction algorithm suppressed the visible ring artifacts. Grid had a beneficial impact on nonuniformity, contrast to noise ratio, and Hounsfield unit accuracy for both scanning geometries. The nonuniformity reduced by 90 % for head sized object and 91 % for pelvic-sized object. CNR improved compared to no corrections on average by a factor 2. 8 for the head sized object, and 2. 2 for the pelvic sized phantom. Grid outperformed software correction alone, but adding additional software correction to the grid was overall the best strategy. In the observer study, a significant improvement was found in both soft tissue visibility and nonuniformity of scans when grid is used. The evaluated fiber-interspaced grid improved the image quality of the CBCT system for broad range of imaging conditions. Clinical scans show significant improvement in soft tissue visibility and uniformity without the need to increase the imaging dos...|$|R
