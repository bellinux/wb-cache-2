5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E

After Dostana release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E

5|$|Despite Paramount's {{failure to}} build a {{national}} broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to toy {{with the idea of}} entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library of shorts and cartoons in separate deals to U.M. & M. TV Corporation, Associated Artists Productions and Harvey Comics (the Superman cartoons were already sold to National Comics when Paramount's license to Superman expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to EMKA, Ltd., a subsidiary of MCA. The live action films would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> what became Universal Television after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962. KTLA was eventually sold to Golden West Broadcasters, a company owned by actor and singer Gene Autry, for $12 million in 1964.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E

30|$|Of the 239 patients, 27 <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a final {{clinical}} diagnosis of definitive PCD. No {{patients with a}} PRMC test that was normal or otherwise not consistent <b>with</b> PCD <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> PCD as final {{clinical diagnosis}} (though a minority of patients in this group <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> unresolved in regard to PCD). Forty percent of patients with an abnormal PRMC test <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> PCD as final clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the PRMC test had {{a high rate of}} conclusive results (90  %). Children < 14  years of age with normal PRMC measurements showed significantly faster lung clearance than adults with similarly normal PRMC measurements.|$|R
30|$|The highest {{percentage}} of patients <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> verified PCD as final clinical diagnosis were seen amongst children 4 – 14  years old (67  % of patients having an abnormal PRMC test) while no patients ≥ 55  years <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the final clinical diagnosis of PCD (Table  1). All four patients with an inconclusive PRMC test that <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> PCD as final clinical diagnosis were ≤ 14  years. The reason for their PRMC tests being inconclusive was pronounced coughing resulting in LR 1 and LR 2 values within the normal range while bolus transport and 24 -h static acquisition were abnormal.|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E

He then has a one-night stand with a man, he doesn't remember. By his and Lockie's fault, John Paul is sent to hospital because of the drugs. He decides to go to rehab. After that, he faces his abusive stepfather Terry and later proposes to John Paul, who accepts. They have a Christmas wedding, that is ruined when Sinead says she's expecting Ste's child. John Paul eventually forgives Ste and agrees to look after their baby with them. Ste then gets the devastating news that he's HIV positive, but John Paul sticks by his side. He is bothered with his friendship with Sinead and thinks they could be romantically involved, which Ste denies. Sinead falls in love with Ste and she wants to separate Ste and John Paul. She finds out John Paul kissed his student, Harry, Tony's son, unknowingly after one of their fights, and tries to frame him but Ste gets attacted in a hate crime. John Paul and Ste later split up and Sinead gives birth to their daughter, Hannah. Ste lives with them but is shocked when he overhears that Sinead loves him. After her heated words, he uses drugs again, but later pleads Sinead to not leave him and give them a chance as a couple, which confuses everyone. Ste than starts seeing Harry, even though he doesn't want to hurt Sinead. When she discovers, she leaves along with Hannah, which devastates Ste. He starts to date Harry behind Tony's back, but he is eventually found out. They later start dating for real but Ste breaks up with him as he thinks he's too young to be with someone like him. They later get back together but after Harry thinks he broke his promise not to take drugs and wants to end it with him, Ste accepts John Paul's offer to meet up and try again, but then when he sees Harry, John Paul understands he doesn't want him and Ste will <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Harry. They live with Ste's sisters but Cameron, the man Leela had Peri with, doesn't want him with them and with false accusations, they both leave and become homeless. Later, when Ste is determinated to deal drugs again, Harry sleeps with another man for money. When Ste finds out the truth, they break up and Cameron gives him crystal meth. Ste becomes addicted and even when he and Harry get back together, he can't stop. When Harry finds out, he and Tony try to help him and get him into rehab.|$|E
