I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E

25|$|Early designs {{including}} Siemens, Westinghouse, and Combustion Engineering had {{a mostly}} can-like shape built with reinforced concrete. As concrete <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> compression strength compared to tensile, {{this is a}} logical design for the building materials since the extremely heavy top part of containment exerts a large downward force that prevents some tensile stress if containment pressure were to suddenly go up. As reactor designs have evolved, many nearly spherical containment designs for PWRs have also been constructed. Depending on the material used, {{this is the most}} apparently logical design because a sphere is the best structure for simply containing a large pressure. Most current PWR designs involve some combination of the two, with a cylindrical lower part and a half-spherical top.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{acknowledges}} {{that he has had}} the benefits of privilege and opportunity and says that his hobbies include fencing, hunting and fishing, especially salmon fishing. [...] He often enjoys these hobbies in bipartisan friendships that include Dick Armey and regarded the late Republican Rep. Henry Hyde as one of his closest friends. [...] In fact, Armey points to Jackson as an example of his ability to work with politicians at all ends of the political spectrum. [...] Jackson also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> relationship with Republican United States President George W. Bush despite their sharp ideological differences. [...] The relationship traces back to when Jackson Sr. and United States President-Elect George H. W. Bush met to discuss a range of issues while Jackson Jr. and his siblings Santita and Jonathan had an hour-and-a-half luncheon with future president George W. [...] He also developed a relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton that enabled him to watch Super Bowl XXXIII at Camp David with them.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{had called}} the baby Allegra [...] "the little Commodore" [...] because of her sturdy body and alert, {{intelligent}} look. Byron was also pleased with Allegra's resemblances to himself in appearance and temperament. When she was eighteen months old, {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend: [...] "My bastard came three days ago—very like—healthy—noisy & capricious." [...] In an 1818 letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote that [...] "She is very pretty—remarkably intelligent ... She has very blue eyes—that singular forehead—fair curly hair—and a devil of a spirit—but that is Papa's." [...] In 1819, in another letter to Leigh, Byron described two and a half-year-old Allegra as [...] "very droll" [...] and again commented on her resemblance to himself in physical appearance, temperament and interests: [...] "(She) <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> deal of the Byron. Can't articulate the letter 'r' at all—frowns and pouts quite in our way—blue eyes—light hair growing darker daily—and a dimple in the chin—a scowl on the brow—white skin—sweet voice—and a particular liking of Music—and of her own way in every thing—is that not B. all over?" [...] The child had forgotten any English she had learned and now spoke only Venetian Italian. In March 1820, he complained in a letter that three-year-old Allegra was vain and [...] "obstinate as a mule". Her behaviour was sometimes unmanageable, probably as a result of her unstable living arrangements and frequent changes in caregivers. [...] At age four, the naughty child terrorised Byron's servants with her temper tantrums and other misbehavior and told frequent lies.|$|E

2500|$|Brawlers tend to {{overcome}} swarmers or in-fighters because, {{in trying to}} get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day.

2500|$|Coptic Orthodox Bishop Marcos of Shubra El-Khiema urged Christians not to {{join the}} demonstrations, saying {{that they do not}} know the goals of those {{responsible}} for launching the protests. During his weekly sermon Pope Shenouda III asked his followers to be [...] "calm" [...] for the second day of demonstrations during his weekly sermon. On 31 January, he expressed support for Mubarak in an interview with Egyptian state television. In spite of this, a number of young Christian activists joined the protests led by well-known Christians like member of the Wafd Party Raymond Lakah. Naguib Sawiris, the head of Orascom Telecom said that the appointment of Omar Suleiman as vice president may not satisfy protestors. [...] "I think it is not enough. It's a good step because the gentleman, Mr. Suleiman <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> international reputation; he is from the system so he can at least ensure that the current transition to a more democratic regime can happen."

2500|$|Partially due {{to being}} such a {{ground-breaking}} ship, Finnjet was also extremely prestigious, which helps explain why she remained in traffic on the Baltic Sea {{for such a long}} time even though she was often unprofitable. Famous Finnish painter Kimmo Kaivanto provided paintings and drawings to decorate the ship, and he even designed a Finnjet medallion to commemorate the ship's commission. Kaivanto's main work for the ship, the three-deck high Pictures of Finland, was given to the Finnish Maritime Museum in 2007, destined for display in the museum from 2008 onwards. In 1977 a 7" [...] single, Finnjet Waltz, was recorded in honour of the ship, and she was the first ship ever to have a Lego model of her for sale on board. As late as the early 1990s Silja Line still considered Finnjet to be one of their greatest ships, and in their brochures she appeared right after the brand-new Helsinki–Stockholm ferries, ahead of many ships that were both newer and larger than Finnjet herself was. Finnjet still remains the best-known individual ship in Finland. She also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> reputation in Germany still, and recently (August 2006) Silja Line's new owners Tallink went on record considering adapting the name 'Finnjet' for their Finland–Germany ferries (to the dismay of ferry enthusiasts in Finland and Germany). However Finnjet is a registered trademark of Finnlines (until 2017) and therefore Tallink could not go ahead with their plan.|$|E
