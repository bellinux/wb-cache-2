40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED), smoking, {{and alcohol}} drinking {{are common in}} middle-aged men. Although smoking {{has been shown to}} be a risk factor of ED in Chinese and other populations, the relationship between drinking alcohol and ED is not clear. The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong conducted the Men Health Survey in 2004. In all, 1506 men aged 20 - 70 years were recruited by stratified random sampling of the male population. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect information on drinking and smoking and other life style factors, morbidities, and sociodemographic status during household visits. The more sensitive information on sexual activity and ED was obtained by a self-completed questionnaire at the end of the interview. A total of 816 subjects aged 31 - 60 years currently active in sexual activity were included in the present analysis. Compared with never drinkers, alcohol drinkers who consumed three or more standard drinks (one standard drink equals 12 g of alcohol) a week were more likely to report EDs as defined by having both sexual dissatisfaction and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulty</b> (odds ratio (OR) 2. 27, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 28 - 4. 03) after adjusting for age and cigarette smoking. When analyzed separately by smoking habit, the risks were higher in current smokers (OR 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 5. 11) than never smokers (OR 1. 91, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 5. 35). Our results suggest that alcohol drinking of three or more standard drinks per week might reduce sexual satisfaction and impair erectile function in current smokers and might have less effect in never smokers. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Low {{sexual desire}} {{has been studied}} more {{extensively}} in women than in men. Aim. The study aims to analyze the correlates of distressing lack of sexual interest and the self-assessed reasons {{for the lack of}} sexual interest among heterosexual men from three countries. Methods. A web-based survey was completed by 5, 255 men aged 18 – 75 years from Portugal, Croatia, and Norway. Main Outcome Measures. We used an item that assesses lack of sexual interest from the British NATSAL 2000. Anxiety and depression were measured with the SCL-ANX 4 and SCL-DEP 6. Relationship intimacy was measured using a five-item version of the Emotional Intimacy Scale. A shortened version of the Sexual Boredom Scale was used to assess proneness to sexual boredom in relation to the duration of relationship, and personal distress was evaluated using an item created for this study. Results. Distressing lack of sexual interest lasting at least 2 months in the previous year was reported by 14. 4 % of the participants. The most prevalent comorbidity among these men was <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulty</b> (48. 7 %). Men with low confidence levels in erectile function, not feeling attracted to the partner, and those in long-term relationships {{were more likely to have}} experienced lack of sexual interest than were men with high confidence levels and those who felt attracted to their partner and those in shorter-term relationships. Professional stress was the most frequently reported reason for lack of sexual interest. Sexual boredom as a result of a long-term relationship was significantly and negatively correlated with the level of intimacy (r = − 0. 351, P < 0. 001) and sexual satisfaction (r = − 0. 497, P < 0. 001). Conclusions. Distressing lack of sexual interest in heterosexual men was associated with a number of intrapersonal (self-confidence in erectile function, stress), interpersonal (relationship duration, partner attractiveness), and sociocultural variables...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} form of hair loss in young and old people is {{androgenic}} alopecia. Hereditary hair loss affects both men and women. Hereditary hair loss in some women begins at the age of 30, but as a rule hair loss begins in post-menopausal women. In women the hair thins out in an oval portion of the front part of the scalp. In men, hair loss can start as early as at the age of 20. The hairline then starts to slowly creep upward along the temples and gives characteristic flaps, and on the scalp a bald spot appears that over time becomes larger and larger. Hereditary androgenic alopecia is caused by androgenic effects on the hair follicles causing the anagen phase to shorten and the telogen phase to extend while the hair follicle size decreases. Polymorphism in the androgen receptor has been linked to androgenic alopecia. Finasteride is a fat-soluble synthetic steroid originally intended for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In 1992 it was approved for BPH-treatment and in 1997 it was approved for male pattern baldness. Finasteride inhibits the function of type ІІ 5 -α-reductase, and therefore inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone(DHT). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effectiveness of finasteride treatment against hereditary male pattern baldness. Six studies on finasteride were selected from searching the database PubMed in february 2013. To get the most relevant results the search terms "finasteride alopecia" were used. Out of 42 hits, six articles were selected. Only articles with clinical testing on humans were selected. The articles included in this study demonstrate that finasteride treatment slows the development of hair loss and increases hair growth. Increased hair growth, however, requires long-term treatment. After one year of treatment, or longer, with finasteride 1 mg daily the increase in hair growth is of the order 7 - 10 % more hairs than at the beginning of the treatment. A larger increase in hair weight suggests that the treatment also increases the thickness and/or the length of hairs. Men 18 - 19 have been treated with finasterid in the studies. The concentration of DHT was decreased by finasteride treatment in all studies. Adverse reactions include decreased libido, <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulty,</b> ejaculation problems and depression can occur in fewer than 1 in 100 people which was also mentioned in the studies...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{risk factors of}} <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> and rapid ejaculation in men in Croatia. Method: We surveyed 615 of 888 contacted men aged 35 - 84 years. The mean age of participants was 54 ± 12 years. College-educated respondents and the respondents from large cities were slightly overrepresented in the sample. Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted in June and July 2004 by 63 trained interviewers. The questionnaire used in interviews was created for commercial purposes and had not been validated before. Results: Out of 615 men who were sexually active in the preceding month and gave the valid {{answers to the questions}} on <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> and rapid ejaculation, 130 suffered from <b>erectile</b> or ejaculatory <b>difficulties.</b> Men who had been sexually active the month before the interview and gave the valid answers to the questions on sexual <b>difficulties</b> reported having <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> more often (77 out of 615) than rapid ejaculation (57 out of 601). Additional 26. 8 % (165 out of 615) and 26. 3 % (158 out of 601) men were classified as being at risk for <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> and rapid ejaculation, respectively. The prevalence of <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> varied from 5. 8 % in the 35 - 39 age group to 30 % in the 70 - 79 age group. The association between age and rapid ejaculation was curvilinear, ie, U-shaped. Rates of rapid ejaculation were highest in the youngest (15. 7 %) and the oldest (12. 5 %) age groups. Older age (odds ratios [OR], 6. 2 - 10. 3), overweight (OR, 3. 3 - 4. 2), alcohol (OR, 0. 3 - 0. 4), intense physical activity (OR, 0. 3), traditional attitudes about sexuality (OR, 2. 8), and discussing sex with one’s partner (OR, 0. 1 - 0. 3) were associated with <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Education (OR, 0. 1 - 0. 3), being overweight (OR, 22. 0) or obese (OR, 20. 1), alcohol consumption (OR, 0. 2 - 0. 3), stress and anxiety (OR, 10. 8 - 12. 5), holding traditional attitudes (OR, 2. 8) and moderate physical activity (OR, 0. 1) were factors associated with rapid ejaculation. Conclusion: The prevalence of <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> was higher than the prevalence of rapid ejaculation in men in Croatia. The odds of having these sexual difficulties increased with older age, overweight, traditional attitudes toward sex, and higher level of stress and anxiety...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{approaches}} to sexual difficulties prioritise the physical aspects of sexuality over other aspects, locating 'disorders' {{primarily in the}} anatomy, chemistry or physiology of the body. In accordance with this perspective on sexual matters, physicians look to physical interventions (for example, hormones, drugs, and surgery) to treat any 'abnormalities'. Following the discovery of popular [...] and profitable [...] sexuopharmaceuticals such as sildenafil citrate (Viagra(TM)) {{for the treatment of}} <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> affecting men, the medical model has gained increasing influence in the domain of sexual health and well-being. However, while medical definitions of [...] and interventions related to [...] sexual difficulties are underpinned by an understanding of a 'universal' body (that is, an essential biological body that transcends culture and history), and by the categorisation of the normal and the pathological, the accounts of users of Viagra, and their sexual partners, do not necessarily support such understandings. In some cases, the experiences and perspectives of those affected by <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> directly challenge the reductionist model of sexuality and sexual experience espoused by medicine. In this paper, we report on a New Zealand study investigating the socio-cultural implications of Viagra, involving 33 men and 27 women discussing the impact of <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> and Viagra use within relationships. The diverse experiences of participants are discussed in relation to two key issues: the notion of 'sexual dysfunction' itself; and the idea of drugs such as Viagra acting as a 'quick fix' for sexual difficulties affecting men.

40|$|Treatment of paroxetine-induced penile {{anesthesia}} in Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) by Low-power Laser Irradiation (LPLI) {{is unknown}} in medical literature. The {{aim of the}} current article is to report partial efficacy of LPLI for paroxetine-induced persistent penile anesthesia. We report on a male patient who presented {{with a history of}} reversible loss of smell, taste and skin sensitivity occurring within a week after start of 20 mg/day paroxetine-hemihydrate for a depressive period. Concurrently, patient suffered from penile anesthesia, scrotum hypesthesia, anejaculation and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> with normal sexual desire. During 2. 5 years of paroxetine treatment and throughout 2 years after paroxetine discontinuation, genital and sexual complaints persisted. Penile anesthesia was treated by LPLI with single and multi diode pulsed laser probes. After 20 LPLI-treatment sessions of 15 min each, patient reported partial return of penile touch and temperature sensation. Clinical improvement of glans penis sensitivity was reported to 20 % and 40 %, compared to pre-paroxetine treatment penile sensitivity during erect and flaccid states, respectively. However, anejaculation and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> remained unchanged. Briefly, in the current patient with early onset of PSSD, LPLI treatment reduced paroxetine-induced penile anesthesia. It is hypothesized that SSRI treatment induces disturbances of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels of mechano-, thermo- and chemosensitive nerve endings and receptors resulting in the penile anesthesia in PSSD. It is further hypothesized that {{there are two types of}} PSSD, one of which occurs soon after the start of SSRI treatment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of sex and the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among middle-aged and older adults throughout the world. Increasing life expectancy {{has been accompanied by}} improvements in the health of the middle-aged and elderly, but little is known about how this has affected their sexual experience. METHODS: Data were collected in 29 countries from 27, 500 men and women aged 40 to 80 years using a standardized questionnaire (self-completed or by interview). Sexual dysfunction was defined as frequent and persistent problems. They included early ejaculation and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> in men, lubrication difficulties and pain during intercourse in women, and a lack of sexual interest, an inability to achieve orgasm, and a feeling of unpleasurable sex in both. RESULTS: More than 80 % of the men and 65 % of the women had had sexual intercourse during the past year. Of these subjects, the most common dysfunctions were early ejaculation (14 %) and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> (10 %) among the men and a lack of sexual interest (21 %), inability to reach orgasm (16 %), and lubrication difficulties (16 %) among the women. Overall, 28 % of the men and 39 % of the women said that they were affected by at least one sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that sexual desire and activity are widespread among middle-aged and elderly men and women worldwide and persist into old age. The prevalence of sexual dysfunctions was quite high and tended to increase with age, especially in men.

Two hundred forty-three (54 %) of the 460 women included were not sexually active. They estimate a prevalence of sexual complaints in 64 % of sexually active women.

This article presents findings from 53 qualitative interviews from the study “Sex, Age & Me: a National Study of Sex and Relationships Among Australians aged 60 +. ” Participants were recruited through an online national survey. We consider how participants understood “safer sex,” the importance of safer sex to them, the safer sex practices they used (and the contexts in which they used them), and the barriers to using safer sex. Older adults had diverse understandings, knowledge, and use of safer sex practices, although participants tended to focus most strongly on condom use.

Increased age at the time of diagnosis and psychological distress tended to correlate with the incidence of sexual problems. For about 60 % of the patients the discussion of expected and experienced sexual life problems was an important issue to be discussed before their treatment for testicular cancer and during follow-up.

The observed frequency of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several double-blind studies of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants. While nefazodone (Serzone), bupropion (Wellbutrin) and reboxetine (Edronax) did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper). Similarly, {{in a group of}} women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline. A 40% rate of orgasm dysfunction (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as [...] "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> for men", occurred in 12% of patients on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved.|$|R

Early ejaculation (30. 3 %) was the commonest male sexual problem, followed by inability to reach orgasm (14. 0 %), <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> (13. 1 %) and lack of sexual interest (11. 2 %). For women, the commonest sexual problems were lubrication difficulties (23. 4 %) and lack of sexual interest (22. 7 %). Depression was a significant correlate of sexual problems, for men and women. More women than men had sought help for sexual problem(s) from a healthcare professional. The findings highlight the importance of encouraging greater use of available healthcare services, including consultation with a medical doctor regarding sexual health. This should not only enable men and women to maintain satisfactory sexual function well into their later years, but may also result in overall improvement in the quality of healthcare...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Relatively {{little is}} known about the usual {{frequency}} of sexual activity and how older individuals cope with sexual problems. The objective was to study sexual activity, prevalence of sexual problems and related help-seeking behaviors among middle-aged and older men and women in Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: Population survey, by Fundação Oswaldo Cruz. METHODS: Interviews were held with 1, 199 Brazilians aged 40 - 80 years (471 men and 728 women). The standardized questionnaire investigated demographics, general health, sexual behavior, attitudes and beliefs. RESULTS: Overall, 92. 6 % of men and 58. 3 % of women had had sexual intercourse during the preceding year. More than half of the men and women had done so more than once a week. Early ejaculation (30. 3 %) was the commonest male sexual problem, followed by inability to reach orgasm (14. 0 %), <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> (13. 1 %) and lack of sexual interest (11. 2 %).

40|$|Sexual self-schemas re {{cognitive}} generalizations regarding sexual {{aspects of}} the self that represent acore component of one's sexuality. We contend that individual differences in the sexual self-view represent an important cognitive diathesis for predicting sexual difficulty or dysfunction. We illustrate the role of sexual self-schemas on sexual behavior and responsiveness in healthy female and male samples. Next, we describe how diathesis-stress models of psychopathology have been applied to the sexual arena, and discuss the critical features of clinically useful diathesis variables. Drawing from these criteria, we examine the diathetic properties of sexual self-schemas. Finally, we discuss an empirical test of the proposed iathesis-stress interaction, reviewing the role of women's exual self-views on sexual morbidity following diagnosis and treatment for gynecologic cancer. Key words: Diathesis-stress model, Sexual dysfunction, Sexual functioning, Sexual self-schema Sexual difficulties are both widespread and clinically sig-nificant. Recent epidemiological research by Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, and Michaels (1994) obtained telling 1 -year prevalence rates {{across a variety of}} specific sexual dif-ficulties. Among women, 33 % reported lack of sexual desire, 19 % had difficulty with lubrication, and 24 % were unable to reach orgasm. The male statistics were also significant. Com-monly reported ifficulties among men included climaxing too early (29 %), sexual performance anxiety (17 %), and low sexual desire (16 %). Whereas 10 % of all men surveyed re-ported significant <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties,</b> prevalence rates in-creased with age-with more than 20 % of men over age 50 reporting erectile problems. Hence, the sexual dysfunctions are {{perhaps one of the most}} common yet underreported of th...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the last}} third of the 20th century, {{medicine}} had little interest in treating <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties.</b> When he was consulted, the urologist received the unfortunate “impotents” between two urinary tract infections, prescribed a male hormone cure which most often came to a sudden end, then sent them back to the psychiatrist. For a number of them, under the influence of Dr. Freud, the sexuality issues were only related to neurosis. However, we knew since the 16th century, {{under the influence of the}} Italian anatomists (Varolio, Leonardo da Vinci) that the erection is a vascular phenomenon. It was not until the 70s that some pioneers (among them the Czech surgeon Vaclav Michal) designed surgical then medical techniques to restore vigor to the “impotent”. Amongst these pioneers, Ronald Virag, still a young chief resident at the Hospital Broussais, took an interest in the erectile dysfunctions occurring to the patients affected by the Leriche’s syndrome (obstruction of the lower part of the aorta which results in limbs claudication and decrease of the erection). Their legs were well treated but not their penises. Urged by their despair the young researcher will henceforth have a passion for this issue and devote most of his professional life to it. A small international group will then gather, combining the Europeans, more focused on physiology, and the Americans, who developed the penile implants techniques. This group will create a new medical Society which is nowadays: the International Society for Sexual Medecine (ISSM), reach of now over a thousand members.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and explore the understanding and perception of erectile dysfunction (ED) using exploratory qualitative approaches. This {{study was conducted in}} Klang Valley, Malaysia. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 17 urban men aged 40 - 75 years. A semi-structural interview guide was used to explore men’s understanding of ED, impacts on their well-being and experiences with treatments. The focus groups revealed that ED was perceived to be an important loss in men’s lives as sexual performance was closely related to manhood. The men associated ED with a loss of masculinity and self-esteem. Men’s understanding of ED treatments was restricted to phophodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE- 5 inhibitors) and traditional therapies. Although PDE- 5 inhibitors were perceived to be effective, they were concerned about their safety and costs. Some of the men have learned to cope with ED rather than to seek help, particularly among older men, who attributed their decreased sexual capacities and erection difficulties to aging, and therefore conditioned themselves to accepting it. In contrast, younger men who have <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> are considered as ‘abnormal’, {{and are more likely to}} seek help and receive treatment for their sexual problem. Men’s knowledge of and experience with modern treatments of ED were mainly associated with PDE- 5 inhibitors. Their perception towards PDE- 5 inhibitors was largely influenced by personal experience, information from mass media and friends. The high cost and fear of side effects were two main deterrents in the use of PDE- 5 inhibitors. Many men had conceded their use of PDE- 5 inhibitors without their partners’ knowledge. They worried that their partners would view the matter with suspicion and mistrust...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the practice, {{perceptions}} and experience of using traditional and complementary medicine (T/CM) for erection difficulties among Asian men. Methods: A total of 10, 934 Asian men living in China (n = 2, 055), Japan (n = 877), Korea (n = 2, 000), Malaysia (n = 3, 000) or Taiwan (n = 2, 002) were recruited via random digit dialing, street interception and face-to-face interview in the Asian Men's Attitudes To Life Events and Sexuality (MALES) Phase I study. The Phase II study was comprised of a total of 1, 286 men who experienced erection difficulties and who lived in China (n = 255), Japan (n = 228), Korea (n = 225), Malaysia (n = 380) or Taiwan (n = 228). Results: Use of T/CM for erection difficulties (9. 1) was relatively low compared to conventional medicine (83. 5). Among those that seek help and treatment from T/CM, the majority were respondents from Malaysia, followed by respondents from China, whereas respondents from Japan and Korea ranked lowest. Use of a combination of alternative and conventional therapy was prevalent. Erection difficulty was amongst the highest in terms of preference of treatment seeking using traditional approaches after back pain, arthritis and gout. Overall outcome was expressed as 'Partly satisfied' with T/CM treatment for erection difficulties. The main reason that T/CM outweighs conventional medicine was because it was perceived that T/CM had fewer side effects than conventional medicine (56. 1). Users of T/CM were mostly middle-aged, married, employed, and perceived their health status and the severity of their erection dysfunction as moderate. Conclusions: The findings help to identify the differences in practices and beliefs about T/CM among Asian countries and provide useful information to conventional practitioners about the alternative help-and treatment-seeking behaviors for <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties.</b> (C) 2008 WPMH GmbH.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{levels of}} sexual activity, problems with sexual functioning, and concerns about sexual health among older adults in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and associations with age, health, and partnership factors. Specifically, a total of 6, 201 core ELSA participants (56 % women) aged 50 to > 90 completed a comprehensive Sexual Relationships and Activities questionnaire (SRA-Q) included in ELSA Wave 6 (2012 / 13). The prevalence of reporting any sexual activity {{in the last year}} declined with age, with women less likely than men at all ages to report being sexually active. Poorer health was associated with lower {{levels of sexual}} activity and a higher prevalence of problems with sexual functioning, particularly among men. Difficulties most frequently reported by sexually active women related to becoming sexually aroused (32 %) and achieving orgasm (27 %), while for men it was erectile function (39 %). Sexual health concerns most commonly reported by women related to their level of sexual desire (11 %) and frequency of sexual activities (8 %). Among men it was level of sexual desire (15 %) and <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> (14 %). While the likelihood of reporting sexual health concerns tended to decrease with age in women, the opposite was seen in men. Poor sexual functioning and disagreements with a partner about initiating and/or feeling obligated to have sex were associated with greater concerns about and dissatisfaction with overall sex life. Levels of sexual activity decline with increasing age, although a sizable minority of men and women remain sexually active until the eighth and ninth decades of life. Problems with sexual functioning were relatively common, but overall levels of sexual health concerns were much lower. Sexually active men reported higher levels of concern with their sexual health and sexual dissatisfaction than women at all ages. Older peoples’ sexual health should be managed, not just {{in the context of their}} age, gender, and general health, but also within their existing sexual relationship...|$|R
40|$|Introduction More than 70, 000 {{new cases}} of bladder cancer are {{diagnosed}} in the U nited S tates annually; with 75 % being non‐muscle‐invasive (NMIBC). Research examining sexual dysfunction in bladder cancer survivors is limited, and previous {{studies have focused on}} cystectomy patients. Aims To evaluate the impact of sexual dysfunction on NMIBC survivors. Methods Mixed‐methods data collection integrated a quantitative survey (S tudy 1; n[*]=[*] 117) and semi‐structured qualitative interviews (S tudy 2; n[*]=[*] 26) from a non‐overlapping sample of NMIBC survivors. We performed descriptive and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses of survey data and qualitative analysis of interviews. Main Outcome Measures Self‐reported sexual activity, interest in sex, and physiologic symptoms (e. g., male erectile/ejaculatory difficulties, female vaginal dryness) over the previous 4 weeks; partner communication about sexuality; contamination concerns; illness intrusiveness. Results Participants in these studies averaged 65 years of age (mean and median) and were male (77 %), white (91 %), and married (75 %). Survey (S tudy 1) results linked NMIBC treatment to sexual symptoms and relationship issues. Many participants reported sexual inactivity (38. 8 %). Sexually active participants reported <b>erectile</b> <b>difficulties</b> (60. 0 %), vaginal dryness (62. 5 %), and worry about contaminating partner with treatment agents (23. 2 %). While almost one‐half reported the usefulness of talking with partners about sexual function, only one‐fifth of participants reported sharing all concerns with their partners. CART analysis supported the importance of communication. One‐half of interviewees (S tudy 2) reported sexual dysfunction. Two‐thirds reported negative impacts on their relationships, including perceived loss of intimacy and divorce; over one‐third were sexually inactive for fear of contaminating their partner or spreading NMIBC. Conclusions Survivors' sexual symptoms may result from NMIBC, comorbidities, or both. These results inform literature and practice by raising awareness about the frequency of symptoms and the impact on NMIBC survivors' intimate relationships. Further work is needed to design symptom management education programs to dispel misinformation about contamination post‐treatment and improve quality of life.
