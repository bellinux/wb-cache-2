The data analysis has enabled the clearidentification of pectin. In particular, Raman spectra of apple juice samples from washedand crushed fruits revealed a peak at 845 cm- 1 (typical of pectin) which disappears in theRaman spectra of <b>depectinised</b> samples. The fructose content was also revealed by thepresence of four peaks at 823 cm- 1, 872 cm- 1, 918 cm- 1 and 975 cm- 1.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cranberry}} extracts and juices during cranberry juice processing on the antiproliferative properties against colon cancer cells was investigated. Two colon cancer cell lines HT- 29 and LS- 513 {{were treated with}} different concentrations of cranberry phenolic extracts from fruits, puree, <b>depectinised</b> puree and pomace and different concentration of three juices (raw, filtered and concentrated juices). The phenolic extracts consisted of water-soluble phenolic compounds, apolar phenolic compounds and anthocyanins. These phenolic extracts and juices were tested against two cell lines at pH 2. 5 (natural juice pH) and at pH 7. 0 (physiological pH). All cranberry extracts and juices could inhibit the growth of both cell lines with the IC 50 values (the concentration of phenolic content required to inhibit 50 % the growth of cancer cells) varied from 3. 8 to 179. 2 μg gallic acid equivalent/ml. It was found that three types of extracts from fruit at pH 7. 0 were the most effective at inhibiting the growth of HT- 29 cell line. Extracts containing anthocyanins from fruit and from pomace were the most and the least efficient, respectively, in inhibiting the growth of both cancer cell lines. Further, three juices at natural pH (pH 2. 5) were more effective at inhibiting the growth of two cell lines as compared to juices at pH 7. 0. Concentrated juice at both pH values was the most effective at growth inhibition of two cancer cell lines compared to two other juices...|$|E
