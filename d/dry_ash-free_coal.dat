To minimise {{the loss of}} carbon in the residue stream, {{it is necessary to}} have a low-ash feed. Typically the coal should be <10% ash by weight. The hydrogen required for the process can be also produced from coal or the residue by steam reforming. A typical hydrogen demand is ~80 kg [...] hydrogen per ton of <b>dry,</b> <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal.</b> Generally, this process is similar to hydrogenation. The output is at three levels: heavy oil, middle oil, gasoline. The middle oil is hydrogenated in order to get more gasoline and the heavy oil is mixed with the coal again and the process restarts. In this way, heavy oil and middle oil fractions are also reused in this process.|$|E
40|$|Coal topping {{gasification}} {{refers to}} a process that extracts the volatiles contained in coal into gas and tar rich in chemical structures in advance of gasification. The technology can be implemented in a reactor system coupling a fluidized bed pyrolyzer and a transport bed gasifier in which coal is first pyrolyzed in the fluidized bed before being forwarded into the transport bed for gasification. The present article is devoted to investigating the pyrolysis of lignite and bituminite in a fluidized bed reactor. The {{results showed that the}} highest tar yield appeared at 823 to 923 K for both coals. When coal ash from CFB boiler was used as the bed material, obvious decreases in the yields of tar and pyrolysis gas were observed. Pyrolysis in a reaction atmosphere simulating the pyrolysis gas composition of coal resulted in a higher production of tar. Under the conditions of using CFB boiler ash as the bed material and the simulated pyrolysis gas as the reaction atmosphere, the tar yields for pyrolytic topping in a fluidized bed reactor was about 11. 4 wt. % for bituminite and 6. 5 wt. % for lignite in <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal</b> base.

40|$|The {{physical}} and nutritional energy values of aquatic invertebrates were studied in re-lation to organic carbon content. The ratio of energy content {{to the weight}} of organic carbon increased with increasing carbon. The dependence is described in regression equa-tions which permit prediction of the cncrgy content with an accuracy of about + 5 % (P> 0. 95). Even {{the use of the}} mean conversion factor of 46 kJ g-l organic carbon yields considerably more accurate results than the use of a general conversion factor for <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> weight. Accurate energy values of animals are essential for studies of animal energetics. Determination of the energy content of animals with the aid of bomb calorimeters now used requires samples relatively large in comparison with the small size of most freshwater invertebrates. Most scientists use <b>dry</b> weight or <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> weight to estimate biomass. As the energy content of <b>dry</b> or <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> biomass varies consid-erably from species to species (e. g. Cum-mins and Wuycheck 1971)) and within one species from season to season (e. g. Schind-ler et al. 1971; Wissing and Hasler 1971; Snow 1972), the use of general energy equivalents for <b>dry</b> or <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> weight does not yield very accurate values. As noted earlier by Platt and Irwin (1973)) the energy equivalent for biomass expressed in terms of organic carbon should theoretically vary less than the energy equivalent for biomass expressed in terms of <b>dry</b> or <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> weight.

METHODS: It was installed three experimental structures with artificial substrate (glass slides) in December 2009 in two sampling sites: ED - near the domestic sewage's release; TR - in the area of intensive fish farming (net cages). Samplings were conducted in each experimental structure, after 21, 26 and 31 days for colonization. We evaluated: transparency, electric conductivity, pH, turbidity, total suspended solids, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, orthophosphate and silicate. The phycoperiphyton was analyzed regarding biomass: biovolume (total and per class); pigments (chlorophyll-a and b and carotenoids) and phaeophytin; <b>dry</b> weight and <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> weight.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} {{on the structure}} of an Australian semi-anthracite char was studied in detail in the 850 - 1150 degreesC temperature range using XRD, HRTEM, and electrical resistivity techniques. It was found that the carbon crystallite size in the char does not change significantly during heat treatment in the temperature range studied, for both the raw <b>coal</b> and its <b>ash-free</b> derivative obtained by acid treatment. However, the fraction of the organized carbon in the raw coal chars, determined by XRD, increased with increase of heat treatment time and temperature, while that for the <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal</b> chars remained almost unchanged. This suggests the occurrence of catalytic ordering during heat treatment, supported by the observation that the electrical resistivity of the raw coal chars decreased with heat treatment, while that of the <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal</b> chars did not vary significantly. Further confirmatory evidence was provided by high resolution transmission electron micrographs depicting well-organized carbon layers surrounding iron particles. It is also found that the fraction of organized carbon does not reach unity, but attains an apparent equilibrium value that increases with increase in temperature, providing an apparent heat of ordering of 71. 7 kJ mol(- 1) in the temperature range studied. Good temperature-independent correlation was found between the electrical resistivity and the organized carbon fraction, indicating that electrical resistivity is indeed structure sensitive. Good correlation was also found between the electrical resistivity and the reactivity of coal char. All these results strongly suggest that the thermal deactivation {{is the result of a}} crystallite-perfecting process, which is effectively catalyzed by the inorganic matter in the coal char. Based on kinetic interpretation of the data it is concluded that the process is diffusion controlled, most likely involving transport of iron in the inter-crystallite nanospaces in the temperature range studied. The activation energy of this transport process is found to be very low, at about 11. 8 kJ mol(- 1), which is corroborated by model-free correlation of the temporal variation of organized carbon fraction as well as electrical resistivity data using the superposition method, and is suggestive of surface transport of iron.

40|$|Growing {{rates of}} manure {{produced}} from large dairies have increased {{concern for the}} environmental quality of nearby streams and watersheds. Typically the manure from the freestalls on these dairies is flushed with water to a mechanical separator. Here, flushed dairy biomass (DB) is parted into separated solids and separated liquid. The separated liquid is discharged into lagoons for treatment and eventual land application. This thesis proposes thermodynamic models for firing DB in small scale boiler systems that would eliminate land application and lagoons, which are being {{claimed to be the}} source of nutrient leaching and overloading. Fuel analysis of flushed DB from a dairy in central Texas show that it contains 93 %moisture (%M), 3 %ash (%A), and 4 %combustibles (%Cb), while separated DB solids contain 81 %M, 2 %A, and 17 %Cb. The <b>dry,</b> <b>ash-free</b> higher heating value of DB is approximately 20, 000 kJ/kg. Using <b>dry,</b> <b>ash-free</b> results, computations can be made over ranges of %M and %A. For example, DB containing 70 %M requires 9. 74 %Cb to vaporize all moisture and produce gaseous products of combustion at 373 K, but requires 17. 82 %Cb to burn in a regenerative combustor with a flame temperature of 1200 K. Separated solids that are pressed in an auger to 70 %M (3 %A and 27 %Cb) can burn at 1200 K with exhaust temperatures of up to 1130 K and a minimum required heat exchanger effectiveness of 15 %. Pressed solids can thus be fired in a boiler, where the remaining separated liquid can be used as feed water. The pressed solids only can release about 30 % of the heat required to vaporize the remaining unclean feed water. However, pressed DB solids can be blended with drier fuels to vaporize almost all the unclean water. The low quality steam produced from the unclean water can be used in thermal processes on the farm. A similar system can be developed for vacuumed DB without the need to vaporize unclean feed water.

The bagasse was supplemented {{with a small amount of}} alfalfa (0. 16 g alfalfa/g bagasse) to provide necessary nutrients. The volatile fatty acid (VFA) product concentrations, yields and proportions of each acid for six different bagasse concentrations (10, 20, 35, 50, 75, and 100 g/L) are reported. Bagasse was treated with calcium hydroxide to increase the digestibility of the cell wall carbohydrates. The treatment conditions were: Ca(OH) 2 loading = 10 g/ 100 g dry bagasse, water loading = 8. 5 g/g dry bagasse, temperature 100 'C, and treatment time = 1 hour. Compared to untreated bagasse, the lime-treated bagasse gave higher total VFA concentrations, faster rates of acidogenesis, and more stable molar proportions of individual VFA'S. The highest total VFA concentration obtained from lime-treated bagasse was 690 mM (45 g/L). By applying the lime pretreatment, the total VFA concentrations increased over 80 % for a 10 g dry bagasse/L loading fermentation (from 4. 5 g VFA/L to 8. 5 g VFAAL) With lime pretreatment, approximately 71 to 96 % of the final total VFA yields were accomplished within the initial three days of fermentation, whereas only 52 to 67 % were achieved without pretreatment during the same time period. At all solid loadings, the VFA molar compositions resulting from lime-treated bagasse were quite constant: acetate, 64 - 70 %; propionate, 21 - 28 %; butyrate, 6. 5 - 7. 6 %; and other acids were about 1 % each. In this thesis, we examined the effect of higher substrate concentration up to 100 g dry bagasse/L. For untreated bagasse, the VFA yields were fairly constant regardless of substrate concentration (ca. 0. 37 g VFA/g dry substrate). However, for lime-treated bagasse, the total VFA yields decreased as the substrate concentrations increased. The best total VFA yield obtained from 10 g/L lime-treated bagasse was 0. 63 g VFA/g dry raw substrate (or 0. 82 g VFA/g <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free</b> substrate or 0. 94 g VFA/g <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free,</b> lignin- free substrate).

Oxygen microelectrodes were used to measure microbial activity and to estimate millimeter-scale heterogeneity in that activity. Oak leaves lost mass more slowly than elm leaves. Generally, there was a decrease in total dry weight over the first 14 days, after which total dry weight began to increase. However, there were consistent decreases in <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> mass over the entire incubation period, suggesting that the material remaining after initial leaf decomposition trapped inorganic particles.

Nutrient additions affected chlorophyll levels at ten sites. Most commonly, autotrophs were co-limited by N and P (three sites) or primarily limited by N and secondarily limited by P (three sites). Nutrient additions suppressed chlorophyll levels at four sites. Nutrient additions affected <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> mass at only three sites, suppressing biomass at two sites, and increasing biomass at one site. At a given site, chlorophyll a and <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> mass never had the same response to nutrient additions. These preliminary results indicate autotrophs and heterotrophs respond differently to nutrient additions. Further analyses will consider how the relative balance autotrophs and heterotrophs, stream nutrient concentrations, and light availability affect nutrient limitation patterns along an urbanization gradient...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{laboratory studies}} {{conducted by the}} Bureau of Mines on the spontaneous combustion of U. S. coals. Approximately 11 pet of U. S. underground coal mine fires are attributed to spontaneous combustion. The relative self-heating tendencies of 24 coal samples were evaluated in an adiabatic heating oven. Minimum self-heating temperatures (SHT's) in the oven ranged from 350 C for a lignite and high-volatile C bituminous (hvCb) coal, to 1350 C for two low-volatile bituminous (lvb) coals. An empirical expression was determined predicting a bituminous coal's minimum SHT in the adiabatic oven based on the <b>coal's</b> <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free</b> oxygen content. Several factors that can affect the self-heating process were also evaluated. The self-~eating tendency of a coal increased when the coal was dried and exposed to humidified air, and was dependent on the particle size and oxygen concentration of the air. A new moderate-scale apparatus is described, in which the self-heating tendencies of larger coal samples, 3 kg, can be evaluated. The minimum SHT's of two coals were determined {{and the results were}} in good agreement with those found in the adiabatic oven. Finally, results of a test in the moderate-scale apparatus indicated a strong dependence of the self-heating rate of a low rank coal on the moisture content of the air...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility {{of a gas}} agglomeration method for cleaning coal was demonstrated by means of bench-scale tests conducted with a mixing system which enabled the treatment of ultra-fine coal particles with a colloidal suspension of microscopic gas bubbles in water. A suitable suspension of microbubbles was prepared by first saturating water with air or carbon dioxide under pressure then reducing the pressure to release the dissolved gas. The formation of microbubbles was facilitated by agitation and {{a small amount of}} i-octane. When the suspension of microbubbles and coal particles was mixed, agglomeration was rapid and small spherical agglomerates were produced. Since the agglomerates floated, they were separated from the nonfloating tailings in a settling chamber. By employing this process in numerous agglomeration tests of moderately hydrophobic coals with 26 wt. % ash, it was shown that the ash content would be reduced to 6 [...] 7 wt. % while achieving a coal recovery of 75 to 85 % on a <b>dry,</b> <b>ash-free</b> basis. This was accomplished by employing a solids concentration of 3 to 5 w/w%, an air saturation pressure of 136 to 205 kPa (5 to 15 psig), and an i-octane concentration of 1. 0 v/w% based on the weight of coal...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the variability of ash content and chemical composition of coal ash is crucial when assessing {{the possibility of using}} this raw material in clean coal technologies (CCS). The paper focuses on chemical, technological and quality characteristics of ash from the combustion of lignite from Polish deposits. Ash content on a <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free</b> basis for the samples from 9 deposits varies from 1 to 50 %. The most commonly observed ash content in the studied samples of lignite is in the range between 10 – 20 %. The measured ash melting temperatures from the collected lignite samples have shown that the sintering, softening, melting and flow temperatures, determined in an oxidizing atmosphere (air), are higher than those determined in a reducing atmosphere. In the majority of Polish lignite deposits, the dominant component of ash was SiO 2, followed by CaO. When evaluating the suitability of coal in energy production, with particular emphasis on the combustion and gasification processes, it is also necessary to study the behavior of ash at high temperatures and the impact of ash on the gasification and combustion facilities. Ash fouling and slagging processes, which are heavily dependent on the ash content, composition, melting point and the content of chlorine, phosphorus and sulfur in coal, {{have a negative effect on}} the combustion process...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{agglomeration}} {{tests were conducted}} {{as part of an}} effort to find a suitable basis for size scale-up of the mixing system used for a gas-promoted oil agglomeration process. In the first series of tests the agitator impeller diameter and speed were varied among runs so as to vary impeller tip speed and agitator power independently while keeping other conditions constant. In the second series of tests the mixing tank size and agitator speed were varied while the ratio of tank diameter to impeller diameter were held constant. All tests were conducted with finely ground Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and with i-octane as the agglomerant. The results of these tests showed that the minimum time te required to produce spherical agglomerates was predominantly a function of the agitator power input per unit volume. In addition, the size of the agglomerates produced in a given time was also strongly dependent on power input. At lower power input levels, the mean size rose as power input increased until a point was reached where agglomerate breakage became important and the mean size decreased. The results also showed that the ash content of the agglomerates produced in a given time tended to decrease with increasing power input. On the other hand, the recovery of clean <b>coal</b> on a <b>dry,</b> <b>ash-free</b> basis was not greatly affected by power input...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} isotherms of Bide-Santang Basin’s main coal seams is studied based on analyzing two Coalbed Methane (CBM) wells in Huale exploration region and testing the coal samples {{and the major}} geological factors are also discussed. A conclusion has been made that the adsorption capacity of Bide-Santang Basin’s main coal seams is high. The Langmuir volume (VL) of <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free</b> basis range from 17. 69 m 3 /t to 21. 38 m 3 /t and the average is 19. 46 m 3 /t. The methane saturation of the coal reservoir is lower than 100 %, commonly ranging from 75. 04 to 105. 55 % and the average is 84. 51 %. It indicates that coal reservoir in the research area is undersaturation. The critical desorption pressures are between 1. 22 MPa and 9. 1 MPa and the average is 3. 25 MPa. The coalbed methane theory recovery rates are between 19. 96 and 46. 15 % with average of 34. 51 %. The main effect geology factors on the adsorption {{in this area are}} reservoir pressure, depth of burial, degree of coalification and characteristics of pores. The reservoir pressure and depth of burial are positively related with the gas content. The higher of the degree of metamorphism is, the stronger adsorbability of CBM is. The well-developed micropores and mesopores contribute to the adsorption capacity of CBM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{influence}} of the herbivorous snail (Physa sp.) on the algal periphyton community from the Gamasiyab River, Kermanshah province in western Iran was examined by establishing a gradient of Physa sp. density in artificial streams. The impact of Physa grazing was evaluated by measuring <b>dry</b> mass, <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> mass (AFDM) and chlorophyll a in the periphyton community. Snails significantly depressed periphyton biomass. Following twelve days of grazing of the grazer densities of 0, 0. 015, 0. 03 and 0. 06 individuals/cm 2 the dry masses of the periphyton communities were 3. 04, 2. 9, 2. 66 and 1. 07 mg/cm 2 respectively. Snails also decreased <b>ash-free</b> <b>dry</b> mass by 2. 04, 1. 78, 1. 63 and 0. 71 mg/cm 2 and chlorophyll a by 8. 6, 8. 06, 5. 25 and 4. 6 mg/m 2. During this experiment the survival percentage for 0. 015, 0. 03 and 0. 06 (individuals/cm 2) treatments was 77. 7 %, 58. 3 % and 30 % respectively. During the 12 days of the grazing period in the artificial stream the snail growth also showed a density dependent pattern. Diatom biovolumes calculated {{in this study are}} 57. 1 × 106, 36 × 106 × 31 × 106, and 5. 8 × 106 μ m 3 /cm 2 for snail densities of 0, 0. 015, 0. 03 and 0. 06 individuals/cm 2 respectively. A group of species which are found primarily in the grazed treatments include Achnanthes lanceolata, Cocconeis pediculus, and Ulothrix sp. In contrast, ungrazed assemblage had high relative abundance of non adnate diatoms such as Nitzcshia linaris, Gomphonema sp. and non filamentous chlorophytes such as Scenedesmus sp...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} for {{predicting}} the specific chemical exergy of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) is presented; the model {{is based on the}} content of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine on a <b>dry</b> <b>ash-free</b> basis (daf). The proposed model was obtained from estimations of the higher heating value (HHV) and standard entropy of MSW using statistical analysis. The ultimate analysis of 56 different parts of MSW was used for the derivation of the HHV expression. In addition, 30 extra parts were used for validation. One hundred and seventeen relevant organic substances that represented the main constituents in MSW were used for derivation of the standard entropy of solid waste. The substances were divided into different waste fractions, and the standard entropies of each waste fraction and for the complete mixture were calculated. The specific chemical exergy of inorganic matter in the waste was also investigated by considering the inorganic compounds in the ash. However, {{as a result of the}} extremely low value calculated, the exergy of inorganic matter was ignored. The results obtained from the HHV model show a good correlation with the measured values and are comparable with other recent and previous models. The correlation of the standard entropy of the complete waste mixture is less accurate than the correlations of each individual waste fraction. However, the correlations give similar results for the specific chemical exergy, indicating that HHV has a greater impact when estimating the specific exergy of solid waste than entropy...|$|R
