Each animal received 1 stainless steel stent (SS), 1 cobalt-chromium stent (CCS), and 1 tacrolimus-eluting stent (TES) in each coronary artery. Follow-up periods were 1 day (n 9 stents), 3 days (n 9 stents), and 7 days (n 15 stents). Longitudinal sections of the stented vessels were examined using scanning electron microscopy. At 1 day, there was scarce, patchy <b>endothelialization</b> with areas of fibrin; the <b>endothelialization</b> rate was similar for all the stents (SS, 29 %+ 23 %; CCS, 29 %+ 24 %; TES, 31 %+ 25 %; P. 9).

Synthetic materials have been developed for blood vessel substitutes but not suitable for small diameter vascular applications such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Polyurethaneureas (PUU) have been widely used for biomedical applications due to their excellent mechanical properties and relatively good biocompatibility. However, like other synthetic materials, they are generally thrombogenic on exposure to blood. <b>Endothelialization</b> of synthetic grafts is a good strategy to improve graft patency. However, the graft patency is dependent on retention of endothelial cells on exposure to physiological shear stress. In this study, we developed bioactive polyurethaneureas to support <b>endothelialization.</b> First, we have demonstrated that endothelial cell behaviors could be altered by the surface YIGSR peptide concentrations. Bioactive polyurethanureas (PUUYIGSR) have been developed by incorporating YIGSR peptide sequences into polymer main chain, and improved <b>endothelialization</b> has been observed on the surface. In addition, PEG- and YIGSR-modified polyurethaneureas (PUUYIGSR-PEG) have been developed, and enhanced <b>endothelialization</b> and improved thromboresistance have been obtained simultaneously.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 11 house swines (body weight 38 - 45 kg), 3 stents were implanted randomly into the 3 large epicardial coronary arteries, namely a bare-metal stent (BMS), a sirolimus-eluting stent with slow-release (SES) and a SES with extended-release (SESXR). Stent length was 18 mm, and stent diameter 3 mm. All stents were of identical design. Animals were followed for 3 (n = 3), 7 (n = 4) and 14 (n = 4) days, respectively. One animal died before implantation due to hyperthermia.

MethodsIn the phase 1 study, stents were deployed in 21 pig coronary arteries for single stenting (9 vessels: 3 GS, 3 SES, and 3 bare-metal stents) and overlapping stenting with various combinations (12 vessels: 4 GS+GS, 4 SES+SES, and 4 GS+SES) and harvested at 14 days for scanning electron and confocal microscopy. In phase 2, immobilized anti-CD 34 antibody coating was applied on commercially available SES (SES–anti-CD 34, n = 7) and compared with GS (n = 8) and SES (n = 7) and examined at 3 and 14 days by scanning electron/confocal microscopy analysis. ResultsIn phase 1, single stent implantation showed greatest <b>endothelialization</b> in GS (99 %) and in bare-metal stent (99 %) compared with SES (55 %, p = 0. 048).

In order to optimize the functionalization procedure before its application to cobalt-chromium (Co/Cr) stents, discs of the same material were preliminarily used.

BackgroundMf is a commonly used therapy in diabetic patients receiving DES. Mf and locally eluted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors used in DES have convergent molecular signaling; however, the impact of this drug interaction on stent <b>endothelialization</b> is unknown. MethodsWe examined human endothelial aortic cells (HAECs) and a rabbit model of stenting to determine points on molecular convergence between these 2 agents and their impact on stent <b>endothelialization.</b> ResultsWestern blotting of HAECs treated with Mf and the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus and 14 -day rabbit iliacs treated with the combination of zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES) and oral Mf demonstrated greater inhibition of S 6 kinase (S 6 K), a downstream effector of mTOR complex 1, than either treatment alone. HAEC proliferation was significantly inhibited by Mf or sirolimus treatments alone and further reduced when they were combined. Knockdown of S 6 K via short interfering RNA in HAECs impaired cell proliferation via a cyclin D 1 –dependent mechanism, whereas its overexpression rescued the antiproliferative effects of both agents.

Mid-graft pre-confluence was reached by 6 weeks (55 ± 45 %) and confluence between week 12 and 24 (95. 0 ± 10. 0 % and 84. 0 ± 30. 13 %). The subintimal thickness did not increase (91. 8 ± 93. 9 mm vs. 71. 4 ± 59. 4 mm at 6 and 24 weeks, respectively; NS). All sealed grafts occluded.

A looped interposition graft model provides sufficient isolation length to separate the two events for up to half a year without an increase in intimal hyperplasia. Growth factor surface modification further enhances this form of healing, while perigraft isolation confirms that fallout <b>endothelialization</b> is insufficient to heal the mid-graft with confluence.

In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of arsenic trioxide in vitro and arsenic trioxide eluting stents in a porcine coronary model have been explored. Sixty-five pigs underwent placement of 139 oversized stents in the coronary arteries with histologic analysis, endothelial function analysis, and immunohistochemical and western blot analyses.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} sirolimus-eluting bioabsorbable magnesium alloy stents (SEBMAS) in restenosis prevention. Methods: A balloon-expandable bioabsorbable magnesium alloy stent (BMAS) was created and coated with biodegradable poly(lactic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) that contained the antiproliferative drug sirolimus (140640 mg/cm 2). Both the uncoated BMAS and the coated SEBMASwere deployed 2 cm apart in balloon-injured infrarenal abdominal aortas of 20 New Zealand white rabbits. The stented aortic segments were removed at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days (5 rabbits per interval) after implantation. The average stent strut sectional area of each group was measured to evaluate the degree of magnesium corrosion and to forecast the biodegradation time profile of themagnesium stent. Histology and histopathology of the sectioned stented aortic segments were performed to evaluate neointima formation, <b>endothelialization,</b> and inflammation. Results: The SEBMAS degraded gradually after being implanted into the rabbit aorta, and total biocorrosion occurred after, 120 days. In all groups, the lumen area was significantly greater, but the neointimal area was significantly smaller in SEBMAS segments compared with the uncoated BMAS segments (p, 0. 05) at all time points.

40|$|Aims. This study {{evaluated}} feasibility {{and safety}} of implanting the polyester-coated nitinol ventricular septal defect occluder (pcVSDO) in the canine model. Methods and Results. VSD models were successfully established by transseptal ventricular septal puncture via the right jugular vein in 15 out of 18 canines. Two types of VSDOs were implanted, either with pcVSDOs (n= 8) as the new type occluder group or with the commercial ventricular septal defect occluders (VSDOs, n= 7, Shanghai Sharp Memory Alloy Co. Ltd.) as the control group. Sheath size was 10 French (10 [*]Fr) in two groups. Then the general state of the canines was observed after implantation. ECG and TTE were performed, respectively, at 7, 30, 90 days of follow-up. The canines were sacrificed at these time points for pathological and scanning electron microscopy examination. The devices were successfully implanted in all 15 canines and were retrievable and repositionable. There was no thrombus formation on the device or occurrence of complete heart block. The pcVSDO surface implanted at day 7 was already covered with neotissue by gross examination, and it completed <b>endothelialization</b> at day 30, while the commercial VSDO was covered with the neotissue in 30 th day and the complete <b>endothelialization</b> in 90 th day.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Surface {{modification}} of biodegradable vascular grafts {{is an important}} strategy to improve the in situ <b>endothelialization</b> of tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) and prevent major complications associated with current synthetic grafts.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess two biofunctionalization strategies for improving <b>endothelialization</b> of biodegradable polyester vascular grafts. These techniques consisted of cross-linking heparin to graft surfaces to immobilize vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or antibodies against CD 34 (anti-CD 34 Ab). To this end, heparin, VEGF, and anti-CD 34 Ab attachment and quantification assays confirmed the efficacy of the modification strategy.

40|$|BackgroundIn humans, transanastomotic endothelial {{outgrowth}} {{onto the}} surface of prosthetic vascular grafts is limited to the immediate perianastomotic region, even after years of implantation. In contrast, continual transanastomotic outgrowth together with short graft lengths has led to early endothelial confluence in most animal models pre-empting <b>endothelialization</b> through transmural capillary sprouting. We describe an isolation loop-graft model that clearly separates these distinctly different events. MethodsBaseline transanastomotic <b>endothelialization</b> was assessed by implanting low-porosity expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (ePTFE; internal diameter 1. 7 mm; internodal distance 15 - 25 μm; 14. 2  ± 1. 6 mm long) for 2, 4, and 6 weeks (n = 6 /time point) in the abdominal aorta of Wistar rats. High-porosity polyurethane (internal diameter 1. 7  mm- 150 μm pore size) grafts were then interposed (“welded”) into the midsection of the ePTFE grafts for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks (n = 6 /time point). Looping the interposition grafts increased their length to 70. 3  ± 8. 3 mm. After implantation periods of 6, 8, 12, and 24 weeks (n = 8 /time point) isolation loop grafts were analyzed by light, immune-fluorescence (CD 31) and scanning electron microscopy, and <b>endothelialization</b> was expressed as maximal transanastomotic endothelial outgrowth (Imax), mean transanastomotic outgrowth (Imean), and segmental graft coverage (GSE). ResultsTransanastomotic outgrowth slowed down between 2 and 6 weeks of implantation (proximal: [Imax from 0. 9  ±  0. 5 to 0. 3  ± 0. 3 mm/wk; P <. 04; Imean from 0. 3  ± 0. 1 to 0. 2  ± 0. 1 mm/wk; nonsignificant (NS) ]; distal: [Imax from 0. 7  ± 0. 3 to 0. 3  ± 0. 2  mm/wk; P <. 02; Imean from 0. 3  ± 0. 2 to 0. 2  ± 0. 0 mm/wk; NS]) but remained constant thereafter (Imax = 0. 5  ± 0. 2  mm/wk; Imean = 0. 4  ± 0. 2 mm/wk at 24 weeks NS). In straight composite grafts, the ePTFE separation zones were too short to isolate transmural ingrowth beyond week 4. In contrast, a broad endothelial-free separation zone was preserved in all looped composite grafts even after half a year of implantation (25. 9  ± 5. 9 vs 8. 7  ± 4. 9 mm proximally and 21. 9  ± 13. 4 vs 12. 3  ± 6. 2 mm distally at 6 and 24 weeks, respectively). Ninety-three percent of patent loop-grafts showed isolated transmural midgraft endothelium after 4 weeks and 97 % after 6 weeks. Midgraft preconfluence was reached by 6 weeks (GSE = 55  ± 45 %) and confluence between week 12 and 24 (GSE = 95. 0  ± 10. 0 % and 84. 0  ± 30. 13 %). The subintimal thickness stayed constant with a nonsignificant trend toward regression (91. 8  ± 93. 9 mm vs 71. 4  ± 59. 4  mm at 6 and 24 weeks, respectively; NS). ConclusionsTransmural <b>endothelialization</b> can be clearly distinguished from transanastomotic outgrowth in a high throughput rat model. A looped interposition graft model provides sufficient isolation length to separate the two events for up to half a year and does not result in an increase in intimal hyperplasia. Clinical RelevanceAlthough the mode of graft deployment has changed over the years, the problem of an absent surface endothelium remains, whether small- to medium-diameter grafts are surgically implanted or placed endovascularly as “covered stents. ” In contrast to humans, most animal models experience progressive transanastomotic endothelial outgrowth. Together with graft lengths that were too short, the clinically irrelevant transanastomotic <b>endothelialization</b> inadvertently led to early endothelial confluence {{in the vast majority of}} experimental vascular graft studies pre-empting or concealing alternative modes of <b>endothelialization.</b> The isolation loop-graft model we propose allows the long-term differentiation of the different modes of <b>endothelialization</b> in a small animal screening model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this study, {{we sought}} to develop {{strategies}} for improved <b>endothelialization</b> of a new polymer coating for vascular stents. Surface enhancement of the new poly- 1, 8 -octanediol-co-citric acid (POC) polymer was achieved through conjugation of anti-CD 34 antibody and incorpora-tion of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibro-blast growth factor-containing poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid microparticles to improve capture and proliferation of endo-thelial progenitor cells (EPC) and compared to untreated POC and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) polymer. Our results indicate that compared to PLLA, POC coating was more hemocompatible, with less platelet activation (p 00. 01), thrombogenicity (p< 0. 05 for 20 and 30 min clot forma-tion), and inflammatory response (IL- 1 β release, p 00. 0009; TNF-α release, p 00. 004).
