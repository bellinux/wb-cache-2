50|$|<b>Dibenzepin</b> is used {{mainly in}} the {{treatment}} of major depressive disorder.|$|E
50|$|Like other TCAs, <b>dibenzepin</b> {{may have}} {{potential}} {{use in the}} treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dibenzepin</b> {{acts as a}} {{norepinephrine}} reuptake inhibitor, potent antihistamine, {{and weak}} anticholinergic. It lacks any 5-HT2 antagonistic properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dibenzepin</b> (brand names Noveril, Anslopax, Deprex, Ecatril, Neodit, Victoril) is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) used widely throughout Europe {{for the treatment}} of depression. It has similar efficacy and effects relative to other TCAs like imipramine but with fewer side effects.|$|E
40|$|Rated 2 {{groups of}} {{depressed}} inpatients (9 and 11 Ss) before, during, {{and after the}} study on 2 depression scales (Hamilton, Breulet), an anxiety scale (Cattell), and the MMPI. The Mann-Whitney U {{test was used to}} analyze statistically the results of the double-blind, cross-over, and randomized evaluation of the antidepressant characteristics of ordinary and of time-released Noveril (<b>dibenzepin).</b> Results confirm that both forms of Noveril are antidepressant, but that ordinary Noveril is more active.

40|$|A fatal {{toxicity}} index (deaths per million National Health Service prescriptions) {{was calculated for}} antidepressant drugs on sale during the years 1975 - 84 in England, Wales, and Scotland. The tricyclic drugs introduced before 1970 had a higher index than the mean for all the drugs studied (p less than 0. 001). In this group the toxicity of amitriptyline, <b>dibenzepin,</b> desipramine, and dothiepin was significantly higher, while that of clomipramine, imipramine, iprindole, protriptyline, and trimipramine was lower. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors had intermediate toxicity, and the antidepressants introduced since 1973, considered as a group, had significantly lower toxicity than the mean (p less than 0. 001). Of these newer drugs, maprotiline had a fatal {{toxicity index}} {{similar to that of}} the older tricyclic antidepressants, while the other newly introduced drugs had lower toxicity indices, with those for mianserin, nomifensine, trazodone, and viloxazine reaching significance. Provided that these drugs are equally effective clinically, serious consideration should be given to prescribing antidepressants with a lower fatal toxicity...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} twenty {{depressive}} patients was compared during a 3 - 4 month course of antidepressant therapy (maprotiline: n = 6, age = 46 · 1; dibenzepin: n = 4, age = 43 · 0; lithium: n = 6, age = 44 · 5; 'mixed' (maprotiline, <b>dibenzepin</b> and trimeprimine) : n = 4, age = 50 · 2) with a healthy control group (n = 32, age = 38 · 2) for subjective assessment of their depressive mood and performance as well as objective measurement of variables relating to driving behaviour. The measurements were taken 2 - 4 weeks after a pre-treatment period (day 1) and after 2 - 3 months offurther therapy (day 2). During therapy, all patients felt 'less depressive ' and 'more capable'Jn subjective terms. A IIpatient groups made learning-progress in the objectively measured variables (psychomotor co-ordination and attentiveness tests). By day 2, the patient groups had almost reached the performance level of the control group, providing they received antidepressant therapy (regardless of the action profile) which was suitable for the basic disorder and the symptoms, and therapy was successful in the opinion ofthe physician. It may be concluded that depressive patients, assuming suitable anti-depressant treatment and good response, are capable of driving while under maintenance therapy...|$|E
