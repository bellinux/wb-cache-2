5|$|Back at the {{department}} office, reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker) interviews Andy for a newspaper article. After he brags about the capture, the reporter suggests his heroics might win him back the affections of Ann (Rashida Jones), his ex-girlfriend, much to Andy's excitement. April (Aubrey Plaza), who has romantic feelings for Andy, overhears this and leaves jealously. Evelyn demands delivery of <b>Fairway</b> Frank. Leslie responds that there is uncertainty about the identity of <b>Fairway</b> Frank. She refuses {{to hand over the}} captured opossum and creates a ketchup-blood diversion so that April can escape with the caged animal.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2005, Fossett and {{co-pilot}} Mark Rebholz recreated {{the first}} nonstop {{crossing of the}} Atlantic which {{was made by the}} British team of John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June 1919 in a Vickers Vimy biplane. Their flight from St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada to Clifden, County Galway, Ireland in the open cockpit Vickers Vimy replica took 18 hours 25 minutes with 13 hours flown in instrument flight conditions. Because there was no airport in Clifden, Fossett and Rebholz landed on the 8th <b>fairway</b> of the Connemara Golf Links.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in <b>fairway</b> clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E

50|$|Ruth Park Golf Course has {{a unique}} design that uses the {{slightly}} hilly terrain. The <b>fairways</b> are very wide throughout, but the greens are quite small. Several holes have out of bounds to the right off the tee. The course has undergone some work as of late to improve the <b>fairways,</b> and the transition to completely zoysia <b>fairways,</b> with bent grass greens. The second, sixth, and seventh hole are tree lined. There is a small practice putting green {{to go along with}} the driving range.|$|R

25|$|Sunline {{started her}} five-year-old {{campaign}} in Melbourne, against the sprinters - streaking {{away in the}} Manikato Stakes (1,200 metres) at Moonee Valley. She then had wins in the Memsie (1,400 metres) and Feehan Stakes (1,600 metres), but was narrowly beaten by <b>Fairway</b> in the Turnbull Stakes (2,000 metres). A natural frontrunner, like Sunline, <b>Fairway</b> refused to hand up the lead to Sunline, who was forced to chase, and held her at bay down the straight. It was Sunline's third defeat over the distance from as many starts away from Moonee Valley, {{but it was a}} great improvement on her previous defeats, especially since <b>Fairway</b> was a multiple Group One winning three-year-old the previous season.|$|E
25|$|Winx is a bay mare bred in Australia by <b>Fairway</b> Thoroughbreds.

His other progeny included Zenyatta, Street Sense, Shocking and Whobegotyou.

25|$|Grass on {{golf courses}} {{is kept in}} three {{distinct}} conditions: that of the rough, the <b>fairway,</b> and the putting green. Grass on the <b>fairway</b> is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.|$|E

25|$|As a way {{of opening}} his first course design in the UK (Chart Hills in Kent), Faldo teed up on the dog-leg right par five.

This was a mark of the man's golfing ability at his peak. Faldo also worked on several overseas golf courses like The Fortress at Louisbourg Resort Golf & Spa on Cape Breton Island, Canada. Most recently, he designed a world-class course in San Miguel de Allende, México. Ventanas de San Miguel hosts an 18-hole par-70 course that was opened in late 2010.|$|E
