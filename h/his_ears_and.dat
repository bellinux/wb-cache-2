5|$|The Master and Mistress buy {{a female}} collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's {{companion}} and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies {{him from his}} food and {{the best places to}} lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E

25|$|When the {{implications}} of {{what was being said}} dawned on Erjavec he glanced across to the upper-sector controller. At his station sat a stunned Tasić, white-faced with shock. Slowly he lifted the headset from <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> placed it on the console in front of him.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, al-Jazzar {{employed}} Haim Farhi, a Damascene Jew from {{a banking}} family, to serve as his treasury manager and administrative adviser. At one point, al-Jazzar was dismissed and arrested Farhi and had his eye gouged, and <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> nose cut. Farhi was restored to his position and his role in Acre became increasingly influential under al-Jazzar's successors, Sulayman Pasha and Abdullah Pasha.|$|E
25|$|Barrie became {{acquainted with}} the family in 1897, meeting George and Jack (and baby Peter) with their nurse (nanny) Mary Hodgson in London's Kensington Gardens. He lived nearby and often walked his Saint Bernard dog Porthos in the park. He entertained the boys {{regularly}} with his ability to wiggle <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> eyebrows, and with his stories. He did not meet Sylvia until a chance encounter {{at a dinner party}} in December. She told Barrie that Peter had been named after the title character in her father's novel, Peter Ibbetson.|$|E
25|$|Wade helps Evans evade his gang, and as {{he finally}} boards the train, congratulates Evans, but Prince appears from behind and shoots Evans despite Wade's order to stop. Wade steps off the train, and when Prince returns his gun belt, {{abruptly}} executes Prince {{along with the rest}} of his gang. William appears and draws his gun on Wade but does not kill him, instead turning to his dying father. Wade boards the train and politely surrenders his weapon. Evans dies as William tells him he accomplished his mission. As the train disappears around a bend, Wade whistles, and his faithful horse pricks up <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> gallops after the train.|$|E

25|$|Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow {{over the}} volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he {{attended}} with his wife. The judge said in a lawsuit {{he has had a}} constant ringing in <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter and the city of Tucson, Arizona, which runs the convention center where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to American Tinnitus Association, an ear-disorder association.|$|E
25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly {{tell you how}} this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E
500|$|Media reports {{stated that}} Jackson's autopsy {{reported}} one scar beside {{each of his}} nostrils, [...] one scar behind each of <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> <b>and</b> two scars on his neck, [...] "probably" [...] from cosmetic surgery, plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, around his eyes and lips, and on his scalp (at his receding hairline).|$|E

500|$|In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not {{wished to}} go on the tour because flying hurt <b>his</b> <b>ears,</b> <b>and</b> long land {{journeys}} hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad. [...] Boult's assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst's The Planets, Walton's Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert's Great C major Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich's 50th birthday party.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Gabbar Singh was modelled on {{a real-life}} dacoit {{of the same}} name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. The character was also influenced by the villain [...] "El Indio" [...] (played by Gian Maria Volontè) of Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More (1965). Soorma Bhopali, a minor comic relief character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from Bhopal named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter. The main characters' names, Jai and Veeru, mean [...] "victory" [...] and [...] "heroism" [...] in Hindi.|$|E
500|$|Despite his defeat, American Pharoah {{was moved}} up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3. He was ridden by Victor Espinoza {{for the first time}} and started as the 3.2–1 second {{favorite}} behind Best Pal Stakes winner Skyway, with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field. American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator, with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third. Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, [...] "We took the blinkers off, put cotton in <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> schooled him a lot. He trained well, we decided he was ready and we put him in there. Today, he behaved himself and showed what he could do. He did what we thought he'd do the first time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} self-published November 5, 2009, and was made {{available}} through the author's website at www.blownforgood.com and on Amazon.com. Blown for Good was selected as a finalist in the 2009 [...] "Book of the Year Awards", by ForeWord Magazine. The Editor in chief of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega, described the book as a [...] "remarkable account". Ortega noted, [...] "Headley's story provides a damning account of life working for Scientology ..." [...] He concluded the review by commenting, [...] "Perhaps the best service that Headley provides with Blown for Good is giving non-Scientologists the sense of what it's really like to work, {{day in and day}} out, in such a strange organization, from the lowliest laborer mucking out excrement in a Gold Base pond (Headley says shit was coming out of <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> pores for days) to what kind of luxuries the celebrities and high-ranking members enjoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{turned his}} {{attention}} to journalism, writing a regular cricket column for The Australasian, a weekly published by Melbourne's Argus newspaper. Haigh writes that Horan [...] "was not an adventurous stylist: he wrote, instead, with <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> eyes, with a sense of the telling remark and the evocative detail." [...] He never attached his own name to his writings, preferring to use the pseudonym [...] "Felix". Horan continued contributing to The Australasian until his death in 1916.|$|E
2500|$|Tundama, {{who ruled}} the northernmost {{part of the}} Muisca Confederation from {{an island in the}} former lake around Tundama, already got notice of the burning of the Sun Temple, two years earlier and the {{submission}} of the neighbouring indigenous groups, the Panche, Guane and others and told his guecha warriors not to bow for the Spanish invaders. When one of his warriors suggested surrender was the best option, Tundama cut off <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> left hand. The cacique declared a [...] "death war" [...] against the Spanish and gathered an army of 10,000 guecha warriors.|$|E

2500|$|Holyfield's rematch with Tyson {{took place}} on June 28, 1997. Known as [...] "The Bite Fight," [...] it went into the annals of boxing {{as one of the}} most bizarre fights in history. The infamous {{incident}} occurred in the third round, when Tyson bit Holyfield on one of <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> had two points deducted. Referee Mills Lane decided to disqualify Tyson initially, but after Holyfield and the ringside doctor intervened and said Holyfield could continue, he relented and allowed the fight to go on. Tyson bit Holyfield again, this time on the other ear. Tyson's teeth tore off a small section of the top of his opponent's ear, known as the helix, and spat that bit of flesh out onto the canvas.|$|E
2500|$|Klonoa: Empire of Dreams {{works like}} a typical 2D sidescroller with the player moving Klonoa left or right on a {{scrolling}} screen while defeating enemies using his [...] "wind bullet", a special ring that can shoot a small gust of wind forward and draw an enemy in, allowing Klonoa to lift them over his head. [...] From this position, he can either throw them straight forward like a projectile, taking out any enemy they hit, or he can perform a double-jump, allowing him to reach places he couldn't normally. [...] In addition to enemies, Klonoa can also pick up large square blocks and place them wherever the player chooses. [...] By holding the jump button after Klonoa has left the ground, Klonoa flaps <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> can float in mid-air for a short duration, which also somewhat increases his jumping height.|$|E
2500|$|Emily {{is usually}} shown {{accompanied}} by four black cats. [...] "Sabbath," [...] the newest cat {{to join the}} Strange family, is usually identified by a tear on one of <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> one bent whisker. [...] "Miles," [...] the most artistic cat {{of the group and}} also the fastest, is identified by his pointy ears, X-mark over his right eye and two pointy whiskers. [...] "Nee Chee," [...] the thinker of the group (also known as the schemer), is identified by the black and white stripes on his tail caused by a chemical spill, as well as three whiskers. [...] "Mystery," [...] the leader of the group and the only female of the four cats, seems to be the closest to Emily, and therefore thought to be the cat that has been with Emily the longest. Mystery is identified by the star on her collar, one curly whisker and occasionally a star on her left eye.|$|E
