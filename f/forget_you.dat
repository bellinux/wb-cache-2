500|$|At that time, Madonna {{was dating}} British writer Andy Bird {{whom she had}} met during her Ray of Light (1998) album era. After {{the two of them}} split up, Madonna penned a song called [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] {{inspired}} by him, which she left in Bird's answering machine. [...] "I've written a song called 'Beautiful Stranger' and it's all about you. I hope you'll hear it one day because I'll never <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> or stop loving you", Madonna said in her message. [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Madonna with William Orbit whom she had collaborated on Ray of Light.|$|E
500|$|In the 1997 biopic {{film about}} Selena, a store manager asks Latinos running towards the singer for an autograph, [...] "Who's Selena?". Americans felt [...] {{the scene was}} [...] "irrelevant" [...] and [...] "over dramatized". One Selena fan said the event {{depicted}} in the scene [...] "happens all the time" [...] to Latinos and their friends, and that they feel their community has been [...] "ignored". Lauraine Miller said, [...] "Selena has opened my eyes", and that Miller had become [...] "more American". Another fan said, [...] "nobody ever lets you <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> are Mexican American" [...] in the U.S.|$|E

500|$|In 1965, the Chamber pressed Taylor {{for further}} {{upgrades}} to the highway, including safety improvements to intersections {{and the construction}} of adequate shoulders. [...] Taylor stated that the province was doing its best to improve the road, but funds were being spread among other important highway projects in the province. [...] "Meanwhile, you must not <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> have a completely black topped road here, one that is equal to the best roads in some of the other provinces and the United States," [...] Taylor said. [...] Nevertheless, the Chamber was still concerned about the condition of the road, particularly in the Crowsnest Pass region where mountainous terrain and steep grades were making upgrades difficult. [...] There was also concern about the diversion of traffic from Highway3 to the Trans-Canada Highway, which would {{have a negative effect on}} the economies of southern Alberta municipalities.|$|E
500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I <b>forget</b> <b>you,</b> O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{had similar}} {{opinions}} about the song's meaning. Lauren Down of The Guardian expressed that [...] "Wrapped up {{in the aftermath of}} a relationship, 'Out Of Mind' [...] allows the pain of an ending love affair to breath". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that an indifferent person tells the singer that [...] "time will heal her broken heart". According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the singer [...] "tells off" [...] a former boyfriend for expecting her to get over quickly their former relationship. Sam Lansky of Idolator felt that the artist shows [...] "frustrated resignation" [...] while she sings the line [...] "I'll <b>forget</b> <b>you,</b> seriously". In the pre-chorus, the music vanishes and she sings [...] "Are you kidding me?". Lansky felt that the [...] "emotion" [...] on the pre-chorus was [...] "chill-inducing", while Savage wrote that [...] "it's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious. A moment where meaning and musical intent align perfectly". In the chorus, the singer repeats the line [...] "You're out of your mind to think that I" [...] and later finishes it with ...|$|E

2500|$|In another {{interview}} Grohl stated, [...] "I {{wrote that}} song to be a teenage makeout song. I {{just love the}} image of two teenagers making out on the beach listening to that song." [...] Also in the song, Dave changed the last line which is meant to sing [...] "always coming back I cannot <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> girl" [...] to [...] "always coming back I cannot <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> Gil" [...] in reference to their producer Gil Norton.|$|E
2500|$|In final desperation, blank {{sheets of}} paper with only the {{consulate}} seal and his signature (that could be later written over into a visa) were hurriedly prepared and flung out from the train. As he prepared to depart, he said, “Please forgive me. I cannot write anymore. I wish you the best.” [...] When he bowed deeply to the people before him, someone exclaimed, [...] “Sugihara. We’ll never <b>forget</b> <b>you.</b> I’ll surely see you again!” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times review {{suggested}} the game would [...] "fit better {{on a big}} screen in some multiplex", and also added that [...] "Uncharted 2 is ridiculously immersive, {{so much so that}} you <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> are controlling the actions of treasure hunter Nathan Drake ... everything is done right." [...] In a review for The New York Times, Seth Schiesel described it as [...] "perhaps the best-looking game on any system, and no game yet has provided a more genuinely cinematic entertainment experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Die Toten Hosen {{paid tribute}} to Johnny Thunders by {{including}} the line [...] "So lange Johnny Thunders lebt, so lang bleib ich ein Punk" [...] ("As long as Johnny Thunders lives I'll stay a punk") in their song [...] "Wort zum Sonntag". After his death Die Toten Hosen changed the lyrics to [...] "Hey, Johnny kannst du uns grad' seh'n, wir vergessen dich nicht – wir werden überall von dir erzählen damit dein Name ewig weiterlebt." [...] ("Hey, Johnny can you see us right now, we won't <b>forget</b> <b>you</b> – we'll let everyone know about you so that your name lives on eternally.") ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Bestest in the Barn" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} on 12 March 2007. It features Lola and Lotta teaching various animals on their farm how to sing, dance and play music. This is the only track on the album which {{does not appear in}} any episode. Lola and Lotta do however appear as farmers in [...] "I Do Not Ever Never Want My Wobbly Tooth To Fall Out". They also have a tendency to imagine that animals are capable of developing impressive human skills, as seen in [...] "We Do Promise Honestly We Can Look After Your Dog" [...] and [...] "I Will Not Ever Never <b>Forget</b> <b>You</b> Nibbles". [...] "The Bestest in the Barn" [...] now features on a playlist of CBeebies programme music played throughout CBeebies Land at the Alton Towers Resort.|$|E

2500|$|The Pesikta de-Rav Kahana cited [...] for the {{proposition}} that God's fate and Israel's fate are intertwined. According to Bar Kappara, God told Israel that the time of God's redemption (when God would release God's right hand, which was restrained while Israel is in exile) was in Israel's hand, {{and the time of}} Israel's redemption was in God's hand. As the time of God's redemption (and action) was in Israel's hand, therefore, Israel should heed the words of [...] "let not your heart grow haughty so that you forget the Lord your God." [...] And that the time of Israel's redemption was in God's hand was seen in [...] "If I <b>forget</b> <b>you,</b> O Jerusalem, My right hand will forget." [...] To Rabbi Dosa, this verse meant that God said that if God forgot Jerusalem, God's right hand would forget how to perform miracles (and God would thus cease to be God).|$|E
