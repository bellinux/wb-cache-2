For LR, the values of interior elements were averaged by tract, and tracts with fewer than 5 rental listings were removed. For GWR, a regression equation was applied to each individual listing that included the socio-economic data of the listing’s corresponding tract. As a result, each tract was given its own regression equation with unique variable parameters and R squared values. The optimal GWR Gaussian kernel bandwidth size (i.e. search radius) was calibrated to minimize cross-validation error using the spgwr package in R ([URL] and found to be 85 nearest neighbors.|$|E

To explore the efficacy of tree-based models for estimating population density, we compare six different model structures including Random Forest and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.

40|$|We {{discuss how}} {{contemporary}} multiwavelength observations of young OB-dominated clusters address long-standing astrophysical questions: Do clusters form rapidly or slowly with an age spread? When do clusters expand and disperse to constitute the field star population? Do rich clusters form by amalgamation of smaller subclusters? What is the pattern {{and duration of}} cluster formation in massive star forming regions (MSFRs) ? Past observational difficulties in obtaining good stellar censuses of MSFRs have been alleviated in recent studies that combine X-ray and infrared surveys to obtain rich, though still <b>incomplete,</b> <b>censuses</b> of young stars in MSFRs. We describe here one of these efforts, the MYStIX project, that produced a catalog of 31, 784 probable members of 20 MSFRs. We find that age spread within clusters are real {{in the sense that}} the stars in the core formed after the cluster halo. Cluster expansion is seen in the ensemble of (sub) clusters, and older dispersing populations are found across MSFRs. Direct evidence for subcluster merging is still unconvincing. Long-lived, asynchronous star formation is pervasive across MSFRs. Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures.

In Mexico, García-Guerrero and Mellado (2012) and Aburto and García-Guerrero (2015) project mortality using the Lee-Carter model, while Ornelas (2015) fits the Lee-Carter, Renshaw-Haberman, and Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models to obtain fitted rates for the insurance market corrected by general mortality. In Argentina, mortality has been studied by Belliard and Williams (2013), Andreozzi and Blaconá (2011), Andreozzi (2012), and Blaconá and Andreozzi (2014). In this last work, a description of the functional data methodology proposed by Hyndman and Ullah (2007) is presented, which represents an advance over the original Lee-Carter model since it uses nonparametric smoothing to reduce the inherent randomness in the observed data, and the decomposition of the demographic components permits use of classic principal components (Blaconá and Andreozzi 2014). On the other hand, for Chile, Lee and Rofman (1994) extend the Lee-Carter model to solve the problems of <b>incomplete</b> <b>census</b> data.

30|$|Our {{work on the}} second-generation {{advances}} {{the literature}} {{in a number of}} other ways. First, our data source, the Current Population Survey (CPS) has information on the country-of-birth of both parents, permitting us to gauge the relative importance of the characteristics of immigrant mothers versus immigrant women from the fathers’ source country, as well as the strength of intergenerational transmission for individuals with two foreign-born parents compared to those with only one. Previous studies like Fernández and Fogli (2009) are only able to match second-generation individuals with their fathers, due to the <b>incomplete</b> <b>Census</b> data on the birthplace of foreign-born mothers. If gender role transmission from mother to daughter is especially strong, this omission could be particularly important for a study of the transmission of gender roles. In fact, we find that second-generation women’s education, fertility and labor supply are significantly positively affected by the immigrant generation’s levels of these variables but that the effect of mother’s source country fertility and labor supply is generally larger than that of women from the father’s source country and the effect of the education of men from the father’s source country is larger than that of women from the mother’s source country.|$|E
40|$|We use a {{suite of}} cosmological N-body {{simulations}} to study the properties of substructure halos (subhalos) in galaxy-sized cold dark matter halos. We extend prior work on the subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physically associated with the main system. These are defined as subhalos that have at some time been within the virial radius of the main progenitor and have survived as self-bound entities to z = 0. We find that this population extends beyond three times the virial radius, and contains objects on extreme orbits, with some approaching the nominal escape speed from the system. We trace the origin of these unorthodox orbits to multiple-body interactions acting during the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos. Multiple-body interactions affect primarily low-mass subhalos, and push them onto higher energy orbits than their more massive counterparts. This results in a strong mass-dependent bias in the spatial distribution and kinematics of associated subhalos: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, the less centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendant population.

40|$|Abridged) We use cosmological N-body {{simulations}} {{to study}} the properties of substructure halos in galaxy-sized dark matter halos. We extend prior work on the subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physically associated with the main system. These are defined as subhalos that have {{at some time in}} the past been within the virial radius of the halo's main progenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to z= 0. We find that this population extends beyond three times the virial radius, and contains objects on extreme orbits. We trace the origin of these unorthodox orbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results in the ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. Ejected subhalos are primarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatial distribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, the less centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendant population. The bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, but disappears at the low-mass end.

40|$|We {{present results}} from the first robust {{investigation}} of galaxy morphology {{as a function of}} environment at z > 1. 5. Our study is motivated by the fact that star-forming galaxies contained within a protocluster at z = 2. 3 in the HS 1700 + 64 field have significantly older ages and larger stellar masses on average than those at similar redshifts but more typical environmental densities. In the analysis of HST ACS images, we apply nonparametric statistics to characterize the rest-frame UV morphologies of a sample of 85 UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z = 1. 7 - 2. 9, 22 of which are contained in the protocluster. The remaining 63 control sample galaxies are not in the protocluster but have a similar mean redshift of zbar ~ 2. 3. We find no environmental dependence for the distributions of morphological properties. Combining the measured morphologies with the results of population synthesis modeling, we find only weak correlations, if any, between morphological and stellar population properties such as stellar mass, age, extinction, and star formation rate. Given the <b>incomplete</b> <b>census</b> of the protocluster galaxy population, and the lack of correlation between rest-frame UV morphology and star formation history at z ~ 2 within our sample, the absence of environmental trends in the distribution of morphological properties is not surprising. In addition, using a larger sample of photometric candidates, we compare morphological distributions for 282 UV-selected and 43 near-IR-selected galaxies. While the difference in the degree of nebulosity between the two samples appears to be a by-product of the fainter average rest-frame UV surface brightness of the near-IR-selected galaxies, we find that, among the lowest surface brightness galaxies, the near-IR-selected objects have significantly smaller angular sizes...|$|E

Follow-up Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph spectroscopy of 64 candidates, representing 40 per cent of the complete photometric catalogue, confirms Wolf–Rayet signatures in 30 instances, corresponding to a 47 per cent success rate. 21 out of 22 statistically significant photometric sources are spectroscopically confirmed. Nebular emission detected in 30 per cent of the Wolf–Rayet candidates spectrally observed, which enable a re-assessment of the metallicity gradient in NGC  5068.

40|$|A {{determination}} of the initial mass function (IMF) of the current, <b>incomplete</b> <b>census</b> of the 10 Myr-old TW Hya association (TWA) is presented. This census is built from a literature compilation supplemented with new spectra and 17 new radial velocities, {{as well as a}} re-analysis of Hipparcos data that confirmed HR 4334 (A 2 Vn) as a member. Though the dominant uncertainty in the IMF remains census incompleteness, a detailed statistical treatment is carried out to make the IMF determination independent of binning, while accounting for small number statistics. The currently known high-likelihood members are fitted by a log-normal distribution with a central mass of 0. 21 ^+ 0. 11 _- 0. 06 M_ and a characteristic width of 0. 8 ^+ 0. 2 _- 0. 1 dex in the 12 M_ Jup- 2 M_ range, whereas a Salpeter power law with α = 2. 2 ^+ 1. 1 _- 0. 5 best describes the IMF slope in the 0. 1 - 2 M_ range. This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which may be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A tentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2 MASS J 11472421 - 2040204 and 2 MASS J 11193254 - 1137466 is identified: this indicates that there might be as many as 10 ^+ 13 _- 5 similar members of TWA with hot-start model-dependent masses estimated at ∼ 5 - 7 M_ Jup, most of which would be too faint to be detected in 2 MASS. Our new radial velocity measurements corroborate the membership of 2 MASS J 11472421 - 2040204, and secure TWA 28 (M 8. 5 γ), TWA 29 (M 9. 5 γ) and TWA 33 (M 4. 5 e) as members.

40|$|We present {{spectral}} energy distributions (SEDs), Spitzer colours, {{and infrared}} (IR) luminosities for 850 -μm selected {{galaxies in the}} Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey Northern (GOODS-N) field. Using the deep Spitzer Legacy images and new data and reductions of the Very Large Array-Hubble Deep Field (VLA-HDF) radio data, we find statistically secure counterparts for 60 per cent (21 / 35) of our submillimetre (submm) sample, and identify tentative counterparts for another 12 objects. This is the largest sample of submm galaxies with statistically secure counterparts detected in the radio and with Spitzer. Half of the secure counterparts have spectroscopic redshifts, while the other half have photometric redshifts. We find that {{in most cases the}} 850 -μm emission is dominated by a single 24 -μm source, with a median flux density of 241 μJy, leading to a median 24 -to- 850 -μm flux density ratio of 0. 040. A composite rest-frame SED shows that the submm sources peak at longer wavelengths than those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Using a basic grey-body model, 850 -μm selected galaxies appear to be cooler than local ULIRGs of the same luminosity. This demonstrates the strong selection effects, both locally and at high redshift, which may lead to an <b>incomplete</b> <b>census</b> of the ULIRG population. The SEDs of submm galaxies are also different from those of their high-redshift neighbours, the near-IR selected BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR-to-radio SEDs are more like those of local ULIRGs. Using 24 -μm, 850 -μm and 1. 4 -GHz observations, we fit templates that span the mid-IR through radio to derive the integrated IR luminosity (LIR) of the submm galaxies and find a median value of LIR(8 – 1000 μm) = 6. 0 × 1012 L. By themselves, 24 -μm and radio fluxes are able to predict LIR reasonably well because they are relatively insensitive to temperature. However, the submm flux by itself consistently overpredicts LIR when using spectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature–luminosity relation. The shorter Spitzer wavelengths sample the stellar bump at the redshifts of the submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer photometry alone provides a model-independent estimate of the redshift, σ[Δz/(1 + z) ] = 0. 07. The median redshift for our secure submm counterparts is 2. 0. Using X-ray and mid-IR data, only 5 per cent of our secure counterparts (1 / 21) show strong evidence for an active galactic nucleus dominating the LIR...|$|E
40|$|This ornithological report {{covering}} the years 1982 and 1983 follows on {{from a series}} begun in 1950. lt deals mainly {{with the results of}} the long-term monitoring of several bird communities in the Camargue and lists a few species which are accidentai in the area. The baseline for inclusion of unusual observations is provided by the Guide des Oiseaux de Camargue (Blondel et Isenmann, 1981) which gives the status and phenology of the 337 species recorded in the Camargue, the Crau and the Alpilles. Now that a rare birds committee has been established in France only those observations accepted by this committee will in future be published here. The present report, however, was written before the committee had given a verdict on sorne of the observations submitted. The meteorological report shows that 1982 was a dry year with a mild winter and a hot summer. The autumn was mild and characterised by a freak storm from the S. E. on the 7 - 8 November 1983 was also a dry year; the spring was dominated by frequent and strong S. E. winds and the summer was hot. Cormorants have been censused for the 3 rd and 4 th consecutive winters and their numbers have peaked at between 4 000 and 6 000 (Fig. 1). The recent increase in numbers can perhaps be related to the increase of the breeding populations of Denmark and Rolland, since ringed birds from Rolland have been sighted in the Camargue. Reed-nesting herons are censuse d annually by aerial photography over the major part of the south coast of Franoe. The Grey heron continues to increase in number and to extend its range (Table l). Purple heron numbers have increased since 1981, but unlike the Grey, the major colonies of this species are not situated within the Camargue proper but to the East and West of the two main arms of the river. Tree-nesting herons have also been censused annually since 1968. Their numbers are given in Table II, from which {{it can be seen that}} the Cattle egret population has practically stopped increasing and now fluctuates at around 400 pairs. Both Little and Cattle egrets have also been censused at the winter roosts (Table III). Breeding Bitterns we re also censused and 5 4 « boom ing) males were located in the greater Camargue area in 1983; the number found in the Camargue proper (24) being the same as in 1982. Both years produced record numbers of flamingos breeding in the delta : 10500 pairs raised 6825 chicks in 1982 and 14400 pairs raised 7200 chicks in 1983, the latter being the only colony established throughout the western Mediterranean. The ringing programme started in 1977 was continued and 652 and 720 chicks respectively were marked the two years. These birds are individually recogniseable in the field and there have now been over 19000 contacts from a total of 4688 colour-ringed flamingos (56 % of the sample). Sightings are from the Western Mediterranean in particular, but with a few birds in Senegal, Mauritania and Libya. Following the strong S. E. winds of early November 1982, small groups of flamingos were sighted well inland in France. One ringed bird is known to have returned to the Camargue after being seen on the River Isère (Drôme), 185 km up the Rhône valley. In spite of the large numbers of flamingos in the Camargue these two springs the problem of these birds feeding in the rice-paddies has not worsened. On the contrary, the scaring campaings have paid off and no subsequent damage was reported by the farmers (even though the area under rice cultivation has increased). The wintering Bewick's Swan population peaked at 55 - 60 in 1981 - 82 and 68 in 1982 - 83, rather lower than the peaks of 85 and 82 individuals recorded in the past. Over the past six years the number of Shelducks recorded along the south coast of France prior to breeding has been around 1400 individuals. About 500 pairs breed in the area, mainly in the salines of the Camargue and Petite Camargue. The colour-ringing programme was continued and a further 69 birds were marked, bringing the total of individually recogniseable Shelducks ringed since 1978 to 316. Sightings of these birds on the « Grosser Knechtsand » have shown that birds from the south of France join the vast majority of birds from North Western Europe for the annual moult in the German Waddenzee (see Table IV). Following the cold spell in N. Europe in winter 1981 - 82, a record number of 2060 Shelducks were counted in S. France, most of these (1876) being in the Camargue and Petite Camargue. Results of the monthly winter censuses of other Anatidae species, carried out by the C. N. R. S. since 1964 - 65, are summarised in Table V and VI, prepared and commented upon by A. Tamisier. During the winter of 1982 - 83 total duck numbers peaked at only 100000. This is lower than usual and may be attributed to two factors mainly : the S. E. storm of early November and the gradual loss of good habitat (disturbance by hunting and fishing has increased). In order to emphasize the importance of disturbance-free areas the numbers of ducks recorded on the St Seren marsh located in the centre of the Tour du Valat Reserve are given in Table VII. Regarding the larger raptors there has been no change in the status of the Egyptian vulture and Eagle owl in the Alpilles, but the two pairs of Bonelli's eagles have had very poor breeding seasons with only 2 young raised in two years. In the Camargue there has been no detectable change in the Marsh harrier population, an estimated 84 occupied nest sites being located in 1982. In the Crau the winte ring population of Little bustards has remained relatively stable over the past ten years at around 1000 individuals (max. 1283 in Dec. 1982. Amongst the waders on passage unusually high numbers of Marsh sandpipers, up to 15 - 16 together, have been recorde deach autumn. a Terek sandpiper was shot locally in Sept. 1983 and there are two further May records of Wilson's phalarope, a species now observed almost annually. The 1982 census of breeding laro-limicolae revealed 26 pairs of Slenderbilled gulls but these failed to raise any chicks. In 1983, however, a similar number of pairs raised 60 young, by far the most successful season on record for this species. Mediterranean gulls also had two good seasons with a record 13 pairs in 1982 and 14 young raised in 1983 by 5 - 6 pairs (<b>incomplete</b> <b>census).</b> Whiskered terns, on the other hand, did not breed in 1982 and failed in their attempt in 1983 (200 + pairs). Amongst the passerines a Desert wheatear was recorded in the Crau in February 1983. This bird, the second recorded from the Crau in 3 years, has been accepted by the rareties committee.
