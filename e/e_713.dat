40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} the associations {{of treatment and}} an additive gene tic efficacy score (AGES) based on dopamine functional polymorphisms with time to first smoking lapse and point prevalence abstinence at end of treatment among participants enrolled into two randomized clinical trials of smoking cessation therapies. Design: Double-blind pharmacogenetic efficacy trials randomizing participants to active or placebo bupropion. Study 1 also randomized participants to cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment (CBT) or this treatment with CBT for depression. Study 2 provided standardized behavioural support. Setting: Two hospital-affiliated clinics (study 1), and two university-affiliated clinics (study 2). Participants: A total of 792 self-identified white treatment-seeking smokers aged ≥ 18 years smoking ≥ 10 cigarettes per day over the last year. Measurements: Age, gender, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, dopamine pathway genotypes (rs 1800497 [ANKK 1 <b>E</b> <b>713</b> K], rs 4680 [COMT V 158 M], DRD 4 exon 3 variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism [DRD 4 VNTR], SLC 6 A 3, 3 ′VNTR) analyzed both separately {{and as part of}} an AGES, time to first lapse and point prevalence abstinence at end of treatment. Findings: Significant associations of the AGES (hazard ratio [HR] = 1. 10, 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 1. 06 - 1. 14, P= 0. 009) and of the DRD 4 VNTR (HR= 1. 29, 95 % CI= 1. 17 - 1. 41, P= 0. 0073) were observed with time to first lapse. A significant AGES by pharmacotherapy interaction was observed (β standard error=- 0. 18 [0. 07], P= 0. 016), such that AGES predicted risk for time to first lapse only for individuals randomized to placebo. Conclusions: A score based on functional polymorphisms relating to dopamine pathways appears to predict lapse to smoking following a quit attempt, and the association is mitigated in smokers using bupropion. © 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Glycoprotein E 2, the immunodominant protein of {{classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV), can induce neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity in pigs. Our previous phylogenetic analysis showed that subgroup 2. 1 viruses branched away from subgroup 1. 1, the vaccine C-strain lineage, and became dominant in China. The E 2 glycoproteins of CSFV C-strain and recent subgroup 2. 1 field isolates are genetically different. However, {{it has not been}} clearly demonstrated how this diversity affects antigenicity of the protein. Results Antigenic variation of glycoprotein E 2 was observed not only between CSFV vaccine C-strain and subgroup 2. 1 strains, but also among strains of the same subgroup 2. 1 as determined by ELISA-based binding assay using pig antisera to the C-strain and a representative subgroup 2. 1 strain QZ- 07 currently circulating in China. Antigenic incompatibility of E 2 proteins markedly reduced neutralization efficiency against heterologous strains. Single amino acid substitutions of D 705 N, L 709 P, G <b>713</b> <b>E,</b> N 723 S, and S 779 A on C-strain recombinant E 2 (rE 2) proteins significantly increased heterologous binding to anti-QZ- 07 serum, suggesting that these residues may be responsible for the antigenic variation between the C-strain and subgroup 2. 1 strains. Notably, a G <b>713</b> <b>E</b> substitution caused the most dramatic enhancement of binding of the variant C-strain rE 2 protein to anti-QZ- 07 serum. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the glutamic acid residue at this position is conserved within group 2 strains, while the glycine residue is invariant among the vaccine strains, highlighting the role of the residue at this position as a major determinant of antigenic variation of E 2. A variant Simpson's index analysis showed that both codons and amino acids of the residues contributing to antigenic variation have undergone similar diversification. Conclusions These results demonstrate that CSFV vaccine C-strain and group 2 strains circulating in China differ in the antigenicity of their E 2 glycoproteins. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of the antigenic units has revealed residues that limit cross-reactivity. Our findings may be useful for the development of serological differential assays and improvement of immunogenicity of novel {{classical swine fever}} vaccines. </p...|$|R

The study was conducted {{in order to determine the}} relationship between various agronomic traits as number of tillers, stalk height, stalk thickness, cane yield and brix value with sugar recovery. Genotypic and phenotypic correlation coefficient studies of each morphological character with sugar recovery showed negative and non-significant correlations with number of tillers, stalk height and cane yield. Positive but non-significant genotypic and phenotypic correlations were observed between sugar recovery and stalk girth. Only brix value showed positive and significant genotypic correlation with sugar recovery, while phenotypically this correlation was positive but non-significant. The results of the stepwise regression analysis indicated that on single factor basis the maximum R-square value of 0. 594 was for brix value related to sugar recovery. The two variable model including the cane yield and brix value yielded highest R-square value of 0. 699 with sugar recovery. When a three variable model was performed, out of all the combinations, the best one was for the stalk girth, cane yield and brix value with R-square 0. 708.

Plants provide {{a reservoir of}} biochemical compounds; among these compounds some have inhibitory effect on mosquitoes. In the present study the larvicidal, adulticidal and genotoxic activity of essential oil of Psoralea corylifolia Linn. against Culex quinquefasciatus Say was explored. Methods Essential oil was isolated from the seeds of P. corylifolia Linn. Larvicidal and adulticidal bioassay of Cx. quinquefasciatus {{was carried out by}} WHO method. Genotoxic activity of samples was determined by comet assay. Identification of different compounds was carried out by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry analysis. Results LC 50 and LC 90 values of essential oil were 63. 38 ± 6. 30 and 99. 02 ± 16. 63 ppm, respectively against Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae. The LD 50 and LD 90 values were 0. 057 ± 0. 007 and 0. 109 ± 0. 014 mg/cm 2 respectively against adult Cx. quinquefasciatus,. Genotoxicity of adults was determined at 0. 034 and 0. 069 mg/cm 2.

When pituitary cells were incubated with 1 X 10 M E 2 for 6 h or longer, decreased FSH but increased LH basal secretion was observed. Further, both LHRH-induced FSH and LU release were enhanced by E 2. The degree of this enhancement was dependent on E 2 concentration, and a concentration of E 2 higher than 1 O M was required. There was a lag period of only 2 h before the agumentative effect of E 2 on LI-IRH-induced FSH and LU release could first be measured. Our study also demonstrated that E 2 not only reduced the LIIRI-I concentration required for inducing the half-maximal response (ED 20) of FSII and LH secretion, but it increased the maximal response of FSH and LH to LHRH stimu-lation. In addition, LIIRII alone, or together with E 2, altered intracellular and media concentra-tion of gonadotropins, but not the total amounts. In conclusion, although E 2 has different effects on the basal secretion of FSFI and LH, it increases the responsiveness of ovine pituitary cells to LIIRH-induced FSII and LII secretion. The sensitization effect of E 2 is most likely exerted on the releasable gonadotropin pool rather than on de novo synthesis of FSH and LH...|$|R

Also, following 5 or 11 daily injections of 10 g estradiol- 1 <b>713</b> (<b>E</b> 2), the levels were significantly lower in the fatty rats. The equilibrium dissociation constants of the cytosol and nuclear ER were similar in both types of rats, as were the S values after sedimentation of the ER through 5 - 20 % sucrose gradients. When nuclear translocation and cytosol replenishment of the uterine ER were examined, however, {{it was found that the}} peak of nuclear retention of the ER after an injection of E 2 occurred after 1 h in the lean rats and after 2 h in the fatty rats. Cytosol replenishment, moreover, was less in the fatty compared to the lean rats. The peak of nuclear ER retention correlated with the peak of in t’ivo uterine RNA synthesis as measured by a 1 h pulse of l 3 Hl uridine incorporation in vivo. The lean rats, however, also showed a second peak of incorporation occurring 8 h after E 2 injec-tion. This second peak was not observed with the fatty rat. ER levels were also measured in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Hypothalamic levels of the ER of fatty and lean rats were similar, but the fatty rat pituitaries had lower amounts of ER as compared to pituitaries from lean rats. Also, the wet weights of fatty rat pituitaries were lower than those from lean rats. Our data shows that the infertility in the Zucker obese rat is accompan-ied by physiological changes in the estradiol-receptor interaction in the uterus. Whether these changes contribute to the observed infertility is unknown at this time...|$|R
40|$|THE ORPHIC PAPYRUS ROLL OF THESSALONICA (Plates 12 - 15) In {{the course}} of an {{excavation}} of tombs conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service at Derveni, a site about 10 km. North of Thessalonica, in the first months of 1962, among the remnants of the funeral pyre of tomb A was found a carbonized Greek papyrus roll. This is the first manuscript on papyrus to have been discovered so far in the soil of the Greek metropolis as against the thousands of similar finds coming from Herculanum, Egypt or Palestine. Unfortunately the roll was not found intact. Only its upper part, 7 - 8 cm. high, had been preserved, the rest of it having apparently been destroyed by the fire. The impossible task of unrolling the extremely fragile object was carried out by Mr. Anton Fackelmann, conservator of the Vienna National Library collection of papyri, who finally succeeded, by using juice of fresh papyrus, in making the carbonized roll manageable. Thus the text became accessible for decipherment and further investigation. The importance of the new manuscript lies chiefly in its early date. A comparison of its writing with that of the oldest known papyri coming from the last decades of the IVth century (particularly that of the Timotheos papyrus), {{as well as with the}} inscriptions of the same century suggests that the new roll was written about the middle of the IVth century B. C. If this is true, as I firmly believe despite some doubts expressed by other scholars, this roll must be the oldest Greek manuscript now in existence. Moreover its neat appearance is significant in that it proves that by this time a real Buchschrift had been developed in Greece, whereas in Egypt even later Greek literary papyri were written in clumsy and rather crude hand (cf. W. Schubart, Einleitung in die Papyruskunde, Berlin 1918, p. 30). The unrolling gave only a series of small and large fragments and several tiny scraps. However the relation of most of these fragments between each other have now been established, and this has been partly feasible thanks to the young photographer Mr. Spyros Tsavdaroglou, who supplied us with excellent photographs. In this task as well as in the decipherment of the text, in many places obscure and desperately damaged, I largely profited by the palaeographic and scholarly experience of my assistant Mr. K. Tsantsanoglou. Twenty two columns can now be recognized with certainty. As the place of a few fragments and scraps has not yet been identified we cannot say how many columns the roll contained originally. The number of the lines preserved differs from column to column ranging from eleven to sixteen; but the last lines generally present large gaps. The number of lines contained in the lower part of the roll, now lost, cannot actually be reckoned. It should be noted that the continuation of the text in subsequent columns is very rarely obvious. The length of the lines varies between thirty one to forty two letters, the copyist finishing each line with a full word or, exceptionally, with the first component of a compound. The style of the script is the same throughout the text, but after the seventh column a finer calamos was employed. The text is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem of cosmogenic and theogenic content. Eighteen verses of this poem are quoted separately, marked by the sign of paragraphos, while other words or phrases are inserted in the text of the commentary itself. This poem, alluded to by Plato (Laws <b>713</b> <b>e),</b> was known from Ps. - Aristotle’s de Mundo 1 (401 a 25) and appears later on in an expanded form in the socalled Rhapsodic Theogony (ιεροί λόγοι εν ραψωδίαις κδ'). Since the time of the composition of the Orphic Theogony is uncertain, the new text will probably cast new light on this puzzling problem. Besides the Orphic verses the commentator quotes three Homeric verses (also instructive for the tradition of the Homeric text) in order to corroborate his explanation of a word of the poem commented on by him. For it is a feature of this author’s method to combine allegoric interpretation with lexical explanations. However this method of lexical explanation and quotation of verses does not prove that this commentary is in any way connected with Alexandrian scholarship. Even if the date of the new roll permitted such a hypothesis, the fact that here the main point is the allegoric interpretation, which was alien to Alexandrian scholarship, excludes any connection with the latter. Here another tradition, that of allegoric interpretation of poetry, which appears already in the Vlth century, is in operation. There is evidence that allegoric interpreters pursued lexical explanation (an example is offered by Metrodoros from Lampsacus). The language of this text, which contains poetic and Ionic forms, makes it probable that the commentator of the Orphic poem, like other allegorists, did not come from Athens but from the periphery of the Greek world. Yet nothing is certain about his identity. Epigenes who is stated to have written On Orpheus' Poetry (Clem. Al. Strom. I 21, 131, 5 = II 81, 11 St.) and explained the expressions of Orphic symbolism [ibid. V 8, 49, 3 = 360, 10 St.), though seemingly not unfamiliar with lexical explanation (cf. Athen. 468 c) should be excluded since the allegoric explanations of this commentary are quite different from his own...|$|R
