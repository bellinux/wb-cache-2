5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She {{was not going to be}} a fugitive, instead her husband was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E
25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

He explained [...] "I was stupid. I thought I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood and conquer the world, and I didn't."

No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him.

While saying the group would assemble to record new material, Lee announced the release of The Open Door to her fans during a post on an unofficial Evanescence website, EvBoard.com. The album progressed slowly because of Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke, Will Boyd's and Ben Moody's departure, and the loss of their former manager. Lee said on a fan's internet forum the new recording would be completed in March 2006; the release was postponed because [...] "Wind-up Records...wanted to make a few changes to the upcoming single [...] "Call Me When You're Sober".

[...] Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to [...] "...have the women be something other than a victim, a hostage, other things when [...] dealing with an immortal hero." [...] Consequently, the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but [...] were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod.

500|$|More than 1,000 viewers {{complained to}} ITV {{and more than}} 2,000 to Ofcom when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole refused to vote off either act in the bottom two (Cohen and Waissel) and {{was not allowed to}} vote last and force a deadlock. A {{spokesperson}} for The X Factor explained: [...] "A judge can abstain from placing a vote. [...] made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. [...] went back to her to clarify that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a majority vote if she did that.

[...] However, a Daily Mail poll of 6,890 people showed that 4,795 of them wanted Cole to be sacked for refusing to vote. O'Leary revealed that during the previous commercial break, when the bottom two was known to the producers, they realized that Cole might abstain and decided in that if she did, they would go to a majority vote. After the series ended, voting statistics showed that Waissel received fewer votes than Cohen, meaning that if the result went to deadlock, Waissel would have been eliminated.|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
