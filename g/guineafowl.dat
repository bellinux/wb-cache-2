5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, <b>guineafowl</b> and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E
40|$|Birds are {{hosts of}} the {{immature}} stages of several ixodid tick species (Theiler 1962) and consequent-ly {{could serve as}} a source of subsequent adult tick infestation for other hosts. This is particularly so for migrating birds (Hoogstraal, Kaiser, Traylor, Gaber & Guindy 1961), or species such as helmeted guinea-fowls, Numida meleagris, that on occasion can har-bour large numbers of immature ticks (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak, Spickett, Braack & Williams 1991). Two species of <b>guineafowls</b> and several spe-cies of francolins occur in South Africa and of these the ixodid tick burdens of helmeted <b>guineafowls,</b> Cape francolins, Francolinus capensis, and grey-wing francolins, Francolinus africanus, have been determined (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak et al. 1991; Horak & Boomker 1998). Similar data for crested francolins, Francolinus sephaena, or crest-ed <b>guineafowls,</b> Guttera pucherani, both of which occur in the northern and north-eastern regions of South Africa, have not been collected. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether crested francolins, which prefer thick cover and matted vegetation, play the same role as hel-meted <b>guineafowls,</b> which prefer thorny scrub and savanna veld, as hosts for the immature stages of ticks of veterinary importance.

5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the <b>guineafowl.</b> Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy wattles, called a snood, that hang {{from the top of}} the beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted <b>guineafowl</b> (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|Later {{research}} {{has managed to}} create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations). Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the <b>guineafowl</b> Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 234 helmeted <b>guineafowls,</b> Numida meleagris coronata, were {{examined}} for lice at five localities in South Africa.

A total of eight louse species, comprising Amyrsidea desousai, Clayia theresae, Goniodes gigas, Goniodes numidae, Lipeurus numidae, Numidicola antennatus, Numidilipeurus lawrensis and Somaphantus lusius were recovered from the <b>guineafowls.</b> With the exception of A. desousai, which was not recovered from the <b>guineafowls</b> in the Bontebok National Park, all eight species were present on the birds at each locality. The prevalence of infestations on the birds at the various localities ranged from 99, 2 - 100 %, and the numbers of lice present on individual birds, from 0 - 3619. Goniodes spp. and N. antennatus were the most abundant and A. desousai the least. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

In Esperanto, therefore, a numido would be any bird of the genus Numida, and a meleagra numido the helmeted <b>guineafowl</b> specifically.
