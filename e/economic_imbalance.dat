25|$|The {{economic}} downturn in Ireland {{was not a}} recession but a slowdown {{in the rate of}} economic expansion. Signs of a recovery became evident in late 2003, as US investment levels increased once again. Many senior economists have heavily criticised the government for the <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance</b> in favour of the construction industry, and the prospect of sustaining economic growth in the future.|$|E
25|$|Although the Bumiputra {{have always}} been the largest racial segment of the Malaysian {{population}} (about 65%), their economic position has also tended to be precarious. As late as 1970, 13 years after the drafting of the constitution, they controlled only 4% of the economy, with much of the rest being held by Chinese and foreign interests. As a result, the Reid Commission had recommended the drafting of Article 153 to address this <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{obstacles}} to reunification {{are the same}} as in 1956: having Nantes in Brittany could harm the position of Rennes and create an <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance</b> between Lower and Upper Brittany. Moreover, the Pays de la Loire region could not exist without Loire-Atlantique, because it would lose its political and economic capital. Without Loire-Atlantique, the other départements would not form an efficient region any more, and would have to integrate neighbouring regions such as the Centre-Val de Loire and Poitou-Charentes.|$|E
40|$|This {{submitted}} article identifies {{relations between}} the degree of decentralization and <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{on the basis of}} a cluster (exploratory) analysis. Two indicators have been chosen for measuring economic inequalities: an indicator of dispersion of regional GDP per capita as representative of the performance imbalances within countries (it measures the economic development gap among regions in European countries); and a multidimensional inequality-adjusted human development index as representative of inequalities in the distribution of wealth in the countries. Decentralization is measured by means of a decentralization index, which contains both quantitative and qualitative components. Although groups of countries characterised by a high degree of decentralization do not necessarily show the lowest degrees of <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances,</b> it is however possible to conclude that the countries in groups with a higher degree of decentralization are among those countries with more favourable values of the <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances</b> indicators monitored. As a part of the research, two clusters of countries were identified which are identical in their degree of decentralization, but differ in the results connected with <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> The differences are caused by different institutional qualities in the two groups...|$|R
30|$|As {{stated in}} the introduction, CPI {{inflation}} appears {{not to be a}} sufficient statistic of <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances</b> and, hence, the estimates of potential output might not be properly reflecting the economic growth that an economy can attain with its resources and technology. To ascertain whether that possibility holds formally, we test to what extent the potential output growth estimates made over time—real time—are systematically associated with the changes in the set of variables defined in Table 1, which are considered to capture <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances.</b>|$|R
40|$|Unemployment {{is a major}} {{imbalance}} in the labour market. There are more factors that maycause such an imbalance. Sometimes, there are certain correlations between unemploymentand other <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Such correlations may be discovered betweenunemployment, on one hand, and simple or multiple factors of influence, on the other hand. Using modern statistical software, the author analyses the correlation betweenunemployment and other <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances.</b> In order to do that, the author considers thepossible influence {{of the dynamics of}} inflation and GDP (considered separately andtogether) upon unemployment developments (in Romania, during 1990 - 2010) ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, {{substantial}} {{economic reforms}} (Malaysian New Economic Policy) were enacted {{to address the}} <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance.</b> In the 1980s and 1990s, more affirmative action was also implemented to create a Malay class of entrepreneurs. Public opposition to such policies appeared to wither away after the rioting of May 1969, with parties running {{on a platform of}} reducing Bumiputra privileges losing ground in Parliamentary elections. However, {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, debate was revived when several government politicians made controversial statements on the nature of Malay privileges as set out by Article 153.|$|E
500|$|According to the Second Malaysia Plan, the NEP {{aimed to}} [...] "create a Malay {{commercial}} and industrial community" [...] through [...] "wholly owned enterprises and joint ventures". Prior to this, the government had, {{in the words of}} a local economist, played [...] "administrative, supportive, and regulatory" [...] roles in attempting to address the <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance,</b> but avoided [...] "represent direct and active efforts in promoting" [...] Malay interests. Now, the government would not only [...] " [...] access of the Chinese and Indian population to universities, public jobs and public money," [...] but also actively intervene in the economy to give [...] " [...] a bigger piece of the business action". One criticism of this increased intervention was that UMNO supposedly [...] "became a major beneficiary of the expanded role of the state".|$|E
500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance,</b> pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{unrestrained}} timber {{demand from}} Basle led to considerable <b>economic</b> <b>imbalances</b> and less sustainable forestry in the Wiesental, which then led to various bureaucratic bans on timber and coal exports.

2500|$|Under {{the monarchy}} the <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance</b> between the Hutus and the Tutsis crystallized, and a complex {{political}} imbalance {{emerged as the}} Tutsis formed into a hierarchy dominated by a Mwami or 'king'.

2500|$|Among some individuals, {{poverty is}} {{considered}} a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be {{an essential element of}} renunciation in religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism (only for monks, not for lay persons) and Jainism, whilst in Roman Catholicism {{it is one of the}} evangelical counsels. [...] The main aim of giving up things of the materialistic world is to withdraw oneself from sensual pleasures (as they are considered illusionary and only temporary in some religions - such as the concept of dunya in Islam). This self-invited poverty (or giving up pleasures) is different from the one caused by <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, the First Malaysia Plan—whose {{approach}} {{had been}} {{dependent on the}} Malays [...] "availing themselves of these facilities and services and putting them to good use"—failed in addressing the <b>economic</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Its policies also resulted in discontent among the non-Malays, who mostly supported the opposition parties that favoured reducing or eliminating affirmative action for the Bumiputra in the 1969 general election. A victory parade held on May 12 by supporters of the opposition led to a retaliatory rally on May 13 by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a major party in the governing Alliance coalition. However, the rally soon turned into a riot which lasted two days. Officially, around 200people died—although others have given much larger estimates—with thousands left homeless, {{the majority of them}} Chinese. A state of emergency was declared, and Parliament was suspended. The National Operations Council (NOC) governed until 1971, when Parliament reconvened.|$|E
