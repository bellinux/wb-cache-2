5|$|Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, , <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> of the Supreme Court of the United States {{concerning}} {{the constitutionality of}} funding restrictions imposed by the United States Congress. At issue were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions, believing {{it was the only}} way to get Velazquez financial relief.|$|E
5|$|Ex parte Crow Dog, , <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> of the Supreme Court of the United States that {{followed}} {{the death of one}} member of a Native American tribe at the hands of another on reservation land. Crow Dog {{was a member of the}} Brulé band of the Lakota Sioux. On August5, 1881 he shot and killed Spotted Tail, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to Sioux tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow Dog for murder in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. The Supreme Court held that unless authorized by Congress, federal courts had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. Crow Dog was therefore released. This case was the first time in history that an Indian was held on trial for the murder of another Indian. The case led to the Major Crimes Act in 1885, which placed some major crimes (initially seven, now 15) under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the plenary power legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit tribal sovereignty.|$|E

25|$|The best {{possible}} prediction method would yield {{a point in}} the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case of a balanced coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E
25|$|The halting problem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> problem about {{properties}} of computer programs {{on a fixed}} Turing-complete model of computation, i.e., all programs that can be written in some given programming language that is general enough to be equivalent to a Turing machine. The problem is to determine, given a program and an input to the program, whether the program will eventually halt when run with that input. In this abstract framework, there are no resource limitations {{on the amount of}} memory or time required for the program's execution; it can take arbitrarily long, and use an arbitrary amount of storage space, before halting. The question is simply whether the given program will ever halt on a particular input.|$|E
