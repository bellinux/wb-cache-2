50|$|According to the 1871 census Robert Moodie {{was then}} 53 {{years old and}} a hotel keeper. His wife, Elizabeth was 55 and they had eight {{children}} that {{ranged in age from}} 28 to 13. The eldest son was a blacksmith while the second eldest farmed their land. The farm consisted of around 100 acres of improved land. Twenty acres were dedicated to pasture, half an acre for gardening/orchard, eight for wheat, two acres for potatoes and around 60 acres for hay. The land also had one house, two barns, three carriages, four carts, six ploughs one reaper, one <b>horse</b> <b>rack</b> and one fanning mill. That year the crop yields consisted of 75 bushels of wheat, 150 bushels of barley, 300 bushels of oats, five bushels of beans, 200 bushels of potatoes, 40 bushels of turnips, 10 bushels of beets, 35 bushels of carrots, six bushels of pears/plums and 80 tons of hay. The livestock on the land consisted of nine horses/colts, eight milk cows, 13 cattle, 18 sheep, 13 swine and three beehives. These animals produced a total of 700 pounds of butter, 75 pounds of honey, 100 pounds of wool and four muskrat and eight mink furs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> Breeders' Association of America was {{originally}} {{formed as a}} vehicle for the promotion of horses shown without the artificial and extreme devices often seen in Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breed showing. However, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> is one of the breeds often harmed by the inhumane practice of soring, prohibited at the federal level by the Horse Protection Act of 1970. Soring is an abusive practice used to accentuate the gaits of breeds such as the Tennessee Walking <b>Horse</b> and <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse,</b> in order to gain an unfair advantage in competition.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1900s, <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> enthusiasts formed {{their own}} group, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> Breeders Association of America, and their breed was {{recognized}} by the United States Department of Agriculture as separate from the Tennessee Walking Horse in 1971. In 1975, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> was designated the official state horse of Alabama.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> Breeders' Association of America (RHBAA) is the {{original}} registry for the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> breed. It was formed in 1971 in Decatur, Alabama and is still located there.|$|R
50|$|Fairly common, usually seen in jumping {{horses and}} in <b>horses</b> that <b>rack</b> in an {{inverted}} frame.|$|R
50|$|Horses that {{naturally}} have an upright neck with high head carriage, {{as well as}} animated gaits and high action are best at saddle seat. They should be very energetic but still remain responsive to the rider's aids. Several breeds do well in this discipline, with the most well-known being the American Saddlebred. Other breeds commonly exhibited in saddle seat style are the National Show Horse, Tennessee Walking <b>Horses,</b> <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses,</b> Spotted Saddle Horses, Morgans, and Arabians. In addition, Hackneys, Dutch Harness Horses, Paso Finos, Missouri Foxtrotters, and Rocky Mountain Horses are sometimes shown in this discipline. Less often, Friesians and Andalusians are exhibited.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> is {{also used}} as a trail and {{pleasure}} horse, and the RHBAA has a versatility program in place through which <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> can earn awards by participating {{in a variety of}} activities, including endurance riding.|$|R
50|$|Another large {{event in}} Decatur and North Alabama, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> World Celebration attracts horses {{from around the}} world to compete in the largest <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> competition. Held in the Celebration Arena near Priceville, the celebration draws up to 75,000 fans and {{competitors}} each year.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> {{is a light}} riding horse, {{standing}} {{an average}} of [...] high and weighing around 1000 lbs kg. Overall, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> is described as [...] "attractive and gracefully built". The neck is long, the shoulders and croup sloping and the build overall well-muscled.|$|R
50|$|The term {{wash rack}} {{is also used}} to {{describe}} pads for washing <b>horses.</b> Wash <b>racks</b> for vehicle washing may be called closed-loop washing systems, heavy duty wash systems and degreasing pads.|$|R
50|$|The Spring Celebration, {{formerly}} known as the Spring Warm-Up is held in mid-to-late April and begins the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> show season each year. It is very similar in style and level of competition to the World Show, but only lasts four days. It is the second-largest <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> show in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|S. 1406, {{introduced}} July 31, 2013, a bill {{to permit}} the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for the issuance of permits for people hired {{for the management of}} horse shows, exhibitions, auctions, and sales, requiring all such individuals to be qualified to identify instances of soring. Individuals receiving the permits must be cleared of any potential conflicts of interest and preference is to be given to accredited veterinarians. The bill further makes it a crime for any person to sell, auction, exhibit, or race any sore horse, and bans Tennessee Walking <b>Horses,</b> <b>Racking</b> <b>horses,</b> and Spotted Saddle horses from being sold, auctioned, exhibited, or raced if they are equipped with any action device (which the bill defines) or equipment that would alter the gait of the horse. A companion bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 1518.|$|R
50|$|The {{ancestors}} of the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> were first bred on southern plantations prior to the American Civil War. They could be ridden comfortably for hours because of their smooth, natural gait. They were also bred for a good disposition, intelligence, and versatility. Their development {{was similar to that}} of the Tennessee Walking Horse, also popular in the southeastern US. In the late 1800s, horse shows became increasingly popular in the southeastern United States, as an alternative to the gambling associated with <b>horse</b> racing. <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> were most commonly seen at small shows, although they were also seen at larger ones. They did not have their own breed association, however, and were often shown as a type of Tennessee Walking Horse.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> is a horse breed {{derived from}} the Tennessee Walking Horse, {{recognized}} by the USDA in 1971. It is known for a distinctive singlefoot gait. In 1971, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> Breeders' Association of America, headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, was formed as the breed registry. Its goal is to preserve the breed in a natural state {{with little or no}} artificial devices that enhance gait. The horse's tail is naturally raised without nicking or tail sets. Some classes allow special shoes that enhance action, and a new class allows the use of chains, six ounces and under as action devices. The practice of soring, illegal under the Horse Protection Act of 1970, is also seen within the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> world. Since the breed's inception, about 80,000 <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> have been registered, with the largest populations located in the US states of Alabama and Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> World Celebration is {{the largest}} show for the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> breed. It is held {{annually}} in late September at the Celebration Arena in Priceville, Alabama, a few miles outside Decatur. The Celebration encompasses over a week of nightly shows, and includes approximately 170 classes. Over 1,000 horses compete there each year.The World Celebration's counterpart is the Spring Celebration, held in April at the same location.|$|R
500|$|Soring {{began in}} the 1950s with gaited horse {{trainers}} who were looking to improve their chances of winning at horse shows. To do this, they developed methods to enhance the desired high action gaits to levels greater than that produced by traditional training methods. Thus began the use of irritants, including chemicals and physical objects, or abusive shoeing and hoof-trimming practices on the front legs. Attempting to relieve the pain in its legs, a sored horse lifts its front {{feet off the ground}} more quickly, creating a flashier gait. By the 1960s, soring had gained popularity, as horses so treated gained an edge in competition. However, public opposition to the practice also grew, and in 1966, the American Horse Protection Association was created in part {{to address the issue of}} soring. In 1969, Senator Joseph Tydings sponsored legislation to prohibit soring, leading to the passing of the Horse Protection Act in 1970, amended in 1976. While Tennessee Walking <b>Horses,</b> <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> and other [...] "high-stepping breeds" [...] are generally targeted by these abusive practices, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|R

5|$|The TWHNC {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of classes in both in-hand and performance, including divisions for youth, amateurs, and professionals. Horses may be shod with keg shoes or performance stacks; flat-shod classes are particularly popular among amateur owners who train their own horses. Leadline classes, for children under six, are a crowd favorite. All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted Saddle <b>Horse</b> and <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> associations as well. Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{temperament}} of the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> {{is described}} as [...] "gentle, intelligent and affectionate". They are typically calm and laid back, but as with any breed of horse, temperament of individuals may vary.|$|R
50|$|The {{two largest}} shows for the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> are the Spring Celebration, held {{annually}} in April, and the World Celebration, held in late September. Both are {{held at the}} Celebration Arena in Priceville, Alabama.|$|R
50|$|The Single-Footing Horse is {{descended from}} crosses of American Saddlebreds, Standardbreds and other gaited breeds, with some {{influence}} from Spanish bloodlines. An influential stallion was EZD Falcon Rowdy, who also influenced the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> breed.|$|R

500|$|Two {{organizations}} have formed {{to promote the}} exhibition of flat-shod horses. The NWHA promotes only naturally-gaited horses in its sanctioned horse shows, has its own rule book, and is the official USEF affiliate organization for the breed. The NWHA sanctions horse shows and licenses judges, and is an authorized HIO. The NWHA {{was in the process}} of building its own [...] "tracking registry" [...] to document both pedigree and performance achievements of horses recorded there. These included the Spotted Saddle <b>Horse</b> and <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> breeds as well as the Tennessee Walker. However, the NWHA was sued by the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders & Exhibitors Association (TWHBEA), which eventually won some concessions regarding the use of the TWHBEA’s copyrighted registry certificates by the NWHA. While the judgment did not prohibit the NWHA from continuing its registry service, it is no longer actively advertised on the NWHA website.|$|R
5|$|Nipper's husband {{initially}} rode horses as an amateur, but {{he later}} became a professional trainer, as did his and Nipper's son, Joel. Joel Nipper first specialized in Tennessee Walking Horses, but later switched to <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses,</b> a related breed.|$|R
5000|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include all solid equine coat colors and roan. <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> are also commonly seen in colors created by dilution genes, such as dun, cream and champagne. Some horses may also have body markings. Pinto <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> may be double-registered as Spotted Saddle Horses. [...] The breed {{is known for its}} ambling gait, a four-beat intermediate-speed gait known as the rack or sometimes single-foot, which it performs in addition to the four-beat walk (called the 'show walk' in breed-specific competition) and canter. The latter gait is not performed at breed-specific horse shows. When assessing the rack, judges place greater weight on correct movement and speed, rather than extreme elevation.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the breed}} standard, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> should have slim legs, with good bone and feet {{large enough to}} {{preclude}} lameness. The head should be [...] "intelligent and neat" [...] with a straight profile preferable. The ears should prick alertly and the eyes should be large, clear and bright.|$|R
50|$|Speck, {{owned by}} Robert Skimehorn, {{was a red}} roan {{stallion}} who won 14 world championships in speed racking and was also a very influential sire. Although Speck died in 2000 {{as the result of}} a stroke, his and EZD Falcon Rowdy's bloodlines are still influencing the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> breed today.|$|R
50|$|The Celebration {{was started}} in 1972, {{not long after the}} {{formation}} of the RHBAA. Although most of the organizers were from Birmingham it was decided to hold the show in Priceville, which is in Morgan County, northern Alabama, because the horse center there was the best in the state at the time. The first Celebration lasted one day and included 23 classes and 257 horses. Many of the exhibitors and horses were from the Muscle Shoals area. The competition was patterned after the larger and to some extent, more widely known Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration.The first World Grand Champion <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> was Go Boy's Road Runner in 1972. In 1986, the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> World and Spring Celebrations were named by the Southeast Tourism Society as being among the top 20 attractions in the Southeastern United States.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> may {{be shown}} in saddle seat or western tack and attire, {{as well as in}} driving. Horses are shown in a long, natural mane and tail, but for saddle seat classes, the horse will have ribbons braided in the mane and forelock. It is also {{sometimes}} shown in hand, or in trail obstacle classes.|$|R
50|$|The rack may {{range in}} speed from 8 {{miles an hour}} in {{pleasure}} or style racking, up to as fast as 30 mph in speed racking. It {{is similar to the}} running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse, but with more collection, and without a head nod. Most <b>Racking</b> <b>Horses</b> have two distinct speeds within the rack.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the cream}} gene, which is {{widespread}} throughout many breeds on different continents, the champagne gene is rare and found almost exclusively among American horse breeds. Nearly all American Cream Draft horses are gold champagne. The champagne gene {{is also found}} in the Tennessee Walking Horse, American Saddlebred, Missouri Fox Trotter, <b>Racking</b> <b>horse,</b> Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse, Spanish Mustang, American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, Appaloosa and Miniature horse breeds.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{popularity}} of the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> went down and many distinct bloodlines died out or became closely related, leading to inbreeding. To counteract this, the RHBAA has reopened the registry to horses that meet breed standards for height, conformation, and gait. Some breeds often eligible for this are the Tennessee Walking Horse, Standardbred, Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse and Rocky Mountain Horse. Purebred American Saddlebreds, however, are ineligible for RHBAA registration, although half-Saddlebreds may be registered if they meet the standard.|$|R
5000|$|The TWHNC {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of classes in both in-hand and performance, including divisions for youth, amateurs, and professionals. Horses may be shod with keg shoes or performance stacks; flat-shod classes are particularly popular among amateur owners who train their own horses. Leadline classes, for children under six, are a crowd favorite. All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted Saddle <b>Horse</b> and <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> associations as well. Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.The only exception to this rule are ponies competing in lead line classes. Over 20 World Championships are awarded in different classes throughout the course of the Celebration, including the Lead Line Ponies World Championship, Park Performance, Four-Year-Old, Three-Year-Old, Two-Year-Old, Weanling, Trail Pleasure, Show Pleasure, and Lite Shod. The most anticipated class, however, is the World Grand Championship, the largest honor in the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. [...] Competition at the Celebration is traditionally opened each night by a white or gray Tennessee Walking Horse and rider carrying the American flag, during the singing of the American national anthem. The same flag horse often serves for years and is not allowed to compete in the Celebration itself or any other horse show during their tenure. [...] Over the course of the Celebration, over $650,000 in prizes is given out. The Celebration also includes attractions such as a dog show, barbecue cookout, and barn decorating contest.|$|R
5000|$|State Route 67 (Hulaco to US 72 Alt./SR 20 (Decatur)) - {{enters the}} area at Hulaco and {{continues}} to Somerville. Passes by the old Morgan County Courthouse. Travels through Priceville (past the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> World Celebration Arena), and enters Decatur at an interchange with I-65. As SR 67 crosses 6th Avenue (US 31) it becomes known as the Beltline, a bypass that was constructed to alleviate traffic problems on the swollen 6th Avenue. The highway continues on a north-northwesterly curve and terminates at US 72 Alt./SR 20 inside Decatur.|$|R
5000|$|The American Saddlebred and Tennessee Walking Horse {{are shown}} with an artificially {{positioned}} tail in the [...] "high action" [...] classes, such as three-gaited and five-gaited under saddle classes, and Fine harness competition. Set tails {{are not allowed}} in Saddlebred or Tennessee Walking horse pleasure classes or in most flat shod classes, though a horse which has previously been shown with a set tail may be allowed in some classes if its tail has been taken down and {{allowed to return to}} its natural position. [...] Other saddle seat breeds, such as the Arabian, <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> and Morgan, prohibit tail-setting altogether.|$|R
25|$|The rack or racking is a gait that is {{also known}} as the singlefoot or single-foot. It is an even, lateral four-beat gait. Although many breeds of horses are capable of {{producing}} this gait, it is most commonly associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In the rack, the speed of an even lateral slow gait is increased, while keeping the even intervals between each beat. In the American Saddlebred show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained, while the slow gait is expected be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also closely associated with the <b>Racking</b> <b>Horse</b> breed.|$|R
