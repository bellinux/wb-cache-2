5000|$|Clay, {{the oldest}} of the three, emerged on the {{national}} political scene first, serving as counsel for Aaron Burr in his treason trial and serving two short stints in the United States Senate before being elected Speaker of the House of Representatives for the Twelfth Congress. Calhoun was a freshman member of this Congress, and his friendship and <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> with Clay helped propel him to prominence as a leader of the War Hawk faction agitating for a war which would eventually be declared as the War of 1812. Webster was elected in 1813 to Congress and immediately became a leading anti-war and anti-administration Federalist. Webster wrangled with the nationalists Clay and Calhoun on post-War issues such as the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States and the Tariff of 1816. After the Fourteenth Congress, Calhoun became Secretary of War and Webster declined reelection to focus on his law practice in Boston, a practice which took him before the U.S. Supreme Court in landmark cases like Dartmouth College v. Woodward, Gibbons v. Ogden, and McCullough v. Maryland, in which he represented the Bank of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Since his {{retirement}} from the Argentine Foreign Service and {{his return to}} Argentina in 2004, Posse became an ardent critic of the policies of Nestor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, former President of Argentina, both in his opinion pieces in the press {{as well as in}} political activities. In 2007 he backed the presidential candidature of Eduardo Duhalde, while in the same year he was a candidate in the senate ticket of Roberto Lavagna for the City of Buenos Aires. Toward the end of 2009, he was named Minister of Education of the City of Buenos Aires by Mauricio Macri (newly elected President of the country), replacing Mariano Narodwski. His posting caused a scandal due to a controversial piece he published on 10 December in La Nación (1). In this article, not only did he judge the Kirchner policies as inefficient in relation to law and order issues, but Posse also accused the Kirchners of <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> to the armed left-wing militants of the 1970s (an ideology he has rejected in many of his texts) and of only telling one side of the story of the last military dictatorship. This text ignited a wave of protests in broad sectors of the left, including union and student organizations, as well as in social media, and in various newspaper outlets such as Página 12, who insisted that part of his diplomatic career had been under the watch of the previous military dictatorship. Given the intensity of these protests, Posse resigned from this post 11 days after his appointment.|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to present itself as an apolitical organization, leading members of the German Football Association (DFB) have {{repeatedly}} argued over the last 100 years that football and politics have to be kept apart. Consequently, {{there has never been}} a critical self-appraisal of the DFB analysing its political history. Instead the DFB's commemorative publications to its centenary are full of anecdotes, glossy pictures, statistical material and details about victories and defeats. This article will provide a critical historical overview of the DFB's early development and will focus upon the organization's political position and ideological orientation in the context of associated social conflicts, from its beginnings in 1900 to the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in the late 1940 s. It will show that the political history of the German Football Association is characterized by a high degree of <b>ideological</b> continuity and <b>closeness</b> to nationalist, militaristic and later national-socialist ideas...|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{research on}} the analysis of roll call votes in the European Parliament since the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage and draws lessons about legislative behavior in the European Parliament. The research shows that voting in the European Parliament occurs along supranational party lines and not along geographical lines. Party cohesion has increased with {{the powers of the}} European Parliament. This increased cohesion is the reflection of European party discipline based on cohesion of national party groups. Moreover, coalition frequency is related mostly to <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> between party groups. (JEL codes: D 72, F 53, P 16) Copyright, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|When are {{minority}} cabinets effective? We {{study the}} extent to which minority cabinets demonstrate legislative reliability, i. e. introduce to parliament the bills they have announced in their legislative agendas. We test hypotheses drawn from two theories of minority government effectiveness: the positional agenda power theory which emphasizes the central location of the minority cabinet in the policy space; and the ideological proximity theory which stresses the importance of the <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> of opposition parties to the government. In an analysis of over 1, 600 bills announced by Danish and Swedish minority cabinets in 19 legislative agendas published between 1998 and 2012, we find more support, overall, for the ideological proximity than for the positional agenda power model...|$|E
40|$|Most {{explanations}} for the increased effect of partisanship on voting for the U. S. House focus on the polarization of parties at the elite levels of politics. It remains unclear, however, just how the two phenomena are connected. In this study, we find that partisans near the extreme of their respective party’s prevailing ideology have largely {{been responsible for the}} change in voting behavior, because it is these voters who have experienced the greatest increase in relative <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> to the party {{at the same time that}} the ideological component of party identification has become a more powerful determinant of electoral choice. There is little support, however, for the idea that partisan realignment by moderately liberal Republicans and moderately conservative Democrats in response to perceptions of growing divergence between the parties has been the mechanism behind elevated party-based voting...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the electoral {{consequences}} of corruption in Spanish local elections (Jiménez, 2007; Fernández-Vázquez and Rivero, 2011; Costas et al [...] , 2011) have found that voters do not necessarily punish corrupt mayors. As has been {{pointed out in the}} comparative literature, the average loss of electoral support by corrupt incumbents is small and does not prevent their reelection most of the times (Jiménez and Caínzos, 2006). What remains unsolved, however, is the remarkable variability in this pattern. This paper explores the micro-level variables that might mediate the effect of corruption scandal on the votes. We focus on three factors: <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> to the incumbent party, political sophistication, and employment status. Our results provide only partial support for our hypothesis, suggesting that the effects of corruption are much more complex than what may seem at first sight. ...|$|E

40|$|Claims {{are often}} made in British {{education}} {{about the extent}} to which policy reforms have been ‘borrowed’ from overseas. Based on interviews with senior civil servants and HMI, this paper addresses the extent to which such claims apply to central government educational policy‐making at school level in England between 1985 and 1995. This was a period which saw the collapse of traditional ‘partnership’ modes of educational reform (central and local government, schools, teachers, educationists), which was replaced by major centrally directed legislation from Kenneth Baker’s 1988 Education Reform Act onwards. It was also a period in which the OECD promoted the use of educational ‘performance indicators’ to facilitate cross‐national comparisons of educational quality. The paper finds that, while overseas developments were frequently cited during this period of radical legislative change, these were largely convenient examples from countries with particular <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> to the English climate, promoted by ‘New Right’ think tanks, to lend legitimacy to what were primarily ‘home grown’ policy solutions. Overall, their effect was marginal. Reforms in England took place both prior to and in parallel with similar reforms elsewhere; hence examples from overseas were more often used to confirm developments in England rather than to initiate them...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the "New Anti-Capitalist Left" (Nová antikapitalistická levice, NAL), a Czech group radically leftist group that had been {{established}} in Prague in the autumn 2009 {{under the leadership of}} Nikola Čech, {{who was a member of}} the organization World Revolution (Revo) at the time. Revo was considered to be a Trotskyist group. The NAL was concentrating to ideological work as well as attending academic seminars, demonstrations or blockades of far-right activists. It was organizing summer camps where there notable leftist intellectuals were giving lectures, and not only at these camps the NAL was able to establish connections to a fairly wide spectrum of leftist individuals and groups, it was especially cooperating with the KSČM (The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia). Since approximately 2013, it the NAL was functioning besides a citizens' association Left Perspective (Levá perspektiva), since 2014 only the LP is active. The thesis describes, at first, generally the activities and personal background of NAL/LP and the attitudes of their members and active supporters (who we consider persons who were contributing to the web portals of the groups). Then it analyzes its relations and <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> to other Leftist subjects, both political parties (Communist Party of Bohemia and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to find out the ideological stance of the Greek ruling party SYRIZA in {{comparison}} to socialism and social democracy. This comparison was used to determine whether the possible radicalness of SYRIZA lies in the party’s rejection of the politics of austerity or are there features in SYRIZA’s ideology which make the party substantially extreme left. The hypothesis formulated {{at the beginning of this}} thesis suggested that compared to socialism and social democracy, SYRIZA’s ideological stance is not radical – if anything, the radicalness of the party is expressed in its opposition to austerity politics. In my view, this hypothesis proved to be correct and thus the <b>ideological</b> <b>closeness</b> of SYRIZA to classical leftist ideologies was confirmed. The essence of SYRIZA’s positions and proposals are found in Table 1 which plainly demonstrates the party’s socialist and social democratic roots. Thus, the central conclusion of this paper is that ideologically, SYRIZA is not a radical party. True, it uses Marxist rhetoric, is anti-elite and severely criticises neoliberalism, but it is not seeking to stage a revolution to abolish the capitalist system. The party’s proposed measures regarding social welfare, equality, reforms in the public sector or sustainable development are not essentially radical. If anything, the radicalness of SYRIZA lies in the party’s opposition to the politics of austerity. One dimension missing from this paper is SYRIZA’s use of populism. The way the party deploys populist rhetoric and to what extent is definitely a possible topic for future research. Another fascinating option would be to compare SYRIZA to the anti-austerity movements and parties in other countries, some of which were mentioned in the discussion part of this paper...|$|E
