5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{official}} student government during the first few decades at Georgia Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial student government and proposed an Honor Code, modeled on that of West Point's, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up a more formal organization, the Student Council (later the Student Government Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> student body.|$|E
5|$|Levesque {{is a fan}} of {{the band}} Motörhead (which has {{performed}} three different entrance themes for Triple H over his career), and was good friends with lead singer Lemmy. To pay homage to both Lemmy and the band, Levesque wore Lemmy-inspired facial hair during a large portion of his career. After Lemmy died on December 28, 2015, Levesque attended his funeral on January 9, 2016, where he spoke about the gift of sound that Lemmy and Motörhead have given to him and the friendship they <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SS. This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E

5|$|Virtually all the Turkish Army {{commander}}s, down {{to company}} commander level, were very experienced, being {{veterans of the}} Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the non-commissioned officer (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company. One advantage that the Turkish Army <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which were not used by the British forces.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an {{increasing}} number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Church of England. This {{led to the formation of}} independent churches and schools by what are known as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance, but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670.|$|E

5|$|Harclay's {{head was}} on display in London for five years before it was taken down. His sister {{petition}}ed the king to return the {{various parts of the}} body for a Christian burial, and in 1328 her request was granted. Further clemencies were not awarded. In the reign of Edward III, Harclay's nephew Henry petitioned to have the charge of treason annulled, but the petition was ignored. As for the peace treaty, the wisdom of Harclay's policy was vindicated after his death. Edward II's inability to win the war against the Scots, combined with his refusal to give up his claim on the Scottish crown, proved untenable in the end. Furthermore, it was Harclay's military skills and well-organised forces that gave what little protection the northern borders <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> previous years. Less than three months after Harclay's execution, Edward agreed on a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|Notre Dame {{nonetheless}} {{opened the}} season with a 31–7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40–0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20–17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Jewish appeals {{brought the}} {{attention}} of Sir Moses Montefiore, {{the president of the}} Board of Deputies of British Jews, whose willingness to travel great distances to help his co-religionists—as he <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Damascus blood libel of 1840, for example—was already well known. From August to December 1858 he headed a special British committee on Mortara that relayed reports from Piedmont to British newspapers and Catholic clergymen, and happily noted the support expressed by British Protestants, particularly the Evangelical Alliance led by Sir Culling Eardley. After unsuccessfully attempting to have the British government lodge an official protest with the Vatican, Montefiore resolved to personally travel to Rome to present a petition to the Pope calling for Edgardo to be returned to his parents. He arrived in Rome on 5 April 1859.|$|E
5|$|Democratisation {{still left}} open one {{important}} {{distinction between the}} former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about social justice and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government {{the same degree of}} powers over the former princely states as it <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, {{at the end of which}} the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the Government of India Act 1935. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed in exactly the same legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state's Constituent Assembly.|$|E

5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Americans {{was that}} it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E

25|$|A disorganised, pro-Iraqi Ba'ath guerilla {{movement}} {{existed before}} {{the establishment of}} the Arab Liberation Front (ALF). The ALF was established in 1969 at a National Congress of the Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath Party to weaken the hold al-Sa'iqa, the pro-Syrian Ba'ath organisation in Palestine, <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ba'athist movement. In contrast to al-Sa'iqa, the ALF never had access to a large recruitment pool; there were few Palestinians in Iraq, and the Palestinians living in Iraq were generally well-educated. Because of this, ALF could not – and would never – have the same degree of influence over the Palestinian movement as al-Sa'iqa did. This caused the ALF to be controlled by the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement: weakening its effectiveness and influence, but saving it from infighting between Palestinianists and Ba'athists (a problem in al-Sa'iqa). However, the ALF's influence weakened periodically during its history due to infighting in the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement. Because of the control the pro-Iraq Ba'ath movement <b>had</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ALF, the ALF always held a pro-Iraqi position in the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLO). The ALF was {{a founding member of the}} Rejectionist Front in 1974, rejecting the PLO's Ten Point Program. Abdel-Wahhab Kayyali (a member of the PLO Executive Committee) froze his seat on the committee in protest, instead of following the example (resignation) of the Rejectionist Front.|$|E

Among the country's cities, only Lisbon was capable of equipping an army.

The Russian admiral vowed to defend himself if the British fleet tried to enter the port, but he refused to land his marines to assist the French on land. Senyavin pointed out that his nation was not at war with Portugal. Meanwhile, his sailors consumed large amounts of Junot's limited stocks of food.|$|E
