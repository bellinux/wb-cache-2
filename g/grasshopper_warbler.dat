5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species {{can be considered as}} heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue and {{its tributaries}} support a {{population}} of European eels (Anguilla anguilla). Reptiles found include the European adder (Vipera berus) and grass snake (Natrix natrix). Multiple bird species include Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris), Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), *Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), gadwall (Anas strepera), <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella naevia), hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus), marsh tit (Poecile palustris), merlin (Falco columbarius), northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), peregrine (Falco peregrinus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), teal (Anas cracca), willow tit (Poecile montanus) and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella).|$|E
50|$|Another {{source of}} {{recreation}} on the South Fork is birdwatching. A {{few of the}} major species in this area include mourning <b>warbler,</b> <b>grasshopper</b> sparrow, eastern bluebird, eastern kingbird, and Canada geese. Along with fly fishing and bird watching, kayaking is another recreational activity to participate in on the river.|$|R
50|$|Cliff ledges provide nesting {{sites for}} seabirds {{including}} fulmar, shag, black-legged kittiwakes and gulls. Peregrine falcon, chough and raven nest on secluded cliff slopes and carns. Areas of scrub on the cliff tops {{and in the}} valleys provide nesting sites for European stonechat, whitethroat and sedge <b>warbler.</b> <b>Grasshopper</b> warblers breed in the scrub associated with the mires at Boswednack, which also provides suitable conditions for wintering water rail, Eurasian woodcock and Eurasian curlew.|$|R
25|$|Among the birdlife {{which can}} be seen at Cors Caron are buzzard, {{peregrine}} falcon, merlin, Eurasian sparrowhawk and hen harrier. There have also been rare sightings of Montagu's harrier. The reserve provides a habitat for the endangered red kite. Once nearly extinct, the bird of prey has made a dramatic resurgence in the area. The wetlands attract a variety of wild fowl such as the teal, curlew, and water rail. Snipe, red grouse, tree pipit, <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> and whinchat can be seen more in the drier areas and the common redstart and willow warbler nest in the willow scrub.|$|E
500|$|... present include adder (Vipera berus), {{grass snake}} (Natrix natrix), slowworm (Angula fragilis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, {{including}} the <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella naevia), nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), raven (Corvus corax) and the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The Quantocks are {{also an important}} site for red deer (Cervus elaphus). Invertebrates of note include the silver-washed fritillary butterfly (Argynnis paphia), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: Thymalus limbatus, Orchesia undulata and Rhinosimus ruficollis.|$|E
500|$|The South Exmoor SSSI is smaller, {{covering}} [...] {{and including}} the River Barle and its tributaries with submerged plants such as alternate water-milfoil (Myriophyllum alterniflorum). There are small areas of semi-natural woodland within the site, including some which are ancient. The most abundant tree species is sessile oak (Quercus petraea), the shrub layer is very sparse and the ground flora includes bracken, bilberry {{and a variety of}} mosses. The heaths have strong breeding populations of birds, including whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) and European stonechat (Saxicola rubicola). Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) are common near stone boundary walls and other stony places. <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella naevia) breed in scrub and tall heath. Trees on the moorland edges provide nesting sites for Lesser redpoll (Acanthis cabaret), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
500|$|The main reedbed on {{the site}} is known as Newlands, an {{extensive}} area forming {{the eastern end of}} the reserve. [...] Together with other areas in the West Marsh, the total area of reedbed is now around 25 hectares (61 acres). A wind-powered water pump is currently installed to lift water from the flood plain to irrigate a further 9 hectare (22 acre) area near the Visitor Centre. This project is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which has targeted the creation of 1,200 hectare (3,000 acres) of reedbed nationwide. The reedbeds support a number of acrocephalid warblers such as the reed warbler, sedge warbler and marsh warbler as well as others such as <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler,</b> {{and it was the first}} recorded breeding site in the region for Cetti's warbler. There is a long-term plan to have an endangered species, the Eurasian bittern, breeding here by 2014 and regular sightings of the species have already occurred, with up to three individual birds being sighted during late 2009. [...] A new hide overlooking Newlands, named after Brandon volunteer Ted Jury who died in 2009, was opened in 2014.|$|E
6000|$|If we {{take any}} one of the various qualities which we have agreed to {{consider}} highest in bird-music, we find that the wood wren compares badly with his fellow-vocalists--that, measured by this standard, he is a very inferior singer. Thus, in variety, he cannot compare with the thrush, garden-warbler, sedge-warbler, and others; in brilliance and purity of sound with the nightingale, blackcap, etc.; in strength and joyousness with the skylark; in mellowness with the blackbird; in sprightliness with the goldfinch and chaffinch; in sweetness with the wood-lark, tree-pipit, reed-warbler, the chats and wagtails, and so on to the end of all the qualities which we regard as important. What, then, is the charm of the wood wren's song? The sound is unlike any other, but that is nothing, since {{the same can be said}} of the wryneck and cuckoo and <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler.</b> To many persons the wood wren's note is a bird-sound and nothing more, and it may even surprise them to hear it called a song. Indeed, some ornithologists have said that it is not a song, but a call or cry, and it has also been described as [...] "harsh." ...|$|E

5000|$|The common <b>grasshopper</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella naevia) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the grass warbler genus Locustella.
