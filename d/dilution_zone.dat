50|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} is now being concentrated on developing automatic laser cladding machines. Many of the process parameters must be manually set, such as laser power, laser focal point, substrate velocity, powder injection rate, etc., and thus require {{the attention of a}} specialized technician to ensure proper results. However, many groups are focusing their attention on developing sensors to measure the process online. Such sensors monitor the clad's geometry (height and width of deposited track), metallurgical properties (such as the rate of solidification, and hence the final microstructure), and temperature information of both the immediate melt pool and its surrounding areas. With such sensors, control strategies are being designed such that constant observation from a technician is no longer required to produce a final product. Further research has been directed to forward processing where system parameters are developed around specific metallurgical properties for user defined applications (such as microstructure, internal stresses, <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> gradients, and clad contact angle).|$|E
40|$|The {{mixing process}} within the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> noticeably affects the {{temperature}} {{field in the}} outlet section of a gas turbine combustor. In fact, dilution jets lower {{the temperature of the}} hot flow exiting the primary zone establishing suitable temperature profile and pattern factor at the combustor outlet. Thus, the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> design has a significant impact on performance and durability of the turbine. In this study, a dual fuel gas turbine combustor is investigated by a commercial finite-volume CFD code. The computational domain extends from the compressor discharge to the gas turbine inlet and it is meshed with a coarse grid since it was originally conceived for thermoacoustic analysis. The model has been already validated throughout measurements acquired during full scale isothermal and reactive tests. On the basis of the results of reactive simulations, several solutions of the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> are designed to improve the uniformity of radial and circumferential temperature at the turbine inlet. The designed configurations feature number, arrangement and diameter of dilution holes which differ from the commercial configuration providing four identical dilution holes equally spaced. Advantages and drawbacks of each <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> layout are supported by results of numerical calculations. The results suggest that the solutions featuring two dilution holes perform better than the actual layout...|$|E

The introduction of swirl into the flow creates much faster mixing, caused by radial pressure gradients and increase in turbulence generation.

Flow fields with swirl, both confined and unconfined are studied. The role of the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> to achieve the turbine inlet radial profile plays an important part, therefore temperature field measurements were made in several idealized <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> configurations...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} Zeldovich kinetic {{scheme was}} used to predict nitric oxide formation in the burned gases. Nonuniformities in fuel-air ratio in the primary zone were accounted for by a distribution of fuel-air ratios. This was followed {{by one or more}} <b>dilution</b> <b>zones</b> in which a Monte Carlo calculation was employed to follow the mixing and dilution processes. Predictions of NOX emissions were compared with various available experimental data, and satisfactory agreement was achieved. In particular, the model is applied to the NASA swirl-can modular combustor. The operating characteristics of this combustor which can be inferred from the modeling predictions are described. Parametric studies are presented which examine the influence of the modeling parameters on the NOX emission level. A series of flow visualization experiments demonstrates the fuel droplet breakup and turbulent recirculation processes. A tracer experiment quantitatively follows the jets from the swirler as they move downstream and entrain surrounding gases. Techniques were developed for calculating both fuel-air ratio and degree of nonuniformity from measurements of CO 2, CO, O 2, and hydrocarbons. A burning experiment made use of these techniques to map out the flow field in terms of local equivalence ratio and mixture nonuniformity...|$|R

For more {{information}} on how to obtain this article please visit the ASME Digital Library, [URL]. The paper focusses attention on alternative approaches for treating the coupling between the flow in the annulus supply ducts and the jets which enter combustor primary and <b>dilution</b> <b>zones</b> through air admission ports. Traditionally CFD predictions of combustor flows have modeled this in a very weakly coupled manner, with the port flow conditions being derived from 1 D empirical correlations and used as boundary conditions for an internal-flow-only combustor CFD prediction. Recent work by the authors and others has introduced the viewpoint that fully coupled external-annulus–internal-combustor predictions is the way forward. Experimental data is gathered in the present work to quantify the strength of the interaction between annulus and core flows, which ultimately determines the jet characteristics at port exit. These data are then used to illustrate the improvement in the prediction of port exit jet characteristics which is obtained by adopting fully coupled calculations compared to the internal-flow-only approach. As a final demonstration of the importance of a fully coupled approach, isothermal calculations are presented for a single sector generic annular combustor. These show that quite different primary zone flow patterns are obtained from the two approaches, leading to considerable differences in the overall mixing pattern at combustor exit...|$|R

At longitude 5. 13 °E (37 km from the Rhone river mouth), the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> is 40 m deep and spreads over 0. 075 ° latitude (8 km). It is due to an eastward current present there throughout the ADCP-detected range (12 – 120 m).

40|$|Jets in {{crossflow}} {{are common}} in many engineering applications including: V/STOL aircraft in transition flight, <b>dilution</b> <b>zones</b> in gas turbine combustors, cooling of turbine blades, gaseous state fuel injection, and numerous manufacturing processes. Despite the extensive research over several decades, basic understanding of the flow physics of even the simplest configuration is still incomplete. One reason {{for the lack of}} understanding is the highly turbulent, three-dimensional nature of the flow field including: complex separation and reattachment, shear, and curvature. ^ This experimental investigation of a confined, rectangular jet-in-crossflow is unique for several reasons. Firstly, the rectangular jet spans almost 80 % of the crossflow duct, rather than issuing into a semi-infinite crossflow. Secondly, the jet is confined in the cross-stream direction because it issues into a relatively narrow duct. Thirdly, the flow rate of the secondary jet is large (up to 50 % of the crossflow flow rate) which also influences the jet-crossflow interaction. This complicated geometry is encountered in a variety of different industrial manufacturing processes used to mix product streams. ^ A systematic variation of the three pertinent parameters, i. e. momentum ratio, injection angle and development length was performed. A full factorial experiment was run using three velocity ratios (Vr = 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5), three downstream distances (x/Dh = 6, 10, 19) and six injection angles (α = 18 °, 24 °, 30 °, 48 °, 60 °, 90 °). A planar Mie scattering technique was used to evaluate the relative mixing effectiveness at various conditions within the parameter space studied. Three regimes for the jet-crossflow interaction and the resulting scalar concentration field were revealed: “wall jet”, “fully lifted jet”, and “reattached jet”. To understand the flow physics in these regimes, velocity field data were obtained using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Integrating the scalar concentration and velocity field data has provided an understanding of the large-scale mixing and the role of coherent structures and their evolution. The investigation revealed that the flow does not necessarily develop symmetrically and also highlighted some of the effects of severe confinement. ...|$|R

40|$|A generic {{combustor}} {{has been}} modelled using Reynolds Averaged Numerical Simulations (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The combustor {{is representative of}} a sector of an aero-engine combustor, including one fuel injector and several dilutions ports. To enable optical measurements the combustor has been equipped with air-cooled quartz windows. Both RANS and LES computations have been performed, and two grids have been applied. One grid represents the combustor only, while the other also includes the burner swirler passages. The difference between applying the boundary conditions at combustor inlet and including the swirlers in the CFD model are studied. The computations are performed with a Rolls-Royce in-house code. The code is block-structured and parallelised using MPI (Message Passing Interface). Both isothermal and combustion computations have been carried out. The combustion process has been modelled with a conserved scalar flamelet model, but also a finite rate chemical model has been applied. Detailed experimental data are available (LDA, PIV, DGV, Raman, CARS) with the primary and <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> of the combustor. The measurements have been performed by DLR Cologne within the EC funded research project MOLECULES. The cold flow field in the primary zone is represented well by both the RANS and LES model, but if the injector is modelled, the combustor inlet profiles are better represented by the LES model. In the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> there are larger differences between LES and RANS. The RANS computations underestimate the jet penetration. The combusting simulations using the conserved scalar model compare not very well with the experimental results close to the injector: the mixture burns too fast.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reproducibility of antibody levels obtained by single radial hemolysis with six internal reference sera were evaluated. The test {{was performed in}} a clinical laboratory for routine assessment of immunity to rubella infection {{over a period of}} 1 year. A linear relationship exists between the antibody titer (expressed in log <b>dilution)</b> and <b>zone</b> diameters. In 43 of 44 test runs the correlation coefficient of the standard curve was over 0. 990. Prediction limits of 95 % around the curve showed that on replication of the test, zone diameters could be found within less than half a doubling-dilution step. The antibody level can thus be determined more accurately by the single radial hemolysis test than in the conventional hemagglutination inhibition test. This is particularly important in assessing immunity when antibody titers are low, since the hemagglutination inhibition test is less reliable then. The use of standard sera calibrated international units would render results of different laboratories comparable and allow standardization at threshold values...|$|R

For constant momentum ratio, the optimum S/H(0) with in-line injections is one half the optimum value for single sided injections.

40|$|Lakes formed {{because of}} coal mining are {{characterized}} by low pH and high concentrations of Fe(II) and sulfate. The anoxic sediment is often separated into an upper acidic zone (pH 3; zone I) with large amounts of reactive iron and a deeper slightly acidic zone (pH 5. 5; zone III) with smaller amounts of iron. In this study, the impact of pH on the Fe(III) -reducing activities {{in both of these}} sediment zones was investigated, and molecular analyses that elucidated the sediment microbial diversity were performed. Fe(II) was formed in zone I and III sediment microcosms at rates that were approximately 710 and 895 nmol cm− 3 day− 1, respectively. A shift to pH 5. 3 conditions increased Fe(II) formation in zone I by a factor of 2. A shift to pH 3 conditions inhibited Fe(II) formation in zone III. Clone libraries revealed {{that the majority of the}} clones from both zones (approximately 44 %) belonged to the Acidobacteria phylum. Since moderately acidophilic Acidobacteria species have the ability to oxidize Fe(II) and since Acidobacterium capsulatum reduced Fe oxides at pHs ranging from 2 to 5, this group appeared to be involved in the cycling of iron. PCR products specific for species related to Acidiphilium revealed that there were higher numbers of phylotypes related to cultured Acidiphilium or Acidisphaera species in zone III than in zone I. From the PCR products obtained for bioleaching-associated bacteria, only one phylotype with a level of similarity to Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans of 99 % was obtained.

40|$|Introduction and Summary Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} and, at the same time, most difficult Problem {{in the design and}} development of gas turbine combustion chambers, is that of achieving a satisfactory and consistent distribution of temperature in the efflux gases discharging into the turbine. In the past, experience has {{played a major role in}} the determination of dilution-zone geometry, and trial and error methods have of necessity been employed in developing the temperature-traverse quality of individual combustor designs to a satisfactory standard. Experimental investigations into dilution-zone performance carried out on actual chambers have led to useful empirical-design data, but very often it has proved difficult or impossible to distinguish the separate influences of all the variables involved. Thus although it is now generally accepted that a satisfactory temperature profile is dependent upon adequate penetration of the dilution jets, coupled with the correct number of jets to form sufficient localized mixing regions, the manner in which the total dilution-hole area is Utilized in terms of number and size of holes is still largely a matter of experience. Unfortunately, more basic studies of jet mixing do not usually yield results that can readily be expressed in the parameters which are most familiar to those concerned with combustion-chamber design. However, some of these investigations can provide a useful guide to the relationships involved. One such investigation resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of data on the mixing of cold jets when injected into hot streams under conditions where the temperature and velocity of the hot and cold streams, the injection-hole diameter, the angle of injection, and the mixing length could be accurately controlled and varied over a wide range. These data are used here, firstly to demonstrate a logical method of <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> design and, secondly, to provide quantitative data on the rate of exchange between temperature traverse quality and the relevant design parameters such as <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> length, dilution hole diameter and pressure loss factor. The effects of chamber inlet velocity and inlet velocity profile are also examined. Finally, it is proposed that the aerodynamic performance and stability of a combustion chamber may, for most practical purposes, be adequately described in terms of a parameter p which is the ratio of the flametube pressure loss to the overall pressure loss.

40|$|A model {{laboratory}} reactor is presented and characterized {{for the study}} of spray-fired combustion in a swirl-stabilized, complex, three-dimensional flow representative of a gas turbine combustor. The reactor features optical access for non-intrusive diagnostics, and clean boundary conditions for modeling. The aerodynamic and thermal fields are characterized using laser anemometry and a thermocouple probe respectively. The droplet size and droplet velocity fields are resolved using phase Doppler interferometry. The performance of the reactor is found to be representative of a practical combustor with a well defined dome region primary zone, a secondary zone between the two rows of wall jets in which reaction persists, and a relatively well-mixed and cool <b>dilution</b> <b>zone.</b> A parametric study of the dome geometry indicates that the structure of the dome region recirculation is relatively insensitive to a change from a step to a 45 ° divergent dome expansion. A parametric study of the dome swirl, primary jet, and dilution jet flows shows that the primary air provides closure to the dome recirculation and enhances the turbulent mixing. The reactor is attractive for studies of turbulent mixing, fuel effects, and spray dynamics in this class of flows. © 1997 Combustion Institute...|$|E
40|$|Droplet {{interaction}} {{with a high}} temperature gaseous crossflow is important because of its wide application in systems involving two phase mixing such as in combustion requiring quick mixing of fuel and air with the reduction of pollutants and for jet mixing in the <b>dilution</b> <b>zone</b> of combustors. Therefore, {{the focus of this}} work is to investigate dispersion of a two-dimensional atomized and evaporating spray jet into a two-dimensional crossflow. An interactive Microsoft Excel program for tracking a single droplet in crossflow that has previously been developed will be modified to include droplet evaporation computation. In addition to the high velocity airflow, the injected droplets are also subjected to combustor temperature and pressure that affect their motion in the flow field. Six ordinary differential equations are then solved by 4 th-order Runge-Kutta method using Microsoft Excel software. Microsoft Visual Basic programming and Microsoft Excel macrocode are used to produce the data and plot graphs describing the droplet's motion in the flow field. This program computes and plots the data sequentially without forcing the user to open other types of plotting programs. A user's manual on how to use the program is included...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{research into the}} cladding of stellite 6 on stainless steel by pulsed Nd:YAG laser has been carried out. The effects of pulse energy, pulse frequency, powder mass flow rate and spot overlap on the clad layer height, <b>dilution</b> and heat-affected <b>zone</b> (HAZ) have been examined. It was found that both the clad height and penetration into the substrate increase with the pulse energy, spot overlap and pulse frequency, but {{the effects of these}} parameters on dilution are complex. The dilution reaches the lowest value (4 %) at the incident energy of 18 and 25 J/ pulse, spot overlap of 89 % and pulse frequency of 40 Hz. The powder mass flow rate of 22 g/min (for energy of 25 J/pulse and spot overlap of 83 %) produces thick clad layer with low dilution but results in the formation of defects. The hardness of the clad layer decreases linearly with increasing dilution. No cracks have been found in single-track clad layers at a spot overlap of 89 %, however, cracks occurred at lower spot overlap. These cracks were eliminated by the multi-track cladding when the track increment is less than 1 / 3 of the width of track, which is believed to be due to the remelting or heat treatment of the previous clad track by the subsequent track. The track bands in multi-track clad show coarser structure, higher element segregation and lower hardness...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of two controlled ethanol-blended fuel releases under monitored natural attenuation (MNA) versus nitrate biostimulation (NB) illustrates {{the potential benefits}} of augmenting the electron acceptor pool with nitrate to accelerate ethanol removal and thus mitigate its inhibitory effects on BTEX biodegradation. Groundwater concentrations of ethanol and BTEX were measured 2 m downgradient of the source zones. In both field experiments, initial source-zone BTEX concentrations represented less than 5 % of the dissolved total organic carbon (TOC) associated with the release, and measurable BTEX degradation occurred only after the ethanol fraction in the multicomponent substrate mixture decreased sharply. However, ethanol removal was faster in the nitrate amended plot (1. 4 years) than under natural attenuation conditions (3. 0 years), which led to faster BTEX degradation. This reflects, in part, that an abundant substrate (ethanol) can dilute the metabolic flux of target pollutants (BTEX) whose biodegradation rate eventually increases with its relative abundance after ethanol is preferentially consumed. The fate and transport of ethanol and benzene were accurately simulated in both releases using RT 3 D with our general substrate interaction module (GSIM) that considers metabolic flux <b>dilution.</b> Since source <b>zone</b> benzene concentrations are relatively low compared to those of ethanol (or its degradation byproduct, acetate), our simulations imply that the initial focus of cleanup efforts (after free-product recovery) should be to stimulate the degradation of ethanol (e. g., by nitrate addition) to decrease its fraction in the mixture and speed up BTEX biodegradation.

40|$|In Russia {{development}} of mineral resources {{is carried out}} on a truly grand scale, and mining industry is in its essence a basic sector, supporting and facilitating the {{development of}} national economy. It predetermines the need of safe and responsible attitude towards riches of our subsoil – mineral resources. With this in mind, {{one of the key}} requirements to extraction technologies is minimization of mining losses and ore dilution. The biggest ore losses in the mining block take place in the process of development of contact areas between the ore body and surrounding rocks, due to differences between development pattern and surface of geological contact. Complexity of the contact between ore and surrounding rocks is traditionally characterized by so called «stochastic contact zone». Technological difficulty of extracting ore from the ore – wallrock contact is determined by volatility of geometric parameters in «stochastic contact zone» in the plane of geological contact. Current paper focuses on the issues of standard-setting for mining losses and ore dilution in the process of near-contact zone development. A method is suggested to estimate standard values of losses and ore <b>dilution</b> in stochastic <b>zones.</b> Authors have developed an algorithm of defining the shape of the contact. In the stochastic zone the contact can have a rectangular, sinusoidal, serrate and straight-line shapes. Research has established a relation between the contact shape and amounts of mining losses and ore dilution, formulas to calculate standard values are presented. Using suggested method, standard values for contact ore losses can be obtained in a quicker and more reliable way...|$|R
