40|$|Cyclopentene {{is known}} to undergo {{equilibrium}} polymerization through a metathesisreaction which its bulk and solution polymerizations have been thoroughly inves-tigated. However, {{we have found that}} under specific experimental conditions, this monomer polymerizes in the gas phase. The gas phase polymerization is defined here as the conversion of pure <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer</b> into polymer in the condensed phase. Pure gaseous cyclopentene is found to polymerize on a glass surface in {{the upper part of the}} ampoule above the liquid phase when the polymerization is initiated with only tungsten hexachloride. Polymerizations are carried out under high vacuum and in the 10 - 60 oC temperature range. In presence of methanol, the colourless formed polymer shrinks slightly, then it can be removed easily from the glass surface and simply dried under vac-uum without any other purification process. From kinetic measurements, an overall acti-vation energy of 63. 47 kJ/mol is obtained for the conversion of one mole of <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer</b> to one unit of condensed polymer. GPC Chromatograms of polymer samples are compared with chromatograms of polystyrene standards obtained in the same condi-tions in chloroform. All polymer chromatograms show a narrow molar mass distribution. Elution peaks of the polymer correspond to peaks obtained for the standards with high molar mass ranging from 2 × 104 to above 2 × 106 g/mol. 1 H NMR Spectra at 200 MHz show no loss of double bonds in the polymer, nor any presence of tertiary proton.

The mandrel is next overcoated with plasma polymer (CH) 2 to 50 {mu}m thick. Upon heating, the PAMS depolymerizes to <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer</b> which diffuses through the thermally stable plasma polymer coating leaving a hollow shell.

40|$|Synthetic rubber is {{a highly}} {{valuable}} commodity polymer. One important synthetic rubber product is styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). It is principally made via the emulsion copolymerization of styrene and butadiene monomers and the product {{is referred to as}} emulsion polymerized SBR or E-SBR. It {{is one of the most}} widely used polymers in the world today. Typical E-SBR applications include pneumatic tires and tubes; heels and soles for footwear; and gaskets. This study focused on demonstrating and validating the use of Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to the in-line monitoring of E-SBR copolymerization. Based on this objective, a series of styrene/ 1, butadiene emulsion copolymerizations of different monomer feed ratios were carried out in a 12 L stainless steel reactor using a typical industrial recipe. A special sample-taking valve was developed to account for the presence of the 1, 3 butadiene (a <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer</b> at atmospheric conditions). Monomer conversion was monitored off-line using gravimetry combined with proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) spectroscopy and in-line using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The in-line ATR-FTIR monitoring was accomplished with a ReactIR(TM) 1000 probe. It was found that a multivariate statistical analysis (Partial Least Squares) was necessary to achieve good results.

40|$|High {{energy density}} {{polymeric}} dielectric films were prepared by plasma polymerization {{of a variety}} of <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomers.</b> This technique gives thin, reproducible, pinhole free, conformable, adherent, and insoluble coatings and overcomes the processing problems found in the preparation of thin films with bulk polymers. Thus, devices are prepared completely in a vacuum environment. The plasma polymerized films prepared all showed dielectric strengths of greater than 1000 kV/cm and in some cases values of greater than 4000 kV/cm were observed. The dielectric loss of all films was generally less than 1 % at frequencies below 10 kHz, but this value increased at higher frequencies. All films were self healing. The dielectric strength was a function of the polymerization technique, whereas the dielectric constant varied with the structure of the starting material. Because of the thin films used (thickness in the submicron range) surface smoothness of the metal electrodes was found to be critical in obtaining high dielectric strengths. High dielectric strength graft copolymers were also prepared. Plasma polymerized ethane was found to be thermally stable up to 150 C in the presence of air and 250 C in the absence of air.

30|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} self-assembly techniques (bottom-up) {{have been used to}} synthesize the QDs, and they may be broadly subdivided into wet-chemical and vapor-phase methods [22]: (a) wet-chemical methods mainly follow the conventional precipitation methods with careful control of parameters for a single solution or mixture of solutions. The precipitation process invariably involves both nucleation and limited growth of nanoparticles. Nucleation may be categorized as homogeneous, heterogeneous, or secondary nucleation [27]. Homogeneous nucleation occurs when solute atoms or molecules combine and reach a critical size without the assistance of a pre-existing solid interface. Wet-chemical methods are generally microemulsion, sol–gel [28 – 30], competitive reaction chemistry, hot-solution decomposition [31 – 33], sonic waves or microwaves [34], and electrochemistry. (b) Vapor-phase methods for producing QDs begin with processes in which layers are grown in an atom-by-atom process. Consequently, self-assembly of QDs occurs on a substrate without any patterning [35 – 38]. Self-assembly of nanostructures in material grown by MBE, sputtering, liquid metal ion sources, or aggregation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomers</b> are generally categorized under vapor-phase methods [22]. MBE has been mainly used to self-assemble QDs from III-V semiconductors and II-VI semiconductors using the large lattice mismatch, e.g., InAs on GaAs has a 7 % mismatch and leads to SK growth [35].|$|R
40|$|Fluoropolymers are niche macromolecules {{that have}} {{variable}} morphologies (ranging from thermoplastics to, thermoplastic elastomers {{and they can}} be semi crystalline or totally amorphous). They exhibit a unique combination of properties such as very high thermal, chemical, ageing and weather resistances, a strong chemical inertness (toward solvents, hydrocarbons, acids, and bases), low surface energies (" repellant " effect to oil and water), low dielectric constants, refractive indices, dissipation factors, flammability, and humidity absorption. Moreover, the presence of the strong chemical C-F bond induces a crucial impact onto the high resistance to oxidation and hydrolytic stability. Hence, these specialty polymers have found many applications in building (paints and coatings resistant to UV and to graffitis), chemical (high performance membranes), petrochemical and automotives industries, aerospace and aeronautic (elastomers used as O rings, shafts and packings or diaphragms devoted to extreme temperatures close to liquid hydrogen or hydrazine tanks in boosters of space shuttles), for optics (core and claddings of optical fibers), textile treatment, of stone (especially coatings of old monuments), microelectronics. In spite of their high price, (mainly linked to unusual process of (co) polymerization, and to the cost of purification of <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomers</b> and to the low volumes of production), these polymers have found new developments in modern technologies.

40|$|High-index {{contrast}} waveguides now go 3 D on a photonic chip. One of {{the main}} limits of planar lightwave circuits is that they are… planar, indeed. Giving optical waveguides a third dimension would offer more flexibility to overcome the density and complexity limits of conventional photonic integrated architectures, with large benefits in optical interconnects applications. Direct laser writing is a well established technique to fabricate free-form 3 D optical waveguides, but until now {{it was supposed to}} be not suitable to realize high-index-contrast single-mode waveguides. Untrue, actually, because H. H. D. Nguyen and coworkers have just got it. They exploited 3 D femtosecond-laser curing of a newly developed photopolymer, followed by diffusion of a lower-index <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer.</b> The diffusion of the guest monomer is the key of their method. It leads to a strong reduction of the refractive index of the uncured host polymer, as large as 0. 013; in contrast, the refractive index of the laser-cured polymer, that is the waveguide core, is almost not affected by the monomer diffusion process. This technique maintains all the main advantages of conventional 3 D laser writing schemes, such as the possibility to write multi layers of waveguides without any stacking or alignment effort, the need for neither wet chemical nor etching process, the use of only one layer of a single material. And waveguide propagation loss (0. 37 dB/cm at 850 nm) is nicely low. Monomer diffusion time, now in the order of several tens of hours, is a bit long, but H. H. D. Nguyen and coworkers are confident that it can be reduced to better meet commercial requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{library of}} polymers/oligomers with three {{different}} architectures was synthesised. Short chain, linear oligomers were produced by performing oxidative cleavage on a poly(butyl methacrylate-co-butadiene) polymer. Although butadiene is a <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer,</b> {{it was found that}} careful control over the reaction conditions led to successful copolymerisation in an unpressurised reactor. Hyperbranched polymers of n-butyl methacrylate and t-butyl acrylate were synthesised by RAFT polymerisation with 4 -vinylbenzyl-pyrrolecarbodithioate (CTA 1) and 4 -vinylbenzyl dithiobenzoate (CTA 2). A variety of analytical techniques, such as elemental analysis and NMR, were used to characterise the polymers and confirm the hyperbranched structure. Some variation in monomer conversion and CTA uptake was seen under different polymerisation conditions. After synthesis and characterisation, {{it was found that the}} polymer end groups could be modified through work up with diamine or 4. 4 ‘-azobiscyanovaleric acid. Linear oligomers of butyl methacrylate were functionalised with amines whilst hyperbranched polymers were given acid functional end groups. FT-IR and elemental analysis were used to monitor the success of the end group reactions. As the polymers could be applied as films, they were assessed as cell culture substrates using Human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and Human renal epithelial cells (HREp). A linear butyl methacrylate-co- 4 -vinyl benzoic acid copolymer was also assessed in comparison to the hyperbranched structures. It was observed that the two cell types had different responses to each of the polymers. Fibroblast cells showed better rates of adhesion and proliferation on acid-functionalised polymers, whilst epithelial cells performed best on the aminefunctionalised moieties. This work provides useful information for the synthesis and preparation of new biomaterials. It has been found that polymer functionality must be considered when compatibility with a specific cell type is desired, and polymers with the potential to be incorporated into future biomaterials are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifty years, polymer {{coatings}} have been extensively used to encapsulate, isolate and protect, the properties of these coatings refined and optimised for their specific tasks. Poly-p-xylylene, a linear high molecular weight polymer is prepared using vapour deposition polymerisation in which a film is formed on a substrate via direct exposure to the <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer</b> p-xylylene. Since deposition occurs completely from the vapour, no liquid stage is required and the polymer coating produced is both of uniform thickness and conformal. The development of a copolymer coating incorporating an organosilane as a permeation barrier encapsulant for power thyristors is described {{and the result of}} testing presented. An analysis of the improvement in adhesion between the silicon oxide surface and coating using both the peel test method and also an ion migration technique is described and the results discussed. Infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis have been used to assess the extent of incorporation of organosilane within the coating. The results indicate that the application of a poly-p-xylylene coating incorporating 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate has the potential to considerably improve the reliability of the semiconductor devices and simplify handling. An attempt to increase the adhesion of a poly-p-xylylene coating to a polytetrafluoro-ethylene substrate using adhesion promoters is also described, the orientation of ultra-thin poly-p-xylylene layers on aligned polytetrafluoro-ethylene assessed via birefringence, electron diffraction and under an atomic force microscope.

30|$|Among {{the methods}} {{breaking}} C–F bonding {{on the surface}} of PTFE membranes, plasma technique has many advantages, because it avoids environmental contamination problems. Plasma assisted cross-linking and functional group attachment can also be surface-specified and leave little damage to mechanical properties of the bulk membranes [5]. It has been reported that N 2, NH 3, H 2 O, C 2 H 2, and H 2 O/Ar plasmas effectively improve the surface hydrophilic properties by cross-linking or functionalization mechanisms [12, 13]. The Ar, O 2 or Ar/O 2 plasmas are used to improve surface adhesion of PTFE mainly by etching-induced surface activation and roughening effects [14]. But, plasma-generated radicals on the polymer surface would react rapidly once exposed to <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomers</b> [15]. Plasma-initiated graft polymerization might take good use of the short-lifetime surface radicals generated during the plasma activation and allow the growth of the graft macromolecular chain. Grafting density and length of the grafted chains can be controlled by tuning plasma parameters (power, pressure, sample disposition and so on) and polymerization conditions (monomer concentration, grafting time and so on). Acrylic acid {{is one of the most}} frequently applied monomers in membrane surface hydrophilic modification [16, 17, 18]. The negatively charged polyacrylic acid (PAA) layer could reduce the adsorption of negatively charged contaminants due to an enhanced electrostatic repulsive force between solutes and the modified membrane surfaces. Also, the carboxyl groups in PAA would, in turn, provide sufficient bonding sites for inorganic oxide nanoparticles [19]. This strategy was successfully applied in coating TiO 2 on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using TiO 2 nanoparticles [20] or sol–gel [21], however, the mechanical stability and recycling application were not presented therein.|$|R

The elastomeric phase helps to improve impact strength, and extend its application at low temperature conditions. Polymerization of high impact polypropylene could be achieved by at least two stage processes. First the homo- or random copolymer matrix is produced in bulk or gas phase polymerization, and later on the elastomeric phase of propylene/ethylene copolymer is formed through polymerization in gas phase. Among several commercial process technologies available, Spheripol process (bulk homo- and gas copolymerization) {{is one of the}} most widely used process to produce high impact polypropylene globally. For target oriented product development, detailed knowledge of catalyst kinetics is necessary in order to establish the required operation conditions for the desired polymer characteristics. Kinetics of bulk polymerization of the propylene matrix polymer are investigated in our group by reaction calorimetry. With reaction calorimetry, the heat of reaction, which is proportional to the reaction rate, can be measured and used for development of kinetic models. The elastomeric ethylene propylene copolymer is produced by gas phase polymerization in semi-batch mode: The <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomers</b> are fed by mass-flow controllers to the reactor that way, that both pressure and gas composition, which is online monitored via a fast response micro-gas chromatography, stay constant.

Es wurde gezeigt, dass in diesen inerten Medien zahlreiche Methoden zur Polymererzeugung unter gleichzeitiger Morphologiekontrolle eingesetzt werden können, die in konventionellen wässrigen, heterophasischen Systemen versagen. rnrnAusgangspunkt war die literaturbekannte Metallocen-katalysierte Synthese von Polyethylen (PE) - und Polypropylen (PP) -Nanopartikeln in perfluorierter Emulsion in Gegenwart hochmolekularer Blockcopolymere als Stabilisierungsagens. Mithilfe kinetischer Untersuchungen hinsichtlich der PE-Synthese wurde im Rahmen dieser Arbeit ein Modell entwickelt, welches den Diffusionsweg eines gasförmigen Monomers über die verschiedenen Phasengrenzen hinweg zum aktiven katalytischen Zentrum in der dispergierten Phase beschreibt. Ferner konnte die Diffusions- und Reaktionsbestimmtheit der Reaktion in Abhängigkeit verschiedener Reaktionsparameter nachgewiesen sowie ein tieferer Einblick über den Ort der Polymerisation in den heterophasischen Systemen erhalten werden. rnrnDie so gewonnenen Erkenntnisse wurden für die erfolgreiche Synthese von Poly(ethylen- 1 -hexen) -Copolymeren in perfluorierter Emulsion genutzt, wobei der Comonomergehalt im resultierenden Polymer über einen breiten Bereich variiert werden konnte. Neben der Homo- und Copolymerisation von Polyolefinen wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit weiter gezeigt, dass die heterogenen Fluide zum Aufbau komplexerer Morphologien wie Kern-Schale-Nanopartikeln genutzt werden können; so gelangte man zu Partikeln mit Kernen aus isotaktischem PP, ummantelt von „weichem“ Poly(n-butylacrylat). rnrnEin weiterer Fokus dieser Arbeit lag auf der Erweiterung der Anwendungsmöglichkeiten der perfluorierten Emulsionen, und so wurde bspw. der Zugang zu Polymerdispersionen aus konjugierten Materialien mit Partikeldurchmessern von 70 - 100 nm mittels Cyclopolymerisation eröffnet. Ferner konnten als bioverträgliche und biologisch abbaubare Materialien Partikel aus epsilon-Caprolacton in koordinativ-anionischer Polymerisation gewonnen werden. Im Zuge dessen wurden Emulgatoren entwickelt, die den Einsatz polarer Monomere in perfluorierter Emulsion erlauben. rnrnSchlussendlich konnten mittels trifunktioneller Polymere mit lipophilen und fluorophilen Gruppen sowie Lewis-basischen Ankergruppen Ag- und Cu-Partikel dergestalt oberflächenmodifiziert werden, dass ein homogenes Einbetten in eine perfluorierte Matrix möglich war, was antibakterielle perfluorierte Werkstoffe - erwiesen an E. coli - lieferte. The present work is {{directed}} to the polymerization in nonaqueous emulsions – comprising a perfluorinated solvent and a hydrocarbon – while using different monomers, catalysts and polymerization techniques in order to generate various polymer particles. It was shown that numerous methods for polymer formation can be applied in these inert media which would fail in well-established aqueous, heterophasic systems. rnrnStarting point was the literature-known metallocene catalyzed synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene nanoparticles in perfluorinated emulsions {{in the presence of}} high molecular weight blockcopoylmers as stabilizing agents. By kinetic studies on the polyethylene synthesis a model could be developed within this work which describes the diffusion of a <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomer</b> molecule through the different interphases to the catalytically active center in the dispersed phase. Further, the influence of different parameters on the control by diffusion or the reaction itself was investigated and a deeper insight about the locus of the reaction in the heterophasic systems was gained. rnrnThese results were exploited for the successful synthesis of poly(ethylene- 1 -hexene) -copolymers in perfluorinated emulsions, whereby the comonomer content in the resulting monomer was varied over a broad range. Besides the homo and copolymerization of polyolefins it was further shown that the fluids can be used for generating more complex morphologies such as core shell structures; by that, particles consisting of isotactic polypropylene were obtained, which were surrounded by a “soft” shell of poly(n-butylacrylat). rnrnA further aspect was to broaden the range of possible applications and, thus, a procedure to obtain particle dispersions comprising conjugated materials with diameters of 70 - 100 nm was developed. Further, biocompatible and biologically degradable particles of epsilon-caprolacton were synthesized in an anionic-coordinative manner. In this context, new emulsifiers were developed which allow the use of polymer monomers in perfluorinated emulsions. rnrnIn addition, Ag- and Cu-particles could be surface-functionalized by trifunctional polymers with lipophilic and fluorophilic groups as well as lewis-basic anchor groups. These particles were incorporated homogeneously in a perfluorinated matrix and the antibacterial behavior of the resulting perfluorinated materials was shown on experiments with E. coli...|$|E

25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment <b>gaseous</b> or liquid <b>monomer,</b> often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|R

Ethene, propene, 1 -hexene, 1 -hexadecene, vinylcyclohexane and phenylnorbornene were homo- or copolymerized with the catalysts. The unbridged benzyl substituted zirconium dichloride catalysts (1 - 4), ansa- bridged acenaphtyl substituted zirconium dichloride catalysts, (5, 6), rac- and meso-ethylene-bis(1 -indenyl) zirconium dichlorides, (rac- and meso- 8), rac-ethylene-bis(1 -indenyl) hafnium dichloride, (12), bis(9 -fluorenyl) hafnium dichloride (14) enantiomerically pure (R) - phenylethyl[(9 -fluorenyl- 1 -indenyl) ]ZrCl 2, (11), 14 and asymmetric dimethylsilyl[(3 -benzylindenyl-(2 -methylbenzen[e]indenyl) ] zirconium dichloride, (13), were prepared in our laboratory. Dimethylsilyl-bis(1 -indenyl) zirconium dichloride, (9), isopropylidene(9 -fluorenyl-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride, (10), and were obtained commercially. The solid-state structures of the catalysts rac- and meso- 1 were determined by X-ray crystallography. Computational methods {{were used for the}} structure optimization of the catalyst rac- and meso- 1 in order to compare the theoretical calculations with the experimental results. Polymerization experiments were conducted in a highly purified autoclave system using low pressures (< 5 bar) of <b>gaseous</b> <b>monomers.</b> The experiments were designed to attain the optimal catalytic activity and a uniform copolymer composition. The prepared homo- and copolymers were characterized by the gel permeation chromatography, GPC, differential scanning calorimetry, DSC, nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, FTIR. Molar mass (Mw, Mn), molar mass distribution (Mw/Mn), tacticity, comonomer content, melting temperature, glass transition temperature, and end group structures and content were determined. A special attention was paid on the correlation of the polymer properties with the catalyst structures and polymerization conditions. An intramolecular phenyl coordination was found in phenyl substituted benzyl zirconocenes 1 - 3 explaining the decreased activity of the catalysts. Novel copolymers poly(propene-co-phenylnorbornene) and poly(propene co-vinylcyclohexane), were synthesized and high molar mass poly(ethene-co- 1 -hexene) and poly(ethene-co- 1 -hexadecene) copolymers with elastic properties were prepared. Activation of a hafnocene catalyst was studied with UV-Vis spectrometry and activation process for the synthesis of ultra high molar mass poly(1 -hexene) was found out. Väitöskirjatyössä tutkittiin polyolefiinimuovien, kuten polyeteenin ja polypropeenin, muokkausta katalyyttisellä polyolefiinisynteesillä. Katalyytit olivat organometallisia metalloseenikatalyyttejä, jotka aktivoitiin alumiinialkyyli tai boraatti kokatalyyteillä. Polymerointikokeissa syntetisoitujen polymeerien ominaisuudet tutkittiin polymeerien tutkimusmenetelmillä, kuten geelipermeaatio kromatografialla (GPC), ydinmagneettisella resonassi spektroskopialla (NMR),differentiaalisella pyyhkäisykalorimetrialla (DSC) ja Fourier-muunnos infrapunaspektroskopialla, (FTIR). Metalloseenikatalyyttien erilaisilla rakenteilla havaittiin olevan selkeitä vaikutuksia syntyneiden polymeerien ketjunpituuteen, komonomeerien pitoisuuteen ja polymeeriketjussa olevien monomeeriyksiköiden avaruudelliseen järjestymiseen. Lisäksi havaittiin eräällä katalyyttiryhmällä, että katalyyttiin kiinnitetty aromaattinen fenyyliryhmä voi hidastaa polymeroitumista kiinnittymällä itse aktiiviseen katalyyttikeskukseen.

The Cp 2 TiCl mediated styrene LRP was also demonstrated from both activated and inactivated halides. The effect of reaction parameters (aldehyde structure, temperature, reagent ratios) was investigated in depth and optimized conditions were elaborated. The living character was supported by the linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, narrow polydispersity and linear first order kinetics. The initiation was demonstrated by the presence of the aldehyde or halide fragment on the polymer chain end. ^ A room temperature initiating system was developed for the (co) polymerization of fluorinated monomers. Kinetic investigations revealed a UV and peroxide prerequisite, and the free radical character of the polymerization. A series of fluorinated (co) polymers were subsequently successfully synthesized and characterized. ^ Gold halides were also investigated as superior catalysts for 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;-caprolactone LROP. Living polymerizations were observed under a very wide range of reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations revealed a strong complexation of the monomer with the catalyst, resulting in fast cationic polymerizations via either the activated chain end or monomer mechanism even under catalytic conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel dual-plasma {{process for}} the {{synthesis}} of organic layer-coated metal nanoparticles is presented. Metal nanoparticles are synthesized by the low-pressure pulsed arc evaporation of a metal cathode surface, followed by the in-flight deposition of a thin organic layer by capacitively-coupled radio-frequency (CCRF) plasma polymerization from a <b>gaseous</b> hydrocarbon <b>monomer.</b> The system is simple to operate and can be designed for high throughput. The combination of the synthesis and surface treatment of metal nanoparticles in the whole system avoids newly produced metal nanoparticles from being contaminated by surrounding environment. A home-made self-oscillatory pulsed power supply has been designed and built for the arc evaporation of metal sources. The stability of the pulsed arc system and the cathode erosion rate are discussed. The inductor present in the discharge loop is shown to have a stabilizing effect on the train of pulsed arcs. It was shown that the erosion rate was strongly dependent on peak arc currents due to the increased emission of macroparticles with peak arc currents, and the yield of metal nanoparticles {{was found to be}} slightly influenced by the peak arc current. The produced coated copper nanoparticles were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was revealed that the coated copper nanoparticles have a metal core of size ranging from a few to 50 nm, and that the thickness of the organic layer ranges from 3 to 10 nm. The smallest copper nanoparticles are crystalline, while the organic coating has a macromolecular structure and shows a hydrophobic behavior. The XPS results showed that the plasma polymer film is chemically adsorbed onto the surface of the copper nanoparticle. The effects of operating conditions such as reactor pressure and inert gas flow rate on the average size of the produced bare copper nanoparticles were studied. It was demonstrated that the metal nanoparticle size tends to decrease with decreasing reactor pressure, while inert gas flow rate has little influence on the mean nanoparticle size. The morphology of the plasma polymer coating was revealed to be strongly dependent on the RF plasma power, reactor pressure, and inert gas flow rate. Two kinds of organic films were produced: a smooth, uniform and dense polymer film and a liquid polymer film. Based on a series of experiments, a "characteristic map" for the in-flight plasma polymerization from the C 2 H 6 monomer generating an organic layer onto the Cu nanoparticles was developed. A simplified free-radical mechanism was proposed for the plasma polymerization from ethane. Other metal sources such as iron and aluminum were used as cathodes in the arc evaporation reactor. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the production of coated nanoparticles similar in morphology to the ones obtained with the copper cathode. Lastly, ethylene glycol vapor were introduced as an alternative monomer into the plasma polymerization region. A non-uniform coating was observed on the metal nanoparticle surface...|$|R
