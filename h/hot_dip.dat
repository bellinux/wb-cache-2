5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanising.|$|E

40|$|Zinc has {{traditionally}} been the metallic material most widely used to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion due to its ability to afford cathodic protection to steel in all types of natural atmospheres. In recent decades, aluminium and zinc/aluminium alloy coatings have been used instead of zinc in certain atmospheric applications. Although these coatings present some advantages over zinc, they {{are not able to}} cathodically protect steel substrates in all types of natural atmospheres. The present paper assesses the cathodic protection afforded by Al (flame spraying), Al/ 13 Si (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> 55 Al/Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn/ 15 Al (flame spraying), Zn/ 5 Al (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (discontinuous <b>hot</b> <b>dipping)</b> and Zn (electroplating). Aluminium and aluminium-rich alloy coatings (55 %Al/Zn) provide cathodic protection to the steel substrate only in atmospheres that are highly contaminated with chloride ions (> 100 mg Cl- m- 2 day- 1) where these coatings become active. © 2004 Elsevier B.

50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, <b>hot</b> <b>dipping,</b> {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is <b>hot</b> <b>dipping.</b> The process of <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|R
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. <b>Hot</b> <b>dip</b> galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

40|$|Steel {{is still}} the main {{construction}} material for automobiles, general equipment and industrial machinery. <b>Hot</b> <b>dipping</b> has been proven to be an excellent method of corrosion protection of steels {{for a wide range}} of applications worldwide. Coatings of Zn-Al alloys on steel sheet have high corrosion resistance due to the corrosion prevention ability from Zn and the passivation of Al Bath composition, immersion velocity/time and substrate composition are the <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> parameters that more influence on the thickness and corrosion resistance of the deposited coating. In order to study their influence small amounts of magnesium were added. Experiments were performed in a <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> simulator using different substrates, bath compositions and <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> parameters. Surface layers were characterised by: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS). Cyclic corrosion tests were performed in order to observe the corrosion resistance for different Zn-Al-Mg coatings. Results show that the microstructure and composition of the substrate strongly affect the desired coating properties. Nevertheless, the influence of the magnesium on coating thickness is relevant, increasing when added in small quantities in a molten bath of Zn- 5 wt %Al. The quality and microstructure of the coating is affected by the amount of Mg in the bath.

40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>dipping</b> is coating {{technique}} {{used in industry}} for galvanizing machine elements and steel profiles for construction or automotive applications. However, an alternative use of this process might be to improve specific properties. For instance, {{in order to improve}} the magnetic properties of electrical steels, it may be desirable to increase the Si and/or Al content. A possible and alternative route to realize this is by the application of an Al-Si-rich coating on the steel substrate using a <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> process, followed by a diffusion annealing treatment in order to distribute the Al/Si more evenly in the steel. The obtained distribution depends on the annealing parameters and can be both beneficial and detrimental for the magnetic properties. In the present work, Fe-Si substrates were <b>hot</b> <b>dipped</b> in different Al-Si baths. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 1100 °C during 20 minutes and concentration profiles were measured with scanning electron microscope – energy dispersive spectroscopy line scans.

The final properties of the material depend on the resulting concentration profiles, therefore a model capable of simulating the Si and Al diffusion is required. The first steps toward such a model are presented. The lack of knowledge of the ternary interdiffusion coefficients for the Al-Si-Fe system is overcome by reducing the coupled system of diffusion equations to a single partial differential equation (PDE), utilizing the diffusion path. Then by using a Levenberg-Marquardt inverse method, the apparent diffusion along this path can be determined. The direct problem was solved by a second-order space discretization, reducing the diffusion equation to a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which consequently can be solved with standard procedures for ODE...|$|R

There was little rotting in fruit harvested between November and Januay, while fruit harvested between February and April exhibited a greater susceptibility, which varied with picking date. <b>Hot</b> water <b>dipping</b> gave beneficial effects on decay control of fruit harvested in February and March but was detrimental for fruit harvested in April.
