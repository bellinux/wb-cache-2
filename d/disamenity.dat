40|$|The author {{develops}} a model predicting {{that in a}} labor market that attaches a wage premium to jobs with a <b>disamenity</b> (a compensating wage differential), the premium’s upper bound will be defined by the average wage change of voluntary job movers whose consumption of the <b>disamenity</b> rises {{as a result of}} their move; its lower bound, by the wage change of those whose consumption of the <b>disamenity</b> falls. These predictions will not hold if, as predicted by a “segmented ” labor market model, the labor market attaches a wage penalty to workplace disamenities. Using longitudinal data on job characteristics and wages in Germany in 1984 – 2001, the author estimates the market returns to four workplace disamenities: heavy workload, job insecurity, poor hours regulation, and a mismatch between skills possessed and skills required. The results broadly support the existence of compensating differentials in the German labor market...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{argues that}} income growth leads to {{increased demand for}} environmental quality and thus reduction in pollution. Using a utility theoretic model, we hypothesize that the income [...] pollution relationship should depend {{on the level of}} <b>disamenity</b> of the pollutant. We proxy for <b>disamenity</b> using the toxicity of releases. For counties in the United States, the functional relationship between income and releases depends on the level of disamenity: the form is more concave for more toxic releases. We find that environmental improvements occur at lower levels of per capita income for more toxic pollutants. (JEL Q 25, Q 28, O 13) Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{concern about}} rising rates of obesity, public health researchers {{have begun to}} examine the availability of parks and other spaces for physical activity, particularly in cities, to assess whether access to parks {{reduces the risk of}} obesity. Much of the research in this field has shown that proximity to parks may support increased physical activity in urban environments; however, as yet, there has been limited consideration of environmental impediments or <b>disamenities</b> that might influence individuals’ perceptions or usage of public recreation opportunities. Prior research suggests that neighborhood <b>disamenities,</b> for instance crime, pedestrian safety, and noxious land uses, might dissuade people from using parks or recreational facilities and vary by neighborhood composition. Motivated by such research, this study estimates the relationship between neighborhood compositional characteristics and measures of park facilities, controlling for variation in neighborhood <b>disamenities,</b> using geographic information systems (GIS) data for New York City parks and employing both kernel density estimation and distance measures. The central finding is that attention to neighborhood <b>disamenities</b> can appreciably alter the relationship between neighborhood composition and spatial access to parks. Policy efforts to enhance the recreational opportunities in urban areas should expand beyond a focus on availability to consider also the hazards and disincentives that may influence park usage...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} uses intermetropolitan {{differences in}} {{quality of life}} to estimate the value that residents place on metropolitan amenities and <b>disamenities</b> in land and labor markets. Using individual-level data from the 1980 and 1990 Census of Popu lation and Housing merged with metropolitan-level economic, social, and environ mental factors, it estimates hedonic wage and rent equations to derive the value of amenities and <b>disamenities</b> for 257 metropolitan areas in the United States. Addi tionally, {{the extent to which}} capitalization of urban amenities and <b>disamenities</b> changes over time is examined. Results show that the valuation of the urban environ ment changes over time. Amenities appear to play a stronger role in the housing market compared to the labor market.

Housing transactions from 1990 formed the sample frame for surveying home buyers on their knowledge of local environmental <b>disamenities,</b> both at the time their homes were purchased, and when the survey was conducted. Of particular interest was home buyers' knowledge of nearby landfill sites. Because of clustering of survey responses, a sample selection model that combines transaction data with 1990 census micro data was used.

30|$|There is a {{positive}} correlation between the number of hours worked and salary. Employers that are more productive require longer hours and offer higher salaries. This prediction is in accordance with the compensating differentials theory of Rosen (1974). Hours and salary correlate positively because the utility of the latter compensates for the <b>disamenity</b> of the former. For a given salary level, men experience a smaller <b>disamenity</b> to working, and more productive firms can profit from requiring longer hours. Thus, more productive firms hire more men than women because men require smaller salary compensation for the long hours than women. Therefore, in equilibrium, men sort into longer-hour, higher-paying jobs, and women sort into shorter-hour, lower-paying jobs.|$|E

However, only one study beside this one addresses the mechanism responsible for these effects. I measure separate effects for different types of foreclosed properties and use the estimates to decompose he effects of foreclosures on nearby home prices into two components. One component is due to the additional available housing supply and the other is due to a <b>disamenity</b> stemming from deferred maintenance or vacancy.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper applies hedonic and {{quasi-experimental}} {{methods to}} measure the <b>disamenity</b> value of communication antennas. We {{take advantage of a}} rich dataset of residential housing sales from central Kentucky that contains an extensive set of structural housing characteristics and precise location information. This allows us to overcome endogeneity issues caused by unobservable characteristics correlated with antenna location. The best estimate of the impact is a property with a visible antenna located 1, 000 feet away sells for 1. 82 % ($ 3, 342) less than a similar property located 4, 500 feet away. The aggregate impact is $ 10. 0 million for properties located within 1000 feet. Key words: local <b>disamenity,</b> communication antennas, housing hedonic, quasi-experimenta...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal level of firm-specific training by {{taking into account}} the positive effect of training on the expected duration of workers' current employment. In the framework of an efficiency wage model, a short expected job tenure represents a <b>disamenity</b> that reduces the penalty from shirking. As this <b>disamenity</b> increases, workers have an incentive to continue providing a positive level of effort only if they are compensated by a higher wage. We endogenize the employment separation rate by introducing firm-specific training. Firm-specific training creates a rent that is lost if the worker is separated from the firm. As a result, the firm will be more reluctant to fire its trained workforce in a recession. This implies that firm-specific training can decrease current wages as it implies a credible commitment to lower future labour turnover...|$|E

It provides empirical evidence of two distinct channels through which centrally regulated pay induces variation in the quality of applicants. First, national wage setting implies that relative wages between the police and other occupations vary spatially. We show that higher outside wages are associated with lower quality applicants, using several spatially-varying measures of outside wages. Second, nationally-set wages cannot adjust to reflect spatial variation in the <b>disamenity</b> of an occupation.

40|$|Abstract. Compared to the {{accumulated}} empirical {{evidence on the}} disproportionate collocation of environmental <b>disamenities</b> with racial and ethnic minorities, there is considerably less clarity with regard to why or how the inequality occurs in communities. This article uses agent-based modeling to test three competing theories that may explain why environmental <b>disamenities</b> are located where they are – cost factors alone, benign intentions to favor majority populations, or malign intentions to target minority populations. The simulation results demonstrate that a purely neoclassical world—one in which firms and residents care only about costs—does not lead to environmental injustice. Nor does a similar world in which disamenity-producing firms seek to locate away from majority residents. Two conditions led to environmental injustice in the simulation: when disamenity-producing firms aim to locate near minority populations, or when residents prefer to live near other residents like themselves...|$|R

40|$|Past {{attempts}} to uncover evidence that economically disadvantaged groups are unjustly exposed to environmental <b>disamenities</b> {{have failed to}} take into account self-selection behavior of individuals or groups of individuals. For instance, when choosing a place to live, households may be trading environmental quality for other housing, neighborhood, and location characteristics they care about. Previous literature on environmental justice has investigated location choice of polluting industries, but fails to account for consumer self-selection in housing markets. This paper thus focuses on location choice of individuals based on observed housing transactions. From the results of a random utility model, a test is proposed that incorporates the no-envy concept of economic equity. The results support a finding for environmental discrimination with respect to African American households, but do not support the hypothesis that poor households in general are unfairly exposed to environmental <b>disamenities.</b> Copyright 2000 Gatton College of Business and Economics, University of Kentucky. ...|$|R

40|$|Landscape {{amenities}} and disamenities {{are important}} factors for households in making residence decision. This study presents a hedonic {{analysis of the}} amenity and <b>disamenity</b> effects arising from the heterogeneous urban landscape in a Chinese city. The sample is composed of 358 apartment characteristics and transaction data collected directly from home owners in the central built-up area of Shenzhen. Four types of urban landscapes were included, namely urban parks, residential gardens, Shenzhen Bay, and urban villages. We applied a three-dimensional model (availability, accessibility, and visibility) to estimate the amenity-disamenity effects of these urban landscape features. The results indicated that residential gardens were the most attractive landscape (an average increase of 17. 2 % of housing price) and urban villages had <b>disamenity</b> effects (a decrease of 3. 72 % for visibility and 2. 5 % for availability). The visibility of landscape was more valued than the accessibility. The lower weight accorded to the availability variable suggested: both benefits and possible negative impacts related to urban parks and Shenzhen Bay could be embodied in home buyers' behaviour; and the unavoidability of urban villages. The findings could provide insights to the location and design of residential areas vis-à-vis amenity-disamenity landscape features in Chinese cities that are rapidly expanding and redeveloping. © 2010 The Author(s).

40|$|UnrestrictedIn 1982, the {{predominantly}} African American residents of Warren County, NC, protested {{for six weeks}} against the siting of a landfill to contain illegally contaminated dirt. Though unsuccessful, those protests sparked the Environmental Justice Movement, a movement dedicated to reducing the exposure of poor and minority populations to environmental hazards. Since then, only one Executive Order has been issued, no federal legislation has passed, and judicial efforts have been mixed. Moreover, local governments have little guidance or financial support to address environmental inequity.; I examined the spatial proximity of environmental hazards and goods to poor and minority people in 18 U. S. cities at the Census-tract level. Using Geographic Information Systems, I mapped the distribution of Toxics Release Inventory facilities and large-quantity generators of hazardous waste. I also mapped the distribution of city parks and community gardens. My general research question was: Are minorities and poor populations over-represented in neighborhoods where environmental <b>disamenities</b> cluster and under-represented in neighborhoods where environmental amenities cluster? Using the GIS results, I investigated the city-level institutional factors that may contribute to improved environmental equity. Guided by the Social Movements Framework, I examined eight propositions to answer: What are the city-level political processes and institutional variables that {{are more likely to}} be associated with better <b>disamenities</b> and amenities distributions?; The GIS results suggested that in a majority of cities, the distributions of <b>disamenities</b> and amenities are not random, and often, the hazards cluster in minority and/or poor areas, while amenities only sometimes do. Regression analyses using the traditional explanatory variables failed to explain adequately the distribution pattern in most cities. As well, the institutional analysis failed to show a consistent combination of political structures or processes that might explain environmental equity, with the exception of the combination of a strong mayor-council government and formal neighborhood organizations. Further analysis identified the path dependency of environmental inequity as a policy problem.

40|$|We {{know that}} {{earnings}} inequality has increased {{sharply in the}} United States since the late 1970 s, {{but there has been}} no evidence on the changing inequality of nonmonetary aspects of work nor on how any such changes are related to changes in earnings. I begin by studying patterns of interindustry differences in occupational injuries during 1979 - 95, breaking the total burden of injuries into its components, risk of injury and injury duration. In those industries where earnings rose relatively, we observed a relative drop in injury rates and in the total burden of injuries. Obversely, during the 1960 s interindustry wage differentials narrowed, a decline that was associated with an increase in the relative risk of injury in high-wage industries. Evidence for large sectors of Dutch industry from 1974 - 92 suggests that injury rates there fell most in sectors where wages grew most rapidly. Examination of another workplace <b>disamenity,</b> working evenings or nights, shows analogous results for the period 1973 - 91 : This <b>disamenity</b> was increasingly borne by low-wage male workers. Changes in earnings inequality thus have understated absolute changes in inequality in the returns to work. All the outcomes are readily explicable as income effects of exogenous shocks to the distribution of full earnings in the presence of skill-neutral changes in the cost of reducing workplace disamenities. Under reasonable assumptions we can infer from the estimates that the demand for the amenities, workplace safety and desirable work times, is highly income-elastic. ...|$|E
