2500|$|As {{described}} in the back-story, following first contact with the Ashiyyur, there was increasing friction between human and Ashiyyur civilizations, evolving from a “cold war” into {{an increasing number of}} small and then larger military clashes in which the Ashiyyur generally prevailed. The fiercely independent [...] governments of the <b>human</b> <b>worlds</b> responded to the Ashiyyurian challenge largely by dithering and self-deception about the threat. A few <b>human</b> <b>worlds,</b> led by Dellaconda, reacted militarily by forming a small military force, based at first mainly on the Dellacondan navy, to wage a guerrilla war known as [...] "the Resistance" [...] against the Ashiyyur.

5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the <b>human</b> <b>world.</b> Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{a second}} Monsters, Inc. film existed since 2005. Following {{disagreements}} between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, Disney—which owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films up to Cars—announced that a sequel to Monsters, Inc. would be made by Circle 7 Animation, which was also working on early drafts of Toy Story 3 & Finding Nemo 2. Titled Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise, the film would have focused on Mike and Sulley visiting the <b>human</b> <b>world</b> to give Boo a birthday present, {{only to find that}} she had moved. After getting trapped in the <b>human</b> <b>world,</b> Mike and Sulley split up after disagreeing on what to do. Screenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write a script for the film, and storyboarded an early draft of it. Disney's change of management in late 2005—in which Eisner was replaced by Bob Iger—led to renewed negotiations with Pixar, and in early 2006 Disney announced it had purchased the studio. The Disney-owned sequel rights were then transferred to Pixar, leading to the cancellation of Muir and Hilgenberg's version of the film and the subsequent closure of Circle 7.|$|E
5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the <b>human</b> <b>world,</b> intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the <b>human</b> <b>world,</b> Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.|$|E

In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human.
