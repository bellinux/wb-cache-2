Four of the six experienced <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> diagnosis and received inadequate fluid replacement. Five of the six experienced <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> transfer.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{consequences}} of physician <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> the diagnosis of breast cancer by comparing stage, treatment, and outcome of patients with and without delay, and to identify patient characteristics that may make diagnosis more difficult. SUMMARY BACKGROUND INFORMATION: <b>Delay</b> <b>in</b> diagnosis of breast cancer {{is the most common}} clinical scenario resulting in malpractice litigation. METHODS: The records of 1014 patients were reviewed and the events preceding the diagnosis were reconstructed. Accurate assessment of the physician <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> diagnosis could be made for 606 patients, 51 (8 %) with physician delay > 3 months. Patients with delay were comparable to patients without <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> terms of age, height, weight, age at menarche, pregnancies, children, proportion in menopause, age at menopause, and family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of patients who had a <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> diagnosis had normal mammograms versus 7 % of patients without <b>delay.</b> Cancers <b>in</b> patients with <b>delay</b> were significantly larger on average than <b>in</b> those without <b>delay,</b> but {{there were no significant differences}} in pathology, differentiation, nodal status, TNM stage, treatment, or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Physician <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> the diagnosis of breast cancer is common, and patients with delay are similar to patients without delay, although they are more likely to have normal mammograms. The consequences of physician <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> terms of stage at diagnosis, treatment, and outcome were not statistically significant...|$|R
