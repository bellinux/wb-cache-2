5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging as she made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E

25|$|The name of {{the central}} character, Mother Courage, is drawn from the picaresque {{writings}} of the 17th-century German writer Grimmelshausen. His central character in the early short novel, The Runagate Courage, also struggles and connives <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Thirty Years' War in Germany and Poland. Otherwise the story is mostly Brecht's, in collaboration with Steffin.|$|E

25|$|Dann was {{prevented}} from leaving the area by car because {{the roads were}} closed for a funeral cortege. She decided to drive her car backwards down the nearby street, but the road dead-ended into a private drive. Abandoning her car, she removed her bloodstained shorts and tied a blue garbage bag around her waist. With her two remaining guns she made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods and came upon {{the house of the}} Andrew family. Dann entered the house and met a mother and her twenty-year-old son, who were in the kitchen. She claimed she was raped and had shot the rapist in the struggle.|$|E
25|$|As Greif {{made her}} way towards Arendal, the torpedo boat {{encountered}} thick fog, forcing Kapitänleutnant von Lyncker to decrease the vessel's speed, delaying the arrival at Arendal. According to the operational plans for the invasion, all the German landing groups were to arrive at their targets simultaneously at 04:15. Greif arrived at Arendal at 08:20. At 01:00, still more than seven hours from their objective, the Germans had received radio reports of fighting {{taking place in the}} Oslofjord. All the lighthouses along the southern Norwegian coast, from Marstein Lighthouse in the west to the Swedish border in the east had been turned off the previous evening, on the orders of Commanding Admiral Henry Diesen of the Royal Norwegian Navy.

500|$|After Chell {{completes the}} final test chamber, GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her [...] "victory candescence", {{maneuvering}} Chell into an apparent incinerator. As GLaDOS assures her that [...] "all Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (6 740 °F or 3 727 °C)", Chell escapes {{with the use}} of the portal gun and makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS becomes panicked and insists that she was only pretending to kill Chell, as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the [...] "party escort submission position", lying face-first on the ground, so that a [...] "party associate" [...] can take her to her reward, but Chell continues anyway. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she became corrupt and had killed everyone else in the center, which is also revealed in a later comic. Chell makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as [...] "the cake is a lie", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem [...] "The Chariot", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's [...] "The Reaper and the Flowers", and Emily Brontë's [...] "No Coward Soul Is Mine", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] is {{a length}} of two minutes and 48 seconds. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "grown-up club sound". The song is set in compound time of 12/8 and has a fast tempo of 118 beats per minute. It is written in the key of B minor and Cyrus' vocals span two octaves, from A3 to D5. Cyrus belts <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> choruses, while some lines in the verses feature processed vocals with the use of auto-tune. It follows the chord progression B5–D–A. Driven by a dark, pounding beat and the heavy use of synths, [...] "Can't Be Tamed"'s instrumentation relies on drum machine.|$|E

[...] He also complimented the performances by Kapoor and Kumar. Patcy N of Rediff.com noted the film's appeal to the general public, finding its subject matter [...] "something different from the standard fare on offer". She also praised the music and choreography. India Today film critic Anupama Chopra lauded Chopra's [...] "impressive" [...] performance, and deemed the film [...] "good timepass".|$|E

[...] Before he can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. [...] Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. [...] In their symposium, the scientists explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. [...] The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. [...] Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of [...] "neutrino systems" [...] but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as [...] "the annihilator".|$|E
500|$|American band Sleigh Bells {{recorded}} {{an acoustic}} {{cover of the}} song during their Maida Vale sessions and released it Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on March 6, 2012. A writer of Billboard magazine commented that their cover was [...] "ethereal". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly described the cover as [...] "really good!... Krauss also has a teen-pop background thanks to her Rubyblue days, so it's actually not that surprising that she can find her away around a Top 40 single so well." [...] However, Maura Johnston of The Village Voice gave a negative review for the cover, saying: [...] "Krauss sighs <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> song, turning her voice into a mew that sounds like {{she was trying to}} sing along with the radio while not being heard by her roommates or anyone else outside of a six-inch radius... Also, some of the guitar chords are a bit off.... it's sorta disappointing." ...|$|E

500|$|Some fans {{attending}} the show were dissatisfied with its short length, with one quoted afterward as saying, [...] "That was so disappointing." [...] Some fans were also {{disappointed by the}} performance quality, with one quoted as saying, [...] "It looked like she lip-synched <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> whole thing." [...] Other fans were more accommodating, pleased to be seeing her in good health and appearance and with one quoted as saying, [...] "Whatever, we love her. She's amazing." [...] One group of female fans wore matching pink tops that said [...] "Bald Ambition" [...] {{on one side and}} [...] "The Comeback 2007" [...] on the other. [...] Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel summed up some of the reaction by writing that fans {{at the tail end of}} the tour [...] "knew that the show would be short. ...

500|$|Alexandra {{undertook}} {{many public}} duties; {{in the words}} of Queen Victoria, [...] "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty." [...] She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called [...] "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met. Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously, but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ordeal, which the British press still portrayed in a positive light, describing the crowds as [...] "enthusiastic". As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College, Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised Friends with Benefits for its [...] "breezy, speedy {{and funny}} comedy" [...] and complimented the {{chemistry}} between the lead actors. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars, and remarked about the film, [...] "What not every rom-com has, however, is good dialogue, well-delivered {{at a fast}} clip." [...] He added, [...] "Kunis fast-talks <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> opening scenes as if she's channeling Juno, and Timberlake easily keeps up. At some fundamental level, I simply enjoyed watching them." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety found the plot to be predictable and benign; however, he complimented the cast, calling Kunis [...] "a natural with comedy", while Timberlake [...] "exudes the kind of star wattage that put Will Smith on top." [...] Likewise, Salon Andrew O'Hehir asserted that despite a disappointing conclusion to the film, it was nonetheless a [...] "rewarding summer diversion." [...] The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw reacted negatively to the film, expressing that there [...] "was no benefit to watching it." [...] Bradshaw gave the film a one-out-of-five-star rating.|$|E
