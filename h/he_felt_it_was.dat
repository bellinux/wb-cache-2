5|$|As {{a popular}} physician, Sonnabend was renowned for {{protecting}} and promoting patients' rights. He did not {{shy away from}} criticising the scientific establishment when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> failing to put patients' interests first. He often disagreed with mainstream opinion on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1962 season, Shaughnessy {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} with a year remaining on his contract. He expressed regret in his departure and admiration for Halas, but said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for a change.|$|E
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, he had no choice.|$|E
5000|$|Crapsey pictured himself [...] "as {{a simple}} parish priest, {{primarily}} concerned with the welfare of his parishioners." [...] However, he was not satisfied with [...] "the dogma of the church" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> duty to speak publicly about this fact.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> nodded. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{useless to}} combat her resolution.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unmanly, {{as well as}} idle, {{to boast}} in the circumstances.|$|R
5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{technically}} superior instrument. Steely Dan has featured the Rhodes in almost all of their albums after 1975, and Fagen has also used the Rhodes in all of his solo albums and continues to play it at every one of his touring performances since 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something women could relate to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{dialogue}} between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the scene to an afterthought, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E

5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests. In the judgment of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one indicates that he was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, or that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not working {{as quickly as he}} needed it to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E
5|$|The scenes set in Cyprus were filmed on {{location}} in Deià, a coastal village in the island of Majorca. Previously working on a film using the same location, producer Chris Fry chose the village because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the closest to the UK the crew can get to mimic the hot, Mediterranean feel of Cyprus. Because filming abroad tend to be costly for a BBC budget, the producers kept costs down {{as much as possible}} by using a limited crew with some local help. Much of the original script was to take place inside a house, but because there were no gaffers responsible for lighting, and that the weather was decent, filming took place primarily outside because of the natural sunlight. The filming crew spent four days at the end of April shooting in Majorca.|$|E
60|$|In {{the very}} act of calling this tone of levity to his aid, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> profligate and worthless, and {{asserted}} her against it.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} that I thought <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> right to do so--that I <b>was</b> {{thoroughly}} convinced <b>it</b> would <b>be,</b> since <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> right.|$|R

5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|Starting on 1 May, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a three-day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy {{ahead of the}} Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them. HRT elected not {{to take part in}} the test, instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in Madrid. Both Lotus's trackside operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as a testing venue as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not safe enough for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Éric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season testing in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E

6000|$|... § 12. Now observe; if in {{his attempt}} to do this the artist does not {{understand}} the sacredness of the truth of Impression, and supposes that, once quitting hold of his first thought, he may by Philosophy compose something prettier than he saw, and mightier than <b>he</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all over with him. Every such attempt at composition will be utterly abortive, and end in something that is neither true nor fanciful; something geographically useless, and intellectually absurd.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} designer for the game, Tetsuya Nomura, had also worked on both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The Tsviets were designed {{with the idea}} of creating a sense of balance for the warriors with which players would already be familiar; primarily Vincent, Cloud Strife and Sephiroth. Nomura initially had doubts when designing Shelke's ordinary clothes {{for the end of the}} game, but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important for her to appear out of uniform so as to indicate she was truly free from Deepground. The character of G was based on the Japanese singer and actor Gackt, who wrote and performed the two theme songs of the game, and voiced G in the Japanese-language version of the game. Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of Crisis Core, liked the mysterious role of G so much, he decided to expand his character in that game. The character of Lucrecia Crescent, who features briefly in an optional quest in the original game, was redesigned so as to give her a similar appearance to her son, Sephiroth, based on portraits from guidebooks and in fan-art. Reeve Tuesti was also redesigned, as he only appears briefly in the original game as himself rather than through Cait Sith.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E
60|$|Hawtrey let the jibe pass. For one thing, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> warranted, {{and just}} then his anxiety was {{too strong for}} anger.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics; Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music called the tracks [...] "very enjoyable", but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "less refined" [...] than subsequent soundtracks. Another reviewer {{from the same}} site, GoldfishX, said the only drawback the disc has is the mastering of the CD which can difficult to hear the guitars on rhythm in some tracks. As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a problem related to composition, he gave a perfect score to the soundtrack.|$|R

25|$|Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, son of Vice President of the United States Joseph Biden, {{announced}} in a January 2010 speech {{that he would}} not seek election to his father's former seat in the United States Senate because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more important to fully pursue Bradley's prosecution.|$|E
25|$|His father Master Curtis Page Sr. – {{a three-time}} kickboxing world {{champion}} – was his instructor. Of his nine siblings, his sister Sefena and brothers Curtis Jr., Jamie, and Kalon are also kickboxing world champions.

25|$|Avery {{asserted}} {{that this was}} the film he wanted to make due to the new information he found out later and due to the funding and distribution he was offered; in addition, with many firefighters, survivors and witnesses going to him about events of that day, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to update the film. David Ray Griffin was a script consultant and radio host Alex Jones was associated with the production of this film as well. This was over two hours long, had a new musical score, and included additional interviews and new information that was not available in the prior versions.|$|E
