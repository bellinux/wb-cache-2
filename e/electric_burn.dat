40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) following {{high voltage}} <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> is very rare, and its pathogenesis remains controversial. Electrical burns represent only 4 % of all burns. Hence, clinical managements {{have taken a}} slow pace in developing. The recent guidelines laid down by the cardiology societies include cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the gold standard marker {{for the assessment of}} myocardial damage assessment. Two patients were admitted to our hospital at the different time {{with the same kind of}} high voltage <b>electric</b> <b>burn.</b> Both patients had complained with chest discomfort during admission, and cardiac parameter assessment was done for both the patients. cTnI was also measured for both patients, and marked increase in the values was seen within 5 h of onset of myocardial damage and got into normal range within 72 h. Myocardial damage following <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> needs to be suspected and assessed as early as possible. Hence, cTnI should be the valuable tool to detect the severity of myocardial damage incurred in the <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> cases...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: P ost <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> defects are {{difficult}} to manage due to deep injury involving all the structures up to bony level. A good vascularized flap is required to resurface the defect for preventing the complication and for reconstruction of involved structures. AIM: Resurfacing the post <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> defect with different flaps according to need of the defect. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All patients of <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> hand and fore arm defect admitted to burn, p lastic and reconstructi ve department of SCB Medical College &hospital, Cuttack between January 2012 to December 2012 {{were included in the}} study. During this period the patients were followed up at weekly interval for first 2 month, then at 1 monthly interv al for next 6 - 8 month. OBSERVATION: Out of 40 cases of post <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> forearm and hand reconstruction, 10 cases underwent groin flap cover, 6 cases underwent abdominal flap cover, 5 cases underwent cross finger flap cover 5 cases underwent free antero lateral thigh flap cover, 4 cases underwent free latissimus dorsi flap cover, 5 cases underwent first dorsal metacarpal artery flap cover, 5 cases reverse radial forearm flap cover. All the defects were resurfaced successfully with flaps. Four had marginal necrosis and six had wound infection. Eventually all flaps settled well without further intervention. Due to involvement of all important tendons & nerves, functional outcome is guarded. DISCUSSION: Hand and forearm are most commonly and most severely aff ected in <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> injury because they are mostly first part of body to come in contact with electric circuit. Even though at initial part the injury appears to be superficial, deepe r structures like bone, tendon and neurovascular bundles are affected requiring flap cover for future reconstruction of these structures to get functional and sensate hand. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of post <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> defect of distal forearm and hand represents great challenge due to depth of injury involving full thickness of skin and other structures like neurovascular bundle and bones and tendons. Choice depends on size of defect, availability of local or regional tissue, patient’s acceptance and cooperatio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Electrical burns are {{associated}} with complications and may aggravate burned patients. Aim: To evaluate the effect of electrical burns in mortality and length of stay in a critical care unit for burn patients. Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records of 182 patients aged 15 to 90 years, admitted to an intensive care unit for burn patients. The length of stay and mortality of 14 patients that suffered <b>electric</b> <b>burns</b> was compared with the features of 168 patients with other type of burns. Results: Patients with electrical burns were younger, had a lower percentage of total body surface burnt and had a lower frequency of inhalatory injuries than their counterparts with other type of burns. Mortality rate among patients with electric or other types of burns was similar (three and 49 patients, respectively). Intensive care unit stay was also similar. A multivariate analysis showed that high voltage <b>electric</b> <b>burns</b> were an independent risk factor for death with an odds ratio of 12 (95 % confidence intervals 1. 8 - 79. 4). Conclusions: High voltage <b>electric</b> <b>burns</b> are an independent risk factor for death among burn patients...|$|R

40|$|We {{report an}} unusual case of <b>electric</b> <b>burns</b> {{suffered}} by a 15 -yr-old boy. The patient’s neck {{had come in}} contact with a high voltage broken electric wire and by reflex he had pulled it away with his right hand. He presented with a tracheo-cutaneous fistula with a right-sided pneumothorax. Emergency airway management included insertion of a tracheostomy tube through the traumatic opening in the neck and insertion of an intercostal tube drain. When the diagnostic endoscopy revealed an externally communicating tracheo-oesophageal fistula, protecting the lower airways from gastrointestinal contamination became a priority. The patient was anaesthetized through the traumatic tracheostomy and a formal low tracheostomy was done below the level of the fistula. The patient then underwent oesophageal reconstruction with a stomach free flap.

40|$|Background The aim of our {{research}} was {{an evaluation of the}} effectiveness of neurofeedback in reducing the symptoms of Post-trauma stress disorder (PTSD), which had developed {{as a result of a}} high-voltage <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> to the head. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event related potentials (ERPs) were utilised in the evaluation. Case study A 21 -year-old patient, experienced 4 [sup]th[/sup] degree burns to his head as a result of a high-voltage <b>electric</b> <b>burn.</b> The patient was repeatedly operated on and despite the severity of the injuries was to recover. However the patient complained of flashbacks, difficulties with sleeping as well as an inability to continue work in his given profession. Specialist tests were to show the presence within him of PTSD. As a result of which the patient was provided with neurofeedback therapy. The effectiveness of this therapy in the reduction (eradication) of the symptoms of PTSD were evaluated through the utilisation of qantitative eeg (Qeeg) and event related potentials (ERPs). Results It was found that in the first examination that ERPs display the most significant deviations from the reference in the two components: (1) the one component is generated within the cingulate cortex. The pattern of its deviation from the norms is similar to that found in a group of OCD patients. In contrast to healthy subjects the component repeats itself twice; (2) the second component is generated in the medial prefrontal cortex. Its pattern (neuromarker) is similar to that found in PTSD patients. There is a delay in the late part of the component, which probably reflects the flashbacks. In the second examination, after neurofeedback training, the ERPs were similar to the norm. The patient returned to work. Conclusions Chronic PTSD developed within the patient as a result of a high-voltage <b>electric</b> <b>burn.</b> The application of a method of therapy (neurofeedback) resulted in the withdrawal of the syndrome symptoms. ERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used to plan neurofeedback and in the assessment of functional brain changes induced by neurotherapeutic programmes. Funds Collection: Private sources...|$|E
30|$|The {{distinct}} injury marks {{formed at}} the place of contact with electric current (entry mark) and joule burns {{can be considered as}} a classical external sign of electrocution. Entry mark alone was seen in nearly half of the autopsied cases while both entry and exit marks were noticed in nearly 10 % cases. The findings were similar to those of Di Maio (DiMaio and DiMaio 2001) and Bailey et al. (Bailey et al. 2001). The production of electrical injury depends on voltage, amount of current flow, the area of the contact, and duration of contact. An electrical burn occurs only if the temperature of the skin is raised enough for a sufficiently long period to produce damage (Spitz 1993). On the other hand, a glancing contact or fall against conductor results in break in the circuit; in cases of high-tension supplies, the victim is usually repelled violently. Nevertheless, there can be enough current to make it difficult for a person to remove his body parts (Erkol 1995). In four cases, no <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> was found. In all these cases, the victims were in contact with water. Unlike dry skin, wet skin offers less resistance to the passage of electric current, thus producing no visible <b>electric</b> <b>burn</b> mark at the site of contact. In such cases, circumstances such as having eyewitnesses and faulty earthing of the electrical appliances or circuits help in forming an opinion regarding electrocution.|$|E

Methods From July 1999 to June 2006, we performed 15 cases of toe tissue transfer for thereconstruction of finger defects caused by electrical burns. We performed preoperative rangeof motion exercise, early excision, and coverage of the digital defect with toe tissue transfer. Results We obtained satisfactory results in both functional and aesthetic aspects in all 15 cases without specific complications. Static two-point discrimination results in the transferredtoe cases ranged from 8 to 11 mm, with an average of 9. 5 mm.
