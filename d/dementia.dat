5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} prescribed to treat behavioral symptoms of <b>dementia.</b> However, like antidepressants, {{they have little}} evidence of effectiveness, although antipsychotics have shown some benefit.

5|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} {{result in}} progressive damage to {{different parts of}} the brain's function, and worsen with age. Common examples include <b>dementia</b> such as Alzheimer's disease, alcoholic <b>dementia</b> or vascular dementia; Parkinson's disease; and other rarer infectious, genetic, or metabolic causes such as Huntington's disease, motor neuron diseases, HIV <b>dementia,</b> syphilis-related <b>dementia</b> and Wilson's disease.

5|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>dementia</b> increases with age and, {{to a lesser}} degree, duration of the disease. <b>Dementia</b> {{is associated with a}} reduced quality of life in people with PD and their caregivers, increased mortality, and a higher probability of needing nursing home care.|$|E
40|$|Background. Patients with {{progressive}} dementing disorders {{associated with}} cortical cholinergic dysfunction gradually develop cholinergic deficits {{many years before}} symptom onset and may begin to smoke cigarettes during midlife {{as a form of}} self-medication. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare self-reported past smoking rates between those with and without cholinergic <b>dementias,</b> to determine if those who developed cholinergic <b>dementias</b> were more likely to smoke during midlife than those who did not. Methods. Retrospective cross-sectional study of past smoking status among patients treated at an outpatient clinic during a three-year period. Results. A total of 440 patients were evaluated during the study period, including 224 with cholinergic <b>dementias</b> and 216 with noncholinergic <b>dementias</b> and controls. Past smoking rates were greater among those with cholinergic <b>dementias</b> compared to those without cholinergic <b>dementias</b> (43. 92 % versus 26. 96 %, P= 0. 012). Additionally, smokers with cholinergic <b>dementias</b> reported significantly greater mean pack-years of smoking (P= 0. 038). Conclusions. Greater midlife smoking rates and greater pack-years of smoking were associated with cholinergic <b>dementias.</b> These results suggest midlife smoking may be an early indicator for those developing brain cholinergic deficits related to progressive dementing disorders and support initiating treatment prior to symptom onset in cholinergic <b>dementias...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS <b>dementia</b> complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal <b>dementia,</b> and Lewy Body <b>dementia</b> may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of <b>dementia.</b> The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile <b>dementia</b> were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile <b>dementia</b> of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dementia,</b> and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but <b>dementia</b> costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (CJD) is still made by exclusion of other <b>dementias.</b> We now evaluated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{as a possible}} additional diagnostic tool. CSF LDH levels of patients with CJD (n = 26) were compared with those in other <b>dementias</b> (n = 28). LDH isoenzymes were determined in a subset (n = 9). Total LDH and isoenzyme LDH- 1 were significantly higher, whereas the fractions of LDH- 2 and LDH- 3 were significantly lower in CJD patients. We conclude {{that in addition to}} established CSF parameters, LDH and its isoenzymes might serve as a further help to discriminate between CJD and other <b>dementias.</b> Copyright (C) 2004 S.
