Additionally, a {{one of three}} subset was studied in detail for purposes of evaluating the causes, risks, and consequences behind trangression events. Occurrences are subdivided by enabling factor and flight <b>phase</b> <b>designations.</b> It is concluded that a larger risk of collision is associated with controller enabled departure transgressions over all other categories. The influence of this type is especially evident during the period following the air traffic controllers' strike of 1981. Causal analysis indicates that, coincidentally, controller enabled departure transgressions also, show the strongest correlations between causal factors. It shows that departure errors occur more often when visibility is reduced, and when multiple takeoff runways or intersection takeoffs are employed. In general, runway transgressions attributable to both pilot and controller errors arise from three problem areas: information transfer, awareness, and spatial judgement. Enhanced awareness by controllers will probably reduce controller enabled incidents...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the derivation {{of a new}} archaeological chronology for the Postclassic period at Yautepec, Morelos. We first apply cluster analysis to ceramic type frequencies for 47 excavated contexts to identify groups of related ceramic collections. This classification is then extended to several hundred additional collections using discriminant-function analysis. The groups are evaluated successfully against stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates, resulting in their <b>designation</b> as chronological <b>phases.</b> Radiocarbon determinations are then used to assign calendar dates to the phases. The new chronology consists of one Middle Postclassic phase (Pochtla), two Late Postclassic phases (Atlan, Molotla), and one Early Colonial phase (Santiago). We also explore issues concerning the extension of this chronology to other Postclassic sites in the Yautepec Valley. The past two decades have seen a tremendous growth of research on Aztec society by archaeologists and ethnohistorians.

40|$|Abstract Background For {{the past}} few years, {{scientific}} controversy has surrounded {{the large number of}} errors in forensic and literature mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. However, recent research has shown that using mtDNA phylogeny and referring to known mtDNA haplotypes can be useful for checking the quality of sequence data. Results We developed a Web-based bioinformatics resource "mtDNAmanager" that offers a convenient interface supporting the management and quality analysis of mtDNA sequence data. The mtDNAmanager performs computations on mtDNA control-region sequences to estimate the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups and retrieves similar sequences from a selected database. By the <b>phased</b> <b>designation</b> of the most-probable haplogroups (both expected and estimated haplogroups), mtDNAmanager enables users to systematically detect errors whilst allowing for confirmation of the presence of clear key diagnostic mutations and accompanying mutations. The query tools of mtDNAmanager also facilitate database screening with two options of "match" and "include the queried nucleotide polymorphism". In addition, mtDNAmanager provides Web interfaces for users to manage and analyse their own data in batch mode. Conclusion The mtDNAmanager will provide systematic routines for mtDNA sequence data management and analysis via easily accessible Web interfaces, and thus should be very useful for population, medical and forensic studies that employ mtDNA analysis. mtDNAmanager can be accessed at [URL]. </p...|$|R
40|$|Milankovitch-scale Quaternary climatic {{oscillations}} within south-east Australia {{are known}} to be characterized by relatively arid glacial and wet interglacial stages. However, terrestrial proxy records of environmental change are scarce, based largely on river terraces, dune sediments and pollen sequences. Here we present a speleothem-based palaeoclimate record from Yarrangobilly caves, south-east Australia. The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite (δ 18 Ocalcite) is taken to represent rainfall amount and used as an aridity index. High-resolution trace element profiles and UV fluorescence support interpretations based on δ 18 Ocalcite, allowing further <b>designation</b> of key <b>phases</b> of speleothem growth into periods of relative aridity and moisture excess. A hiatus of approximately 37 ka duration divides the record into two key phases of growth which can be mapped onto marine isotope stages 5 c–a and 3, respectively. Increasing aridity {{in the latter half of}} MIS 5 led to cessation of speleothem growth for the duration of MIS 4. Growth recommences during MIS 3, associated with greater moisture availability, enhanced vegetation and augmented biogeochemical cycling. This speleothem record provides a unique context of terrestrial environmental change and depicts hydrological conditions which fluctuate markedly over the 70 -ka period covering the time of megafauna extinction and human arrival on the continent...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the term}} Crémant was {{introduced}} for non-Champagne sparkling wines in France, an AOC for more [...] "modern" [...] or internationally styled sparkling wines, {{was created in}} 1990. The origin of that decision occurred a year earlier, in 1989, when the producers of Limoux had {{to decide whether or}} not they wanted to maintain the traditional makings of Blanquette de Limoux based on Mauzac or relax the AOC regulations to allow the introduction of more Chenin blanc and Chardonnay to create internationally recognized flavors. Limoux producers were split on what direction they wanted to go, so the provisional appellation of Crémant de Limoux was introduced to allow the producers to make whichever style of sparkling wine that they preferred and still sell it under an AOC designation. A deadline was set in 1994 for the least used AOC <b>designation</b> to be <b>phased</b> out but the deadline passed without Crémant de Limoux or Blanquette de Limoux making significant progress and both AOC continue to co-exist today. These Crémant de Limoux wines differ primarily from Blanquette de Limoux in their grape composition with Chardonnay and Chenin blanc as the main varieties. Together they are not to exceed 90% of the wines. For Chenin blanc, a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 40% must be used. Mauzac and Pinot noir are accessory grape varieties and may not exceed 20% together with Pinot noir itself not exceeding 10%. Thus, Crémant de Limoux contains 40-70% Chardonnay, 20-40% Chenin blanc, 10-20% Mauzac and 0-10% Pinot noir. AOC regulations dictate that the wine be aged for a least a year on the lees prior to disgorgement. Over 40 villages around the city of Limoux are permitted to make Crémant de Limoux.|$|R
40|$|The {{substance}} MHPOBC is {{the oldest}} and still most important reference antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC). There is still considerable controversy concerning the correct <b>phase</b> <b>designations</b> for this material and, in particular, about {{the presence or absence}} of SmC* in its phase sequence. By means of dielectric spectroscopy and polarizing microscopy, we show that whereas the pure compound lacks the SmC* phase, this phase rapidly replaces the SmC*b subphase through the reduced purity resulting from temperature-induced chemical degradation which is hard to avoid under standard experimental conditions. X-ray investi- gations furthermore show that this change in phase sequence is coupled to a decrease in translational order. This explains the large variations in the reported phase sequence and electro-optic behaviour of MHPOBC, in particular concerning the SmC*b phase which has been said to exhibit ferro-, ferri- as well as antiferroelectric properties. It is likely that the sensitivity of the AFLC phase sequence to sample purity is a general property of AFLC materials. We discuss the importance of optical and chemical purity as well as tilt and spontaneous polarization for the observed phase sequence and propose that one of the key features determining the existence of the different tilted structures is the antagonism between orientational (nematic) and translational (smectic) order. The decreased smectic order (increased layer interdigitation) imposed by chemical impurities promotes the synclinic SmC* phase at the cost of the AFLC phases SmC*a, SmC*b, SmC*c and SmC*a. We also propose that the SmA* phase in FLC and AFLC materials may actually have a somewhat different character and, depending on its microstructure, some of the tilted phases can be expected to appear or not to appear in the phase sequence. AFLC materials exhibiting a direct SmA*–SmC*a transition are found to be typical ‘de Vries smectics’, with very high orientational disorder in the SmA* phase. Finally, we discuss the fact that SmC*b and SmC*c have two superposed helical superstructures and explain the observation that the handedness of the large scale helix may very well change sign, while the handedness on the unit cell level is preserved...|$|R
