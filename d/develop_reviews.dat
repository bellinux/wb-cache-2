40|$|OBJECTIVE: To <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> {{criteria}} {{to assess the}} quality of care for three major chronic diseases: adult asthma, stable angina, and non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Modified panel process based upon the RAND/UCLA (University College of Los Angeles) appropriateness method. Three multiprofessional panels made up of general practitioners, hospital specialists, and practice nurses. RESULTS: The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method of augmenting evidence with expert opinion was used to develop criteria for the care of the three conditions. Of those aspects of care which were rated as necessary by the panels, only 26 % (16 % asthma, 10 % non-insulin dependent diabetes, 40 % angina) were subsequently rated by the panels as being based on strong scientific evidence. CONCLUSION: The results show the importance of a systematic approach to combining evidence with expert opinion to <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> criteria for assessing the quality of three chronic diseases in general practice. The evidence base for the criteria was often incomplete, and explicit methods need to be used to combine evidence with expert opinion where evidence is not available...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: National Health Service (NHS) {{initiatives}} such as Clinical Governance, National Service Frameworks and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{clinical guidelines}} programme create demand for tools to enable performance review by healthcare professionals. Ideally such tools should enable clinical teams to assess {{quality of care}} and highlight areas of good practice or where improvement is needed. They should {{also be able to}} be used to demonstrate progress towards goals and promote quality, while not unnecessarily increasing demand on limited resources or weakening professional control. AIM: To formulate and evaluate a method for developing, from clinical guidelines, evidence-based review criteria that are proritised, useful and relevant to general practices assessing quality of care for the primary care management of coronary heart disease (CHD). DESIGN OF STUDY: A two-stage study comprising, first, a review of available evidence-based guidelines for CHD and, second, the definition and prioritization of associated review criteria from the most highly rated guidelines. SETTING: Primary healthcare teams in England. METHODS: Using structured methods, evidence-based clinical guidelines for CHD were identified and appraised to ensure their suitability as the basis for <b>developing</b> <b>review</b> criteria. Recommendations common to a number of guidelines were priortszid by a panel of general practitioners to <b>develop</b> <b>review</b> criteria suitable for use in primary care. RESULTS: A standardised method has been developed for constructing evidence-based review criteria from clinical guidelines. A limited, prioritized set of <b>review</b> criteria was <b>developed</b> for the primary care management of CHD. This was distributed around the NHS through the Royal College of General Practitioners for use by primary care teams across the United Kingdom. CONCLUSION: <b>Developing</b> useful, evidence-based <b>review</b> criteria is not a straightforward process, partly {{because of a lack of}} consistency and clarity in guidelines currently available. A method was developed which accommodated these limitations and which can be applied to the development and evaluation of review criteria from guidelines for other conditions...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} advice {{published}} for information systems researchers aiming to conduct standalone literature reviews, and this advice has been, at times, confusing, contradictory and contested. In this opinion paper, we harmonize and resolve some crucial elements of this debate. In our view, literature review articles need to adhere to the same high standards of quality and trustworthiness as other empirical studies. We argue that a systematic approach, accompanied by transparent reporting, is essential for positivist as well as interpretivist reviews, regardless of their specific type, scope and methods. In terms of structure, we first recap the main genres of review articles used by information systems scholars, and present a high-level framework of the steps required to <b>develop</b> a literature <b>review</b> article. For each step, we then explain how the twin concepts of systematicity and transparency should be understood and embedded in the process of <b>developing</b> <b>review</b> papers across a wide range of genres, including positivist aggregative reviews as well as interpretive syntheses using iterative, inductive and abductive approaches...|$|R
