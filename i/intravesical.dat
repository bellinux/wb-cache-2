25|$|During storage, bladder {{pressure}} stays low, {{because of}} the bladder's highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (<b>intravesical)</b> pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is {{a manifestation of the}} law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle.|$|E
25|$|Bladder afferent signals ascend {{the spinal}} cord to the periaqueductal gray, where they project both to the pontine {{micturition}} center and to the cerebrum. At {{a certain level of}} afferent activity, the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in <b>intravesical</b> pressure occurs. The pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of Onuf's nucleus, resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter. When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra. The micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder.|$|E

Twenty years later, a series of prospective randomized clinical trials have firmly established the benefit of post-TURBT <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy.

50|$|For {{therapeutic}} usage, thioTEPA {{is given}} in 30 mg doses intravesically weekly for four to six weeks. Many studies have reported a success rate of up to 55 percent.

50|$|<b>Intravesical</b> drug {{administration}} is {{the delivery of}} pharmaceuticals to the urinary bladder through a catheter.

40|$|Objective: The {{therapeutic}} strategy for patients affected by intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) recurring after <b>intravesical</b> therapy is not definitively established. Only {{few studies have}} been published on secondline <b>intravesical</b> therapy. BCG is advocated when <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy fails and is often repeated. On the other hand, some patients that suffer recurrence repeat <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy. A retrospective analysis of 179 intermediaterisk patients submitted to second-line <b>intravesical</b> therapy is reported. Patients and Methods: The clinical files of patients affected by intermediate risk NMI-BC and submitted to second-line adjuvant <b>intravesical</b> therapy were reviewed. Patients not receiving at least six instillations of BCG or <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy after the first diagnosis and again after the transurethral resection (TUR) of the first recurrence were excluded. Only mitomycin c and epirubicin were accepted as chemotherapy. Only patients with intermediaterisk tumors with a recurrence-risk score between 5 and 9 according to the EORTC risk tables and in absence of Tis were selected.

40|$|To date, {{prophylactic}} <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy after radical nephroureterectomy {{is one of}} the few available {{treatments that}} effectively prevent secondary bladder cancer. However, treating all patients with prophylactic <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy is excessive for patients who are at a low risk or insensitive to the treatment. Thus, to guide individualized clinical treatment, in addition to identifying patients who are at risk of bladder cancer recurrence, it is equally necessary to identify the patients who will benefit the most from prophylactic, postoperative <b>intravesical</b> instillation therapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ki- 67 expression levels were measured using immunohistochemical staining samples from 320 patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) from 2004 to 2012. Although no patients received <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy after RNU before 2008, this method began to be used in 2008 to prevent bladder cancer recurrence. To identify the patients who would most benefit from <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy, we assessed biological interactions between <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy and clinicopathological factors or biomarkers. The incidence rates of bladder UTUC recurrence decreased after <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy, and the decrease was greater in patients with low Ki- 67 levels, negative EGFR staining and preoperative positive urine cytology. Biological interactions were observed between <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy, low-level Ki- 67 and EGFR negativity. The multivariate analysis showed that after balancing a variety of factors, <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy is a protective factor for preventing <b>intravesical</b> recurrence in the negative EGFR, low-level Ki- 67 and preoperative positive urine cytology sub-groups but not in their corresponding sub-groups. Additionally, the multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative positive urine cytology and Ki- 67 were not but that EGFR positivity was an independent risk factor for recurrence after <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapy.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{describes}} the histopathological and molecular effects of P-MAPA (Protein aggregate magnesium-ammonium phospholinoleate-palmitoleate anhydride) <b>intravesical</b> immunotherapy combined with systemic doxorubicin or cisplatin {{for treatment of}} non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in an appropriate animal model. Our results showed an undifferentiated tumor, characterizing a tumor invading mucosa or submucosa of the bladder wall (pT 1) and papillary carcinoma in situ (pTa) in the Cancer group. The histopathological changes were similar between the combined treatment with <b>intravesical</b> P-MAPA plus systemic Cisplatin and P-MAPA immunotherapy alone, showing decrease of urothelial neoplastic lesions progression and histopathological recovery in 80 % of the animals. The animals treated systemically with cisplatin or doxorubicin singly, showed 100 % of malignant lesions in the urinary bladder. Furthemore, the combined treatment with P-MAPA and Doxorubicin showed no decrease of urothelial neoplastic lesions progression and histopathological recovery. Furthermore, Akt, PI 3 K, NF-kB and VEGF protein levels were significantly lower in <b>intravesical</b> P-MAPA plus systemic cisplatin and in <b>intravesical</b> P-MAPA alone treatments than other groups. In contrast, PTEN protein levels were significantly higher in <b>intravesical</b> P-MAPA plus systemic cisplatin and in <b>intravesical</b> P-MAPA alone treatments. Thus, it could be concluded that combination of <b>intravesical</b> P-MAPA immunotherapy and systemic cisplatin in the NMIBC animal model was effective, well tolerated and showed no apparent signs of antagonism between the drugs.

40|$|<b>Intravesical</b> {{bacillus}} Calmette-Guérin (BCG) {{therapy is}} highly {{effective in the}} therapy of carcinoma in situ of the bladder, but the mechanism of BCG immunotherapy is not clearly understood. We studied the production of TNF-alpha in spleens and bladders of mice after <b>intravesical</b> BCG or BCG/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) instillation. Significant change of TNF-alpha mRNA expression of spleens and bladders of C 3 H/He mice was observed after <b>intravesical</b> BCG instillation, although <b>intravesical</b> IFN-gamma therapy 3 days after BCG instillation to maintain the activated state of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells did not show a significant change of TNF-alpha mRNA, {{compared with that of}} BCG therapy alone. Maximal production of TNF-alpha mRNA in spleens of mice was seen after the first or second <b>intravesical</b> BCG instillation, and production of TNF-alpha mRNA in bladders was also increased after <b>intravesical</b> BCG instillation. The increment of TNF-alpha production by BCG stimulation in HL- 60, a promyelocytic leukaemic cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro may support the in vivo effect of BCG therapy on the bladder. These data show that local production of TNF-alpha as well as systemic production by <b>intravesical</b> BCG treatment may correlate with one of the mechanisms of BCG immunotherapy of superficial bladder cancer...|$|E
40|$|Characterising the {{integrative}} {{physiology of}} the bladder requires whole organ preparations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to validate an isolated large animal (pig) bladder preparation, through arterial and <b>intravesical</b> drug administration, <b>intravesical</b> pressure recording and filming of surface micromotions. Female pig bladders were obtained from the local abattoir and arterially perfused in vitro. Arterial and <b>intravesical</b> pressures were recorded at varying volumes. Bladder viability was assessed histologically and by monitoring inflow and outflow pH. Arterial drug administration employed boluses introduced into the perfusate. <b>Intravesical</b> administration involved slow instillation and a prolonged dwell-time. Surface micromotions were recorded by filming the separation of surface markers concurrently with <b>intravesical</b> pressure measurement. Adequate perfusion to all bladder layers was achieved for up to eight hours; there was no structural deterioration nor alteration in inflow and effluent perfusate pH. Arterial drug administration (carbachol and potassium chloride) showed consistent dose-dependent responses. Localised movements (micromotions) occurred over the bladder surface, with variable correlation with fluctuations of <b>intravesical</b> pressure. The isolated pig bladder is a valid approach to study integrative bladder physiology. It remains viable when perfused in vitro, responds to different routes of drug administration and provides a model to correlate movements of the bladder wall directly to variation of <b>intravesical</b> pressure...|$|E
40|$|Adjuvant <b>intravesical</b> Calmette-Guerin {{bacillus}} (BCG) is {{an effective}} treatment for superficial bladder cancer. The mechanisms by which BCG mediates antitumor activity are not known. We investigated the initial interaction of BCG with the bladder mucosa to determine whether binding was essential {{for the development of}} antitumor activity. Herein, we show that bladder urothelial disruption induced by acrolein, adriamycin, or electrocautery resulted in BCG binding in areas of urothelial damage. Binding induced by each method was inhibited by anti-fibronectin (FN) antibodies but not by antibodies to the basement membrane component laminin. <b>Intravesical</b> BCG binding also was inhibited by pretreating BCG with soluble FN. Inhibition of <b>intravesical</b> FN-mediated BCG attachment prevented immunization via the <b>intravesical</b> route. Moreover, the expression of both delayed hypersensitivity in the bladder of BCG-immunized mice and antitumor activity was inhibited by blocking FN-mediated <b>intravesical</b> BCG attachment.

40|$|Bladder {{cancer is}} very common and most cases are {{diagnosed}} as nonmuscle invasive disease, which is characterized by its propensity to recur and progress. <b>Intravesical</b> therapy is used to delay recurrence and progression, while cystectomy is reserved for patients who are refractory to transurethral resection and <b>intravesical</b> therapy. There is an increasing interest in methods to enhance the delivery of <b>intravesical</b> chemotherapeutic agents to improve efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that electro-osmosis of mitomycin C (MMC) is more effective in delivering this drug into the urothelium, lamina propria, and superficial muscle layers of the bladder wall than is passive transport.
