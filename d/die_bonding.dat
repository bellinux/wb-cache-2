40|$|This {{extended}} abstract {{describes the}} back metal optimization for PbSn die attach assembly to overcome die attach voiding issues {{that resulted in}} reliability testing failures. During the fab transfer qualification of a GaAs RF power amplifier, we encountered <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> voiding issues using a matching backside metal stack process and assembly method. The problem manifested only when the process was run at the alternate Fab. The process was transferred using a copy smart approach where the thicknesses were matched, but processing tools were different. During the pre-qualification process, die voiding issues were encountered which did not meet manufacturing indices specifications. During pre-qualification reliability failures were also encountered. Experiments were run to optimize the back metal layers to achieve passing <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> criteria specifications and reach manufacturability. In addition, reliability was validated by using a JEDEC standard battery of tests on the optimized process. BACKGROUND Freescale utilizes a metal stack specialized for high power GaAs power amplifiers which are assembled using PbSn based soft solder [1]. The process was transferred to a different Fab. The metal stack shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Table 1 was duplicated at the new Fab, but processing tools were not {{identical to the original}} Fab. This required validation of the new process using assembly process indices and JEDEC standard reliability testing. Special attention was paid to <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> coverage, which plays an important reliability role. <b>Die</b> <b>bond</b> coverage has been, historically, a key factor to maintain reliability and Freescaleâ€™s high quality standards...|$|R
50|$|Various gases may {{be present}} in the package cavity, either as {{impurities}} trapped during manufacturing, outgassing of the materials used, or chemical reactions, as is when the packaging material gets overheated (the products are often ionic and facilitate corrosion with delayed failure). To detect this, helium is often in the inert atmosphere inside the packaging as a tracer gas to detect leaks during testing. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen may form from organic materials, moisture is outgassed by polymers and amine-cured epoxies outgas ammonia. Formation of cracks and intermetallic growth in die attachments may lead to formation of voids and delamination, impairing heat transfer from the chip die to the substrate and heatsink and causing a thermal failure. As some semiconductors like silicon and gallium arsenide are infrared-transparent, infrared microscopy can check the integrity of <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> and under-die structures.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of electronic packages under exceptionally harsh environments presents a significant {{challenge for the}} microelectronics industry, for example, in down-hole, well-logging and turbo-machinery applications. High temperature Au based solders are one potential candidate for die attachment for harsh environments and is already used in limited cases. For Au-Si <b>die</b> <b>bonding,</b> some of the Si is provided by diffusion from the Si die itself. Therefore, the interfacial reaction between the Si and Au-Si thin foil solder preform is {{a key factor in}} the control of the <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> process. Unfortunately, during the <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> process, defects such as voids, delaminations, and impurities are not unusual. These defects are caused by the assembly process, chemical impurities, soldering reactions, and thermal stresses. Understanding these defects is critical for the reliable performance of the devices after bonding. In this paper, optimization of the Au-Si eutectic <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> has been performed and near 100 % bonded area confirmed by scanning acoustic microscopy achieved consistently. Die attach reliability was investigated by thermal shock and thermal cycling treatments, after which the bonded area showed some signs of degradation. Shear strength testing and microstructural analysis were also carried out. Die bond optimisation gave a significant improvement in both bonded area and reliability...|$|E

40|$|Conclusion The {{freezing}} point of eutectic Au-Si solder is observed to increase {{with the amount}} of Ag content dissolved in the solder. This results in a subsequent increase in AT. Furthermore, this dissolution of Ag increases with an in-crease in the <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> temperature, leading to an in-crease in solder hardness. These experimental results in conjunction with Taylor and Yuan's theory demonstrate that <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> to a Ag-plated leadframe using Au-Si eutectic solder at a temperature much higher than the eutect ic temperature induces larger residual thermal stress in the chip and causes lower performance of de-vices during temperature cycling tests...|$|E

40|$|In {{the era of}} {{high power}} electronics, voices asking for high {{performance}} miniaturized electronic devices are full of our minds. One of the keys in responding to these strong needs {{is the use of}} highly electrical conductive <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> materials. Those with a strong ability to conduct heat generated during applications are of special interest as overheating of devices is avoided. Currently, tin-lead solders and electrically conductive adhesives are two commonly used <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> materials in interconnecting components in circuit board. Although solder has a relatively higher conductivity, it has adverse environmental impacts upon disposal, and stringent regulations from European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive require it to be progressively faded out. Developing high performance <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> alternatives is an urge and is of great importance. Conductive adhesives especially silver epoxy has been used for decades as <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> materials since its first application in 1951. It is considered {{as one of the best}} ways to replace the leading role of solder in electronic packaging industry due to its ability to devices miniaturization. Its wide applications are limited by its comparably lower conductivities. Enhancement of silver epoxy by incorporation of conductive nano fillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nano-silver particles has been found promising recently. However, the addition of nano particles leads to drastic increase in the viscosity of the adhesive or decrease in processability. To ensure an effective use of these nano fillers without changing the process abilities during practical applications, understanding of the microrheological properties of the nano filler/silver epoxy adhesives becomes paramount. In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of matrix viscoelasticity on CNTs dispersion using optical microscopy (OM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic rheometry. We discovered that the best dispersion system is a ternary mixture of silver epoxy containing nano Ag@CNTs and acid treated CNTs. This is the first report so far which has not been reported in literature before. Systematic investigations were also carried out on the effect of CNTs concentration and CNTs structure on the rheological properties of silver epoxy composites. The CNT structure effects refer to as-received CNTs, nano Ag@CNTs and acid treated CNTs, respectively. There is a clear correlation between flow-induced CNTs aggregation and steady shear viscosity of the composite. The ternary systems exhibit highest critical concentration for CNTs aggregation. Up to 7 wt% of CNTs can be homogeneously dispersed inside the silver epoxy composite without any notable formation of aggregates. The highest concentration of homogenous dispersion of CNTs in literatures is less than 2 wt %...|$|E

40|$|Today's {{electronic}} packaging {{products have}} to keep shrinking in size and achieving higher packing density. The small-outline diode (SOD) {{is one of the}} smallest and most widely used components in all electronic devices. A series of calculations and analyses were conducted based on finite element simulation to study the thermo-mechanical performance of SOD package. The residual thermal stresses accumulated during production in the cooling processes after <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> and post-mold curing were considered as the indicator of thermo-mechanical performance of the packages.

40|$|Nowadays, {{die attach}} glue {{is widely used}} in {{adhesive}} <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> packages, for its high heat dissipation ability and good resistance against thermal fatigue. However, because of the fillet and the uncontrolled bond line thickness, bubbles or voids can easily occur in the interfaces between wafer and adhesive layer, which will further lead to delamination or package cracking. In the circumstances, people are thinking to use another new die attach material: die attach film (DAF), to replace the die attach glue in some applications, for its advantages of consistent bond line thickness, no bleeding, no voids and so on. Although many integrated device manufactures and semiconductor companies are considering the applications of DAF, {{there are still some}} potential issues over the employment of this new material, package cracking is the most serious one.
