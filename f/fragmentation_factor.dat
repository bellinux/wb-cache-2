Fusion of yeast vacuoles has been well characterized but their fission and the mechanisms determining vacuole size and abundance remain poorly understood. We therefore attempted to systematically characterize factors necessary for vacuole fission. Here, we present results of an in vivo screening for deficiencies in vacuolar fragmentation activity of an ordered collection deletion mutants, representing 4881 non-essential genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screen identified 133 mutants with strong defects in vacuole fragmentation. These comprise numerous known <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factors,</b> such as the Fab 1 p complex, Tor 1 p, Sit 4 p and the V-ATPase, thus validating the approach. The screen identified many novel <b>factors</b> promoting vacuole <b>fragmentation.</b> Among those are 22 open reading frames of unknown function and three conspicuous clusters of proteins with known function. The clusters concern the ESCRT machinery, adaptins, and lipases, which influence the production of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. A common feature of these factors of known function is their capacity to change membrane curvature, suggesting that they might promote vacuole fragmentation via this property...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEuropean eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a {{catadromous}} {{fish species}} that received substantial attention as its population has markedly {{declined in the}} last three decades. The possible causes of this decline include habitat <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factors</b> such as dams and weirs. In some cases, these obstacles are equipped with fish friendly passage devices that may select young eels according to their climbing behaviour. We tested how individual climbing tendency was related to the event of fishway passage experienced in the field and classified fish climbing profiles as climbing ‘leaders', ‘followers', ‘finishers' and ‘no climbers'. Moreover, we analysed the brain transcription level of genes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and compared it to climbing profiles. We found that fish from the upstream segments of an impounded river had a higher climbing propensity. Their behaviour was also more repeatable throughout the whole test than the obstacle-naive fish from the downstream segment. Moreover, we found that boldly climbing ‘leaders' had lower levels of transcription of synapse-related genes than the climbing ‘followers'. These differences could be related to coping styles of fish, where proactive ‘leaders' express a routine and risky behaviour, whereas reactive fish need an environmental assessment before exploratory behaviour. Our study showed that differences in climbing propensity exist in glass eelsseparated by water obstacles. Moreover, eels could adoptclimbing different strategies according to the way they dealwith environmental stress and to the cognitive abilities theypossess...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} {{important}} pathophysiological role in the homeostasis of immune systems. DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factors</b> (DFFs) {{have been shown to}} be essential for DNA fragmentation, and the resultant DNA fragments follow a laddering pattern during apoptosis in vertebrates. In invertebrates, the functions of the DFF orthologs are not well characterized; therefore, we cloned and characterized a bivalve DFFA ortholog from the Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis (designated ChDFFA). The full-length cDNA of ChDFFA is 1186 bp in length and encodes a putative protein of 200 amino acids that contains an N-terminal CAD domain and a DFF-C domain at its C-terminus. Real-time RT-PCR results showed that ChDFFA is ubiquitously expressed in several tissues, and its highest expression is in gill. Following a 3 - to 48 -h challenge by microbial infection, the expression of ChDFFA increased in hemocytes. Using fluorescence microscopy, ChDFFA was localized in nuclei when exogenously expressed in HeLa cells. In addition, overexpression of ChDFFA inhibited the transcriptional activities of p 53 /p 21 -Luc reporter genes in HEK 293 T cells. These results suggest that ChDFFA may be involved in immune response reactions in the Hong Kong oyster C hongkongensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

50|$|Apoptosis is a {{cell death}} process that removes toxic and/or useless cells during {{mammalian}} development. The apoptotic process {{is accompanied by}} shrinkage and fragmentation of the cells and nuclei and degradation of the chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units. DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor</b> (DFF) is a heterodimeric protein of 40-kD (DFFB) and 45-kD (DFFA) subunits. DFFA is the substrate for caspase-3 and triggers DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. DFF becomes activated when DFFA is cleaved by caspase-3. The cleaved fragments of DFFA dissociate from DFFB, the active component of DFF. DFFB {{has been found to}} trigger both DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined.|$|E
40|$|DNA {{fragmentation}} is {{a hallmark}} of apoptosis (programmed cell death). However, the biological function of apoptotic DNA fragmentation remains unclear. Here, we show that DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor</b> {{plays an important role}} for maintaining genomic stability. Inhibition or loss of the DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor</b> (DFF) /caspase-activated DNase (CAD), whose nuclease activity is responsible for digesting genomic DNA during apoptosis, led to significant increases in spontaneous or induced gene mutations, gene amplifications, and chromosomal instability in primary mouse cells and transformed human cell lines. The mechanism underlying genetic instability in DFF/CAD-deficient cells, at least in part, involves a small but significant elevation in the survival of cells exposed to ionizing radiation, suggesting that apoptotic DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor</b> contributes to genomic stability by ensuring the removal of cells that have suffered DNA damage. In support of this hypothesis are the observations of increased cellular transformation of mouse embryonic cells from the DFF/CAD-null mice and significantly enhanced susceptibility to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in these mice. These data, in combination with published reports on the existence of tumor-specific gene mutations/deletions in the DFF/CAD genes in human cancer samples, suggest that apoptotic DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor</b> is required for the maintenance of genetic stability and {{may play a role in}} tumor suppression...|$|E

If the outsourced sector provides a non-traded input, the outsourcing tax can have adverse impact on labor even if it is the most capital-intensive sector of the economy. Thus contrary to expectations, a tax on a capital-intensive sector actually hurts labor.

40|$|Cities promote strong bicycle “networks ” {{to support}} and {{encourage}} bicycle commuting. However, {{the concept of a}} “network ” of bicycle facilities is not very well studied. Previous work has found relationships between the amount of bicycle infrastructure in a city and bicycle ridership. This study shifts the focus from quantity of bicycle infrastructure to measuring the quality of bicycle infrastructure networks using network science concepts and measurement techniques from other transportation modes. It fills a gap in the bicycling literature by developing a standard methodology for measuring bicycle infrastructure network quality. A dataset of bicycle facility network shapefiles was collected for 74 medium- and large-sized cities in the United States. ArcGIS was used to develop routines for systematically measuring and analyzing network connectivity in each of these cities using routines developed for ArcGIS. Factor analysis is employed to test how the network connectivity constructs fit into general network qualities: size, connectivity, directness, and <b>fragmentation.</b> These <b>factors</b> are used in regression models to test their association with bicycle commuting mode share and the gender balance of bicycle commuters. The results suggest that connectivity, and to some extent <b>fragmentation,</b> are important <b>factors</b> associated with both bicycle ridership and the percentage of female bicycle commuters, even when controlling for household size and structure, vehicle ownership, and city size. These findings provide a framework for transportation planners and policymakers to evaluate their local bicycle facility networks and set regional priorities that support and encourage nonmotorized travel behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cide family {{proteins}} including Cidea, Cideb and Cidec/Fsp 27, {{contain an}} N-terminal CIDE-N domain that shares sequence similarity to the N-terminal CAD domain (NCD) of DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factors</b> Dffa/Dff 45 /ICAD and Dffb/Dff 40 /CAD, and a unique C-terminal CIDE-C domain. We have previously shown that Cide proteins are newly emerged regulators {{closely associated with}} the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and liver steatosis. They modulate many metabolic processes such as lipolysis, thermogenesis and TAG storage in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis in the liver. Results To understand the evolutionary process of Cide proteins and provide insight into the role of Cide proteins as potential metabolic regulators in various species, we searched various databases and performed comparative genomic analysis to study the sequence conservation, genomic structure, and phylogenetic tree of the CIDE-N and CIDE-C domains of Cide proteins. As a result, we identified signature sequences for the N-terminal region of Dffa, Dffb and Cide proteins and CIDE-C domain of Cide proteins, and observed that sequences homologous to CIDE-N domain displays a wide phylogenetic distribution in species ranging from lower organisms such as hydra (Hydra vulgaris) and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) to mammals, whereas the CIDE-C domain exists only in vertebrates. Further analysis of their genomic structures showed that although evolution of the ancestral CIDE-N domain had undergone different intron insertions to various positions in the domain among invertebrates, the genomic structure of Cide family in vertebrates is stable with conserved intron phase. Conclusion Based on our analysis, we speculate that in early vertebrates CIDE-N domain was evolved from the duplication of NCD of Dffa. The CIDE-N domain somehow acquired the CIDE-C domain that was formed around the same time, subsequently generating the Cide protein. Subsequent duplication and evolution have {{led to the formation of}} different Cide family proteins that play unique roles in the control of metabolic pathways in different tissues. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDamaged DNA-binding {{activity}} comprises {{two major}} protein components, DDB 1 and DDB 2, which are {{implicated in the}} repair of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced DNA damage. The possible role of DDB 2 as a determinant of cellular sensitivity to UV was investigated. The abundance of DDB 2 in UV-resistant HeLa cell lines was increased compared with that in the parental UV-sensitive cells. Stable transfection of the resistant cells with DDB 2 antisense cDNA resulted in marked depletion of DDB 2 protein and restored cellular sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis. Whereas the extent of UV-induced activation of apoptosis executioners, including DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor,</b> and caspase- 3 were reduced in the UV-resistant cells compared with those apparent in the sensitive cells, depletion of DDB 2 from the resistant cells restored the normal activation patterns for these proteins. In contrast, overexpressing DDB 2 in DDB 2 -depleted cells with recombinant adenovirus, which carries ddb 2 cDNA, markedly inhibited the extent of UV-induced activation of DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>factor,</b> and caspase- 3. Interestingly, a mutated form of DDB 2, which is defective in interacting with DDB 1 and binding to UV-damaged DNA, also markedly inhibited the activation of apoptosis executioners. These results indicate that DDB 2 is a modulator of UV-induced apoptosis, and that UV resistance can be overcome by inhibition of DDB 2. The findings also suggest that modulation of UV-induced apoptosis by DDB 2 may be independent of DNA repair...|$|E
