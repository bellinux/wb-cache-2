40|$|This study {{explored}} how gender expressions were {{portrayed in}} the narratives of gay men who view themselves as non-masculine. An adapted life story interview was conducted with seven participants {{between the ages of}} 20 and 47 years. Life stories were analysed using content analysis. The study found that non-masculinity was defined in different ways and that social context, including threat, impacted on gender expression. Non-masculinity was strongly associated with male homosexuality. <b>Homophobic</b> <b>verbal</b> and physical <b>abuse</b> was portrayed alongside negative appraisals of non-masculinity. This may be indicative of internalised anti-effeminacy values. Marginalisation in gay communities was also portrayed, including romantic rejection. Intersections of gender-expression and ethnicity or age were important in evaluations of sexual attractiveness. Conversely, masculinity was often eroticised or regarded as aspirational. Positive qualities associated with non-masculinity included expressiveness, humour and flexibility in working with power demonstrations of others. These reinforce the assertion that effeminate and androgynous men bypass facets of gender-role conflict...|$|R

40|$|<b>Verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> in the {{workplace}} represents a costly problem for human resource management, with implications for staff productivity and retention. Nurses are a profession exposed to extremely high levels of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse,</b> particularly from patients, but also from colleagues, making these abusive behaviours, and reactions to them, of vital significance to hospital personnel management professionals. The present study investigated {{the extent to which}} responses to <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> scenarios varied {{as a function of the}} role and gender of the perpetrator, the situation in which the <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> occurred, and the participant’s level of assertiveness, with a view to establishing key contributors for management attention. Participants were 62 female registered nurses. Results showed evidence of variation in cognitive, affective and behavioural attitudes toward the <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> described, particularly as a function of situation. In particular, <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> was reported to be more frequent, considered less acceptable and elicited more affective arousal in non emergency than in emergency situations. These findings were consistent with predictions that were based on attribution theory. Responses to <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> also varied in relation to the nurse’s assertiveness, which is a finding suggesting that assertiveness training is a potential strategy for protecting employees against the effects of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse.</b> This study has important implications for managers in hospitals, and indeed, other organisational settings in that dealing with <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> requires cognisance of the need for the implementation of both organisational and individual levels of intervention, within a framework that acknowledges the complexity of responses to <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> in {{the workplace}}...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To report {{observational}} {{data collected}} {{as part of}} a multi-phased study examining violence in the health sector. The findings presented detail the nature of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> experienced by nurses during their everyday interactions with patient, their families, or companions. Background: Nurses have unacceptably high levels of exposure to violence, which commonly includes <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse.</b> However, relatively {{little is known about the}} nature of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> against nurses. Design: Observational design. Methods: During 2010, 1150 hours of observation resulted in data on 220 patients displaying cues for physical violence and 210 qualitative observational notes. These observational notes constitute the data for this paper and reveal the nature of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> experienced by nurses in their everyday work. Results: A mosaic of abuse was revealed through three major categories: a discourse of gendered <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> that was largely: sexual; insults, ridicule, and unreasonable demands; and hostility, threats, and menacing language. Conclusions: For the nurses observed in this study, everyday nursing practice occurred in a backdrop of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> and hostility, which had a strong theme of gendered and sexualized overtones. We recommend that interventions that target <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> should address the gendered and sexualized nature of the abuse experienced by nurses...|$|R
50|$|<b>Verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> is {{a concept}} that {{indicates}} some form of mistreatment via oral expression. <b>Verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> can impact the productivity in the workplace, both for the employee and employer.

This is when a group of individuals engages in non-physical abusive behavior at work. This could be expressed in aggressive and unprincipled forms of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> towards one person.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study was to describe, {{with the intention of}} understanding, the lived experiences and meanings given to these experiences, of adult women who were verbally abused as children. Existing studies in the area of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> have often examined <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> as part of psychological and/or emotional abuse or in conjunction with physical and sexual abuse. In order to more fully understand the phenomenon of childhood <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> and to add to previous research, this study focused exclusively on <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> using a phenomenological research approach. Three adult women who experienced childhood <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse,</b> but who are coping successfully despite negative childhood experiences, were interviewed in three separate in-depth conversations; these were augmented with observations, fieldnotes and other documents. After multiple readings of the transcripts, stories of the three women were told. Further analysis consisted of a guided existential reflection based on lived time, lived body, lived space and lived relation to aid in the process of questioning, reflecting, writing, and coming to {{a deeper understanding of the}} ways these women have experienced childhood <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse.</b> 	 The findings from this study add to the understanding of childhood <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> and perhaps will have the added benefit of bringing increased awareness of how detrimental this form of abuse can be to an individual’s self-concept. Results suggest that although <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> experienced in childhood can have negative consequences, individuals can cope and survive to become stronger and more resilient.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{describe}} and analyze gender and age patterns of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> among students, {{and how it is}} used in identity construction by girls and boys in social interaction in school. Two sets of data were used: a school-based survey (study I) and an observation and interview-based qualitative study (studies II-IV). The survey encompassed all 6 th and 8 th graders (n= 1 006) in a medium-sized Swedish city, and served to assess the gender and age-based prevalence of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse,</b> and its effects on well-being. The qualitative study was conducted among 8 th grade students at two schools in the Stockholm area (127 hours of observations and 10 interviews). Through discourse analysis, it explored the role of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> in gender and age construction between same-age students in everyday interactions and examined students’ own understanding of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse.</b> The survey showed that <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> is prevalent, more pronounced among 8 th graders, that boys experienced insults and threats to a greater extent, and girls sexual name-calling (e. g. “whore”). Boys most often used <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> against other boys as well as girls, indicating that it was especially significant for masculinity construction. Being exposed {{did not have to be}} frequent, repeated or combined with other kinds of harassment to be negatively related to school satisfaction and well-being. The observations and interviews demonstrated that <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> was a cultural resource to which boys had greater access. Often with sexual content, it contributed to “toughness”, a central component of hegemonic masculinity in the schools. While generating most of the <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse,</b> tough, popular boys were not necessarily regarded as verbally abusive. Responsibility for the bulk of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> was instead attributed to “rowdy” boys. Whereas boys largely benefited from using <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse,</b> such practices mostly reflected unfavorably on girls. <b>Verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> simultaneously ordered masculinities and femininities, structured heterosexual relations, and contributed to age construction, intertwined with that of gender. For boys, using <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> constituted them as appropriately (hetero) sexual teenage males. Discourses of immaturity, development, and school year used in the meaning-making of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> positioned genders differently, and contrasted teenagers with adults. Verbally abusive girls were associated with a negative “fjortis”-femininity, indicating that they displayed the wrong kind of sexuality, femininity and social age. What constituted ‘verbal abuse’ was jointly constructed by students and sometimes also by teachers in interaction. Speaker intent was a main point of students’ understanding, in turn modified by a number of permissive discourses, such as “joking”, friendship or pejoratives having “lost their meaning”. Students came to interpret use of pejoratives and insults especially by tough popular boys as “jokes”, rather than being offensive and hurtful. This suggests that students, using and investing in such discourses, reduced the practice of being verbally abusive to acceptable everyday interactions because it was part of how hegemonic masculinity is constructed in school at this age. It appears that <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> influences power relations between conversational participants to the advantage of the speaker, and can have positive social consequences for those who can learn to use it the “right” way. Power implications of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> go beyond the particular interaction and conversational participants. Orders of status and power repeatedly produced through <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> based on e. g. gender, age, and sexuality, create part of the social context of school in which students live their everyday lives and form their identities...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: From May 2008 to February 2009, we used respondent-driven sampling to recruit MSM $ 18 years old in Kampala who reported anal sex with another man in the previous three months. We collected demographic and HIV-related behavioral data through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviews. Laboratory testing included biomarkers for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. We obtained population estimates adjusted for the non-random sampling frame using RDSAT and STATA. 300 MSM were surveyed over 11 waves; median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 21 – 29 years). Overall HIV prevalence was 13. 7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 7. 9 %– 20. 1 %), and was higher among MSM $ 25 years (22. 4 %) than among MSM aged 18 – 24 years (3. 9 %, odds ratio [OR] 5. 69, 95 % CI 2. 02 – 16. 02). In multivariate analysis, MSM$ 25 years (adjusted OR [aOR] 4. 32, 95 % CI 1. 33 – 13. 98) and those reporting ever having been exposed to <b>homophobic</b> <b>abuse</b> (<b>verbal,</b> moral, sexual, or physical abuse; aOR 5. 38, 95 % CI 1. 95 – 14. 79) were significantly more likely to be HIV infected.

40|$|Objectives: Physical {{or sexual}} abuse in {{childhood}} {{is known to}} have an adverse effect on the course of bipolar disorder, but the impact of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> has not been well elucidated. Methods: We examined the occurrence and frequency (never to frequently) of each type of abuse in childhood in 634 US adult outpatients (average age 40 years). Patients gave informed consent and provided information about their age of onset and course of illness prior to study entry. Results: <b>Verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> alone occurred in 24 % of the patients. Similar to a history of physical or sexual abuse, a history of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> was related to an earlier age of onset of bipolar disorder and other poor prognosis characteristics, including anxiety and substance abuse comorbidity, rapid cycling, and a deteriorating illness course as reflected in ratings of increasing frequency or severity of mania and depression. Conclusions: A lasting adverse impact of the experience of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> in childhood is suggested by its relationship to an earlier age of onset of bipolar disorder, other poor prognosis factors, and a deteriorating course of illness. <b>Verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> is a common confound in comparison groups defined by a lack of physical or sexual abuse.
