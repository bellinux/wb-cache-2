5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E
25|$|During the Fear Itself storyline, Howard forms a team {{called the}} Fearsome Four with She-Hulk, Frankenstein's Monster and Nighthawk {{to stop the}} Man-Thing when he goes on a rampage in Manhattan, due to the fear and chaos <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> on the citizens.

25|$|Five years later, Taki has {{graduated}} from university and {{is searching for}} a job. <b>He</b> <b>senses</b> he is missing something important, and learns that inhabitants of Itomori survived by following the mayor's order. He recognizes Tessie and Sayaka in a Tokyo restaurant, now engaged, but cannot identify them. One day, Taki and Mitsuha recognize each other when their trains draw parallel.

25|$|Fifty years later, Doro {{returns to}} the seed village. His {{relationship}} with Anyanwu has deteriorated, {{and one of the}} only things keeping him from killing her is her successful marriage to Isaac. He has come home because <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> that Anyanwu’s daughter, Nweke, is fully coming into her powers. During her transition, Nweke attacks Anyanwu. Trying to protect Anyanwu, Isaac accidentally kills Nweke and suffers a heart attack. Anyanwu realizes she is too weak to heal Isaac and he dies. Afraid that Doro will kill her now that Isaac is not there to protect her, Anyanwu transforms into an animal and runs away.|$|E
25|$|This version's major {{difference}} is Brainiac's role in Krypton's destruction. Brainiac {{is portrayed as}} the supercomputer that monitors Krypton and advises the planetary council on scientific matters. <b>He</b> <b>senses</b> the imminent destruction of the planet, but denies it so he can avoid the council's order to organize the planet's evacuation and instead focus on saving himself. Brainiac reasons {{that the loss of}} the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order, but his own survival would ensure the preservation of Krypton's history and achievements. Because he goes against Brainiac and the Kryptonian Council, Jor-El becomes an outlaw in their eyes as he works to save his son. After the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's arrival on Earth, Brainiac eventually becomes an enemy of Superman.|$|E
25|$|Word {{about this}} new Fremen leader Muad'Dib reaches both the Baron and the Emperor as spice {{production}} falls due to increasingly destructive Fremen raids. The Baron decides to replace his more brutish nephew Glossu Rabban with his shrewd nephew Feyd-Rautha, hoping to gain favor with the Fremen. The Emperor suspects the Baron of trying to create troops {{more powerful than the}} Sardaukar to seize power, and sends spies to monitor activity on Arrakis. Hawat uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance. Meanwhile, Gurney has reunited with Paul and Jessica. Believing Jessica to be the Atreides traitor, Gurney tries to kill her, but is stopped by Paul. However, Paul had not foreseen Gurney's attack, and believes he must drink the Water of Life to increase his prescience, until now usable only by the Bene Gesserit sisterhood and fatal to men. Paul falls into unconsciousness for several weeks after drinking the Water, but when he wakes, {{he has the ability to}} see across time and space—he has become the Kwisatz Haderach. <b>He</b> <b>senses</b> that the Emperor and Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive against the Harkonnen troops.|$|E
5000|$|Mancs (...) (1994-2006), a male German Shepherd Dog, was {{the most}} famous rescue dog of the Spider Special Rescue Team of Miskolc, Hungary. His name means [...] "paw". Mancs' special talent was {{locating}} earthquake survivors who lay trapped deep beneath the rubble, and alerting rescuers. He could locate people buried under the earthquake rubble and not only differentiate whether the person was dead or alive, but could also indicate this to {{the other members of}} the rescue crew. If <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> a dead person, he laid down; when <b>he</b> <b>sensed</b> a live person beneath the rubble, he stood up, wagged his tail and barked.|$|R

25|$|During an FBI raid on {{the organ}} donor {{facility}} where Dacyshyn works, he ends up escaping, leaving Bannan's severed head at the scene. Mulder, who accompanied Whitney on the raid, chases Dacyshyn to a building construction site. Whitney follows, and is killed when Dacyshyn pushes her down an elevator shaft. Scully, seeking a resolution, asks Joe, who has not yet heard {{of the discovery of}} Bannan's head, if <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> that she is still alive. He replies that she is. Discouraged but still determined, Mulder decides to investigate the incidents further. He starts by driving Scully's car to Nutter's Feed Store in a small town near the abductions, as the human remains contain acepromazine, an animal tranquilizer. When Dacyshyn coincidentally arrives moments later, Mulder slips out and follows him. Dacyshyn notices him, however, and runs his car off the road. Mulder survives and manages to tail Dacyshyn, who exits his truck after the engine fails, to a small compound in a former barn. Mulder enters, and the commotion caused by a two-headed guard dog brings Dacyshyn out from one of the buildings. The compound is being used by an east-European medical team that has been murdering people and stealing their organs for years. The field where Father Joe had earlier discovered the bodies turned out to be their dumping ground. Mulder enters the building to find that the team has been using the organs and body parts in an attempt to keep Tomczeszyn alive. At that moment, they attempt to place Tomczeszyn's head on the body of the second abducted woman. Mulder tries to save her from the gruesome fate, but a doctor comes from behind and injects him with a tranquilizer. Helpless, Mulder is taken outside to be murdered by Dacyshyn.|$|E
500|$|In Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), Ermac {{becomes a}} force for good to atone for his crimes {{committed}} in Kahn's name. He allies himself {{with the spirit of}} Liu Kang and helps free the imprisoned souls of his friends—Johnny Cage, Jax, Sonya Blade, Kitana, and Kung Lao—who had been killed by the Deadly Alliance and then resurrected and controlled by the game's main boss character, the Dragon King Onaga. In a subplot that has not been explored further in the series, <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> that Onaga is being controlled by an unseen, more powerful influence. In the game's training mode that is set before the main storyline, Ermac is dispatched to the Netherrealm by Shao Kahn to defeat the demon Ashrah, but since he is bound by magic, the dark realm drains his powers. He encounters the game's protagonist Shujinko, who locates the monolithic [...] "Soul Stone" [...] that restores his strength, and Ermac trains Shujinko as compensation. When Ermac confronts Ashrah, she wrongly believes he also is a demon and seeks to kill him, but he defeats her.|$|E
500|$|Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says [...] "On my signal, unleash hell." [...] This is a {{reference}} to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when Scrat, a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts. When Stewie invades Bertram's camp {{at the end of the}} episode Bertram quotes , repeating the line Darth Vader says when <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star. [...] When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite. [...] When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters. [...] Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors. [...] Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens. [...] A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit “Milkshake.” This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie [...] in which Ben Stiller does the same thing in his fatsuit.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Goldman {{identifies}} a major aesthetic {{shift in}} Boulez’s {{work from the}} mid-1970s onwards, characterised variously {{by the presence of}} thematic writing, a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form. He sees this shift reflected in Boulez's writings from the period in which <b>he</b> <b>senses</b> a great concern for the audience, for the way his works are to be perceived, not only the way they are conceived and constructed. Boulez himself said: [...] "the envelope is simpler. The contents are not ... I think in my recent work {{it is true that the}} first approach is more direct, and the gesture is more obvious, let's say." [...] The works from this period are amongst his most frequently performed.|$|E

One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question {{his life and his}} own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Two uncaring EMTs come over to pump Mildred's stomach, drain her poisoned blood, and fill her with new blood. After the EMTs leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag watches over Mildred, watching the new blood fill her pallid cheeks. Montag then goes outside, overhearing Clarisse and her family talk about the way life is in this hedonistic, illiterate society.

Over the next few days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag as he walks home.
