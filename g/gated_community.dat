The Interlomas area of Mexico City contains hundreds of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> and is the largest concentration of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in the world, stretching over 54 sq mi.

40|$|The current {{literature}} on <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> characterizes residents as fearful, wealthy, white homeowners. Thus, researchers using recent American Housing Survey (AHS) data {{were surprised to}} find that many residents of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> live in apartments and that residents of walled or fenced communities were actually more likely to be renters than owners. This article uses the AHS to explore the characteristics of residents of rental <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> (the other half). Factors leading to the growth of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in general and gated apartments in particular are considered. Owned and rental <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> are compared as a first step in defining the differences between these kinds of tenure, and existing research on subsidized gated housing is updated using descriptive and trend data.

Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a <b>gated</b> <b>community</b> with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E

Directly across from the main campus to the northwest are scenic Montrose Park and the Montrose Park Historic District, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Eugene V.

40|$|<b>Gated</b> <b>communities</b> {{seem to be}} {{appearing}} {{all over}} Guangzhou. According to Western literature, <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> are mainly caused by fear of crime and {{are seen as a}} negative phenomenon, dangerous to the social aspects of city life. However, researchers have called for attention to the Chinese context. This research has tried to find out to what extent fear of crime has influenced the development of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in Guangzhou. The main idea is that fear of crime leads to a wish for security and separation amongst citizens and urban planners, which, influenced by the Chinese context, leads to the development of <b>gated</b> <b>communities.</b> After interviewing Chinese urban planners and inhabitants of <b>gated</b> <b>communities,</b> it is found that fear of crime {{can be seen as the}} main reason for the development of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in Guangzhou. However, walls have been present in Chinese urban planning for centuries and are not seen as negatively in China as in the West, influencing the decision to create <b>gated</b> <b>communities.</b> Also, Chinese <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> differ from their Western counterparts and can be seen as a collection of clusters (zutuans) within one outer wall, while the area inside the outer wall is still semi-public area and accessible to non-residents. Although fear of crime was found to be the main reason for the development of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in Guangzhou, the Chinese context should definitely be taken into account when researching <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in China...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gated</b> <b>communities</b> {{are part}} of the trend of {{suburbanization}} that is based on the creation of self-contained, separate communities with carefully constructed identities. There are many definitions of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> and they differ from country to country.

In parallel to the increasing diversity and multiplicity, <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> have grown in both developed and developing countries and they have radically transformed the urban environment.

40|$|This is {{an essay}} about <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> {{and their impact}} on society. The key {{questions}} of my essay are: why people choose to live in gated communities; how the city is impacted by <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> and what the difference concerning the reasons and impact of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in Florida and Sweden is, and what this difference might depend on. I am using postmodern urbanism as a starting point, and I look closer on Edward J. Soja’s theories about the postmodern metropolis. The research about <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> is almost nonexistent in Sweden, so the literature I have read and used in my essay has mostly an American perspective. For a Swedish perspective I have among other things interviewed a professor in urban planning from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. My study shows that a search for security and a certain lifestyle are the main reasons for people to live or want to live in <b>gated</b> <b>communities,</b> both in Florida and in Sweden. However, {{there is a big difference}} in the subject between Florida and Sweden, mainly because there are only a few living areas in Sweden that can be considered as being <b>gated</b> <b>communities.</b> In Sweden a new lifestyle community called Victoria Park and is considered being a “Swedish gated community” has gotten a lot of critique in the media. This shows that <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> are not really accepted in Sweden yet. In Florida <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> are not considered extraordinary and you can see the negative impacts they have had on the city, like empty cities without the service that is now found inside <b>gated</b> <b>communities.</b> <b>Gated</b> <b>communities</b> can be seen by some as a dream living situation, and for others a nightmare. Living in a private <b>community</b> with <b>gates</b> are not yet something you can do in Sweden, but the development of living areas like Victoria Park and its popularity show that maybe it won’t take long until it’s not considered as an irregularity...|$|R

Despite the growing numbers of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> worldwide, research on this matter remains scarce. I argue that a “gated community consensus” has emerged in Puerto Rico. The hypothesis is that in Guaynabo, the municipality facilitates the emergence of <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> in order to {{change the face of}} the city and reap an economic windfall. Interviews demonstrate the municipality’s commitment to facilitating the construction of new communities and lending support to older communities. Most of these <b>gated</b> <b>communities</b> respond to high end income projects, thus altering the profile of Guaynabo’s residents.
