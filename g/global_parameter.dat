However, the probability of accepting the simulated values for the parameters under a given tolerance with the ABC rejection algorithm typically decreases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the parameter space (due to the global acceptance criterion). Although no computational method (based on ABC or not) seems to be able to break the curse-of-dimensionality, methods have recently been developed to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces under certain assumptions (e.g., based on polynomial approximation on sparse grids, which could potentially heavily reduce the simulation times for ABC). However, the applicability of such methods is problem dependent, and the difficulty of exploring parameter spaces should in general not be underestimated. For example, the introduction of deterministic <b>global</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation led to reports that the global optima obtained in several previous studies of low-dimensional problems were incorrect. For certain problems, it might therefore be difficult to know whether the model is incorrect or, as discussed above, whether the explored region of the parameter space is inappropriate. A more pragmatic approach is to cut the scope of the problem through model reduction.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to propose}} an {{automatic}} and direct method to manipulate <b>global</b> <b>parameters</b> {{of the object}} for prototyping and simulation, given an STL mesh model of a thin-walled object. Proposed method is useful in rapid prototyping, where changing the <b>global</b> <b>parameters</b> such as thickness, scaling local features or draft of walls of an STL mesh is often required. Presently, user needs to iterate over the cycle of modification of the computer-aided design (CAD) model and tessellating it to change the <b>global</b> <b>parameters.</b> The proposed algorithm {{eliminates the need for}} CAD model while manipulating those global properties, as it works directly with the mesh model. Design/methodology/approach - Proposed algorithm automatically identifies walls and its thickness, and then, it extracts mid-surface from each wall. <b>Global</b> <b>parameters</b> are then modified by using these mid-surfaces. Findings - Mesh directly modified and the mesh obtained by tessellating modified CAD model has same global properties; proposed method can also allow multiple parameters to be modified at the same time. Research limitations/implications - Input STL model is assumed to be error-free, where models containing errors like self-intersection will lead to incorrect mid-surfaces. Present algorithm assumes that the mid-surface represent of the input STL model is a manifold surface. Originality/value - A novel algorithm of directly manipulating <b>global</b> <b>parameters</b> of a thin-walled object in its STL mesh model is proposed. The paper also presents a novel method of extracting mid-surface representation from a thin-wall STL mesh...|$|R

50|$|Cells {{are often}} used in bioreceptors because they are {{sensitive}} to surrounding environment and they can respond {{to all kinds of}} stimulants. Cells tend to attach to the surface so they can be easily immobilized. Compared to organelles they remain active for longer period and the reproducibility makes them reusable. They are commonly used to detect <b>global</b> <b>parameter</b> like stress condition, toxicity and organic derivatives. They {{can also be used to}} monitor the treatment effect of drugs. One application is to use cells to determine herbicides which are main aquatic contaminant. Microalgae are entrapped on a quartz microfiber and the chlorophyll fluorescence modified by herbicides is collected at the tip of an optical fiber bundle and transmitted to a fluorimeter. The algae are continuously cultured to get optimized measurement. Results show that detection limit of certain herbicide can reach sub-ppb concentration level. Some cells can also be used to monitor the microbial corrosion. Pseudomonas sp. is isolated form corroded material surface and immobilized on acetylcellulose membrane. The respiration activity is determined by measuring oxygen consumption. There is linear relationship between the current generated and the concentration of sulfuric acid. The response time is related to the loading of cells and surrounding environments and can be controlled to no more than 5min.|$|E

Here we introduce a novel approach to this problem, based on the Green's function. All estimations can be made empirically and hence can be easily extended to more complex systems.

40|$|This paper studies cross-lingual {{acoustic}} modeling in {{the context}} of subspace Gaussian mixture models (SGMMs). SGMMs factorize the acoustic model parameters into a set that is globally shared between all the states of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and another that is specific to the HMM states. We demonstrate that the SGMM <b>global</b> <b>parameters</b> are transferable between languages, particularly when the parameters are trained multilingually. As a result, acoustic models may be trained using limited amounts of transcribed audio by borrowing the SGMM <b>global</b> <b>parameters</b> from one or more source languages, and only training the state-specific parameters on the target language audio. Model regularization using-norm penalty is shown to be particularly effective at avoiding overtraining and leading to lower word error rates. We investigate maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation of subspace parameters {{in order to reduce the}} mismatch between the SGMM <b>global</b> <b>parameters</b> of the source and target languages. In addition, monolingual and cross-lingual speaker adaptive training is used to reduce the model variance introduced by speakers.

This results into a novel and passive vision-based framework to perform autonomous proximity navigation.

40|$|The {{horseshoe}} prior {{has proven}} to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but as shown in this paper, the results can be sensitive to the prior choice for the global shrinkage hyperparameter. We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the <b>global</b> <b>parameter</b> and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the <b>global</b> <b>parameter</b> based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly [...] in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time [...] from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the <b>global</b> <b>parameter</b> using our framework.
