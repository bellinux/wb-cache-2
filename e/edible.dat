40|$|A crucial {{first step}} in {{teaching}} and training the retarded and autistic is to develop and maintain eye contact with the therapist. Functional movement training (an overcorrection procedure) plus <b>edibles</b> and praise were compared with <b>edibles</b> and praise alone {{as a method of}} developing eye contact in three such children. In both conditions, the child was given food and praise when eye contact occurred within 5 sec of the therapist's verbal prompt: "Look at me. " Functional movement training avoidance plus <b>edibles</b> and praise produced about 90 % attention for the three children, while <b>edibles</b> and praise alone were less effective (eye contact never exceeded 55 %). Functional movement training avoidance combined with <b>edibles</b> and praise appears to be an effective method of teaching eye contact and possibly other forms of instruction-following to behaviorally disordered children who are not always responsive to positive consequences...|$|R
