The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if participation in educational decision-making affected teacher productivity and teacher satisfaction. The Data collection took place in April and May, 1976, using a six part questionnaire. Twenty-five high schools were randomly selected along the east coast of Newfoundland. This represented a total teacher sample of three hundred and fifty-eight. In all, two hundred and eighty, or 78. 2 percent, responded. [...] The data analyses consisted of factor analyses and Pearson product-moment correlations. The two hypotheses tested were: [...] 1. There is an inverse relationship between <b>friction</b> <b>point</b> rating (FPR) identified by teachers and their Job Satisfaction. [...] 2. An inverse relationship exists between <b>friction</b> <b>point</b> rating (FPR) and Teacher Productivity. [...] The results of the bivariate analyses were negative; therefore, both hypotheses were rejected. However, the study revealed four major findings.

To simplify the contact status, a contact model with spring-damper system is presented by considering the deformation of the work-piece in this paper. And the dynamic equations of the work-piece are formulated based on this dynamic contact model. The solution of the dynamic equations is finished in Adams, and the contact forces and driving forces are calculated. By compared with the contact forces of the gripping model, the regularity of dynamic contact forces is found out. This is helpful for the design and optimization of large-scale forging manipulators.

Theoretical simulation was conducted for the friction heating with a typical amplitude and frequency. The results suggest that the hot point induced by the sliding friction between the iron string joints around the package and the iron floor is the heat source for the heat transfer progress. It is also illustrated that the calculated temperatures on the surface of cotton package near the <b>friction</b> <b>point</b> are still a little lower that the rapid pyrolysis temperature of cotton material in a rather worse situation. However, more and more heat may accumulate inside the cotton package if there is a long-time heating for it.

40|$|Exact {{solution}} of the steady Navier-Stokes equations has been obtained for the thermal stagnation-point flow {{at the leading edge}} of a turbine blade under the assumptions of constant nose radius and external vorticity, and fluid properties independent of temperature. The solutions reveal that curvature affects local heat transfer and skin friction while external vorticity does not. The effect of external vorticity is to shift the zero skin <b>friction</b> <b>point</b> away from the stagnation point. This solution is valid for all Reynolds number, external vorticity, and nose radius. In the limit of nose radius going to infinity and external vorticity, going to zero, the exact solution for two-dimensional plane stagnation-point flow is recovered identically. In addition, it can be shown that the velocity field around the stagnation point of a rotating curved surface is the same as that around the stagnation point of a stationary curved surface with an external vorticity which equals to twice of the rotational speed. This realization renders the present solution equally valid for thermal stagnationpoint flow at the leading edge of centrifugal impeller blades.

40|$|This study asses the {{kinematic}} {{theory of}} fixed separation in unsteady, two-dimensional flows {{that has been}} proposed by Haller (2004). Experimental investigations were conducted that utilized the rotor-oscillator flow to drive low Reynolds number quasi-periodic and aperiodic flows. Flow separation was observed using flow visualization techniques that employed fluorescent dye. These experimental investigations show the existence of fixed separation in both quasi-periodic and aperiodic flows. The experimental results also suggest that the location of fixed separation is immune to relatively quick variations in the flow. Thus, the 'typical' behavior of a quasi-periodic or aperiodic flow dictates the location of fixed separation {{in addition to the}} amplitude of oscillation of the flow. Both of these findings imply that the time averaged zero skin <b>friction</b> <b>point</b> is a stronger predictor of separation, which supports the Haller (2004) criteria. Furthermore, while still premature, the experimental results have so far been corroborated by early numerical simulations of the Haller (2004) criteria in the quasi-periodic flows investigated in this study. by Moneer Mohammad Helu.

System mapping and informal interviews revealed that the point of purchase was a high leverage, low <b>friction</b> <b>point</b> of intervention where procurement mechanisms, such as the RFP, make institutions passive consumers of value from the food system.
