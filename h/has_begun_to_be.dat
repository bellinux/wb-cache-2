Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide.

25|$|China's {{birth control}} policy, known widely as the one-child policy, was {{implemented}} in 1979 by chairman Mao Zedong's government {{to alleviate the}} overpopulation problem.

Sex-selective abortions are thought to have been a significant contribution to the gender imbalance in mainland China, where there is a 118:100 ratio of male to female children reported.

At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for anemia and erythrocyte size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the MTR-dependent effects of B12 deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine (homocysteinuria). This condition may result in long term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.|$|E

500|$|The {{gestation}} period {{has been reported}} as 10–11 months long in the Indian Ocean and Pacific islands, and 7–9 months long off northern Australia. Earlier authors, such as Melouk (1957), have estimated a {{gestation period}} as long as 16 months, though the validity of this figure has subsequently been challenged.

[...] According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including [...] "no worries", [...] "absolutely", and [...] "bottom line" [...] have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings. The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English.|$|E

Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters.

[...] However, with additional studios now [...] "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: [...] "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [...] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario?

2500|$|Over {{the past}} two decades in which the niqāb <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen in Egypt's streets, the debate about whether the niqāb is {{appropriate}} has resulted in high emotional responses from society and a media storm surrounding it. These effects depict how the niqāb debate is not an isolated issue or an isolated struggle between those who wear the niqāb and the government. The debate around the niqab reflects the greater war against the threat of violent extremism which has led to a broad government crackdown and massive arrests, not only of suspected extremists but moderate Islamists. Finding schools and universities as primary sources of Islamic militancy, the government has designated education as an issue of [...] "national security" [...] and has initiated policies around the niqab to counter the threat of fundamentalism.|$|E

I believe he never suspected it, though of this I am not absolutely sure. If he did, the line he had taken, the line of absolute negation of the matter to himself, shows an immense effort of the will. I may tell my secret now, giving it for what it is worth, now that Mark Ambient has gone, that he <b>has</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alluded to as one of the famous early dead, and that his wife does not survive him; now, too, that Miss Ambient, whom I also saw at intervals during the years that followed, has, with her embroideries and her attitudes, her necromantic glances and strange intuitions, retired to a Sisterhood, where, as I am told, she is deeply immured and quite lost to the world.|$|E
