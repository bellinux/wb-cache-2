5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>value</b> of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country. Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E
5|$|Regulations {{require that}} {{scientists}} use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering {{to be the}} central issue and see animal euthanasia {{as a way to}} reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have <b>intrinsic</b> <b>value.</b> Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Bland–Allison Act in 1878, there had been little {{discussion}} of gold versus silver coinage. Silver had been hardly mentioned in the 1888 campaign, and Harrison's exact position on the issue was initially unclear, but his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, William Windom, encouraged the free silver supporters. Silver supporters' numbers had grown in Congress with the addition of new Western states. The drop in agricultural prices, which made farmers' debts harder to pay, broadened their cause's appeal. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This served only to disappoint both factions. Windom suggested keeping the Bland–Allison system, but doubling the amount of silver allowed to be coined. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>value</b> of the silver dollar had fallen to 72.3 cents, but Windom believed (though gold supporters doubted) that coining more silver would increase demand and raise its value. Harrison was willing to sign whatever bill would satisfy the largest group of people, as long as it did not make the currency unsound.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper Batzen by 50% to adjust its face value to its <b>intrinsic</b> <b>value</b> to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. Not many people could thus {{take advantage of this}} exchange offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese Batzen were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable. Insider deals of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population. The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by Hans Emmenegger from Schüpfheim and Christian Schybi from Escholzmatt, sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to even hear them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (Landsgemeinde) {{of the population of the}} valley at Heiligkreuz, in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the freedom of assembly. The assembly, which took place after the mass on February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.|$|E
5|$|Methods have {{included}} reducing {{the percentage of}} gold in coins, or substituting less precious metals for gold. However, until the 19th century, {{the proportion of the}} world's trade that occurred between nations was very low, so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern. Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters, the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities' wealth through seigniorage, especially when they needed to finance wars or pay debts. A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars. When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism – this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports, but rarely by means of devaluation. A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs. From the late 18th century, and especially in Britain, which, for much of the 19th century, was the world's largest economy, mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade, which held {{that the best way to}} encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>value</b> of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870–1914, so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for competitive devaluation to occur there was little opportunity. Following the end of World War I, many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard, so several of the conditions for a currency war were in place. However, currency war did not occur as the U.K. was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre-war levels, effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market.|$|E

Positive sibling experiences {{were expected to be}} positively linked to <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values</b> and negatively linked to extrinsic values, and negative experiences were hypothesized to fuel extrinsic <b>values</b> and thwart <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values.</b> Using a sample of 205 adolescent sibling pairs (older children M = 17. 61 years, younger children M = 14. 63 years) and multilevel modeling, we assessed within- and between-dyads differences to identify whether the sibling relationship functions as a correlate of values in a similar or different way for 2 siblings. Although siblings were not very similar in their values, sibling competition predicted sibling similarity in higher levels of extrinsic values and lower levels of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values.</b> Implications for value acquisition research that so far has focused almost solely on parents and failed to acknowledge other processes within families are discussed. 2010 American Psychological Association...|$|R

40|$|In England, {{across the}} whole period of the Great Debasement, the mint issued six {{different}} kinds of silver coins and three kinds of gold coins. According to Gresham’s Law, coins with the same face <b>value</b> but different <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values</b> can not circulate side by side for too long: only those coins with lower <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values</b> stay in circulation; those with relatively high <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values</b> would be hoarded, exported, or melted down.

This paper intends to produce such an assessment. For this purpose, two types of evidence are examined: the composition of the re-coinage of 1560, and the trend of the exchange rate.

Mothers and their adolescents (N= 280) rated the importance of three <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values</b> (personal growth, close relationships, and community contribution) and three extrinsic values (wealth, fame, and attractiveness). Results revealed that mothers placed greater emphasis on <b>intrinsic</b> over extrinsic <b>values</b> than did adolescents. Furthermore, the congruence of mothers' and adolescents' emphasis on <b>intrinsic</b> <b>values</b> was moderated by the extent to which adolescents experienced satisfaction of their basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence at home.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the <b>intrinsic</b> work <b>values</b> that were {{perceived}} by the university undergraduates in the three nations (Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia) to influence cooperative communication. These three nations are among the founders of Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967 that represents half of the population of the region. <b>Intrinsic</b> work <b>values</b> are an important medium through which employee behavior can be understood and managed. Previous research suggests that <b>intrinsic</b> work <b>values</b> influences cooperative communication; the relationships among these constructs, however, have not been portrayed explicitly in a theoretical model, nor have they been empirically tested. Therefore, it is important to identify the dimensionality of <b>intrinsic</b> work <b>value</b> in ASEAN future workforce and assess an empirical conceptual framework of the relationships between work values and cooperative communication. The study uses an ASEAN university’s student sample from three nations for comparative study. Using a simultaneous multiple regression analysis, the contribution of six <b>intrinsic</b> work <b>values</b> factors in creating cooperative communication in the three ASEAN nations was assessed. The findings show that <b>intrinsic</b> work <b>values</b> do impact upon cooperative communication for Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
