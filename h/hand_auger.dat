40|$|AbstractA prebored pressuremeter test (PMT) {{requires}} a predrilled vertical smooth surface borehole of a constant diameter. Two methods for {{the preparation of}} predrilled boreholes are included in ASTM D 4719. The first method is drilling a borehole using a rotary rig. While this method provides a constant diameter and a vertical borehole, it is costly and time consuming. The second method is the {{drilling of a borehole}} by a <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> (Iwan type). While this is a low cost, rapid method, it may not provide a vertical borehole of constant diameter in a variety of soils. An innovative mechanical drilling system (MDS) has been developed for the preparation of vertical smooth surface borehole of constant diameter for the pressuremeter testing. The PMT was conducted in boreholes drilled by MDS, rotary rig (RR) and <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> (HA) at a site that comprised clayey silt (CL-ML) and sandy silt (ML) deposits. The PMT curves thus obtained were compared in terms of quality, cost and time. The comparison indicates that good quality and cost effective PMT curves can be obtained by using MDS in broader strain range (up to 40 %) for the stiffness and limit pressure determination...|$|E

40|$|Geotechnical {{characterization}} of soils {{for its use}} in any project is conducted through a programme that comprises in-situ and laboratory tests. The main in-situ tests include pressuremeters (PMT), Dilatometer (DMT), Standard Penetration Test (SPT), Cone Penetrometer (CPT). Among these, prebored pressuremeter tests are performed in pre-drilled boreholes. The drilling methods such as hand augering and rotary drilling rig are recommended by the ASTM D- 4719 for the prebored pressuremeter testing. The vertical and constant diameter boreholes are the basic requirement for the prebored pressuremeter testing to obtain quality tests curves. The verticality and constant diameter for the boreholes are difficult to be achieved by these two methods as the <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> has no control on the vertical movement and rotary rig induces vibrations to {{the walls of the}} borehole during rotation of the bit. A cost effective mechanical drilling system (MDS) has been developed locally for the drilling of vertical and constant diameter shallow boreholes to about 10 m depth. The prebored pressuremeter test curves obtained in boreholes drilled by the MDS, <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> and rotary rig were compared and found that the quality of the test curves obtained in boreholes drilled by the MDS was better than the <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> and rotary rig. The site selected for the detailed study comprised alluvial soils (CL-ML and ML). In addition to prebored PMT testing, field testing comprised, SPT, CPT and laboratory testing included Triaxial testing, Resonant Column along with classification tests. The sophisticated laboratory testing like resonant column tests, isotropically consolidated undrained (CIU) and isotropically consolidated drained (CID) triaxial tests with unload-reload loops were conducted for the determination of shear modulus of soils. The unload, reload and unload-reload shear moduli from triaxial unload-reload tests were compared with those determined from pressuremeter tests. The correlations of geotechnical parameters obtained from laboratory testing and in-situ testing have been established. The precise determination of the in-situ horizontal stress is difficult by the traditional prebored PMT testing technique. A new technique has been developed for the estimation of in-situ horizontal stress keeping in mind the least disturbance/relaxing of the in-situ stresses...|$|E

On the other <b>hand,</b> Pierre <b>Auger</b> Observatory associated some ultra-high-energy cosmic rays {{with the direction}} of Centaurus A and IceCube reported 28 neutrino-induced events in a TeV - PeV energy range, although none of them related with this direction. In this work we describe the spectra {{for each of the}} lobes, the main peak with synchrotron radiation, and the high-energy emission with pp interactions. Obtaining a good description of the main peak, we deduce the magnetic fields, electron densities and the age of the lobes. Describing successfully the γ-ray emission by pp interactions and considering as targets those thermal particles in the lobes with density in the range 10 ^- 10 to 10 ^- 4 cm^- 3, we calculate the number of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Although γ-spectrum is well described with any density in the range, only when 10 ^- 4 cm^- 3 is considered, the expected number of events is very similar to that observed by Pierre Auger Observatory, otherwise we obtain an excessive luminosity. In addition, correlating the γ-ray and neutrino fluxes through pp interactions we calculate the number of high-energy neutrinos expected in IceCube. Our analysis indicates that neutrinos above 1 TeV cannot be produced in the lobes of Centaurus A, which is consistent with the results recently published by IceCube Collaboration.

Lead contamination of 16 to 200 pg Pb/g existed {{on the outside of the}} snow cores, but the measured concentrations decreased more or less abruptly along a radius from the outside to the centers of the snow cores, establishing interior values in the 1 to 5 pg Pb/g range. Some of these interior values are however possibly still slightly affected by lead contamination which could have intruded to the center of the cores because of slight melting of some of the snow cores before laboratory analysis. The interior of the blue ice block appears not to have been significantly contaminated, and contains about 1. 7 pg Pb/g. These new data show that most previously published data on lead in Antarctic snow and ice were in high positive error because of contamination during field sampling, laboratory analysis or both. They show that lead concentrations could not have increased in Antarctic snows or ice from prehistoric times to present more than 2 to 3 fold, confirming that the remote polar areas of the Southern Hemisphere are still little affected by industrial lead pollution. Prehistoric Antarctic ice is shown to contain about 1 pg Pb/g natural excess lead above silicate dust lead; this excess cannot be entirely accounted for by volcanoes or sea spray, which suggests the possible existence of some other unknown natural source of prehistoric excess lead. Present day mean eolian fallout flux of lead in Antarctica is estimated to be about 0. 07 ng Pb cm^(− 2) yr^(− 1), which stands in about the same proportion to that in the South Pacific Westerlies (about 1 : 30) as the flux in Greenland is observed to stand to those in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Westerlies...|$|R

30|$|To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} study to {{investigate}} the 64 CuCl 2 dosimetry of human PCa. The mean dose absorbed by the tumors per administered activity, calculated by means of the MIRD, was 6.00 E- 2  mGy/MBq. This absorbed dose was 4.5 and 2.3 times lower than the mean values in the liver and kidneys, respectively. For an administered activity of 3.7  GBq, the mean dose absorbed by the lesions would be 0.22  Gy. This low value seems to suggest the hypothesis that the reported therapeutic effect of 64 CuCl 2 [20 – 30] is mainly dependent on Auger electron emission rather than on the energy released by the beta radiation. In this setting, to be effective, 64 Cu should be internalized in the cell nucleus [45 – 47], since Auger cascade electrons have an energy spectrum dominated by a large number of very low energy electrons with a very narrow range in biological matter. Indeed, cellular and organ studies have demonstrated that when Auger emitters are introduced into the cytoplasm of cells, the effects are typical of those caused by radiation of low LET, such as photons and beta radiations [48]. On the other <b>hand,</b> when <b>Auger</b> emitters are incorporated into the cell nucleus, the LET of these electrons can cause similar biological damage to that elicited by heavier particles with high LET, such as alpha particles [49]. Therefore, the cytocidal effect of the Auger electrons of 64 Cu appears to be much more severe than that of beta emission; indeed, some studies report effects up to 5 – 25 times [50 – 61]. In addition, since the liver has been identified as the organ receiving the higher dose, owing to its high uptake [4, 62, 63], {{it is important to understand}} whether 64 Cu is internalized in the nucleus of hepatic cells or not. If it is not, the potential hepatic radiotoxicity might be induced by the beta emission component only by means of very high injected activity [4]. More detailed radiobiological studies are required to characterize the radiotoxicity and therapeutic effects of 64 CuCl 2. However, to really understand whether or not the liver is the critical organ in the case of therapeutic application of 64 CuCl 2, phase I clinical trials, not available at the moment, should be conducted.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of heavy metals in some soils is becoming problematic as these affect {{the environment and}} public health. Previous studies have shown cadmium levels to be high in South-West Nigeria. Also, water samples taken from the area have high heavy metal content. The local geology may help explain {{the reason for the}} high levels of the heavy metals in the soils. The soil is from the Benin formation that is Miocene to recent in age and it exhibits some deltaic depositional environment. A pilot study was conducted in Ogun State, Nigeria, where several industries are concentrated, to verify the possible sources of the heavy metals. Four soil samples were obtained from different locations using <b>hand</b> held <b>auger</b> at a depth of 2 m below the surface. The samples were sieved and dried in an oven prior to chemical analysis. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer was used in determining metal concentrations. We tested for cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) and Nickel (Ni) that are associated with manufacturing. Results show that Cd concentration in the soil samples from Ado-Odo/Ota communities were 0. 865, 2. 825 and 4. 010 mg/kg respectively while the sample from Ifo was 1. 320 mg/kg. Zinc had values of 10. 510, 4. 650 and 3. 570 mg/kg respectively while the value from Ifo was 2. 300 mg/kg. Chromium in Ado-Odo/Ota was 43. 350, 38. 600 and 16. 625 mg/kg while the sample from Ifo was 11. 285 mg/kg. Nickel was found to be below 0. 001 mg/kg in all four samples. All the metals tested were safely below the Dutch Standard target values of 140, 100 and 35 mg/kg for Zn, Cr and Ni. Cadmium, however, exceeded the target value of 0. 8 mg/kg but below the intervention value of 12. 0 mg/kg in all soil samples. This means that although the Cd levels are relatively high in all four communities, there is no immediate need for soil remediation. Also, the study shows that heavy metal in Ota had values that were generally higher than that in Ifo. The fact that only Cd exceeded target values in both Ado-Odo/Ota and Ifo municipal communities suggest that geological factors, and not industrial discharges, may be culpable for the problem. Further studies to determine the fate and transport processes of Cd as well as the routes through which it gets into groundwater is recommended. This will help predict the progression of the contaminant in order to prevent its escalation...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metal {{pollution}} {{in water and}} soil is a serious concern to {{human health and the}} associated environment. Some heavy metals have bio-importance but the bio-toxic effects of many of them in human health are of great concern. Hence, there was a need for proper understanding of the concentration levels of these heavy metals in ground water and soil around the community residing {{in the vicinity of the}} defunct mine. Mining has become prominent in this area because of the existence of copper lodes, veins and veinlets. It was therefore necessary to assess these selected metals associated with copper mining as their concentration has a tendency to affect the environment and human health. The objective of this study was to establish the levels of lead (Pb) -zinc (Zn) -copper (Cu) -arsenic (As) -nickel (Ni) metals in ground water and soil associated with an old copper mine in the vicinity of the township and to compare them with the South African and international standards in order to safeguard the health of the community using such water for drinking purpose. Clean sampling plastic bottles were used to collect water from five water boreholes being used at present. Water samples were filtered using membrane filtration set LCW (0. 45 μm). The samples were digested sequentially with different procedures for the total metal concentration. Concentrations of four metals commonly associated with Cu mining were examined at five different water boreholes which are used for drinking and industrial purposes. Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmar S/n 000003 F 6067 A, Singapore) was used to analyze metals in water samples at Eskom Ga-Nala Laboratory: pH, electrical conductivity and turbidity were analyzed using an auto titrator meter (AT- 500,Japan), conductivity meter (Cole-parmer® YO- 19601 - 00) and turbidity meter (AL 250 TIR, Agua lytic, German) respectively. Soil samples were collected from the selected areas where human health is of a serious concern, and a <b>hand</b> held <b>auger</b> drill was used to recover samples, while shovels were used to prepare the sampling area. The samples were sieved up to 63. 0 μm particle size and digested with aqua-regia. Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Model: AA 400; Year: 2008; Manufacturer: Perkin Elmer; Germany; Serial no: 201 S 6101210) was used at the University of Venda Laboratory to analyze soil from the study area for possible heavy metal contamination due to the defunct Cu mine in the area. v The results showed variation of the investigated parameters in water samples as follows: pH, 6. 0 to 7. 51; EC, 70. 0 to 96. 40 μS/cm and turbidity, 1. 05 to 4. 56 NTU. The mean concentration of the metals increased in the followed order: Pb<Cu<As<Ni. Ni is the most abundant in the ground water determined with value of (6. 49 μg/g). The observations have confirmed that most ground water contains an appreciable quantity of Ni. The mean value of As in water is (4. 20 to 4. 84 μg/g), Pb and Cu have (2. 13 to 2. 58 μg/g) and (1. 52 to 2. 52 μg/g) respectively. For soil samples, the mean concentration of the metals increased in the following order: Pb<Cu<Zn<As<Ni. Pb ranged from (0. 023 to 0. 036 μg/g) followed by Cu (0. 28 to 0. 45 μg/g) then Zn (0. 026 to 0. 053 μg/g), the mean range of As in soil ranged from (0. 054 to 0. 086 μg/g). However, some studies show much higher contamination of As from the natural sources and Ni with (0. 057 to 0. 144 μg/g) lastly. Accumulation of heavy metals in soil is of concern due to their toxic effects on human and animals. The quality of ground water from the five boreholes studied was satisfactory with turbidity (T), electrical conductivity (EC) and heavy metals (HM’s) below the WHO limit. The water therefore may, according to the WHO Standards be safely used as a drinking water. The concern lies on pH which was slightly (0. 5) below the standard. There is a serious need to monitor the ground water which is now used for drinking purposes. This study revealed that heavy metal {{pollution in}} soil from the abandoned Cu mine in Musina is a threat to the health of the community. Although pollution was between medium and low in the contamination index, it is therefore important for the Musina Municipality or mine owner of Musina (TVL) Development Co Ltd copper mine to advocate possible remedial actions which will safeguard the environment and human health. The tailing at Musina’s old Cu mine have high pH and they lack normal soil stabilization processes, as a result the tailing does not develop a good plant cover. Pollution of the ground water resources is also evident in the study area where there is seepage or ingress of polluted water to the underground aquifers. Small-scale mining in Musina is causing further degradation to the environment but it supports the South African Waste Hierarchy by promoting the reuse and recycling of the tailing and mine dumps for the production of bricks. Mine workers are exposed to the above mentioned toxic heavy metals daily. Medicine will not help stop the poisoning. The only way to stop the metal poisoning is to stop being exposed to the heavy metals. Environmental SciencesM. Sc. (Environmental Management...|$|R

40|$|This {{sampling}} memorandum {{outlines the}} scope of work and sampling procedures presented in the Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) Background Sampling Work Plan (Work Plan) submitted to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) on August 1, 2013. All personnel participating in field efforts are required to read this sampling plan, become familiar with the field procedures, and implement the procedures to meet the Work Plan goals. The goal of the Work Plan is to collect a sufficient number of soil samples for PAH laboratory analysis to provide background PAH data near the Madison-Kipp Site. Proposed soil boring locations, including recommended locations provided by the WDNR and the City of Madison, are presented on Figure 1. The proposed soil borings are located on City of Madison and/or City right-of-way property, with the exception of Borings 16 and 17, which are located on the Lowell Elementary School property. The following scope of work was presented in the Work Plan: Locate and clear utilities, including private utility locate (Private Lines, Inc.), and Digger’s hotline to clear the soil boring locations. Advance 24 soil borings on City of Madison, City right-of-way, or school property using <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> techniques. Collect one sample per boring from 0 to 1 foot below ground surface for laboratory analysis o...|$|E
40|$|Water is an {{integral}} issue needed to attain the desired targets but good quality water for irrigation purpose is gradually become scarce. The seasonal nature of rainfall can give rise to water stress at critical periods of growth. This research attempts to evaluate the irrigation application efficiency of Chanchaga irrigation scheme, Minna, Niger state. A <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> was used to bore to a desired depth to remove samples of the moist soil. Samples of the moist soil removed {{was placed in a}} can, covered and taken to the laboratory. The specific gravity (apparent) of the soil particle and the depth of water applied were determined using volumetric method, water application efficiency is determined using Gravimetric Method of Soil Moisture Content (Pw) Determination. The moisture content of the field after irrigation water is applied falls between the ranges of 51. 1 % and 51. 5 %, with an average of 51. 28 %, in this case the average amount of water applied is about 4. 68 %, this shows a little increase in the moisture content of the soil in the field. It was concluded that the efficiency of water application obtained is adequate and a good result considering the available management practice in terms of system operation, monitoring and evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The high-degree {{of spatial}} {{variability}} of dissolved As levels in shallow aquifers of the Bengal Basin {{has been well}} documented but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We compare here As concentrations measured in groundwater pumped from 4700 wells < 22 m (75 ft) deep across a 25 km 2 area of Bangladesh with variations in the nature of surface soils inferred from 18, 500 measurements of frequency domain electromagnetic induction. A set of 14 <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> cores recovered from the same area indicate that a combination of grain size and the conductivity of soil water dominate the electromagnetic signal. The relationship between pairs of individual EM conductivity and dissolved As measurements within a distance of 50 m is significant but highly scattered (r 2 = 0. 12; n = 614). Concentrations of As tend to be lower in shallow aquifers underlying sandy soils and higher below finer-grained and high conductivity soils. Variations in EM conductivity account for nearly half the variance of the rate of increase of As concentration with depth, however, when the data are averaged over a distance of 50 m (r 2 = 0. 50; n = 145). The association is interpreted as an indication that groundwater recharge through permeable sandy soils prevents As concentrations from rising in shallow reducing groundwater...|$|E
30|$|Soils were {{collected}} from cropping areas in nine farmlands and a control site. Samples {{were collected}} quarterly for 2  years across the three senatorial districts of Kogi State, namely Kogi Central, Kogi West and Kogi East respectively. Soils were obtained at the depth of 0 – 15 and 15 – 30  cm in each farm and control site, to make 320 composite samples. Samples from the surroundings of each site were homogenized to obtain an individual composite sample (Khan et al. 2008). Following a systematic sampling, ten sub subsamples were collected within an area of 10  m by 10  m with a stainless steel <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> sampler to make a composite. The sampled locations are shown in Fig.  1. The collected samples were dried at ambient temperature, ground and sieved with a < 2  mm mesh and kept in polyethylene packages till analysis. Soil pH was measured in H 20 (soil:water =  1 : 1) suspension electrometrically in duplicate (Bäckström et al. 2004). Soil particle size analysis was carried out as described by Gee and Bauder (1979). Organic carbon of dry soil samples {{was determined by the}} Walkley–Black method (Walkly and Black 1934). The heavy metals in soil were extracted using aqua regia and the digest were determined for Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentration by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.|$|E
40|$|On February 22, 2011, a {{magnitude}} Mw 6. 2 earthquake affected the Canterbury region, New Zealand, resulting in many fatalities. Liquefaction occurred across many areas, {{visible on the}} surface as ‘‘sand volcanoes’’, blisters and subsidence, causing significant damage to buildings, land and infrastructure. Liquefaction occurred {{at a number of}} sites across the Christchurch Boys High School sports grounds; one area in particular contained a piston ground failure and an adjacent silt volcano. Here, as part of a class project, we apply near-surface geophysics to image these two liquefaction features and determine whether they share a subsurface connection. <b>Hand</b> <b>auger</b> results enable correlation of the geophysical responses with the subsurface stratigraphy. The survey results suggest that there is a subsurface link, likely via a paleo-stream channel. The anomalous responses of the horizontal loop electromagnetic survey and electrical resistivity imaging highlight the disruption of the subsurface electrical properties beneath and between the two liquefaction features. The vertical magnetic gradient may also show a subtle anomalous response in this area, however the results are inconclusive. The ground penetrating radar survey shows disruption of the subsurface stratigraphy beneath the liquefaction features, in particular sediment mounding beneath the silt ejection (‘‘silt volcano’’) and stratigraphic disruption beneath the piston failure. The results indicate how near-surface geophysics allow the characteristics of liquefaction in the subsurface to be better understood, which could aid remediation work following liquefaction-induced land damage and guide interpretation of geophysical surveys of paleoliquefaction features...|$|E
40|$|The Sungai Lembing {{abandoned}} tin {{mining and}} processing activities 77 years lease to mine the area {{have resulted in}} the production of hazardous wastes, which contain high residual concentrations of heavy metals. Heavy metals (As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni) contained in the tailings are mobilised, migrate to the surroundings and cause severe and widespread contamination of soils, surface and ground waters and to river. For the purpose of this study, eight holes were drilled using <b>hand</b> <b>auger,</b> and sampling of contaminated soil was conducted at different depths and collected samples from surface for the tailings. The concentrations of heavy metals in this area exceed the limit allowed by Dutch list and Kelly Indices. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in contaminated soils range between 101. 71 mg/kg for Cr and 250311. 4 mg/kg for Pb. Meanwhile, the maximum concentration of heavy metals in tailing deposits is 151839. 32 mg/kg for Pb near the main potential sources of pollution (i. e. near the abandoned processing structure), and the minimum concentration is 96. 04 mg/kg for Cr. The results suggest that there is a vital increase of heavy metal risk in this area. Polluted heavy metals dispersion (for examples from historical and active tailings impoundments and waste rock dumps), are mainly associated, at this site, with water transportation of mine waste through the flowing streams. Control measures of pollution routes and remediation measures at the site are urgently required...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} {{of research on}} pre-Angkorian canals near the ancient settlement of Angkor Borei in the southern Mekong delta of southern Cambodia. The canals have been mapped by aerial photograph interpretation and investigated in the field by <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> drilling of two canal traces and trenching of one of these. Luminescence profiling through the canal infill successfully identified {{the base of the}} canal as well as revealing distrubance and mixing of the canal infill that was not apparent from visual inspection or sedimentological analyses of the infill sediments. OSL dating of the canal bed indicates excavation (or re-excavation) of the canal bed between the first millennium BC and the middle of the first millenium AD. This date is consistent with the time of initial occupation of Angkor borei in the fourth century BC. Multiple charcoal samples with a pooled age of early fourth to early fifth century AD probably signal the onset of canal infilling. The apparent demise of the canal coincides with a major change in land-use signalled in pollen and diatom data from Angkor Borei, but this change cannot be taken to indicate de-population of the region. This tentative chronology will be refined when more canals are investigated and greater precision is achieved in OSL dating of the canals. The latter will necessitate clearer identification and separation of unbleached (older, pre-archaeological) components and bleached (younger and dating the canal digging and/or operation) components in the OSL stored dose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tomato rooting patterns, root length density (cm/cm 3) {{and root}} length {{intensity}} (cm/cm 2), were evaluated {{in a field}} trial with pot transplanted plants where three irrigation regimes (0. 5, 0. 7 and 1 ETm) and three nitrogen application levels: 50, 150 and 250 kg N/ha as Ca (NO 3) 2 were imposed. Root length was measured from soil-root samples taken with a <b>hand</b> <b>auger,</b> at three distances across the planting row (over the plant row, at 15 cm and 37. 5 cm distance from the plant row) and on three dates {{during the growing season}} (34, 72 and 105 days after planting). Root length was recorded as root length density, RLD, cm/cm 3 and total root length per unit of soil surface area, RLI, cm/cm 2. Yield and ºBrix were estimated when about 80 % of the fruits were red or orange. Irrigation and fertilization only in some occasions, locations and depths, had a significant effect on root length density. For all the sampling dates in the location over the plant row about 63 to 78 % of root length was concentrated in the top 10 cm of the soil profile. The results show that water applied increased significantly lateral root growth. Root length intensity in function of distance to the plant row was modelled for the three sampling dates. The soluble solid yield was greater in the treatment where the level of water applied was the highest. Differences found on commercial yield and ºBrix between fertilization treatments were not significant...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} mining of iron ore on soil on the iron ore deposit area of Bukit Besi, Temangan, Machang was investigated. The study {{involved}} determination of some heavy metal content of soil {{in order to}} have baseline data for assessing the impact of mining activities. For the purpose of this study, 6 holes were drilled using <b>hand</b> <b>auger,</b> and sampling of soil was conducted at 0 - 15 cm depth were randomly collected at extraction stage and after the beneficiation stage of mining activities, digested and analyzed using Perkin Elmer (PinAAcle 900 F), a model of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) for concentration of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and iron (Fe). The concentrations of heavy metals in extraction and beneficiation stage were compared with The New Ducth List Guidelines and Kelly Indices Guidelines. All the concentration of heavy metals were not exceed the limit allowed by Kelly Indices Guidelines which classified as uncontaminated while for the New Ducth List Guidelines, only for Zn at Point 1 and 3 and Cu at Point 6 exceed the limits of optimal category but further investigation are not necessary. Possible implication of these heavy metals to the environment, animals, plant and human was discussed. Suggestions are made on how to remediate the soil that contains heavy metals at iron ore mining site by using phytoremediation methods. This method consider as cleanest, environmental friendly technology and cost effective option to apply at the large area compare to other methods of remediation including physical and chemical remediation...|$|E
40|$|ERT {{techniques}} are especially promising in (semi-arid) areas with shallow and rocky soils where other methods {{fail to produce}} soil moisture maps and to obtain soil profile information. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was performed in the Peyne catchment in southern France at four sites located on four different geological substrates. The main objective was to test the usefulness of such geoelectrical method {{for the assessment of}} spatial and temporal variability of soil water content and to demarcate subsurface horizontal zones: topsoil, active zone and bedrock. We used time lapse ERT to separate lithological variability from soil moisture content and to evaluate its potential to demarcate subsurface soil horizons. Three measurement campaigns were carried out and field data were collected using the Sting R 1 /IP advanced resistivity meter with one-channel receiver. We used an array of 28 electrodes with 1 m spacing, which provided reliable resistivity information to a depth of approximately 5. 5 m. ERT were followed by soil sampling carried out with a <b>hand</b> <b>auger,</b> directly below the respective geoelectrical profiles. Empirical linear regression was used to determine the specific relationships between volumetric soil moisture of the field samples and electrical resistivity data obtained in situ. Our conclusions are that ERT is a useful technique for providing information on the spatial–temporal variability of water content in semi-arid areas and for reaching depths otherwise inaccessible. In this study we proposed a method to delineate three important different soil zones: topsoil, active zone, bedrock, based on resistivity data. These three layers are essential information in understanding and modelling the interaction between subsurface and vegetation water uptake, particularly in semi-arid regions...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{an active}} southeast-dipping reverse fault mapped {{in the lower}} reaches of the Mikonui River in Westland, New Zealand. The fault, {{referred}} to as the Lower Mikonui Fault, and the nearby Flagstaff Fault, are mapped as splays of the South Westland Fault. Field investigations for this study have included geological and geomorphological mapping, shallow depth <b>hand</b> <b>auger</b> hole logging and MSAW surveying. These have been combined with previous data from mining reports and borelog collections conducted in the Mikonui Valley to map local geology associated with the Lower Mikonui Fault, Flagstaff Fault, and South Westland Fault in this area. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating has been used to provide age constraints of the rupture history of the active Lower Mikonui Fault from an excellent exposure along the east bank of the lower Mikonui River. A reconstruction of the fault’s Late Quaternary deformation, paleoseismicity and current hazard potential have been created which indicate at least three ruptures in the last ~ 60, 000 years, each with ~ 1 m of vertical displacement and an average dip slip rate of 0. 15 ± 0. 05 mm/yr. The Lower Mikonui Fault is estimated to be capable of at least 6. 8 ± 0. 5 M earthquakes. A new location in the Mikonui Valley for the main splay of the South Westland Fault is proposed, which strongly implies that the South Westland Fault and Hohonu Fault are the southern and northern parts of a single, longer, fault zone structure. The Lower Mikonui Fault and the Flagstaff Fault are interpreted as splays of the South Westland/Hohonu Fault Zone...|$|E
