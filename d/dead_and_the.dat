5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many <b>dead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling dystopia. Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E

5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally <b>dead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|At 04:45, 7 November No. 4 Commando {{were ready}} to start their assault, with No. 3 Troop on the left, the two French troops {{in the middle and}} No. 2 Troop on the right. The commandos moved forward, winning a number of small skirmishes, when at 08:15 three German {{officers}} appeared and offered the surrender of all the remaining German forces in the area. Lieutenant Colonel Dawson met with the German commander and a formal surrender was agreed and 900 prisoners were taken. Other Germans surrendered to some of the Royal Marine commandos at the same time. In the whole operation No. 4 Commando had suffered 13 dead, 21 wounded versus about 200 German <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capture of 1,200 prisoners and large amounts of weapons and equipment.|$|E
5|$|By 1 December, the PVA 58th Division was {{virtually}} destroyed, {{with the remainder}} waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Corps of the 9th Army. But much to the frustration of Song Shi-Lun, the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN forces could finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E

5|$|The main {{battle was}} over, but more combat took place as Kesselring sent in even more Bf 109s {{to support the}} {{withdrawing}} bombers. Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG 2) and Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) engaged RAF fighters near the Isle of Wight as the bombers left British air space. II./JG 2 lost one Bf 109 destroyed and another damaged in battle with Hurricanes from No. 601 Squadron, suffering one pilot missing and the other wounded. JG 27 lost six Bf 109s (three each from I. and II./JG 27) in action against No. 85 Squadron RAF.

5|$|The {{situation}} was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows. Richard rode forwards towards {{the crowd and}} persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation. Walworth meanwhile began {{to regain control of}} the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city. Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.|$|E
5|$|Typically, cemeteries of {{more than}} 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice {{designed}} by architect Reginald Blomfield. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a freestanding four-point limestone Latin cross, mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet. A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded {{on the face of}} the cross. This cross represents the faith of the majority of the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Varanasi {{has been}} a {{cultural}} centre of North India for several thousand years, and is {{closely associated with the}} Ganges. Hindus believe that death in the city will bring salvation, making it a major centre for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide for its many ghats, embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.|$|E

5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand <b>dead,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in Mayâ€“June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Attica is a war-torn city {{under assault}} by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, {{and is the}} site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, Morpheus. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has {{plummeted}} to Earth in Helios' absence. Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton. The Underworld is the underground realm of the dead and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, Charon. Tartarus is the prison of the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Titans where the massive Titan Hyperion is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variable}} winds of 20 May, some ships were more heavily engaged than others {{and as a}} result the casualties in the action were unevenly spread. According to the French account of the battle, RenommÃ©e suffered 93 killed and wounded, including Commodore Roquebert <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first lieutenant and commander of the troops on board both badly wounded, although British accounts give a figure of 145 casualties. The French accounts also demonstrate that NÃ©rÃ©ide had suffered severely, losing 25 dead including Captain Lemaresquier and 32 wounded (again the British accounts differ, stating that she suffered 130 casualties). Clorinde, which had caused severe damage to Galatea while the British ship was immobile but had failed to support RenommÃ©e against Schomberg, lost just one man killed and six wounded. British losses were less severe, although still significant, Galatea losing 16 and 46 wounded, Phoebe seven dead and 24 wounded and Astraea two dead and 16 wounded. Racehorse, despite being badly damaged in her masts and rigging, reportedly suffered no casualties.|$|E
