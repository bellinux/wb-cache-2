5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E

In January 1873, Berry conducted the first human dissection in the prefecture at Kobe Hospital. He visited Kobe's prison in 1877, on the prefecture's request, {{in response to an}} outbreak of beriberi within, and saw with his own eyes the unsanitary conditions and inhumane treatment of prisoners there. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> prefecture to reform its prison system, and many other missionaries followed him in visiting the prisons and presenting plans to the government for their reform.|$|E

500|$|Gabe Bartalos {{performed}} the make-up effects. [...] Trimark contacted Bartalos {{to produce a}} sample. [...] Bartalos's early efforts were not to his liking, and <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> design in a more grotesque direction, as {{that was what he}} wanted to see on the screen as a horror fan. [...] Bartalos's design impressed Trimark, and he got the account. [...] Applying the make-up took three hours, and taking it off took another 40 minutes. [...] Davis described the experience as [...] "not a pleasant sensation". [...] To pass the time while the make-up was being applied, Davis said he had bizarre conversations with Bartalos, with whom he got along well. [...] Davis was conscious of the need to stay relaxed and not move, and he channelled his confidence that the make-up effects were properly applied into his acting.|$|E

He had long {{believed}} that his opponents had been Belgian, not knowing {{that all of the}} Belgian Air Force's Hurricanes had been destroyed {{on the ground in the}} first two days, without seeing combat. On 19 May, Galland shot down a French Potez aircraft. During this flight he ran out of fuel short of the runway and landed nearby, at the base of a hill. With the help of soldiers from a German Flak battery, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> Bf 109 up the hill and then half-flew, half-glided down to the Charleville-Mézières airfield in the valley below. He sent back a can of fuel for his wingman, who had also landed short of the runway. He continued flying and the next day, claimed another three more aircraft, making a total of seven. For this he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class from Erhard Milch on 22 May.|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} to program BASIC on a Tandy 1000 and becoming interested in computer and video games, {{he applied for}} {{a job as a}} game tester at Westwood studios. He submitted his demo tape—described as [...] "an acoustic guitar song with electric guitar leads and keyboard strings, and raining sound effects"—to the company's audio director. The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the NES port of DragonStrike and the computer game Eye of the Beholder II. He later composed with MIDI sequencing for several other Dungeons & Dragons games. In 1992, he helmed the audio of Dune II, attempting to complement the music of the original Dune. He later noted that <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> sequencing program on his Amiga to the limit while scoring the game. While working on Disney's The Lion King in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film. Film composer Hans Zimmer later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores. After finishing the third entry into The Legend of Kyrandia series; Malcolm's Revenge, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game Command & Conquer—the first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim.|$|E

White noted that it featured [...] "lots of contemplative ballads," [...] all of which [...] "showcas Andrew MacMahon's characteristic piano and smooth vocals."

[...] Eureka Productions initially distributed the film, but it struggled to find an audience until Kroger Babb's Hallmark Productions acquired the rights for distribution. Babb initially marketed the film under the title The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket, but failed to achieve success with that title and eventually changed it to [...] "She Shoulda Said 'No'!".

500|$|From a naval career {{point of}} view, Hayward's most notable {{drawback}} was {{his lack of}} time in command of a ship at sea. Admiral Arleigh Burke, now Chief of naval Operations, arranged for Hayward to be given command of the aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt in February 1956. This would normally be the climax of [...] naval aviator's career, but that year he was selected for promotion to rear admiral. His record of 13,200 flight hours was the highest ever achieved by a flag officer. On 7 January 1957, {{he was assigned to}} the office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Operations. In October, he became Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Research and Development. The very public failure of Project Vanguard resulted in Hayward being called to appear before a Congressional Committee, where he was grilled by its chairman, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. The post was upgraded to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development in 1959, and he was promoted to vice admiral. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> development of a number of new weapons systems, including the Lockheed P-3 Orion and the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier [...] Between 1959 and 1961, Defense expenditure on research and development grew from $525 million (roughly equivalent to $ in 20) to $4 billion (roughly equivalent to $ in 20).|$|E
500|$|The {{reform of}} the spoils system of {{political}} patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant Presidency. Grant and all reformed agreed that the prevailing system of appointments was unsound, for it maximized party advantage and minimized efficiency and the nonpartisan interest of good government. Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure. Grant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. [...] Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December, 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions. [...] However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage, meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labelled corruption.|$|E
