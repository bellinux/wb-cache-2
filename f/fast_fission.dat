5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given {{because it is}} the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause <b>fast</b> <b>fission,</b> which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.|$|E
25|$|Uranium-238 (238U or U-238) is {{the most}} common isotope of uranium found in nature, with a {{relative}} abundance of 99%. Unlike uranium-235, it is non-fissile, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction. However, it is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239. 238U cannot support a chain reaction because inelastic scattering reduces neutron energy below the range where <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> of one or more next-generation nuclei is probable. Doppler broadening of U-238's neutron absorption resonances, increasing absorption as fuel temperature increases, is also an essential negative feedback mechanism for reactor control.|$|E
2500|$|The Teller–Ulam-based [...] "Ivy Mike" [...] device had a {{much greater}} yield of 10.4Mt, but most of this also came from fission: 77% of the total came from <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> of its natural-uranium tamper.|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} in {{miniaturization}} was {{to speed up the}} fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving <b>faster</b> <b>fission</b> would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy {{in the case of a}} hollow pit.|$|R
50|$|In all moderated reactors, some {{neutrons}} of all {{energy levels}} will produce <b>fission,</b> including <b>fast</b> neutrons. Some reactors are more fully thermalised than others; for example, in a CANDU reactor nearly all fission reactions {{are produced by}} thermal neutrons, while in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) a considerable portion of the fissions are produced by higher-energy neutrons. In the proposed water-cooled supercritical water reactor (SCWR), the proportion of <b>fast</b> <b>fissions</b> may exceed 50%, making it technically a fast neutron reactor.|$|R
2500|$|Proliferation of neptunium-237 - In designs {{utilizing}} a fluorinator, Np-237 appears with uranium as gaseous hexafluoride {{and can be}} easily separated using solid fluoride pellet absorption beds. No one has produced such a bomb, but Np-237's considerable <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> cross section and low critical mass imply the possibility. When the Np-237 is kept in the reactor, it transmutes to short lived Pu-238. All reactors produce considerable neptunium, which is always present in high (mono)isotopic quality, and is easily extracted chemically.|$|E
2500|$|All {{so-called}} [...] "fission-fusion-fission" [...] weapons (i.e., all conventional modern thermonuclear warheads) {{employ the}} additional step of [...] "jacket fissioning," [...] using fusion neutrons. This works as follows: the high-energy or [...] "fast" [...] neutrons generated by fusion {{are used to}} fission a fissionable jacket located around the fusion stage. In the past this jacket was often made of natural or depleted uranium; but today's weapons {{in which there is}} a premium on weight and size (i.e., virtually all modern strategic weapons) use moderately-to-highly enriched uranium as the jacketing material (see Oralloy thermonuclear warheads section below). The <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> of the secondary jacket in fission-fusion-fission bombs is sometimes referred to as a [...] "third stage" [...] in the bomb, but it should not be confused with the obsolete true three-stage thermonuclear design, in which there existed another complete tertiary fusion stage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{larger portion}} of the total {{explosive}} yield in this design comes from the final fission stage fueled by 238U, producing enormous amounts of radioactive fission products. For example, an estimated 77% of the 10.4-megaton yield of the Ivy Mike thermonuclear test in 1952 came from <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> of the depleted uranium tamper. Because depleted uranium has no critical mass, it {{can be added to}} thermonuclear bombs in almost unlimited quantity. The Soviet Union's test of the [...] "Tsar Bomba" [...] in 1961 produced [...] "only" [...] 50 megatons of explosive power, over 90% of which came from fusion, because the 238U final stage had been replaced with lead. Had 238U been used instead, the yield of the [...] "Tsar Bomba" [...] could have been well-above 100 megatons, and it would have produced nuclear fallout equivalent to one third of the global total that had been produced up to that time.|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the two-group (one-region) and two-region (one-group) Feynman-alpha (variance to mean) formulas was assessed with regards to applications in safeguards and accelerator-driven system (ADS) considered as an option for transmutation of nuclear wastes. Since two-group calculations with the master equation technique when both thermal and <b>fast</b> <b>fissions</b> are included, have not been performed earlier, investigation of this problem has a methodological value of its own. The potential applications of the two-group - one-region and two-region - one-group Feynman-alpha approaches in nuclear safeguards were evaluated and compared {{to the results of}} Monte-Carlo simulations...|$|R
2500|$|The {{possibility}} of isolating uranium-235 was technically daunting, because uranium-235 and uranium-238 are chemically identical, and {{vary in their}} mass by only the weight of three neutrons. However, if a sufficient quantity of uranium-235 could be isolated, it would allow for a <b>fast</b> neutron <b>fission</b> chain reaction. This would be extremely explosive, a true [...] "atomic bomb." [...] The discovery that plutonium-239 could be produced in a nuclear reactor pointed towards another approach to a <b>fast</b> neutron <b>fission</b> bomb. Both approaches were extremely novel and not yet well understood, and there was considerable scientific skepticism {{at the idea that}} they could be developed in a short amount of time.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>fast</b> reactor the <b>fission</b> product poison {{situation}} may differ significantly because neutron {{absorption cross sections}} can differ for thermal neutrons and fast neutrons. In the RBEC-M Lead-Bismuth Cooled <b>Fast</b> Reactor, the <b>fission</b> products with neutron capture more than 5% of total fission products capture are, in order, 133Cs, 101Ru, 103Rh, 99Tc, 105Pd and 107Pd in the core, with 149Sm replacing 107Pd for 6th place in the breeding blanket.|$|R
2500|$|Pressurized water reactors, {{like all}} thermal reactor designs, require the <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> {{neutrons}} to be slowed down (a process called moderation or thermal) {{in order to}} interact with the nuclear fuel and sustain the chain reaction. In PWRs the coolant water is used as a moderator by letting the neutrons undergo multiple collisions with light hydrogen atoms in the water, losing speed in the process. This [...] "moderating" [...] of neutrons will happen more often when the water is more dense (more collisions will occur). The use of water as a moderator is an important safety feature of PWRs, as an increase in temperature may cause the water to expand, giving greater 'gaps' between the water molecules and reducing the probability of thermalisation—thereby reducing the extent to which neutrons are slowed down and hence reducing the reactivity in the reactor. Therefore, if reactivity increases beyond normal, the reduced moderation of neutrons will cause the chain reaction to slow down, producing less heat. This property, known as the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, makes PWR reactors very stable. This process is referred to as 'Self-Regulating', i.e. the hotter the coolant becomes, the less reactive the plant becomes, shutting itself down slightly to compensate and vice versa. Thus the plant controls itself around a given temperature set by the position of the control rods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>fission</b> of [...] in the {{secondary}} stage of a nuclear weapon contributes greatly to yield and to fallout. The <b>fast</b> <b>fission</b> of [...] also makes {{a significant contribution to}} the power output of some fast-neutron reactors.|$|E
50|$|In {{a normal}} thermal reactor, {{it has a}} very low fission product yield; thus, this isotope is not a {{significant}} contributor to nuclear waste. <b>Fast</b> <b>fission</b> or fission of some heavier actinides will produce 121mSn at higher yields.

5000|$|But the Castle Bravo {{accident}} of 1954, {{in which a}} thermonuclear weapon produced {{a large amount of}} fallout which was dispersed among human populations, suggested that this was not what was actually being used in modern thermonuclear weapons, which derive around half of their yield from a final fission stage of the <b>fast</b> <b>fissioning</b> of the uranium tamper of the secondary. While some proposed producing [...] "clean" [...] weapons, other theorists noted that one could make a nuclear weapon intentionally [...] "dirty" [...] by [...] "salting" [...] it with a material, which would generate large amounts of long-lasting fallout when irradiated by the weapon core. These are known as salted bombs; a specific subtype often noted is a cobalt bomb.|$|R

40|$|A general {{solution}} {{strategy of}} the modified power iteration method for calculating higher eigenmodes has been developed and applied in continuous energy Monte Carlo simulation. The new approach adopts four features: 1) the eigen decomposition of transfer matrix, 2) weight cancellation for higher modes, 3) population control with higher mode weights, and 4) stabilization technique of statistical fluctuations using multi-cycle accumulations. The numerical tests of neutron transport eigenvalue problems successfully demonstrate that the new strategy can significantly accelerate the fission source convergence with stable convergence behavior while obtaining multiple higher eigenmodes at the same time. The advantages of the new strategy can be summarized as 1) {{the replacement of the}} cumbersome solution step of high order polynomial equations required by Booth's original method with the simple matrix eigen decomposition, 2) <b>faster</b> <b>fission</b> source convergence in inactive cycles, 3) more stable behaviors in both inactive and active cycles, and 4) smaller variances in active cycles.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the Feynman-alpha method was {{extended}} to two-energy groups and two-regions {{by the use of}} the Chapman - Kolmogorov equation with complete description of various processes including all reaction intensities for neutrons. This paper presents a full derivation of the variance to mean formula with the forward approach, as well as quantitative evaluation of the formula with regards to applications in safeguards and accelerator-driven system. The quantitative assessment was made through MCNPX and MCNP-PoliMi simulations. The motivation for this work is related {{to the fact that the}} traditional one-group (and one-region) variance to mean formula was elaborated and used for thermal systems in which the thermal flux and the lifetime of thermal neutrons dominates. However, this approach does not fully describe the fast neutron systems, as well as heavily reflected thermal systems, since the effects of the reflector play a significant role in the latter. Thus, a two-group two-point master equation approach might lend the possibility of treating a fast multiplying material surrounded with a reflector in a more accurate way, by treating the counts separately in the fast and the thermal groups (or in the fissile and reflector regions). Investigation of this problem has a methodological value of its own since, for example, two-group calculations with the master equation technique when both thermal and <b>fast</b> <b>fissions</b> are included, have not been performed earlier...|$|R
