5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of <b>gas</b> <b>transfer.</b> This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E

This lines can be damaged like stretching, twisting, cramping, springing, etc. {{occurring}} due to the surface movements happening on the ground layers. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>transferring</b> lines have major effects on the reliabilities of the lines. The study reveals the effect of ambient temperatures in which these lines are established or repaired. Experimental measurements and tests applied on the sample sets acquired from the butt joined lines at different ambient temperature between + 60 °C and- 25 °C temperature intervals with fusion welding method. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} pipe quality (Plastic structure and production of plastic material) is an important parameter on the heating and pressure times. The result of the study shows that ambient temperature of the joining process is an effective parameter on the heating and pressure time of PE plastic...|$|R

25|$|Electrodeionization: Water {{is passed}} between a {{positive}} electrode and a negative electrode. Ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible {{if the right}} conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants, and with <b>gas</b> <b>transfer</b> membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{reasonably}} assumed that in reality, both perfusion transport by blood circulation, and diffusion transport in tissues {{where there is}} little or no blood flow occur. The problem with attempts to simultaneously model perfusion and diffusion is that there are large numbers of variables due to interactions between all of the tissue compartments and the problem becomes intractable. A way of simplifying the modelling of <b>gas</b> <b>transfer</b> into and out of tissues is to make assumptions about the limiting mechanism of dissolved gas transport to the tissues which control decompression. Assuming that either perfusion or diffusion has a dominant influence, and the other can be disregarded, can greatly reduce the number of variables.|$|E

Absolute temperature is determined at low temperature by fitting quasimomentum distributions obtained using bandmapping, i. e., turning off the lattice potential slowly compared with the bandgap.

To overcome this limitation, we extract temperature using the in-trap size of the gas. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
25|$|The {{assumption}} that perfusion is the limiting mechanism {{leads to a}} model comprising a group of tissues with varied rates of perfusion, but supplied by blood of approximately equivalent gas concentration. It is also assumed {{that there is no}} <b>gas</b> <b>transfer</b> between tissue compartments by diffusion. This results in a parallel set of independent tissues, each with its own rate of ingassing and outgassing dependent on the rate of blood flowing through the tissue. Gas uptake for each tissue is generally modelled as an exponential function, with a fixed compartment half-time, and gas elimination may also be modelled by an exponential function, with the same or a longer half time, or as a more complex function, as in the exponential-linear elimination model.|$|E
25|$|An {{inner ear}} {{decompression}} model by Doolette and Mitchell {{suggests that a}} transient increase in gas tension after a switch from helium to nitrogen in breathing gas may result from the difference in <b>gas</b> <b>transfer</b> between compartments. If the transport of nitrogen into the vascular compartment by perfusion exceeds removal of helium by perfusion, while transfer of helium into the vascular compartment by diffusion from the perilymph and endolymph exceeds the counterdiffusion of nitrogen, this {{may result in a}} temporary increase in total gas tension, as the input of nitrogen exceeds the removal of helium, which can result in bubble formation and growth. This model suggests that diffusion of gases from the middle ear across the round window is negligible. The model is not necessarily applicable to all tissue types.|$|E
