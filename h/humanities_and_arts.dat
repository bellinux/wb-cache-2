25|$|The Humanities Project, {{also known}} as a Sufficiency, is {{designed}} to assess well-roundedness in areas outside of technological knowledge. The project consists of five thematically-related courses in the <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts</b> (such as Western literature, musical composition, etc.), and culminates with a course-long independent project. This can be a variety of different things; recent Sufficiency projects include research into contemporary music history, a student giving a flute recital, original screenplays, and critiques of philosophy. Students interested in foreign languages often skip the project and take an additional course, though there are opportunities to do a project. Students who are majoring in a <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts</b> related field do a similar Sufficiency project in a science or engineering discipline.|$|E

5000|$|Discussing {{his work}} in the digital medium, and the {{potential}} of new platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, Frank said, [...] "For me, experimentation is not about the technology. In an ever-changing technological landscape, where today’s platforms are not tomorrow’s platforms, the key seems to be that any one of these spaces can use a dose of <b>humanity</b> <b>and</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> culture." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} PhD {{graduates}} has progressed {{at a similar}} pace as university enrollment overall. Natural sciences and engineering have proved increasingly popular among both sexes, even if engineering remains a male-dominated field. In 2012, women made up one-third of PhD graduates, being drawn primarily to health (40% of PhD students), natural sciences (39%), agriculture (33%) and <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts</b> (31%). According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 38% of master’s and PhD students were studying science and engineering fields in 2011.|$|E
25|$|A lifelong and well-respected area {{musician}} and artist, Jim Groth, became an educator, when the Office of Indian Ed {{opened up and}} needed teachers for the new Native Connections classes, including his own, in Lincoln High School.

The connections classes have grown to serve the city in cultural <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts</b> and Groth continues to be a leader in music in the city.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Irving began {{interacting}} with the Ford Foundation. At that time, the Foundation's <b>Humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arts</b> Program offered grants-in-aid to “creative and performing artists”, et al and the Workshop stood to benefit. Over time Irving developed {{a relationship with the}} Foundation as a consultant who advised fledgling theaters on survival and growth throughout the nation. [...] Of particular note is his travel to Mississippi in the early '60s to work as an advisor to the Free Southern Theater, a racially integrated troupe presenting Waiting for Godot amid a [...] "beligerant, racist" [...] atmosphere. Irving's relationship with the Ford Foundation offered important lessons in the ethics and effects of philanthropic intervention in non-profit enterprises within a free market system.|$|E

The school finished renovations and reopened on the Memorial Student Center on April 21, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pursuit of}} beauty has driven Hofstadter {{both inside and}} outside his {{professional}} work. He seeks beautiful mathematical patterns, beautiful explanations, beautiful typefaces, beautiful sonic patterns in poetry, etc. Hofstadter has said of himself, [...] "I'm someone who has one foot in the world of <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts,</b> and the other foot in the world of science." [...] He has had several exhibitions of his artworks in various university art galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his ambigrams (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by [...] "oscillation", like the Necker Cube or the rabbit/duck figure of Joseph Jastrow), and his [...] "Whirly Art" [...] (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India).

North Campus {{is home to the}} fraternity quads, the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities, the Technological Institute, Dearborn Observatory, and other science-related buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center. South Campus is home to the University's humanities buildings, Pick-Staiger Concert Hall and other music buildings, the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, and the sorority quads. [...] In the 1960s, the University created an additional [...] by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan.
