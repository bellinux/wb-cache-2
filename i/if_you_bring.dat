25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to go to a movie when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead {{the confidence to}} self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said [...] "the only concept that we had for this album was {{that we wanted to}} record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves." [...] According to guitarist Ed O'Brien: [...] "Everyone said, You'll sell six or seven million <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> out The Bends Pt 2, and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'." [...] A number of producers, including major figures such as Scott Litt, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a plate reverberator purchased from Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer.|$|E
500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E

2500|$|Hours {{before the}} raid, {{the head of}} the İHH, Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım, declared, [...] "We're going to defeat the Israeli commandos–we're declaring it now. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> your {{soldiers}} here, we will throw you off the ship and you'll be humiliated {{in front of the whole}} world." [...] Later, according to the crew, a group of about 40 İHH activists took over the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Officials {{said the}} {{agreement}} with Teodorin showed that the justice department's Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, {{under the auspices of}} which the probe into Teodorin had taken place, had become a key deterrent to foreign kleptocrats. [...] "These cases do send a strong message that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> your assets into our country, if you buy real estate here, we will find them. We will take them," [...] said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, then head of the justice department's criminal division. The 2014 settlement did not affect Teodorin's ability to enter the U.S., which he continued to enjoy because of his diplomatic immunity.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Carolina {{fans that}} week were {{carrying}} around a poster {{with the image}} of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail," [...] Jay McCormick said. [...] "Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. [...] After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they are your rival, they're going to do exactly what you told them not to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ashcroft {{had been}} adamant that the Verve would not re-form, once remarking: [...] "You're {{more likely to}} get all four Beatles on stage". However, after Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with McCabe over a {{possible}} side project, Ashcroft contacted McCabe and Jones, making peace with them, and the band re-formed. Tong was not asked to rejoin, so as to keep the internal issues that split the band up a decade ago to an absolute minimum. Jones explained this decision by stating: [...] "It would have been too hard, it's hard enough for the four of us. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> more people to it, it's harder to communicate and communication has always been our difficulty". On 26 June 2007, the band's reunion was announced by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1. The band, reuniting in their original line-up, announced they would tour in November 2007, and release an album in 2008. The band stated: [...] "We are getting back together for the joy of music", though they turned down a multi-album deal offer [...] "because the 'treadmill' of releasing albums and touring {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the band a decade ago".|$|E
2500|$|In Melody Maker, Adam Sweeting said [...] "The Unforgettable Fire is {{the other}} side of the coin from War. Where the latter opened with the {{shattering}} paramilitary drumbeat of 'Sunday Bloody Sunday',... Fire launches into the long shimmer of 'A Sort Of Homecoming,' whose sort-of-mystical lyric adorns the romantic maroon-and-gold sleeve. The fact is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> your established conception of U2 to this record, you'll be disappointed." [...] Kurt Loder was more critical in Rolling Stone, [...] "U2 flickers and nearly fades, its fire banked by a misconceived production strategy and occasional interludes of soggy, songless self-indulgence. This is not a 'bad' album, but neither is it the irrefutable beauty the band's fans anticipated." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau felt Bono's moralizing and [...] "wild romantic idealism" [...] proved careless, specifically on [...] "Pride" [...] and [...] "Elvis Presley and America", but concluded that those qualities work well enough for him throughout the rest of the album [...] "to make a skeptic believe temporarily in miracles". At the end of 1984, it was voted the 29th best record of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published in The Village Voice.|$|E
