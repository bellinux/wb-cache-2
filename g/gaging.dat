60|$|Carroll's courage {{failed him}} as he {{realized}} it, but {{he felt that he}} must eat and sleep before he could grapple with the situation. He would allow himself a scanty meal and a few hours' rest. While the kettle boiled, he crawled out and shortened in the cable and plied the pump. Then he went below and feasted on preserved beef and tea, <b>gaging</b> the size of each slice with anxious care, until he reluctantly laid the can aside. After that, he filled his pipe and stretching his aching limbs out on the port locker, which was comparatively dry, soon sank into heavy sleep.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gage</b> Avenue and Upper <b>Gage</b> Avenue {{are named}} after the park {{of the same name}} whose western border is bounded by <b>Gage</b> Avenue. The park was on lands sold by Robert Russel <b>Gage,</b> a descendent of William <b>Gage</b> and named in honour of the <b>Gage</b> {{families}} that descended from James <b>Gage,</b> a lumber merchant and his uncle William <b>Gage,</b> a farmer. Together James and William had farms that were the site of the Battle of Stoney Creek during the War of 1812. The wounded were treated inside their homes and they were both awarded compensation for it by the government. Originally <b>Gage</b> Avenue was called Trolley Street.|$|R
60|$|The two men sparred for a moment, <b>gaging</b> one another. Then Battling Dago Pete swung {{a vicious}} left that landed square on Billy's face.

Pete had half lowered his hands as he {{recovered}} from the blow, so sure he {{was that it would}} finish his new sparring partner, and now before he could regain his guard the mucker tore into him like a whirlwind. That single blow to the face seemed to have brought back to Billy Byrne all that he ever had known of the manly art of self-defense.|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{remembered that}} despite Stillwell's {{simplicity}} {{he was as}} deep as any of his cowboys, and {{there was absolutely no}} <b>gaging</b> him where possibilities of fun were concerned. Madeline fancied that his exaggerated talk about the cowboys' sudden craze for golf was in line with certain other remarkable tales that had lately emanated from him. Some very strange things had occurred of late, and {{it was impossible to tell}} whether or not they were accidents, mere coincidents, or deep-laid, skilfully worked-out designs of the fun-loving cowboys. Certainly there had been great fun, and at the expense of her guests, particularly Castleton. So Madeline was at a loss to know what to think about Stillwell's latest elaboration. From mere force of habit she sympathized with him and found difficulty in doubting his apparent sincerity.|$|E
60|$|After {{a little}} further conversation, his visitor left and Herbert resumed his work. On the whole, the {{interview}} had been less embarrassing than he expected, and though it was likely {{that the rest of}} his colleagues would call and expostulate, he was ready to meet them. His excuse for abandoning the project was, on the face of it, a good one; but he had no thought of giving these men, who were largely interested in the original company, a word of warning. It was undesirable that they should sell their shares until he had disposed of his. They had, he argued, the same opportunities for forecasting the course of the market and <b>gaging</b> the trend of investors' ideas as he enjoyed, and if they did not make use of them, it was their fault. The stock had reached a satisfactory premium, which was all that he had promised; he could not be expected to guarantee its remaining at the high level.|$|E

40|$|A {{device for}} {{measuring}} strain in substrates at high temperatures {{in which the}} thermally induced apparent strain is nulled is described. Two <b>gages</b> are used, one active <b>gage</b> and one compensating <b>gage.</b> Both <b>gages</b> are placed on the substrate to be gaged; the active <b>gage</b> is attached such that it responds to mechanical and thermally induced apparent strain while the compensating <b>gage</b> is attached such {{that it does not}} respond to mechanical strain and and measures only thermally induced apparent strain. A thermal blanket is placed over the two <b>gages</b> to maintain the <b>gages</b> at the same temperature. The two <b>gages</b> are wired as adjacent arms of a wheatstone bridge which nulls the thermally induced apparent strain giving a true reading of the mechanical strain in the substrate...|$|R
40|$|Choosing {{the right}} strain <b>gage</b> for a {{measurement}} application requires selecting <b>gages</b> {{with the right}} characteristics for the job. In general, the strain <b>gage</b> {{is to be used}} to measure the strain {{at the center of the}} <b>gage,</b> but it inherently underestimates the peak strain when it is mounted in high stress gradient areas. This paper concerns itself with the averaging effects of a strain <b>gage</b> along <b>gage</b> filaments. The approach is unconventional in dealing with the orientation and size of the <b>gage.</b> The results provide insight into the averaging effect and selecting <b>gages</b> for measuring strains in areas of steep strain gradients. Dimensionless curves which can be used to estimate errors as well as enhance hole-drilling method results are presented. Practical recommendations are made for selecting <b>gages</b> for high strain gradient measurements...|$|R

40|$|The S/N {{fatigue life}} <b>gage</b> {{is a small}} sensor which is similar in {{appearance}} to a foil strain <b>gage.</b> The S/N fatigue life <b>gage</b> is bonded {{to the surface of}} a mechanical structure using standard strain-gage techniques. The S/N <b>gage</b> changes resistance permanently as a continuous function of fatigue experience. This <b>gage</b> was developed by Mr. Darrell R. Harting of the Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington. The <b>gage</b> is produced commercially by Micro-Measurements, Inc. and distributed by W. T. Bean, Inc., Detroit, Michigan. This investigation describes the results of a series of reverse bending tests on S/N fatigue life <b>gages</b> which were mounted on Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V titanium specimens. Each S/N <b>gage</b> was subjected to various constant strain loadings for varying numbers of cycles. The results of this investigation show that the performance of the S/N fatigue <b>gage</b> under random cyclic loading is predictable. Another result of the tests indicates that the S/N <b>gage</b> experiences an above normal increase in resistance well in advance of actual <b>gage</b> failure. Finally it was observed that a decrease in S/N <b>gage</b> resistance will occur: immediately after the mean cyclic strain level is lowered; and whenever the <b>gage</b> is subjected to any substantial rest period.
