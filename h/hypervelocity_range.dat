40|$|We {{develop an}} optimal {{transportation}} meshfree (OTM) method for simulating general solid and fluid flows, including fluid–structure interaction. The method combines concepts from optimal transportation theory with material-point sampling and max-ent meshfree interpolation. The proposed OTM method generalizes the Benamou–Brenier differential formulation of optimal mass transportation problems to problems including arbitrary geometries and constitutive behavior. The OTM method enforces mass transport and essential boundary conditions exactly and is free from tension instabilities. The OTM method exactly conserves linear and angular momentum and its convergence characteristics are verified in standard benchmark problems.

40|$|AbstractLarge scale {{three-dimensional}} numerical {{simulations of}} hypervelocity impact of Aluminum alloy 6061 -T 6 plates by Nylon 6 / 6 cylindrical projectile {{have been performed}} using the Optimal Transportation Meshfree (OTM) method of Li et al. [7] along with the seizing contact and variational material point failure algorithm [17, 18]. The dynamic response of the Al 6061 -T 6 plate including phase transition in the high strain rate, high pressure and high temperature regime expected in our numerical analysis is described {{by the use of}} a variational thermomechanical coupling constitutive model with SESAME equation of state, rate-dependent J 2 plasticity with power law hardening and thermal softening and temperature dependent Newtonian viscosity. A polytropic type of equation of state fit to in-house ReaxFF calculations is employed to model the Nylon 6 / 6 projectile under extreme conditions.

In support of the analysis, we have conducted experiments over a range of plate thicknesses of [0. 5, 3. 0] mm, a range of impact velocities of [5. 0, 7. 0]km/s and a range of obliquities of [0, 70]o at Caltech's Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> <b>Range</b> (SPHIR) Facility.

Hypervelocity impact is a rising concern in spacecraft missions where man-made debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) and meteoroids {{are capable of}} compromising or depleting the structural integrity of spacecraft. To address these concerns, the goal of current research is to experimentally investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for deformation and damage evolution during hypervelocity impact utilizing Caltech/JPL's Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> Impact <b>Range</b> (SPHIR) facility.

Specific aims are to establish the feasibility of the protocol and its basic properties, including the tightness of the predictions afforded by the protocol. The assessment {{is based on an}} application to terminal ballistics and a specific system configuration consisting of 6061 -T 6 aluminum plates struck by spherical 440 c stainless steel projectiles at ballistic impact speeds in the range of 2. 4 – 2. 8 km/s. The system's inputs are the plate thickness, plate obliquity and impact velocity. The perforation area is chosen as the sole performance measure of the system. The objective of the UQ analysis is to certify the lethality of the projectile, i. e., that the projectile perforates the plate with high probability over a prespecified range of impact velocities, plate thicknesses and plate obliquities. All tests were conducted at Caltech's Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> <b>Range</b> (SPHIR), which houses a two-stage gas gun. A feature of this facility is that the impact velocity, while amenable to precise measurement, cannot be controlled precisely but varies randomly according to a known probability density function. In addition, due to a competition between petalling and plugging mechanisms for the material system under consideration, the measured perforation area exhibits considerable scatter. The analysis establishes the feasibility of the XDoD UQ protocol as a rigorous yet practical approach for model-based certification of complex systems characterized by uncontrollable inputs and noisy experimental data...|$|E

Spherical projectiles are common shape {{used to study}} impact of space debris on spacecraft structures or shielding system. However, real space debris which {{is a threat to}} spacecraft {{is not likely to be}} spherical. There is a need to study the influence of projectile shape as non-spherical shapes may cause greater damage to spacecraft than spherical projectiles with same impact conditions. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of projectile shapes focusing on impact velocity in <b>hypervelocity</b> <b>range</b> by numerical simulations. The geometrical shapes of projectiles that were simulated are sphere, cylinder and cube. Projectiles and targets are made of aluminium, 2024. All projectiles have equivalent mass hence equivalent impact energy The impact velocities are 3 km/s, 5 km/s, 7 km/s and 9 km/s. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is applied. The shapes of debris clouds, velocities of debris clouds, residual velocity of projectiles, dimension of target hole after impact, impact induced stress and target failure modes are investigated and compared between different projectile shapes. Shapes of debris clouds generated by impact of cylindrical and cubic projectiles have spike-like in frontal area of the debris clouds, which do not exist in that of spherical projectile. Velocities of debris clouds generated by the impacts of cylindrical and cubic projectiles are higher than that of spherical projectile in hypervelocity impact range, i. e. higher than 5 km/s. The conventional spherical projectile is not the most dangerous case of space debris. With equivalent mass, a cylindrical projectile, with length-to-diameter ratio equal to 1, is more lethal than a spherical projectile. A cubic projectile is more lethal than a spherical projectile and cylindrical projectile, with length-to-diameter ratio equal to 1 and with an equivalent mass. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of new methods of producing hypersonic wind-tunnel flows at increasing velocities {{during the last few}} decades is reviewed with attention to airbreathing propulsion, hypervelocity aerodynamics and superorbital aerodynamics. The role of chemical reactions in these flows leads to use of a binary scaling simulation parameter, which can be related to the Reynolds number, and which demands that smaller wind tunnels require higher reservoir pressure levels for simulation of flight phenomena. The use of combustion heated vitiated wind tunnels for propulsive research is discussed, as well as the use of reflected shock tunnels for the same purpose. A flight experiment validating shock-tunnel results is described, and relevant developments in shock tunnel instrumentation are outlined.

40|$|AbstractThe Caltech Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> Impact <b>Range</b> (SPHIR Facility) {{utilizes}} a two-stage, {{light gas}} gun to accelerate Nylon 6 / 6 right cylinders (d = 1. 8 mm, L/D= 1, 5. 5 mg) and spheres (d = 1. 8 mm, 3. 6 mg) to impact speeds of 5 km/s and above. The projectiles impact aluminum 6061 -T 6 plate targets. An optical technique {{was employed to}} produce images of the hypervelocity impact event with short exposure times (20 ns) and short inter-frame times (< 1 μs). The technique uses coherent illumination, orthogonal to the projectile flight direction, to provide a series of shadowgraph images of {{the impact on the}} target. An expanded beam from a 532 nm continuous wave laser is used as the illumination source. The beam is expanded to illuminate a 10 cm diameter area and is then directed to a gated, intensified high-speed CCD camera. The front ejecta and debris clouds created behind the target are simultaneously imaged with this system. An edge-finding algorithm has been developed to provide a consistent method for identifying the position of the debris-front in sequential images. This technique enables a regular method to investigate the debris cloud evolution and to characterize its asymmetrical features. Furthermore, with the Laser Side-lighting system atmospheric waves emanating from the impact site are also visible. Increasing the atmospheric pressure in the target chamber (above the nominal 1. 5 Torr) significantly increases the observable features of these shock waves. The behaviour of these waves provides an improved understanding of the temporal sequence of the impact phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{uncertainties}} in the gas-surface interaction model, intermolecular interaction model and high temperature reaction {{rates on the}} prediction of aerothermodynamic properties of hypersonic flows are studied. The uncertainties in the input parameters are propagated through the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions using the non-intrusive generalized polynomial chaos (gPCE) method. It is shown that gPCE expansion with just three flowfield samples can reconstruct output mean, standard deviation, skewness and probability distribution function with an accuracy equivalent to the Monte Carlo (MC) random sampling methods with ten million samples. Flows generated by hypersonic leading edges and Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> Impact <b>Range</b> (SPHIR) projectiles are considered in this study. ^ In the hypersonic flow leading edge study, the considered input uncertainties are the accommodation coefficient, surface temperature and the viscosity exponent. The effect of the input uncertainties are quantified by computing produced uncertainties in the flowfield temperature, flowfield density, surface shear, pressure and heat flux. It is shown that surface fluxes and flowfields in the hypersonic boundary layer are {{more sensitive to the}} accommodation coefficient than the surface temperature or the viscosity exponent uncertainty. An input uncertainty of 19 % in the accommodation coefficient results in a 20 % uncertainty in the flowfield temperature at Mach 10 and 31 % uncertainty at Mach 20. ^ Uncertainties introduced near the leading edge have greater effect that those introduced further downstream. It is also shown that the effect of most input uncertainties increase with Mach number. Uncertainties in the N 2 dissociation reaction rate, O 2 dissociation reaction rate and two NO exchange reaction rates are considered in a Mach 23 flow around a 2 mm SPHIR projectile. This study reveals that the shock front is most sensitive to input uncertainties. In the flowfield, away from the shock front, atomic nitrogen and nitric oxide are most sensitive to uncertainties in the four reaction rates. ...|$|R
40|$|New in situ {{diagnostic}} {{capabilities and}} improvements {{made to the}} previously reported 1. 8 mm bore, two-stage light-gas gun facility located at the California Institute of Technology are described. The Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> Impact <b>Range</b> (SPHIR) facility is capable of routinely producing launch speeds of 5 – 7 km/s for launch package masses < 6 mg, with maximum speeds exceeding 10 km/s. The facility features a comprehensive ensemble of in situ diagnostics that are available for simultaneous implementation in every impact experiment. A fast (150, 000 fps) camera is used routinely to provide impactor velocimetry. A gated, intensified ultra-high-speed camera is {{used in conjunction with}} an optical technique to create shadowgraph images of hypervelocity impact phenomena with very short exposure times (25 ns) and inter-frame times (< 1 μs). This technique uses a constant 532 nm wavelength laser to deliver a collimated, coherent illumination beam orthogonal to the projectile flight direction that provides a 100 mm diameter maximum field of view. The ultra-high-speed camera produces 8 images with exposure and inter-frame times sufficiently short to enable sharp visualization of impact features with little motion blur at the test speeds of 5 – 7 km/s. Additionally, a debris capture system is located behind the target configuration during every experiment. This system is composed of layers of closed-cell foam and plastic film and provides depth of penetration and trajectory measurement for debris particles thrown behind the target. Lastly, the SPHIR facility utilizes two additional high-speed cameras coupled with two spectrographs to characterize the light emitted by the impact event. One spectrograph and its high-speed camera records UV–visible emission spectra in the wavelength range between 300 nm and 850 nm. The other spectrograph uses a high-speed, infrared camera to capture a single full-field image of the near-IR emission in the wavelength range of 0. 9 μm– 1. 7 μm. These two spectrograph camera systems provide both visual and spectral data of the hypervelocity impact emission; yielding information regarding the molecular composition of both the impact ejecta and debris.

40|$|Hypervelocity {{impact of}} meteoroids and orbital debris poses {{a serious and}} growing threat to spacecraft. To study {{hypervelocity}} impact phenomena, a comprehensive ensemble of real-time concurrently operated diagnostics has been developed and implemented in the Small Particle <b>Hypervelocity</b> Impact <b>Range</b> (SPHIR) facility. This suite of simultaneously operated instrumentation provides multiple complementary measurements that facilitate the characterization of many impact phenomena in a single experiment. The investigation of hypervelocity impact phenomena described in this work focuses on normal impacts of 1. 8 mm nylon 6 / 6 cylinder projectiles and variable thickness aluminum targets. The SPHIR facility two-stage light-gas gun is capable of routinely launching 5. 5 mg nylon impactors to speeds of 5 to 7 km/s. Refinement of legacy SPHIR operation procedures and the investigation of first-stage pressure have improved the velocity performance of the facility, resulting {{in an increase in}} average impact velocity of at least 0. 57 km/s. Results for the perforation area indicate the considered range of target thicknesses represent multiple regimes describing the non-monotonic scaling of target perforation with decreasing target thickness. The laser side-lighting (LSL) system has been developed to provide ultra-high-speed shadowgraph images of the impact event. This novel optical technique is demonstrated to characterize the propagation velocity and two-dimensional optical density of impact-generated debris clouds. Additionally, a debris capture system is located behind the target during every experiment to provide complementary information regarding the trajectory distribution and penetration depth of individual debris particles. The utilization of a coherent, collimated illumination source in the LSL system facilitates the simultaneous measurement of impact phenomena with near-IR and UV-vis spectrograph systems. Comparison of LSL images to concurrent IR results indicates two distinctly different phenomena. A high-speed, pressure-dependent IR-emitting cloud is observed in experiments to expand at velocities much higher than the debris and ejecta phenomena observed using the LSL system. In double-plate target configurations, this phenomena is observed to interact with the rear-wall several micro-seconds before the subsequent arrival of the debris cloud. Additionally, dimensional analysis presented by Whitham for blast waves is shown to describe the pressure-dependent radial expansion of the observed IR-emitting phenomena. Although this work focuses on a single hypervelocity impact configuration, the diagnostic capabilities and techniques described can be used {{with a wide variety of}} impactors, materials, and geometries to investigate any number of engineering and scientific problems...|$|R
40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{under this}} contract {{can be divided}} into two main areas: <b>hypervelocity</b> (in the <b>range</b> up to 7 km/s) and high velocity (less than 1 km/s). Work in the former was performed at NASA-MSFC using the Light Gas Gun Facility. The lower velocity studies were conducted at Auburn University using the ballistic gun. The emphasis of the project was on the hypervelocity phenomenon especially in the characterization of the debris cloud formed by the primary impact events. Special devices were made to determine the angular distributions of momentum and energy of the debris cloud as a function of impact conditions. After several iteration processes, it was decided to concentrate on the momentum effort. Prototype devices were designed, fabricated, and tested. These devices were based on the conservation of momentum. Distributions of the debris cloud formed were measured by determining the amount of momentum transferred from the debris cloud to strategically placed pendulum measurement devices. The motion of the pendula was monitored using itegrated opto-interrupters. The distribution of momentum in the debris cloud was found to be a strong function of the impact condition. Small projectiles at high velocities were observed to produce finely dispersed debris whereas large projectiles generated discrete particles in the debris. Results also show that the momentum in the forward direction was enhanced due to the impact. This phenomenon of momentum multiplication was also observed in other studies and in computer simulations. It was initially planned to determine the energy distribution using deformation energy in a rod with strain gauges. Results from preliminary studies show that this technique is acceptable but too tedious. A new technique was explored based on measuring the heating effect of the debris cloud using an IR camera. The feasibility and sensitivity was established at Auburn University. This type of energy distribution measurement method can easily be adapted to the gas gun facility at MSFC.

40|$|Approximately 20 sq m of {{protective}} thermal blankets, largely composed of Teflon, were retrieved from the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) after the spacecraft had spent approximately 5. 7 years in space. Examination of these blankets revealed that they contained thousands of <b>hypervelocity</b> impact features <b>ranging</b> from micron-sized craters to penetration holes several millimeters in diameter. We conducted impact experiments {{in an effort}} to reproduce such features and to [...] hopefully [...] understand the relationships between projectile size and the resulting crater or penetration-hole diameter over a wide range of impact velocity. Such relationships are needed to derive the size- and mass-frequency distribution and flux of natural and man-made particles in low-Earth orbit. Powder propellant and light-gas guns were used to launch soda-lime glass spheres of 3. 175 mm (1 / 8 inch) nominal diameter (Dp) into pure Teflon FEP targets at velocities ranging from 1 to 7 km/s. Target thickness (T) was varied over more than three orders of magnitude from infinite halfspace targets (Dp/T less than 0. 1) to very thin films (Dp/T greater than 100). Cratering and penetration of massive Teflon targets is dominated by brittle failure and the development of extensive spall zones at the target's front and, if penetrated, the target's rear side. Mass removal by spallation at the back side of Teflon targets may be so severe that the absolute penetration-hole diameter (Dh) can become larger than that of a standard crater (Dc) at relative target thicknesses of Dp/T = 0. 6 - 0. 9. The crater diameter is infinite halfspace Teflon targets increases [...] at otherwise constant impact conditions [...] with encounter velocity by a factor of V 0. 44. In contrast, the penetration-hole size is very thin foils (Dp/T greater than 50) is essentially unaffected by impact velocity. Penetrations at target thicknesses intermediate to these extremes will scale with variable exponents of V. Our experimental matrix is sufficiently systematic and complete, up to 7 km/s, to make reasonable recommendations for the velocity-scaling of Teflon craters and penetrations. We specifically suggest that cratering behavior and associated equations dominate all impacts in which the shock-pulse duration of the projectile (tp) is shorter than that of the target (tt). We also demonstrate that each penetration hole from space-retrieved surfaces may be assigned a unique projectile size, provided an impact velocity is known or assumed. This calibration seems superior to the traditional ballistic-limit approach...|$|R
