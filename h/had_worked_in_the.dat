5|$|For Your Eyes Only {{marked a}} change in the {{production}} crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.|$|E
5|$|The Teochew dialect {{became the}} lingua franca among the Chinese {{in many parts}} of Johor and Riau, as the {{majority}} of the Chinese from these areas were of Teochew origin, many of whom were descended from the Chinese coolies who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gambier and pepper plantations. The Teochews form the second-largest dialect group among Chinese Singaporeans, and many families can trace their family ancestry to immigrants who were Kangchu or coolies in these plantations.|$|E

5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed {{a little bit in}} 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E
5|$|American {{businessman}} and philanthropist Armand Hammer, {{well known to}} the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with 2,300 pounds of medical supplies that were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, {{and the other half}} were his own personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Bowie portrayed {{physicist}} Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's film The Prestige (2006), {{which was}} about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century. In the same year, he voice-acted in the animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais television series Extras. In 2007, he lent his voice to the character Lord Royal Highness in the SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis television film. In the 2008 film August, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, alongside Josh Hartnett and Rip Torn, with whom he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1976 film The Man Who Fell to Earth.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Burnham oversaw {{and led the}} Northern Territories British South Africa Exploration Company {{expedition}} {{that first}} established for the British South Africa Company that major copper deposits existed north of the Zambezi in North-Eastern Rhodesia. Along the Kafue River, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets. After this expedition he was elected {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society. Later, the British South Africa Company built the mining towns of the Copperbelt and a railroad to transport the ore through Portuguese Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo {{when she had}} thought {{he was about to}} die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E
5|$|In the Republican primary on March 16, McEwen faced trade lawyer Rob Portman, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House under President George H. W.

Dorsey, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and township trustee in Hamilton County's Anderson Township; and Ku Klux Klan leader Van Darrell Loman of Cheviot. Three other candidates filed and qualified but withdrew from the primary, former Madeira mayor Mary Anne Christie; Lebanon attorney Bruce Gudenkauf, a member of the Warren County Republican Party's central committee; and Donnie Jones, city auditor in Norwood.|$|E

5|$|The expedition's {{scientific}} staff {{consisted of}} six persons, including Bruce. The zoologist was David Wilton who, like Bruce, {{had been a}} member of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition. He had acquired skiing and sledging skills during several years living in northern Russia. Robert Rudmose-Brown, of University College, Dundee, and formerly an assistant in the Botany Department at the British Museum, was the party's botanist. Dr James Harvie Pirie, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Challenger office under John Murray, was geologist, bacteriologist, and the expedition's medical officer. Robert Mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work, and Alastair Ross, a medical student, was taxidermist.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{issues with the}} {{promotion}} of the film: promotional material in the form of teaser posters created by Bob Peak, based on the Licence Revoked title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli, had been produced, but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed 'Licence Revoked' to be a common American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence. The delayed, corrected advertising by Steven Chorney, in the traditional style, limited the film's pre-release screenings. MGM also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive Don Smolen – who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publicity campaign for eight Bond films before – emphasising the rougher content of the movie.|$|E
5|$|This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but {{the first of a}} series of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.|$|E

5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E
5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from {{the fact that he did}} not speak French, at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long, while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E
5|$|In an {{arrangement}} that predates the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a District Attorney independent of the mayor's office. Dilworth had been elected to the office in 1951 but resigned in 1955 to run for mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman and former assistant district attorney, was elected to fill the unexpired term. Blanc was a veteran of both World Wars who, during his time on the council, led an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. In 1957, he ran for a full four-year term, but his connection with machine politics led Clark and Dilworth to withhold their endorsement of him. The Republican nominee was Emil F. Goldhaber, a local lawyer who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state attorney general's office and in private practice. He was unopposed in the primary. The split in the Democratic leadership made the district attorney's race the liveliest of the campaign, according to Philadelphia Inquirer writer Joseph H. Miller.|$|E
