50|$|Oliveira {{then made}} his most ambitious film to that date, The Satin Slipper (Le Soulier de Satin), {{based on the}} notorious 1929 epic play by Paul Claudel, which is rarely {{performed}} in its entirety due to its length. The seven-hour film took Oliveira two years to complete. It was Oliveira's first film in French, {{as well as his}} first film with actor Luís Miguel Cintra, who would go on to act in all of his films from then on. The story of The Satin Slipper is about the unrequited love of sixteenth-century conquistador Don Rodrigue and nobelwoman Dona Prouheze with the backdrop of colonialism in Africa and the Americas. The film opens with a theater gradually being <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> an <b>audience</b> and an introduction to the film on stage. The film itself uses very theatrical set pieces, such as cardboard waves and backdrops. The film was never released theatrically, but was screened at both the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and the 1985 Venice Film Festival, where Oliveira received a special Golden Lion for his career up to that point. Later the Brussels Cinematheque awarded the film its L'Âge d'or Prize.|$|R

In the course of the evening, Mrs. Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr. Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it was true.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 Oliveira {{made one}} of his most {{experimental}} films, My Case (Mon Cas), partially based on José Régio's one act play O Meu Caso, although the film also takes inspiration from Samuel Beckett's Fizzles and the Book of Job. Oliveira takes a surreal and meta-narrative approach {{to examine the relationship between}} art and life. The film begins with a theater being <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the <b>audience</b> and actors before a play is about to begin. A mysterious man play by Luis Miguel Cintra enters the stage and presents [...] "his case" [...] about the fallacies of theater and its illusions. One by one all of the play's actors and technicians state their cases about what bothers them about the play and its relation to their own lives. An audience member then takes the stage to make a case for what the collective audience wants. This is followed by three consecutive but very different versions of the one act play: the first is a straightforward farce, the second is presented as a slapstick silent movie, and the third is performed with the dialogue read backwards. The stage performance ends with video footage of war and disasters from around the world and Pablo Picasso's painting Guernica. The entire film then shifts to a retelling of the Book of Job, with Cintra as Job and Bulle Ogier as his wife. This sequence ends with a close-up of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. My Case opened the 1986 Venice Film Festival and was released in 1987.|$|R

60|$|The first {{character}} of propriety the Lawsuit possesses in an eminent degree. The {{plot of the}} play is an iniquitous suit; {{there can be no}} fitter persons to be concerned in the active part of it than low, necessitous lawyers of bad character, and profligates of desperate fortune. On the other hand, in the passive part, if an honest and virtuous man had been made the object of their designs, or a weak man of good intentions, every successful step they should take against him ought rather to <b>fill</b> the <b>audience</b> <b>with</b> horror than pleasure and mirth; and if in the conclusion their plots should be baffled, even this would come too late to prevent that ill impression. But in the Lawsuit this is admirably avoided: for the character chosen is a rich, avaricious usurer: the pecuniary distresses of such a person can never be looked upon with horror; and if he should be even handled unjustly, we always wait his delivery with patience.|$|R

From the 1930s to the 1950s, the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies. After Stanley Kubrick's landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously.

50|$|And {{then came}} the Russian Revolution, {{on top of the}} ongoing {{international}} War. <b>With</b> <b>audiences</b> turning against the Tsar, film producers began turning out, after the February Revolution, a number of films with anti-Tsarist themes. These, along with the usual retinue of detective films and melodramas, filled theaters when the streets were not <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> revolutionaries. However, the destruction of the infrastructure in the major cities, the failing war-drained economy, the takeover of rural cinemas by local Soviets, and the aversion of some in the film industry to communism, caused the Russian film industry per se to effectively die out by the time Lenin on November 8, 1917 proclaimed a new country, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.|$|R

The film was also notable in introducing Grable as the pinup favorite to the troops as well as giving her dramatic scenes that expanded her range; a crying scene reportedly took over six hours to film. When released in September 1941, A Yank in the R.A.F. was a popular film <b>with</b> <b>audiences</b> and critics alike.

50|$|Sol Smith Russell is {{a general}} {{favourite}} wherever he goes and his engagements are invariably successful ones. Toronto is no {{exception to the rule}} and always turns out good audiences to see and hear him. Last evening the Grand Opera House was well <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> an <b>audience</b> that went away delighted with Mr. Russell’s new comedy “Pa” by Cal Wallace. The play is a highly amusing one, somewhat of the farcical order, witty in dialogue and full of comical situations. It portrays the adventures of an old gentleman, Perkimen Guinney or “Pa,” who has three daughters, two marriageable and one who thinks she is. “Pa” is the legal guardian of a dog to which a small fortune was bequeathed by its owner, and he seeks to add to his pecuniary advantage in this respect by marrying one of his daughters to a loony medical student whose father is millionaire. Many absurd situations arise out of this scheme and “Pa” finds himself as a rule, in a sea of difficulties, which however, he safely crosses in the end, and all is happiness and joy. It is needless to say that Mr. Russell is the life of the piece, and those who have seen him before need not be told that while he is on stage the house is kept in continual laughter. His comicalities are never exaggerated, but they never fail to excite the utmost merriment. His power of facial expression is wonderful and the imitations which he gave were very true to nature. A recitation of a rural idyll also was enthusiastically applauded, and his songs met with equal favour. It may safely be said that the quaint humour of Mr. Russell’s acting is inimitable. His company is a very good one. The four ladies take their parts well, as do the gentleman. Miss Emma Hagger’s dancing won her an encore, and Frank Lawton proved himself wonderfully agile in the same line. The whistling of the latter with banjo accompaniment brought down the house. “Pa” is very funny and should draw crowded houses. It will be repeated this evening and at both performances to-morrow.|$|R
