5000|$|Chemical {{alternatives}} assessment (or {{substitution of}} hazardous chemicals) {{is the use}} of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b> Safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals may simply be other chemical substances, or may involve deeper changes in material or product design. Chemical alternatives assessment aims to provide the basis for well-informed decision-making by thoroughly characterizing chemicals and materials (and other design options) across a wide range of environmental and health impact categories. The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a carcinogenic chemical with a neurotoxic one), and to minimize the unintended consequences of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance—in other words, to prevent [...] "regrettable substitutions", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. This {{study was}} {{launched}} because of alarming conditions in laboratories {{and lack of}} general occupational health and safety. Employees are exposed {{to a number of}} chemicals for extended periods of time, and these employees aren't completely informed of the risks involved in working with the hazardous substances. There is a general lack of awareness and concern about employee health and safety in the workplace, especially in laboratories. In this study personal and environmental sampling was conducted in three subject groups with the highest potential risk. With the sampling employee or environmental exposure to ten chemicals could be quantified. Questionnaires were used to assess employee as well as health and safety representative's general knowledge of occupational health and safety. In the course of this study it was found that employees are exposed to low concentrations {{of a wide variety of}} chemicals during the workday. The exposure to a combination of chemicals leads to an exceedingly high concentration of overall volatile organic substances. The exposure to these low concentrations takes place over a number of years for permanent employees. During the workday employees are also exposed to short periods of very high concentrations of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b> These short term exposure levels are complicated to compare with international standards because of the lack of standards available. 'Therefore it is difficult to determine if an employee's exposure does exceed the international limits, and therefore it is difficult to control or prevent this short term exposure. The long term exposure to these <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> may lead to serious detrimental health effects, which often only develop years after exposure occurred. The biggest concern for employees working with <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> is depression of the nervous system and development of cancer. To prevent these negative health effects it is important to control or minimize employee exposure to <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> during the workday. The institution should launch a thorough investigation to determine employee exposure of the various chemicals during the eight hour workday, but also during the short term exposure periods. Control measiures such as ventilation systems or fume cupboards should be installed or repaired to provide adequate control to minimize employee exposure. Master...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} and processing of various chemicals {{and raw materials}} {{all around the world}} currently exceeds hundreds of millions of tonnes a year and is constantly growing. In addition, the spectre of produced materials is increasing, including relatively toxic compounds. It is absolutely clear that such production volumes lead to a risk of accidents with the leakage of chemical toxicants, and [...] depending on the toxicity of the relevant substances [...] these accidents represent a serious threat for human health, animals and the environment. Disasters involving chemicals drew public attention already in the 20 th century, when ways were sought to guarantee the safety of production, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. This is also an essential prerequisite for the occurrence of an accident involving the leakage of chemical toxicants [...] the presence of such toxicants in the production, processing, storage or transportation. Whether during wars or in peacetime, there are situations when large numbers of people can be exposed to the effects of a wide spectre of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> (NCHL). These situations include military operations, campaigns by the integrated rescue system (IZS), industrial accidents or acts of terror. In developed industrial countries, the capacities used for the production, storage, processing and transportation of NCHL are usually localized in urban industrial zones. The high concentrations of these <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> within these zones represent a potential health risk for the people nearby. Chemical safety is a challenge and a must. I find this issue attractive and therefore decided to analyse, in my thesis, the causes of mass chemical intoxication and their consequences on the affected population.
