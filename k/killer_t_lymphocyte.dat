In this study we used pharmacologic inhibitors to investigate the role of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein kinase C (PKC) in this process. The PTK-inhibitors herbimycin A, genistein, and methyl 2, 5 -dihydroxycinnamate blocked anti-CD 3 -activated <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> (AK-T) lymphocyte-mediated killing of tumour target cells. The PKC-inhibitors staurosporine, calphostin C, and myristoylated PKC pseudosubstrate peptide, as well as PKC desensitization by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate pretreatment, also suppressed the cytolytic effector function of AK-T lymphocytes. Lack of tumoricidal activity was not due to reduced AK-T lymphocyte binding to tumour target cells but was associated with the abrogation of granule exocytosis, indicating that PTK and PKC are involved in the postbinding process which results in delivery of the `lethal hit' by AK-T lymphocytes. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

We analyzed immune cell populations in the liver and several lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow in Parp 2 -deficient mice to better define the role of PARP proteins in liver immunity and inflammation at steady state and during ConA-induced hepatitis. We show that 1) the genetic inactivation of Parp 2, but not Parp 1, protected mice from ConA hepatitis without deregulating cytokine expression and leucocyte recruitment; 2) cellularity was lower in the thymus, but not in spleen, liver, or bone marrow of Parp 2 -/- mice; 3) spleen and liver iNKT lymphocytes, as well as thymic <b>T</b> and NKT <b>lymphocytes</b> were reduced in Parp 2 knockout mice.

As a promising alternative, we obtained sustained mouse iNKT cell responses associated with prolonged antitumor effects through repeated administrations of tumor-targeted recombinant sCD 1 d-antitumor scFv fusion proteins loaded with αGC. Here, we demonstrate that CD 1 d fusion proteins bound to tumor cells via the antibody fragment specific for a tumor-associated antigen, efficiently activate human iNKT cell lines leading to potent tumor cell lysis. The importance of CD 1 d tumor targeting was confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in which only the specific tumor-targeted CD 1 d fusion protein resulted in tumor inhibition of well-established aggressive tumor grafts. The therapeutic efficacy correlated with the repeated activation of iNKT and natural killer cells marked by their release of TH 1 cytokines, despite the up-regulation of the co-inhibitory receptor PD- 1. Our results demonstrate the superiority of providing the superagonist αGC loaded on recombinant CD 1 d proteins and support the use of αGC/sCD 1 d-antitumor fusion proteins to secure a sustained human and mouse iNKT cell activation, while targeting their cytotoxic activity and cytokine release to the tumor site...|$|R

Human leukocyte antigen class 1 molecules bind antigenic peptides for cell surface presentation to cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> HLA-B 27 binds and presents peptides from influenza, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and other viruses.

Although many theories have been proposed to explain the role of HLA-B 27 in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathy, we favour those postulating that the pathogenic role of HLA-B 27 stems from its natural function. For example, the 'arthritogenic' peptide hypothesis suggests that disease results from the ability of HLA-B 27 to bind a unique peptide or a set of antigenic peptides. Additionally, a number of lines of evidence from our laboratory and other laboratories have suggested that HLA-B 27 has unusual cell biology.

The {{purpose of this}} work was to evaluate cell profiles and lymphocyte phenotypes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and to correlate them with depression in lung function tests detected by depletion of diffusing capacity (DlCO). BAL {{was carried out in}} 25 untreated, non-smoking patients suffering from diffuse scleroderma and in 12 healthy non-smoking volunteers. For the analysis of lymphocyte sub-sets flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies were used. The following cell sub-types were counted: <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> B lymphocytes, helper lymphocytes, suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes, natural <b>killer</b> cells, cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and activated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> The total cell count was higher in the group of patients with mild and moderate impairment in DlCO. The percentage of lymphocytes was greater in patients with DlCO lower than 65 % of the predicted value since neutrophilia was found in patients with severe DlCO depletion, i. e. significant when compared with healthy subjects. The proportions of suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes and of activated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were higher in patients than in controls. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences between patients with moderate and mild changes in DlCO and the healthy volunteers. A decreased helper/suppressor ratio was noticed in these patients. We concluded that the BALF lymphocyte phenotype analysis may reflect the features of alveolitis in patients with SSc...|$|R
40|$|Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) {{is caused}} by genetic defects in {{cytotoxic}} granule components or their fusion machinery, leading to impaired natural <b>killer</b> cell and/or <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> degranulation and/or cytotoxicity. This may accumulate into a life-threatening condition known as macrophage activation syndrome. STXBP 2, also known as MUNC 18 - 2, has recently been identified as the disease-causing gene in FHL type 5 (FHL- 5). A role for STXBP 2 in neutrophils, and for neutrophils in FHL in general, has not been documented thus far. Here, we report that FHL- 5 neutrophils have a profound defect in granule mobilization, resulting in inadequate bacterial killing, in particular, of gram-negative Escherichia coli, but not of Staphylococcus aureus, which rather depends on intact reduced NAD phosphate oxidase activity. This impairment of bacterial killing {{may contribute to the}} apparent susceptibility to gastrointestinal tract inflammation in patients with FHL-...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective There is {{substantial}} inter-individual {{diversity in the}} susceptibility of alcoholics to liver injury. Alterations of intestinal microbiota (IM) {{have been reported in}} alcoholic liver disease (ALD), but {{the extent to which they}} are merely a consequence or a cause is unknown. We aimed to demonstrate that a specific dysbiosis contributes to the development of alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Design We humanised germ-free and conventional mice using human IM transplant from alcoholic patients with or without AH. The consequences on alcohol-fed recipient mice were studied. Results A specific dysbiosis was associated with ALD severity in patients. Mice harbouring the IM from a patient with severe AH (sAH) developed more severe liver inflammation with an increased number of liver <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subsets and Natural <b>Killer</b> <b>T</b> (NKT) <b>lymphocytes,</b> higher liver necrosis, greater intestinal permeability and higher translocation of bacteria than mice harbouring the IM from an alcoholic patient without AH (noAH). Similarly, CD 45 + lymphocyte subsets were increased in visceral adipose tissue, and CD 4 +T and NKT lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes. The IM associated with sAH and noAH could be distinguished by differences in bacterial abundance and composition. Key deleterious species were associated with sAH while the Faecalibacterium genus was associated with noAH. Ursodeoxycholic acid was more abundant in faeces from noAH mice. Additionally, in conventional mice humanised with the IM from an sAH patient, a second subsequent transfer of IM from an noAH patient improved alcohol-induced liver lesions. Conclusions Individual susceptibility to ALD {{is substantial}}ly driven by IM. It may, therefore, be possible to prevent and manage ALD by IM manipulation...|$|R
30|$|Escape from immune-mediated tumor {{destruction}} {{has been}} recognized as a hallmark of cancer [47]. Zitvogel et al. and Wolfers et al. were the first researchers to show the relationship between EVs derived from cancer cells and the immune system, and many studies have since confirmed this relationship [48, 49]. In the tumor microenvironment, immune cells, such as macrophages, natural <b>killer</b> cells, <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and B lymphocytes, interact with tumor cells and regulate tumorigenesis and progression. It has been acknowledged that tumor progression is partly related {{to the extent of}} immune dysfunction, and emerging data indicate that EVs are a novel contributor to the immune modulation. EVs derived from cancer mostly have immunosuppressive effects that support tumor progression and metastasis. For instance, Kim et al. have shown that EVs from oral cancer patient sera contain FasL and induce apoptosis in Jurkat and CD 8 + T cell [50]. Myeloid-derived-suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been identified as a population of immature myeloid cells with the ability to suppress T cell activation, contributing to cancer proliferation [51]. Chalmin et al. found that heat shock protein 72 (Hsp 72) expressed on tumor-derived EVs triggers STAT 3 activation in MDSCs through toll-like receptor 2, inducing their immunosuppressive activity [52].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Innate {{recognition}} {{is essential in}} the antiviral response against infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV). Chemokines are important for control of HSV via recruitment of natural <b>killer</b> cells, <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and antigen-presenting cells. We previously found that early HSV- 1 -mediated chemokine responses are not dependent on TLR 2 and TLR 9 in human macrophages. Here, we investigated {{the role of the}} recently identified innate IFN-inducible DNA receptor IFI 16 during HSV- 1 infection in human macrophages. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from buffy coats and monocytes were differentiated to macrophages. Macrophages infected with HSV- 1 were analyzed using siRNA-mediated knock-down of IFI 16 by real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting. Results We determined that both CXCL 10 and CCL 3 are induced independent of HSV- 1 replication. IFI 16 mediates CCL 3 mRNA accumulation during early HSV- 1 infection. In contrast, CXCL 10 was induced independently of IFI 16. Conclusions Our data provide the first evidence of HSV- 1 -induced innate immune responses via IFI 16 in human primary macrophages. In addition, the data suggest that at least one additional unidentified receptor or innate sensing mechanism is involved in recognizing HSV- 1 prior to viral replication. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cells expressing {{markers of}} both natural <b>killer</b> and <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (NK <b>T</b> cells) in humans and mice express a {{restricted}} T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, are of CD 4 - CD 8 - or CD 4 + CD 8 - phenotype, and upon anti-CD 3 stimulation secrete {{large amounts of}} interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). NK T cells may be {{the primary source of}} IL- 4 -promoting T helper type 2 (Th 2) responses and/or they might be involved in regulating the balance between Th 1 - and Th 2 -type immune responses, and may consequently affect susceptibility to autoimmune diseases associated with a skewed Th phenotype. We show that rat NK T cells selectively proliferate to IL- 2, and use this fact to analyse cytokine production by NK T cells in two rat strains differentially susceptible to Th 1 - or Th 2 -type autoimmune diseases. Analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that, in contrast to mouse, rat NK T cells secrete exclusively IFN-gamma and not IL- 4 after anti-CD 3 stimulation, and use a wider TCR-Vbeta repertoire, suggesting that rat NK T cells are not essential for the development of Th 2 -type CD 4 + T-cell responses...|$|R
