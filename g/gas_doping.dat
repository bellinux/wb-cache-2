A polycrystalline rod of ultra-pure electronic grade silicon is passed through an RF heating coil, which creates a localized molten zone from which the crystal ingot grows. A seed crystal is used at one end in order to start the growth. The whole process is carried out in an evacuated chamber or in an inert gas purge.

As {{the main}} {{substrates}} materials for solar cell, Czochralskisilicon (CZ-Si) has more crystal defects, higher impurities content and so on, which limit the further improvement of conversion efficiency (η). Floating zone melting silicon (FZ-Si) has excellent performance but the feed rod cost is much higher, {{so it is}} hardly used for solar cell widely. To solve this problem, we developed CFZ silicon monocrystal (CFZ-Si). First the poly was made into poly rod withΦ 110 ~Φ 130 mm by CZ process and then made into CFZ-Si by FZ method. During FZ process, the resistivity is controlled by <b>gas</b> <b>doping</b> and the process is adjustable. CFZ-Si combines advantages of CZ-Si with FZ-Si.

We try to maximize light trapping by {{the evaluation of the}} use of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and BR for high efficiency. It was verified that the configuration of SnO 2 :F front TCO and ZnO:B BR shows better optical properties than typical configurations for light trapping due to its high transparency at the front and high haze at the back. In addition, we noticed that the absorption of the BR has a strong influence on the solar modules. We obtained a superior ZnO:B BR with high haze and low absorption by controlling the <b>doping</b> <b>gas</b> ratio (B 2 H 6 /DEZ). As the <b>doping</b> <b>gas</b> ratio of ZnO:B BR decreases, the haze increases due to a rougher surface morphology, and the absorption decreases due to reduced free carrier absorption. The solar modules with a ZnO:B BR in a lower <b>doping</b> <b>gas</b> ratio show relatively higher Pmax for the same i-μc-Si layer thickness. This results from an increased Isc due to higher haze and lower absorption. In addition, the ZnO:B BR with a low <b>doping</b> <b>gas</b> ratio was found to be effective in reducing the i-μc-Si layer thickness because there are more chances for trapping the light at the i-μc-Si layer. We could reduce the i-μc-Si layer thickness by about 28 % for the equivalent Pmax level by lowering the <b>doping</b> <b>gas</b> ratio.
