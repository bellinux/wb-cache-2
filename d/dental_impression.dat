2500|$|The {{process of}} {{fabricating}} a denture usually {{begins with an}} initial <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. Standard impression materials are used during the process. The initial impression is {{used to create a}} simple stone model that represents the maxillary and mandibular arches of the patient's mouth. This is not a detailed impression at this stage. Once the initial impression is taken, the stone model is used to create a 'Custom Impression Tray' which is used to take a second and much more detailed and accurate impression of the patient's maxillary and mandibular ridges. Polyvinylsiloxane impression material is one of several very accurate impression materials used when the final impression is taken of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. [...] A wax rim is fabricated to assist the dentist or denturist in establishing the vertical dimension of occlusion. [...] After this, a bite registration is created to marry the position of one arch to the other.|$|E
2500|$|The verb form [...] "stenting" [...] {{was used}} for centuries to {{describe}} the process of stiffening garments (a usage long obsolete, per the Oxford English Dictionary) and some believe {{this to be the}} origin. According to the Merriam Webster Third New International Dictionary, the noun evolved from the Middle English verb stenten, shortened from extenten, meaning to stretch, which in turn came from Latin extentus, past participle of extendere, to stretch out. Others attribute the noun [...] "stent" [...] to Jan F. Esser, a Dutch plastic surgeon who in 1916 used the word to describe a <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> compound invented in 1856 by the English dentist Charles Stent (18071885), whom Esser employed to craft a form for facial reconstruction. The full account is described in the Journal of the History of Dentistry. [...] According to the author, from the use of Stent's compound as a support for facial tissues evolved the use of a stent to hold open various bodily structures.|$|E
50|$|In dentistry, {{syneresis}} is {{the expulsion}} of water or other liquid molecules from <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> materials (Alginate for example) after an impression has been taken. Due to this process, the impression shrinks a little and therefore its size is no longer accurate. For this reason, many <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> companies strongly recommend to pour the dental cast {{as soon as possible}} to prevent distortion of the dimension of the teeth and objects in the impression.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Legal Dentistry {{encourages}} {{the use of}} multiple <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> to create a “dental lineup”, similar to a suspect lineup used to identify alleged perpetrators of crime. Currently, <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> collected as evidence are compared only to those collected from a given suspect, which may bias the resulting outcome. Using multiple <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> in a lineup may enable forensic odontologists to significantly decrease the current bias in matching bite marks to the teeth of a suspect. The organization BOLD also supports the creation of a database of dental records, which could help in verifying dental uniqueness. This database could be created using criminal records or possibly all dental patients.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>impressions</b> are {{negative}} imprints of teeth and oral soft tissues {{from which a}} positive representation can be cast. They are used in prosthodontics (to make dentures), orthodontics, restorative dentistry, dental implantology and oral and maxillofacial surgery.|$|R
50|$|The {{digital mapping}} {{technology}} of CEREC that charts {{the inside of}} the patient’s mouth completely accurately and down to the last detail ensures that there is no issue with inaccurate <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> that lead the patient to experience discomfort with bulky molds and unnecessary debris in their mouth.|$|R
5000|$|A {{correctly}} made <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> will {{capture a}} part {{or all of}} a person's dentition and surrounding structures of oral cavity. The <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> forms an imprint (i.e. a 'negative' mould) of teeth and soft tissues, which can then {{be used to make}} a cast of the dentition. Casts are used for diagnostics, patient record, treatment planning, fabrication of custom trays, fabrication of dentures, crowns or other prostheses and orthodontics.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} if digital study models are a satisfactory alternative to plaster study models. Method: 1. Pilot study to compare linear measurements from plaster models with {{two types of}} digital model. 2. Study to compare PAR scores from plaster models with digital models created from scans of <b>dental</b> <b>impressions.</b> 3. Pilot study to compare PAR scores of plaster models with 30 printed models created from scans of <b>dental</b> <b>impressions.</b> Results: A mean difference of <O. 5 mm (range 0. 02 - 0. 51 mm) for single linear measurements and < 3. 0 mm (0. 47 - 3. 03 mm) for multiple linear measurements was indicated. A mean difference of 0. 03 PAR points (SD= 3) was demonstrated between PAR scores for plaster models and digital models. A mean difference of 1 PAR point (SD= 3) was demonstrated between PAR scores for plaster models and 30 printed models. Conclusions: Both types of digital study model may be comparable with plaster models when used for linear measurements. Digital models created from scans of <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> are indicated to be comparable with plaster models for PAR scoring. 30 printed models may be comparable to plaster models for PAR scoring. Further research using a larger sample size is required to confirm above conclusions with regard to validity and reliability...|$|R
30|$|Following a {{discussion}} of the craniofacial multidisciplinary team and numerous paediatric pathologists, a diagnosis of intermediate-grade sarcoma of the oral mucosa and hard palate was re-affirmed. A partial right-sided maxillectomy was planned to gain adequate tumour clearance, and prior to surgery, the patient attended for <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> and counselling regarding the procedures involved, together with instructions regarding the obturator prosthesis.|$|R
30|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>impressions</b> {{were taken}} to allow {{construction}} of a maxillary complete denture template to both aid {{the placement of the}} zygomatic implants on the defect side and to act as an occlusal registration device during surgery. The occlusal vertical dimension was also measured between nasal tip and chin point to allow subsequent registration to occur at the correct level during surgery.|$|R
50|$|Indirect {{restoration}}s {{are ones}} where the tooth or teeth {{to receive the}} restoration are first prepared, then a <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> is taken and sent to a dental technician who fabricates the restoration according to the dentist's prescription.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> tray is a {{receptacle}} or {{device that}} is used to carry impression material to the mouth, confine the material in apposition to the surfaces to be recorded, and control the impression material while it sets to form the impression.|$|E
50|$|Early EPG devices used {{direct current}} {{electricity}} {{to power the}} sensors, which were activated by moisture sensors on mouthpieces. Mouthpieces (electropalates) originally closely resembled modern <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> plates. Mouthpieces became more customized over time, which allowed for more accurate research. Fig. 1 shows a typical electropalate from the Reading system.|$|E
50|$|In dentistry, an inlay {{is usually}} an {{indirect}} restoration (filling) {{consisting of a}} solid substance (as gold, porcelain or less often a cured composite resin) fitted to a cavity in a tooth and cemented into place. This technique involves fabricating the restoration outside of the mouth using the <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> of the prepared tooth, rather than placing a soft filling into the prepared tooth before the material sets hard.|$|R
50|$|McLachlin {{agreed with}} the {{majority}} that the taking of hair samples, buccal swabs, and <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> were serious violations under section 8. However, {{the collection of the}} tissue was not, as the tissue had been abandoned and it was not derivative evidence. Though the samples were created as a result of detention, the bodily state that they represent was not created by detention and exist outside of the detention.|$|R
50|$|In this {{technique}} the restoration is fabricated {{outside of the}} mouth using the <b>dental</b> <b>impressions</b> of the prepared tooth. Common indirect restorations include inlays and onlays, crowns, bridges, and veneers. Usually a dental technician fabricates the indirect restoration from records the dentist has provided of the prepared tooth. The finished restoration is usually bonded permanently with a dental cement. It is often done in two separate visits to the dentist. Common indirect restorations are done using gold or ceramics.|$|R
50|$|The {{subject is}} placed in a <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> mount fixed {{in a way to}} make it {{possible}} to manipulate the head in three dimensions. The subject's pupils are dilated using a dilating agent to minimize fluctuations from accommodation. After the eyes are sufficiently dilated, the subject is told to fixate on a target while in the mount.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Pediatric mandibular {{fractures}} {{have successfully}} been managed in various ways. The {{use of a}} lingual splint is one such option. The typical indirect method for acrylic lingual splint fabrication involves obtaining <b>dental</b> <b>impressions.</b> <b>Dental</b> models are produced from those impressions so that model surgery may be performed. The splint is then made on those models using resin powder and liquid monomer in a wet laboratory and transferred to the patient. Obvious limitations to this technique exist for both patient and operator. We present a technique for direct, intraoperative, fabrication of a splint using commercially available light-cured material that avoids some of the shortcomings of the indirect method. Recommendations are made based on available material safety information...|$|R

50|$|Alginates are refined from brown {{seaweeds}}. A {{wide variety}} of brown seaweeds of the phylum Phaeophyceae are harvested throughout {{the world to be}} converted into the raw material commonly known as sodium alginate. Sodium alginate has a wide use across a {{wide variety of}} industries including food, textile printing and pharmaceutical. <b>Dental</b> <b>impression</b> material utilizes alginate as its means of gelling. Alginate is both food and skin safe.|$|E
50|$|An {{impression}} {{is made by}} placing a viscous, thixotropic impression material into the mouth via a custom or stock <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> tray. The material, then sets to become an elastic solid, and, when removed from the mouth, provides a detailed and stable negative of teeth. Common materials used for dental impressions are sodium alginate, polyether and silicones - both condensation-cured silicones and addition-cured silicones, such as polyvinyl siloxane. Historically plaster of Paris, zinc oxide eugenol and agar have been used.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{dentures}} (false teeth) {{are made}} by first taking a <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> using a soft, pliable material that can be removed from around the teeth and gums without loss of fidelity and using the impression to creating a wax model of the teeth and gums. The model is {{used to create a}} plaster mold (which is heated so the wax melts and flows out) and the denture materials are injected into the mold. After a curing period, the mold is opened and the dentures are cleaned up and polished.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{begins with}} taking x-ray, photographs, a bite registration, and {{polyvinyl}} siloxane {{impressions of the}} person's teeth and gums.

50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{crowning}} a tooth involves using a <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> of a prepared tooth by a dentist to fabricate the crown {{outside of the}} mouth. The crown can then be inserted at a subsequent dental appointment. Using this indirect method of tooth restoration allows use of strong restorative materials requiring time-consuming fabrication methods requiring intense heat, such as casting metal or firing porcelain which {{would not be possible}} to complete inside the mouth. Because of the expansion properties, the relatively similar material costs, and the cosmetic benefit, many patients choose to have their crown fabricated with gold.|$|E

50|$|Polyvinyl {{siloxane}} (PVS), {{also called}} poly-vinyl siloxane, vinyl polysiloxane, or vinylpolysiloxane, is an addition-reaction silicone elastomer (an addition silicone). It is a viscous liquid that cures ("dries") quickly into a rubber-like solid, taking {{the shape of}} whatever surface it was lying against while curing. As with 2-part epoxy, its package keeps its 2 component liquids in separate tubes until the moment they are mixed and applied, because once mixed, they cure (harden) rapidly. Polyvinyl siloxane is widely used in dentistry as an impression material. It is also used in other contexts where an impression similar to a <b>dental</b> <b>impression</b> is needed, such as in audiology (to take ear impressions for fitting custom hearing protection or hearing aids) or in industrial applications (such as {{to aid in the}} inspection of interior features of machined parts, for example, internal grooves inside bores).
