500|$|Casting {{took place}} in June 1965. Jeffrey Hunter was unwilling to reprise his role as Captain Christopher Pike. [...] Lloyd Bridges and Jack Lord were considered, but William Shatner was finally cast as Pike's replacement, Captain James Kirk. The {{character}} of Number One, the female second-in-command, was dropped on the insistence of the NBC network, and Science Officer Spock was given Number One's unemotional demeanor. NBC was worried about Leonard Nimoy's [...] "satanic" [...] appearance and pressured for his removal.

500|$|He {{took the}} new episode on as a challenge, {{in the belief}} that the {{producers}} didn't think the episode would work well, which caused him to become determined to put out a good episode. He had numerous discussions with Brent Spiner, Justman, and Rick Berman on aspects of the episode, and the technical requirements and effects required an additional day of filming. Bowman credited Spiner for making the episode work, giving one example, [...] "He did the one scene in his own office with Brent sitting down and Lore discussing what it's like to be human. He did one side, we shot through a double, then turned around, read <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> and shot the other half of it. Those two characters in those scenes are different people... he really painted those characters differently." [...] Edits were still being made to the script during filming, as the writers wanted to introduce a new element to Data, in order to further distinguish him from Lore: an inability to use contractions. Data had used contractions during earlier episodes, and Spiner refused to shoot the scene until a final decision was reached; production stopped while there was a meeting on this subject between Gene Roddenberry, the producers, and the writers, {{in the middle of the}} bridge set.|$|E

2500|$|In {{many of his}} films, {{heavy use}} is made of music, both {{classical}} and pop, to accompany the visual imagery. For instance, in Scorpio Rising he makes use of the 1950s pop songs [...] "Torture" [...] by Kris Jensen, [...] "I Will Follow Him" [...] by Little Peggy March and [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] by Bobby Vinton. [...] He first used music to accompany visuals in the 1941 work Who Has Been Rocking My Dreamboat?, where he used tracks by the Mills Brothers. His use of popular music to accompany his films has been cited as a key influence {{on the development of}} music videos and of MTV, although he has stated his dislike for the whole music video industry.

2500|$|Gwynn's father {{encouraged}} {{his sons}} {{to play ball}} in the makeshift baseball field that he assembled in their backyard. The setup was a narrow strip of grass that was longer than wide. Pulling the ball too much resulted in it being lost over the neighbor's fence, but left field being short ruled out hitting it to the opposite field as well. Once the brothers' supply of wiffle balls [...] was exhausted, they resorted to using a sock rolled in rubber bands, a wad of tape, or a hardened fig from a neighbor's tree. Although Gwynn was able to pull the ball in his back yard, he would naturally hit <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> during regular games. Growing up, he attended Los Angeles Dodgers games and watched his hero, Willie Davis; the Dodgers outfielder had twice as many stolen bases as home runs (398 SB, 182 HR) in his career. Gwynn admired Davis for being black, left-handed, and [...] "aggressive but under control"; he respected Davis' work habits as well. Unlike other kids that tracked home run hitters, Gwynn checked the box scores in the newspaper every morning to follow high-average hitters like Pete Rose, George Brett and Rod Carew.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{death and}} the {{traditional}} ceremony, the body {{is placed on the}} ground, and covered with a sheet, and {{at the start of the}} traditional ceremony, the body is lifted from the ground onto a special board or slab (a tahara board), so that it lies facing the door, with a white sheet underneath. The clothes are then removed from the corpse (if they were not removed when the corpse was placed on the ground), and at this point [...] is recited by the enactors of the ritual, as it refers to the removal of filthy clothes. Following this, the body is thoroughly rubbed with [...] water, with the mouth of the corpse covered so that water does not enter it; the next part of the ritual is the pouring of water over the head, while [...] is quoted, since it refers to the sprinkling of water to produce cleanness; and then each limb is washed downwards, while [...] and the following verses, which describe the beauty of elements of the body, are spoken. Finally, nine measures of cold water are poured over the body while it is upright, which is the core element of the ceremony, and it is then dried (according to some customs), and enshrouded; in ancient times the hair and nails were also cut, but by the 19th century the hair was merely combed, and the nails were just cleansed with a special pin, unless their length is excessive. After the ceremony, the taharah board is washed and dried, but is kept facing the same way, as there is a superstition with the belief that turning <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> will cause another person to die within 3 days.
