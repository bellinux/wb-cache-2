Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the occurrence of}} inadequate antimicrobial therapy among critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to {{determine the}} relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome. MethodsFrom June 1995 to January 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant ICU-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of <b>empirical</b> antimicrobial <b>treatment</b> in each case was determined. We defined inappropriate <b>empirical</b> antimicrobial <b>treatment</b> as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated {{at the time the}} causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate <b>empirical</b> antimicrobial <b>treatment</b> and to evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the SPSS package (9. 0). ResultsAmong 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23. 5 %) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In this last group the mean age of patients was 64. 1 ± 13. 2 years, and 64 % were men. Bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92 % of these cases. Eleven percent developed septic shock and 37. 7 % severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28. 2 % of patients given inadequate <b>empirical</b> antimicrobial <b>treatment.</b> The main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15. 3 %), respiratory (7. 6 %) or unknown (53. 8 %). The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate <b>empirical</b> antimicrobial <b>treatment</b> were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29. 5 %), Acinetobacter baumannii (27. 3 %), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (4. 5 % each). The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (OR 2. 62; 95 % CI: 1. 10 – 6. 21; P = 0. 015). The global mortality rate was 56 % and the related mortality was 30 % in the group with inadequate <b>empirical</b> antimicrobial <b>treatment.</b> The only factor associated with inappropriate <b>empirical</b> antibiotic <b>treatment</b> was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (P = 0. 04; OR = 0. 35; 95 % CI: 0. 12 - 0. 97). Septic shock was related to attributable mortality (P = 0. 03; OR = 3. 19; 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 9. 40), but not inappropriate <b>empirical</b> antibiotic <b>treatment</b> (P = 0. 24; OR = 1. 71; 95 % CI: 0. 66 - 4. 78). ConclusionAlmost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate <b>empirical</b> antibiotic <b>treatment,</b> but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. This fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently isolated and the source of the bacteremia...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: To {{evaluate}} non-adherence to guideline on rational antibioticotherapy, {{proportions of}} hospital infections and <b>empirical</b> <b>treatments</b> in antibioticotherapy, {{and the need}} for making intervention to non-rational antibiotics prescriptions. Design: Observational study of non-adherence to guidelines on rational antibioticotherapy. Analysis of antibiotics prescriptions in tertiary hospital settings. Setting: 34 wards in tertiary hospital - University hospital at Kaunas University of Medicine. Main Outcome Measures: Proportions of non-rational treatment. Results: 331 (29, 82 %) patient of 1110, received antibiotics prescription. 166 (50. 15 %) rescriptions for treatment and 165 (49. 75 %) for prophylaxis. Empiric treatment 279 (84. 29 %) cases, 52 (15. 71 %) treatment cases based on bacteriological analysis. Community infections 111 (67. 27 %) cases. 206 (62, 24 %) prescriptions were non-adherent to guidelines rational antibioticotherapy. Correlation of non-adherence with rational antibioticotherapy for hospital and community infections was found as r = 0. 43 (P < 0. 05) and 0. 64 (P < 0. 01), correspondingly; and for empiric treatment and treatment based on bacteriological analysis as r= 0. 8 (P 0. 05), correspondingly. Conclusions: <b>Empirical</b> <b>treatments</b> in hospital settings comprise high (84 %) proportion of cases of antibioticotherapy. Hospital infections comprise high (33 %) proportion of infections in hospital settings. Prescription analysis has shown 62 % non-adherence to rational prescription. Non-adherence to guidelines on rational antibioticotherapy {{and the need for}} intervention is established for two settings: (1) hospital infection origin and (2) empiric antibioticotherapy...|$|R
