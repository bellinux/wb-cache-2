5000|$|R-14 — under acting {{command of}} Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas - {{ran out of}} usable fuel and lost radio {{communications}} in May 1921 while on a surface search mission for the seagoing tug [...] about [...] southeast of the island of Hawaii. Since the submarine's electric motors {{did not have enough}} battery power to propel her to Hawaii, the ship's engineering officer Roy Trent Gallemore came up with a novel solution to their problem. Lieutenant Gallemore decided they could try to sail the boat to the port of Hilo, Hawaii. He therefore ordered a foresail made of eight hammocks hung from a top boom made of pipe bunk frames lashed firmly together, all tied to the vertical kingpost of the torpedo loading crane forward of the submarine's superstructure. Seeing that this gave R-14 a speed of about 1 kn, as well as rudder control, he ordered a mainsail made of six blankets, hung from the sturdy radio mast (top sail in photo). This added [...]5 kn to the speed. He then ordered a mizzen made of eight blankets hung from another top boom made of bunk frames, all tied to the vertically placed boom of the torpedo loading crane. This sail added another [...]5 kn. Around 12:30 pm on 12 May, Gallemore was able to begin charging the boat's batteries. [...] After 64 hours under sail at slightly varying speeds, R-14 entered Hilo Harbor under battery propulsion on the morning of 15 May 1921. Douglas received a letter of commendation for the crew's <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> from his Submarine Division Commander, CDR Chester W. Nimitz, USN.|$|E
40|$|Several {{empirical}} {{works have}} shown the robust and positive relation between growth and innovation at macroeconomic level and between firm economic performance and innovation at microeconomic level. However, the economists have had less opportunities to study such linkages during severe global downturns of the economic cycle. Moreover, the present disruptive economic downturn has forced the firms to implement survival strategies. One of such strategic behaviour regards the way of intervention on product and process areas through <b>innovative</b> <b>actions.</b> Focusing the attention on the micro level, the present work provides an empirical analysis {{on the basis of}} more than 500 Italian manufacturing firms located in Emilia-Romagna region, with the aim of disentangling the relations between pre-crisis innovation strategies and firm economic performance during the crisis as well as the linkages between the <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> taken to react to the recession’s challenges and the economic performance in the recession. The results suggest the existence of strong relationships between past innovative activities and the capacity to react to the challenges brought by the crisis through <b>innovative</b> <b>actions</b> along product, process and organization/HRM dimensions, although the role of complementarities among past innovative activities doe...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{regional}} economies to withstand competition and to manage change {{is related to}} their capacity to innovate. The increasing importance of knowledge in determining economic performance places innovation high on the regional development agenda. The Regional Programmes of <b>Innovative</b> <b>Actions</b> {{are seen as a}} catalyst which gives regions an opportunity to try more adventurous actions that are often otherwise postponed or ignored. It is particularly important for the least-developed regions, such as, among others, the thirteen Greek regions, that they have the chance to experiment in fields outside the norm of their structural funds programmes and develop greater co-operation and networking with more developed regions. The second publication of the Greek Regional Programmes of <b>Innovative</b> <b>Actions,</b> entitled Regional Innovation Excellence in Greece, deals thoroughly with the programmes themselves, notably by presenting a comprehensive inventory of each individual action as well as attempting to produce their first clustering categorisation. Clusters represent a different way of dividing the regional economy. Cluster policy is a ‘mature’ policy area in some countries, and one that is emerging in others. ...|$|E
