5|$|By 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission {{proposed}} relocating Queens Chapel Road near Northwest Branch {{to eliminate}} the highway's circuitous course and extend Ager Road to the new highway. MD 500 was relocated <b>from</b> <b>Northwest</b> Branch to Hamilton Street as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway in 1949.
