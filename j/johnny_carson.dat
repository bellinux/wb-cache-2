5|$|The {{residential}} {{units were}} more successful, and 95% of the 263 condominiums {{were sold in}} the first four months after it opened, despite their high prices—the cost of condominiums at the tower started at $600,000 and ranged up to $12 million, with the penthouse being sold for $15 million in 1985. The tower attracted many rich and famous residents, including <b>Johnny</b> <b>Carson,</b> David Merrick, Sophia Loren, and Steven Spielberg. At least one unidentified resident, who lived on the same floor as <b>Johnny</b> <b>Carson,</b> built a private swimming pool in their unit. In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. However, by 1991, Trump was already involved in lawsuits against residents: in October of that year, he successfully sued actor Pia Zadora and her husband, businessman Meshulam Riklis, to collect $1 million in unpaid rent.|$|E

During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring <b>Johnny</b> <b>Carson,</b> ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they did not think it would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E

Jeopardy! director Kevin McCarthy, Corwin's associate director Bob Cisneros, and Wheel and Jeopardy! technical director Robert Ennis filled in at various points until Cisneros became full-time director in November 2013. Ennis returned as guest director for the weeks airing October 13 through 17 and November 17 through 21, 2014, as Cisneros was recovering from neck surgery at the time of taping.

The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at comedy clubs {{over the next few years}} in Cleveland and Los Angeles. He first came to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 Star Search. Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring <b>Johnny</b> <b>Carson</b> in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey to the couch next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the 14th Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO and made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special, Drew Carey: Human Cartoon, which aired on Showtime and won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.|$|E

5000|$|Between 2013 and 2016, Sheen {{starred in}} and {{produced}} Showtimes Masters of Sex. He and Lizzy Caplan portrayed the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series chronicled [...] "their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them {{go from a}} Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of Time magazine and <b>Johnny</b> <b>Carsons</b> couch". David Sims of The Atlantic described Sheens portrayal of Masters as [...] "an intensely honest and unsympathetic one" [...] while Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club said Sheen played the role [...] "so seamlessly its hard to remember that theres a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers." [...] Sean T. Collins of The Observer described Masters as [...] "a singularly unappealing figure": [...] "Its not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role. On the contrary! Sheens skill in playing Masters as an asshole who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant {{to spend more than}} two minutes with at a time." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter remarked: [...] "Masters has never been very likable. In fact, its a testament to Sheens performance — and Caplans nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters — that anyone still cares what happens to Masters on a personal level." [...] He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Allen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS, {{moving the}} show to NBC and {{becoming}} The Salad Bowl Revue (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmanns Mayonnaise, which was marketed by {{the parent company of}} Linit) later in the year. The show became The Sal Hepatica Revue (1933-34), The Hour of Smiles (1934-35), and finally Town Hall Tonight (1935-39). In 1939-40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to The Fred Allen Show, over his objections. Allens perfectionism (odd to some, considering his deft ad-libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until Town Hall Tonight allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide radio star.The hour-long show featured segments that would influence radio and, much later, television; news satires such as Rowan and Martins Laugh-Ins [...] "Laugh-In Looks at the News" [...] and Saturday Night Lives [...] "Weekend Update" [...] were influenced by Town Hall Tonights [...] "The News Reel", later renamed [...] "Town Hall News" [...] (and in 1939-40, as a sop to his sponsor, [...] "Ipana News"). The Tonight Show Starring <b>Johnny</b> <b>Carsons</b> [...] "Mighty Carson Art Players" [...] routines referenced Allens Mighty Allen Art Players, in name and sometimes in routines. Allen and company also satirized popular musical comedies and films of the day, including and especially Oklahoma!. Allen also did semi-satirical interpretations of well-known lives - including his own.|$|R
