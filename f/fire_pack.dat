5000|$|In 2014 MBAUP {{delivered}} 6 G 300 professional lwb {{cab chassis}} for new prototype fire fighting vehicles in Victoria Australia. Commencing late 2015 a [...] "fire pack" [...] {{version of the}} G300 lwb cab chassis will be delivered {{for the first of}} more than 300 of the [...] "Ultra Light Fire Tankers". The <b>Fire</b> <b>pack</b> includes factory fitted reinforced front winch bar and recovery points (2)rated to 50 kn, 100 amp power supply {{to the rear of the}} vehicle, fire protected fuel, electrical and brake lines and a tow bar and rear recovery points as well as enhanced rear body mounts to handle the continuous high weight, extreme operating environment and strength for the industry leading Falling Object Protection System (FOPS) that is installed on the vehicles.The <b>fire</b> <b>pack</b> and ULT have been developed jointly by Mercedes and fire vehicle specialists from the Victorian government department responsible for fire management on public land, to meet the need for an extremely capable, off-road, small (4500 kg), fire truck. The proven toughness of the G Klasse platform combined with an innovative fire vehicle body has set a new standard for the Australian forest fire industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{steepness}} and ruggedness of {{the terrain}} in Blackwater Canyon meant firefighters had to access the fire on foot, carrying all their supplies. On the Blackwater <b>fire,</b> <b>pack</b> horses were used to ferry supplies from the access roads to an upper base camp. Many of the firefighters were employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and had limited training in wildfire suppression and behavior, as the CCC was mainly engaged in construction projects. After a series of severe and deadly forest fire events in the early 20th century, officials established the 10 am rule in 1935, which recommended aggressive attack on all fires and to have them controlled by 10 am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. A scientific publication about fire behavior {{that could be used}} for widespread training of firefighters first became available in 1951.|$|E

However, Intrepid was destroyed, possibly by enemy gunfire, before she achieved her goal, killing Somers and his entire crew.|$|R
50|$|Packing with {{inherently}} fire-resistive materials, such as rockwool or {{ceramic fibre}} {{is intended to}} protect sealants that would, on their own, be consumed by the <b>fire.</b> Lesser <b>packing,</b> such as foam backer rod or fibreglass are used simply to hold up materials that can survive fire testing on their own. In both cases, the packing is placed {{in such a way}} as to control the exact depth of the materials that top off the seal.|$|R
50|$|The G5 battery, aka Quebec Battery, didn't {{move for}} the first three days, while they were shooting. This was a first for any {{artillery}} movement. Normally, after the guns <b>fired,</b> they would <b>pack</b> up and move, to avoid being fired upon.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 20 March 1994 a Lynx helicopter, serial number ZD275, {{was in the process}} of landing at the large British Army base at Crossmaglen. Meanwhile, an IRA unit had mounted a Mark 15 mortar on a tractor, {{concealed}} behind bales of hay. The tractor was parked 150 yards from the intended target, on waste ground. At 20:27, there was a sudden blackout across Crossmaglen's square and at the same time, a single mortar shell was lobbed into the barracks. The IRA had used the mains for the collapsing circuit of the <b>firing</b> <b>pack,</b> turning off the street's power supply and allowing the mortar's own battery to trigger the launcher. When the Lynx was hovering 100 feet over the helipad, the mortar round hit the aircraft on the tail's boom, which was severed from the fuselage. The machine spun out of control, but the pilot was able to crash-land the Lynx inside the base. A Grenadier Guards' patrol spotted a huge orange fireball from a mile away. Three members of the crew managed to get out with minor injuries, but a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was trapped inside the blazing wreckage. The constable was rescued just before the fuel tanks and the ammunition started to explode.|$|R

50|$|Varvakis was a Greek Orthodox Christian {{who became}} a skilful sailor {{at the age of}} 17 and built a ship, the St. Andrew, which he later offered (with his crew) to the Russian forces during the Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774. He spent his entire fortune to equip the ship and to arm it with cannons and showed {{extraordinary}} courage during the Battle of Chesma (Çeşme) in July 1770. His xebec was transformed into a <b>fire</b> ship, <b>packed</b> with combustibles, set on fire and steered into a large Turkish ship. But the war did not give independence to Greece, as the Ottoman sultan signed peace by the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji in 1774, which granted Russia {{the northern part of the}} Black Sea. On the other hand, this war created a mass exodus of Greeks to Russia.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave the}} word, and we <b>fired</b> into that <b>packed</b> mass with terrible effect. Really I think that each bullet must have brought down {{two or three}} of them. Then, at a command from Mavovo, the Zulus threw down their guns and charged with their broad spears. Stephen, who had got hold of an assegai somehow, went with them, firing a Colt's {{revolver}} as he ran, while at their backs came Bausi and his thirty tall Mazitu.|$|R

Loops are sewn in different places, through which sticks are passed, to stretch the curves into shape: a stake, planted in the ground serves as a buttress to support the apparatus: at a proper height, there is a loophole to <b>fire</b> through. It <b>packs</b> up into a roll of canvas and a bundle of five or six sticks.|$|R
25|$|When {{the team}} debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were {{modeled after the}} Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the {{equipment}} used by Cleveland. So after the <b>firing,</b> Paul Brown <b>packed</b> up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, then they changed to white, black, and orange, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.|$|R
50|$|The 721st Railway Operating Battalion was {{activated}} at Camp Harahan on 14 April 1943. The unit comprised {{men from}} replacement companies, reception centers, a cadre from another battalion and reservists of the New York Central System, which sponsored the battalion. While at Camp Harahan for six weeks, the men underwent a vigorous physical training program, learning to march, hurdle obstacle courses, roll full field <b>packs,</b> <b>fire</b> {{a gun and}} become indoctrinated in Army discipline, rules and regulations. The 721st deployed to the CBI Theater.|$|R

Two pre-production examples of these Ship in a Bottle ships are known to exist (Spanish ship #135 Castigue, and Pirate ship #136 Blue Heron), though both are missing deckplates and as such are incomplete for actual game play purposes.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that they stepped {{on some of the}} errant cartridges and caused the fire that was reported aboard the ship on Sunday morning. Upon seeing the flames, residents of nearby homes fled in the pouring rain. The guard swiftly boarded her and extinguished the flames in about 20 minutes. The Picton was once more towed out into the stream, bursting into flames as this was being done. After the fire was out, the guards went back on board to confirm that the ammunition was still on board, even extinguishing a small <b>fire</b> in the <b>packing</b> straw.|$|R

My tracers ripped into the shining plateglass of the penthouses on its top, and I saw the broken windows cascade like snow to the streets, many floors below. I laughed, for I knew that behind those windows were Japanese high officers, enjoying that modern hotel. When I got closer I could see uniformed figures {{going down the}} fire escapes, and I shot at them...I turned for one more run on the <b>packed</b> <b>fire</b> escapes filled with Jap soldiers, but my next burst ended very suddenly. I was out of ammunition." ...|$|R
50|$|Zero-zero {{technology}} uses small rockets {{to propel}} the seat upward to an adequate altitude {{and a small}} explosive charge to open the parachute canopy quickly for a successful parachute descent, so that proper deployment of the parachute no longer relies on airspeed and altitude. The seat cannon clears the seat from the aircraft, then the under-seat rocket <b>pack</b> <b>fires</b> to lift the seat to altitude. As the rockets fire for longer than the cannon, they do not require the same high forces. Zero-zero rocket seats also reduced forces on the pilot during any ejection, reducing injuries and spinal compression.|$|R
5000|$|He has {{expressed}} his opinion on some issues. In August 2004, {{during a trip}} to Mexico sponsored by the group Republicans Abroad, he called Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez a dictator and criticized the U.S. Border Patrol's use of guns which <b>fire</b> plastic pellets <b>packed</b> with chili powder. Bush was quoted as telling Mexican media, [...] "If there has been American approval for this policy, that is reprehensible. It's kind of barbarous." [...] He attributed the gun usage to [...] "some local INS guy who's trying to be tough, act macho", although it is an agency policy.|$|R
25|$|At Muar itself, a Japanese {{attempt to}} land and seize the harbour was repulsed by Australian artillery, <b>firing</b> at <b>packed</b> barges and junks {{as they tried to}} make their way across the river mouth. By late {{afternoon}} though the Japanese, who had already made another crossing further up river, were in the town of Muar itself. The commanders of the Rajputana Rifles and the Royal Garhwal Rifles were killed along with most of their officers during the fighting around the town, leaving the mostly teenaged sepoys leaderless. To add to the mounting disasters for 45th Brigade it was {{at this point in the}} battle, that an air raid by Japanese aircraft destroyed 45th Brigade Headquarters, killing all the staff officers and concussing Brigadier Duncan (one of only two survivors of the raid). Due to Brigadier Duncan's concussion and the deaths of two of his battalion commanders and most of the HQ staff, command of the 45th Brigade was temporarily handed over to Anderson of the 2/19th Australian Battalion.|$|R
50|$|As {{the rivalry}} between Vianne and Reynaud intensifies, {{a band of}} river gypsies camp out on the {{outskirts}} of the village. While most of the town objects to their presence, Vianne embraces them, developing a mutual attraction to the Traveller Roux (Johnny Depp). Together they hold a birthday party for Armande with other village members and gypsies on Roux's boat. When Caroline sees Luc, who sneaked out to the party, dancing with his grandmother, she begins to see how strict she has been with her son and that his grandmother's influence in his life may after all be beneficial. After the party, Josephine and Anouk fall asleep on a boat, while Roux and Vianne make love. Late that night, Serge sets the boat, where Josephine and Anouk are sleeping, on fire. Both escape unharmed, but Vianne's faith in the village is shaken. Luc helps Armande home from the party; her death soon after devastates both him and his mother. After the <b>fire,</b> Roux <b>packs</b> up and leaves with his group, much to Vianne's sadness.|$|R

50|$|Like other Polynesian people, Māori cooked food {{in earth}} ovens, known in New Zealand as hāngi, {{although}} the word umu is also used as in other Pacific languages. Stones are heated by <b>fire</b> and food <b>packed</b> in leaves are placed on top. The packs are further covered with foliage and cloth, or, wet sacks, then earth. Other cooking methods included roasting and, in geothermal areas, boiling or steaming using natural hot springs and pools. Occasionally food would be boiled in non-geothermal areas by putting hot stones into a bowl with water and the food; and some food was also cooked over the open fire. Some foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, or layers of fat—particularly muttonbirds. Māori {{were one of the}} few people to have no form of alcoholic beverage.|$|R
5000|$|Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge is {{a dynamic}} {{landscape}} made up of forests, wetlands, tundra, lakes, mountains and glacial rivers bounded by the snowy peaks of the Alaska Range. This upper Tanana River valley {{has been called the}} [...] "Tetlin Passage," [...] because it serves as a major migratory route for birds traveling to and from Canada, the lower 48 and both Central and South America. Many of these birds breed and nest on the refuge. Others pass through on their way to breeding and nesting grounds elsewhere in the state. Migrants, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, raptors and songbirds, begin arriving in the valley in April, and continue into early June. An estimated 116 species breed on Tetlin during the short summer, when long days and warm temperatures accelerate the growth of plants, insects and other invertebrates, providing a ready source of rich foods for nesting birds.Tetlin Refuge also supports a variety of large mammals. Dall sheep dot the higher slopes while Alaskan moose feed upon the tender new growth that springs up in the wake of frequent lightning caused <b>fires.</b> Wolf <b>packs,</b> turkey vulture, lynx, tundra swan, red fox, peregrine falcon, coyote packs, beaver, golden eagle, marten, six species of owls, snowshoe hare, osprey, trumpeter swan, muskrat, bald eagle, river otter, grizzly and black bears and members of three different caribou herds range over the refuge.|$|R
60|$|Such a {{thing was}} unheard of. Jacob Kent {{was making the}} <b>fire,</b> {{chopping}} wood, <b>packing</b> water--doing menial tasks for a guest! When Jim Cardegee left Dawson, it was with his head filled with the iniquities of this roadside Shylock; and all along the trail his numerous victims had added to the sum of his crimes. Now, Jim Cardegee, with the sailor's love for a sailor's joke, had determined, when he pulled into the cabin, to bring its inmate down a peg or so. That he had succeeded beyond expectation {{he could not help}} but remark, though he was in the dark as to the part the gash on his cheek had played in it. But while he could not understand, he saw the terror it created, and resolved to exploit it as remorselessly as would any modern trader a choice bit of merchandise.|$|R
