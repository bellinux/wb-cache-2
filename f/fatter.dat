A <b>fat</b> replacer is an ingredient that replaces {{some or all of}} the functions of <b>fat</b> and may or may not provide nutritional value. A <b>fat</b> substitute is an ingredient that replaces all the functions of <b>fat</b> without any energy contribution. Currently available <b>fat</b> replacers are <b>fat</b> mimics (also called mimetics) on <b>fat</b> analogs. <b>Fat</b> mimics are based on carbo-hydrate. protein, and/or <b>fat</b> and have energy values from 0 to 38 kJ/g (() - 9 kcal/g). <b>Fat</b> analogs have the characteristics of <b>fat</b> but have less energy. Because no one ingredient replaces all the functions of <b>fat,</b> most reduced-fat foods are formulated with a combination of ingredients and processes that affect both <b>fat</b> and energy content.

Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species. Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout.

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of adipose tissue is important to cattle production. <b>Fat</b> influences the animalâs reproductive efficiency and determines its carcass value. As a cowâs reproductive efficiency {{is associated with a}} level of overall fatness, not just a particular <b>fat</b> depot, being able to re-partition <b>fat</b> to a more valuable depot while reducing <b>fat</b> in less valuable depots would be advantageous. Most previous research involving <b>fat</b> deposition in cattle focussed on subcutaneous and intramuscular <b>fat,</b> and usually evaluated these in relation to total <b>fat</b> or carcass weight rather than the relationship between individual <b>fat</b> depots. The hypothesis that there is a genetic basis for variation in <b>fat</b> distribution in cattle and a weak relationship between <b>fat</b> depots independent of anatomical site was tested. The principal aim of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms controlling <b>fat</b> deposition in cattle, including any relationship between <b>fat</b> depots. Marbling features (e. g. shape and orientation) and seam (intermuscular) <b>fat</b> area were quantified using image analysis. The seam <b>fat</b> area and other carcass <b>fat</b> measurements were used to examine the relationship between <b>fat</b> depots. Candidate genes for <b>fat</b> deposition traits were identified and sequenced in Jersey â Limousin mapping sires to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In all, 33 SNPs from 11 candidate genes for <b>fat</b> deposition were selected for association studies in the sire progeny. There was large variation in all of the measures but the variation was largely independent of other marbling factors. The seam <b>fat</b> area data were used to identify a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 19, and subsequently identify candidate genes for seam <b>fat</b> area. In general, there were low correlations between <b>fat</b> traits suggesting the relationship between the depots was not strong. The fixed effects of cohort, breed and myostatin variant affected general <b>fat</b> deposition. However, sire affected <b>fat</b> distribution, as no sire had progeny consistently higher or lower for all <b>fat</b> traits. These results suggest there is only a weak genetic link between the <b>fat</b> depots. The size of effect was small for most of the SNPs associated with <b>fat</b> deposition, although there were some candidate genes with sizeable effects, for example, tyrosine kinase, endothelial (TEK 1) (channel <b>fat,</b> 28 %) and Ã, Ã-carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase (BCMO 1) (subcutaneous <b>fat,</b> 20 %). Moreover, the combined effect of all SNPs affecting a single trait explained 38 % (channel <b>fat),</b> 26 % (seam <b>fat</b> and subcutaneous <b>fat)</b> and 23 % (omental <b>fat)</b> of the phenotypic variation. Interestingly, although some genes were associated with variation in more than one <b>fat</b> trait, no one gene was associated with all <b>fat</b> traits or overall fatness. The major conclusion from the research described herein is that there is genetic influence on <b>fat</b> deposition in addition to the effects of age, breed and management, the deposition of <b>fat</b> into the various adipose sites is controlled in an independent manner genetically and there appears to be no one gene that affects deposition in all sites. There were four principal results that support this conclusion; 1) there were low correlations between <b>fat</b> traits, 2) there were no sires with progeny consistently high or low for all <b>fat</b> traits, 3) the QTL for the various <b>fat</b> depots did not overlap with each other, and 4) no SNP was associated with all <b>fat</b> traits. These results indicate that there is large scope for selecting for and against individual <b>fat</b> traits without altering other <b>fat</b> depots. Thesis (Ph. D.)
