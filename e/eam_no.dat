40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the mioma arterial embolization (EAM) by uterine volume, mioma diameter greater and in the ovarian function, was carried through before and after three months of the procedure, pelvic ultrasonography for the transvaginal way (USPTV) and dosages of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). METHODS: Thirty patients carrying of symptomatic leiomyomas had participated of the study that they had been submitted to the EAM after science and signature of the term of free and clarified assent, obeying the criteria of inclusion of the study. Examinations of USPTV for the same professional had been carried through, in the same device before and after three months of the EAM. The uterus volume was express in cm³ e mioma diameter greater in cm. Had been made dosages of FSH before and after three months of the EAM in the central laboratory of the Hospital São Paulo. The values had been quantified in UI/ml, analyzed and express for medium+/-shunting line standard. The data then had been submitted the statistics analysis for the test distribution free of Mann-Whitney. RESULTS: It had the exclusion of a patient due to lack of data after EAM. The average before EAM uterine volume was 402, 4 ± 165, 9 cm³, before-EAM mioma diameter greater 5, 928 ± 2, 126 cm. The observed result was after-EAM uterine volume was 258, 9 ± 118, 6 cm³ and after-EAM mioma diameter greater 4, 607 ± 1, 858 cm. The average of the dosage before-EAM FSH was 4, 997 (± 3, 520) UI/ml and after-EAM FSH was 5, 500 (± 4, 759) UI/ml with p= 0, 581 *. In hormone dosages, 29 cases had been evaluated. One case, that is equivalent 3. 4 % of the total, attended a course with definitive increase of FSH. It had reduction of 35 % of the uterus volume, of 22 % {{in the size of the}} mioma diameter greater and the EAM did not modify the FSH values significantly after 3 months. CONCLUSION: The procedure causes reduction of the uterine volume and leiomyomas preserving the uterus and, does not provoke ovarian function alterations. INTRODUÇÃO: Para avaliar o impacto da embolização arterial de miomas (<b>EAM)</b> <b>no</b> volume uterino, diâmetro do maior mioma e na função ovariana, foi realizado antes e após 3 meses do procedimento ultrassonografia pélvica pela via transvaginal (USPTV) e dosagens de FSH (hormônio folículo estimulante). CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODO: Participaram do estudo 30 pacientes com leiomioma sintomático que se submeteram à EAM após ciência e assinatura do termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido, obedecendo aos critérios de inclusão do estudo.

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{development of}} the internet or other wide band access technologies such as DSL, FTTH has driven the {{development of the}} high-capacity optical networks from research laboratories into commercial deployment such as Synchronous optical networks or Synchronous digital hierarchy. In the first generation, optics is used only in transmission, and all switching and other intelligent functions are handled in electronics. Now people are seeing the deployment of the 2 nd generation optical networks, where some of the routing, switching and intelligence are handled optically. In this network, data is carried from its source to its destination in optical form, without undergoing any optical-to-electrical conversion so that the electronic devices will not limit the speed. In this network, both of the two current primary techniques for data multiplexing i. e. wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and time-division multiplexing (TDM) are used including all optical devices such as wavelength converters, all optical switches, optical add/drop multiplexer, 2 R, 3 R and etc [...] //　This thesis introduces two novel devices for all optical processing by using multiple quantum well (MQW) electroabsorption modulators (EAM) for high-speed telecommunication: wavelength converters and all optical switches. The reasons why the EAM is used to replace the traditional semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) are short recovery time under reverse bias (possible to be < 10 ps), high stability, no amplified-spontaneous emission (ASE), and easy integration with other devices, especially, lasers. Moreover, we chose InGaAlAs as the core layer material in our devices due to its merits of large refractive index ratio between waveguide and cladding layer, large conduction band offset suitable for uncooled operation, and large spectral range. //　The proposed wavelength conversion is based on the optical nonlinear polarization rotation in an EAM. Nowadays, most of the EAM-based wavelength conversion is using cross-absorption modulation (XAM) due to its simple configuration. However, XAM suffers from the large input power, typically larger than 15 dBm. In order to reduce the input power, we investigated the cross-phase modulation (XPM) for TE mode and TM mode, and the polarization rotation. In the static wavelength conversion experiment, we demonstrated that the input powers for π phase shift are only 5 dBm for upward conversion (from 1555 nm to 1560 nm) and 8 dBm for downward conversion (from 1555 nm to 1550 nm), and the extinction ratios are 34 dB and 31 dB respectively. 10 Gb/s dynamic wavelength conversion has also been demonstrated. Further simulation shows that the narrowing of the quantum well and compressive strain of MQW enhance the polarization rotation, thus reducing the required input power for saturation state. Higher speed operation is also possible by using higher reverse and optimizing the RF response. //　For all optical switches, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration with EAM on the MZI arms is proposed. On account of the low relaxation time of <b>EAM,</b> <b>no</b> push-pull operation is needed. Moreover, compared to SOA, EAM has no current injection, so lower heating and low power consumption can be achieved. //　The main challenge of our MZI-EAM device is the monolithic integration of the EAM and other passive waveguide. Due to large insertion loss of EAM and no gain devices in the whole structure, etch and regrowth method is chosen to reduce the total insertion loss by optimizing the active and passive regions individually. Till now, etch and regrowth technology has been well developed for InGaAsP material, but for Al-containing material, it still remains a challenge, especially for ex-situ cleaning procedure. The difficulty arises from the formation of stable Al-Oxides due to the often inevitable air-exposure of the InGaAlAs core layer during device processing, which degrades the crystal quality grown at the interface and causes large scattering loss. We optimized the growth conditions by MOVPE and processing procedures for both one-step regrowth and two-step regrowth and obtained good connection at the interface of the passive waveguide and active EAM region, with high coupling efficiency and low coupling loss (0. 21 dB/facet). //　Another big issue of the EAM-based all optical switch is the large insertion loss. This is mainly due to the large absorption of EAM and scattering in the waveguide. High mesa structure is superior for small size, but suffering from the significant scattering loss at the sidewall. Ridge structure has much lower loss, but has longer S-bend and multimode interferometer (MMI). Moreover, the doping profile in the cladding layer has also influence on the total loss. 報告番号: 甲 22283; 学位授与年月日: 2007 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6488 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, many {{different}} modeling techniques and languages {{were developed in}} order to allow for an efficient and appropriate enterprise architecture management (EAM). Recently, <b>EAM</b> is <b>no</b> longer only seen as a means to ensure business/IT alignment but further as a means to support fundamental changes of the organization, often called enterprise transformation (ET). In a joint project with a group of practitioners we aim at developing a framework that provides guidance on how EAM can support such ETs and thus leverage the benefit of modeling. Our design results after more than one year of research reveal different types of EAM, areas of action in ETs and ET activities that can be supported by EAM. The findings show that modeling techniques or languages should focus on constructs like transitions, benefits or risks in order to increase their value for ET support. ...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral blood {{lymphocytes}} from seventeen non-thymectomized {{and nine}} thymectomized patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and thirteen healthy controls were examined {{for the presence}} of surface markers characteristic of T and B lymphocytes by rosette formation with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). T cells were identified by their capacity to spontaneously form rosettes with SRBCs. The percentage of B lymphocytes was determined by the erythrocyte antibody complement (EAC) rosette-forming test. The EAC complex was prepared with either whole rabbit anti-SRBC serum or with the IgM fraction of rabbit anti-SRBC serum. The two kind of erythrocyte complement rosette-forming cells (EAC-RFC) are designated erythrocyte-haemolysin-complement RFC (EA(H) C-RFC), and erythrocyte-IgM-complement RFC (EA(M) C-RFC). The percentage of total lymphocytes and T cells was not altered in MG patients. The percentage of 'active' T cells, which have been considered to be more actively involved in cellular immunity, was also similar in MG patients and controls. A significant increase in EA(H) C-RFC occurred in both thymectomized and non-thymectomized MG patients, while in B cells detected by <b>EA(M)</b> C-RFC <b>no</b> alterations were found. The increase in EA(H) C-RFC in lymphocytes from MG patients may be due to an increase in the 19 S antibody-forming B lymphocytes or to an increase in T cells which have Fc receptors on their surface...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Marine Corps (USMC) has 156, 000 active duty enlisted Marines and annually orders over 90, 000 {{of them to}} permanently change station. The Commandant of the Marine Corps requires assignments of the "Right Marine, {{to the right place}} with the right skills and quality of life. " USMC manpower planning uses staffing goals (billet requirements) to capture the Commandant's requirements, but, surprisingly, does not monitor how many Marines fill appropriate staffing goal billets. This thesis finds that although the staffing goals are completely achievable, only 45 % of active duty Marines fill a staffing goal billet and 47 % of staffing goal billets are under-staffed. The USMC has used the Enlisted Assignment Model (EAM) since the 1970 s to help enlisted monitors determine assignments. EAM has several shortcomings. Among these, enlisted monitors reject most of EAM suggested assignments and <b>EAM</b> offers <b>no</b> measure of effectiveness to gauge the quality of its assignments. This thesis presents a network model, EAM-GLOBAL to optimize the by-name assignment of Marines to staffing goal billets. EAM-GLOBAL attempts to assign the "right Marines to the right places" while simultaneously balancing staffing shortages, allowing grade and military occupational specialty substitutions, and minimizing the costs of permanent change of station transfers within the continental United States.

40|$|Aims: 1) To {{study the}} {{frequency}} and distribution of acute coronary syndromes {{and other forms of}} ischemic heart disease (IHD) as the cause of hospitalization in the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS); 2) To compare mortality from the various forms of IHD by gender in NHS hospitals in the period 1997 - 2001. Material and Methods: Annual in-patient data based on Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) sent by each NHS hospital to the Informatics and Financial Management Institute (IGIF) using ICD- 9 -CM codes. After quality control of the data by IGIF, the Statistics Department of the Directorate- General of Health (GDS) studied the distribution of codes 410 - 414 by age group and gender. Measures of central tendency were studied and the Student’s t test was used to evaluate the significance of {{differences between men and women}} in the distribution of IHD in-patients. Results: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (410) caused 7618 hospitalizations (5271 male, 2347 female) in 1997. In 2001 the number was 10 047 (6693 male, 3354 female). Other acute and subacute forms of IHD (411) were 4005 (2522 male, 1483 female) and 4100 (2618 male, 1482 female) respectively during 1997 and 2001. Angina pectoris (413) and other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease (414) were 2479 (1543 male, 936 female) and 11 293 (7951 male, 3342 female) during 1997, and 1993 (1212 male, 781 female) and 12 029 (8277 male, 3752 female) during 2001. The age (meanSD) of in-patients coded as 410 was 63. 1 ± 12. 9 / 63. 9 ± 17. 0 years in men and 72. 4 ± 11. 6 / 73. 1 ± 11. 1 years in women over the period 1997 - 2001. Age differences by gender were statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Age for code 411 was similar to AMI in men (62. 9 ± 11. 1 years and 63. 8 ± 11. 7 years respectively in 1997 and 2001), but was lower in AMI cases in women (68. 4 ± 10. 6 years and 69. 3 ± 10. 7 years respectively in 1997 and 2001). AMI mortality was higher in 1997 (11. 6 % male, 22. 1 % female) than in 2001 (9. 9 % male, 19. 8 % female). Conclusions: Acute coronary events are the cause of approximately half of the hospitalizations for IHD, in both sexes. The frequency of every form of IHD in men is higher than in women, and hospitalization occurs nine years earlier on average. Between 1997 and 2001, hospitalizations for IHD increased by over 10 %, mainly for AMI (32 %), although with no significant increase in age. Nevertheless, the prognosis for AMI in in-patients has improved in both sexes. Objectivos: 1) Caracterizar a frequência e distribuição das síndromes coronárias agudas e das outras formas da Doença Isquémica Cardíaca (DIC) como causa de internamento hospitalar (IH); 2) Comparar a letalidade das diferentes formas da DIC nos Hospitais do SNS segundo o sexo, no período de 1997 - 2001. Material e Métodos: Bases de dados dos Grupos de Diagnóstico Homogéneos (GDH) de 1997 - 2001. Dados de IH na Rede dos Hospitais do SNS codificados pela CID- 9 e enviados para o IGIF. Após controlo de qualidade, as bases foram enviadas para a DGS. Na Divisão de Estatística estudou-se a distribuição das rubricas nosológicas 410 - 414 segundo o grupo etário, em ambos os sexos. Relativamente à idade, calcularam [...] se os parâmetros de tendência central e estudou-se o significado da diferença entre o tempo de ocorrência das diversas formas da DIC entre homens e mulheres (teste t de Student). Resultados: O enfarto agudo do miocárdio - EAM (410), em 1997, justificou 7618 IH (5271 H, 2347 M) enquanto, em 2001, o numero foi de 10 047 (6693 H, 3354 M). O número das outras formas agudas e subagudas da DIC (411) foi de 4005 (2522 H, 1483 M) e 4100 (2618 H, 1482 M), respectivamente em 1997 e 2001. Outras formas de angina de peito (413) e de DIC crónica (414) foram a causa de IH, respectivamente, de 2479 (1543 H, 936 M) e de 11 293 (7951 H, 3342 M) casos, em 1997, e de 1993 (1212 H, 781 M) e de 12 029 (8277 H, 3752 M) casos, em 2001.
