Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice <b>indexes</b> may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E
