5|$|Alleles at a locus may be <b>dominant</b> or recessive; <b>dominant</b> alleles {{give rise}} to their {{corresponding}} phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are <b>dominant</b> and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is <b>dominant</b> over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the <b>dominant</b> pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are <b>dominant.</b> In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is <b>dominant</b> over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the <b>dominant</b> species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less <b>dominant</b> species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the <b>dominant</b> species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in the}} skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. <b>Dominant</b> white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, <b>dominant</b> white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from <b>dominant</b> white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
50|$|Social {{status and}} sex also {{influence}} how much daffodil cichlids invest in their livers. Males and females (controlling for body size) have similar liver investment, and subordinates {{of both sexes}} have relatively larger livers compared with <b>dominants.</b> Social status results in liver size disparity because it is hypothesized that liver mass reflects status-dependent differences in energy expenditure, but not energy storage or energy acquisition. <b>Dominants</b> perform more energetically costly behaviors (e.g. social policing and care) compared with subordinates, supporting the notion that energy expenditure drives liver investment. <b>Dominants</b> in large groups with many subordinates to monitor and <b>dominants</b> that own multiple territories with a large area to patrol tend to have smaller livers. Subordinates {{do not appear to}} use the liver as a strategic energy storage organ. Although subordinates feed more frequently than <b>dominants,</b> a negative correlation is found between feeding rates and liver size. This provides evidence that liver investment patterns are linked to status-driven differences in energy expenditure but not energy intake or storage.|$|R

Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of <b>dominant</b> females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E

5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either <b>dominant</b> or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is <b>dominant</b> {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. <b>Dominant</b> individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{why and how}} {{subordinates}} of {{many social}} animals remain consistently smaller than <b>dominants</b> is important for determining the mechanisms underlying the structure and stability of hierarchical societies. Here we show that competition over food and conflict over social rank are ultimately responsible for the regulation of subordinate growth in the group-living reef fish, Paragobiodon xanthosomus (Gobiidae). Subordinates benefit from reducing their own food intake, and hence growth, when they approach a size where they risk conflict with <b>dominants.</b> Dieting {{appears to be a}} behavioural mechanism ensuring that subordinates remain smaller than <b>dominants</b> within the hierarchy...|$|R

5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly <b>dominant</b> in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were <b>dominant</b> in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are <b>dominant</b> in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are <b>dominant</b> in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|E

40|$|Conflict over {{reproduction}} is an inherent part of group living. In many social vertebrates, conflict may be reflected as allostatic load, or {{the costs of}} social status and dominance rank, which may be quantified by measuring glucocorticoid stress hormones. Here, we develop the first quantitative model of allostatic load based on the tug‐of‐war model of reproductive skew to generate insights into the mechanisms underlying reproductive conflict in cooperative breeders and to determine whether glucocorticoids {{can be used to}} assess conflict levels in group‐living vertebrates. It predicts that subordinates have higher allostatic loads than <b>dominants</b> under most conditions, but when body condition is lower in <b>dominants</b> than in subordinates, <b>dominants</b> experience higher allostatic load. Group structure is also important, as <b>dominants</b> generally have higher allostatic loads than subordinates when there is a large number of subordinates in the group, but this cost can be reduced by increasing the number of <b>dominants,</b> as in plural breeding societies. Using glucocorticoid data from cooperatively breeding superb starlings Lamprotornis superbus, we found empirical support for both predictions. Our model is useful for understanding how the costs of social status influence reproductive sharing, and it suggests that glucocorticoids can be used to examine reproductive conflict and cooperation in social species...|$|R
40|$|Cooperatively {{breeding}} groups include {{individuals that}} {{give up some}} current reproductive opportunities while remaining in a group. In some cases, these individuals are physiologically or morphologically unable to reproduce. Empirical and theoretical evidence suggest that this inability often does not result from stress or manipulation by <b>dominants</b> against the interests of subordinates. I argue that such reproductive inhibition can represent a commitment not to reproduce {{in exchange for a}} reduction in costs imposed by <b>dominants.</b> I present a model that allows subordinates to choose whether to inhibit their own reproduction ("self-inhibition") and accept no direct reproduction while in the group or to remain flexible and attempt to take a share of group productivity. If <b>dominants</b> assess the reproductive status of subordinates and punish those that reproduce, this model predicts self-inhibition when group members are closely related, opportunities for independent breeding are poor, assessment of reproductive status and eviction are costly, and the chance of being detected when cheating is high. However, <b>dominants</b> are less likely to assess the reproductive status of subordinates that are closely related, resulting in a narrow window of relatedness in which self-inhibition is favored. Counterintuitively, this window is wider when flexible subordinates would be able to take a large share of group production. Although the model assumes that <b>dominants</b> are able to reliably detect commitment, it is generally robust against mistakes in the form of <b>dominants</b> failing to assess uncommitted subordinates, or even low frequencies of deception by flexible subordinates.
