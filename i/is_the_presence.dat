5|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of Aravan's iconography <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of demonic canine teeth.

30|$|All {{kinds of}} {{persistent}} carotid-basilar anastomosis {{were present in}} our series. <b>The</b> most common <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of fetal pCom (23  %). From the other studied anatomic variants, <b>the</b> most common <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a hypoplastic A 1 segment. In all cases CTA was an excellent diagnostic tool, providing not only high-resolution angiographic images, but also details of the surrounding structures.|$|R

5|$|A {{more mundane}} example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has {{proposed}} that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice {{and with the}} historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> {{of acute}} thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain {{blood from the}} brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of}} the body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E

5|$|It {{may be that}} Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him as an ally of Cathal mac Finguine. The evidence for such involvement is limited. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report {{the presence of a}} Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix and the {{surrounding}} areas are also home {{to a wide variety}} of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E

5|$|Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to the mid 18th century BC. His main {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of seals of Sheshi and of two {{kings of}} the mid 13th Dynasty Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned {{at some point in}} the 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded by hills, Lam Tin {{does not}} have {{direct access to the}} Victoria Harbour. However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} energy supplier for {{electricity and gas}} is at the consumer's choice. Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a 2 megawatt (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, wired to the local sub-grid. It {{has the potential to}} produce 3.5million units of electricity a year, enough to power over a thousand homes.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Lhermitte's sign, a {{classical}} neurological sign, {{is a rare}} manifestation of vitamin B 12 deficiency. <b>The</b> aim here <b>was</b> to report on a case of an elderly patient with vitamin B 12 deficiency whose first clinical manifestation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Lhermitte's sign. CASE REPORT: We describe an elderly patient with vitamin B 12 deficiency who presented cognitive dysfunction, peripheral polyneuropathy and sensory ataxia, and whose first clinical manifestation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Lhermitte's sign. This sign <b>is</b> one of <b>the</b> rarest manifestations of vitamin B 12 deficiency...|$|R

5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch. A sign of this on Lismore <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of rock-cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate the changing sea-levels; {{in some areas of}} the northern coast they also betray the presence of ice by the striation marks on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation {{is the result of}} mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|Another factor {{pointing}} to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a port. From Deva, Ireland (Hibernia) was also accessible, a land which Agricola {{had plans to}} conquer; he even launched an expedition to Ireland, though where from is unclear. Also, the Flavian dynasty was expansionist, and Deva was closer to what would then have been the front, making administration quicker and easier. Furthermore, historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it was practically placed at {{the centre of the}} British isles, being located geographically at nearly the same distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland, the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel.|$|E
50|$|Other {{distinguishing}} features that differentiate Mallomonas cells from Synura cells <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of bristles and V-shaped ridges on their scales. Pore-collar complexes on stomatocysts are species differentiating features.|$|R
5000|$|The precursory {{requirement}} {{for the creation of}} a county in <b>the</b> 1850s <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a local gaol and courthouse.

Because Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener) had a jail and courthouse, the city became the county seat.|$|R

5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a monumental westwork.|$|E
