5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide. Many birds in the Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.|$|E
5|$|The dynamic soaring of {{albatrosses}} is inspiring to airplane designers: German {{aerospace engineer}} Johannes Traugott and colleagues have charted the albatross's nuanced <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> and {{are looking for}} ways to apply this to aircraft, especially in the area of drones and unmanned aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
50|$|Like other bees, A. texanus can {{fly from}} a short or long distance. Their <b>flight</b> <b>patterns</b> usually rely on flower density; they favor flowers with high densities. Their <b>flight</b> <b>patterns</b> best {{resemble}} the bumble bee and the honey bee.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>Patterns,</b> {{also known}} informally as Flying People, is a seven-panel {{photographic}} sculpture installation by David Joyce, {{designed to be}} installed in 1989 in Concourse A at the Eugene Airport in the U.S. state of Oregon. During airport construction in 2015-2016, it was moved to Lane Community College. The airport renovations were completed by early January 2017, but the airport management is studying how public art will be displayed, and has not decided yet whether <b>Flight</b> <b>Patterns</b> will be reinstalled.|$|R
5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches across North America {{from coast to}} coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan and stretches south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike <b>flight</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whites in Omaha have {{followed}} the white <b>flight</b> <b>pattern,</b> suburbanizing to West Omaha over time. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha. More recent Hispanic immigrants, concentrated in South Omaha, have struggled to earn living wages in meatpacking, adapt to a new society, and deal with discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with its white tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upperwing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upperparts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the royal tern can {{be confused with the}} adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less direct <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> and its lack of tail streamers.|$|E
50|$|Small {{differences}} in <b>flight</b> <b>patterns</b> {{have been observed}} in Canadian and Australian P. rapae, indicating {{that there may be}} slight variation between different geographic populations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} more random {{generators}} {{than in the}} original game. Sligs have random generated AI and some flying mines also have random <b>flight</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>Patterns</b> {{consists}} of approximately 130 black-and-white photographic cutouts of people, whimsically posed {{as if they}} were flying, on seven mural panels originally installed on the walls of Concourse A at Eugene Airport.|$|R
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
25|$|The male winter form rarely hilltops, has {{a random}} <b>flight</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{and is often}} found near forests. In cold weather, the winter form hibernates in holes or under {{overhanging}} rocks. Up to 35 individuals may gather together in these places.|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus is {{most notably}} parasitized by a nest parasite, Senotainia trilineata, a Miltogrammid fly. P. gibbosus {{utilizes}} a <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> {{in which it}} flies over the nest from above {{as a means of}} surveying its nest for the parasite, one that is different from other species of the same genus.|$|E
25|$|Reported UFOs {{are often}} far {{too small to}} support a crew {{traveling}} through space, and their reported flight behavior is often not representative of a craft under intelligent control (erratic <b>flight</b> <b>patterns,</b> sudden course changes).|$|R
25|$|It {{is unknown}} how these wasps {{communicate}} with each other, especially within the aggregates they form. However, the powerful residual odors, <b>flight</b> <b>patterns,</b> and flashy colors are all likely candidates for how they {{communicate with each}} other.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the game's storyline, {{other than the fact that}} Earth has been overrun by aliens. It is {{suggested}} through similar ship design and <b>flight</b> <b>patterns</b> that the aliens are the Cranassians of the previous games.|$|R
25|$|Maximum Noise Level – A maximum {{noise level}} of 95.0 dBA Single Event Noise Exposure Level, {{measured}} at noise monitor sites 1,500 feet from {{each end of the}} runway, is enforced 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are no additional noise monitoring stations along the <b>flight</b> <b>pattern,</b> which is routed entirely over residential neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|The airport, {{including}} both passenger terminal buildings, is {{mostly in the}} census-designated place of Fort Snelling in an unincorporated portion of Hennepin County. Small sections of the airport are within the city limits of Minneapolis and Richfield. The airport is across the Mississippi River from St. Paul. The airport's terminal exits are minutes from Mall of America; careful <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> planning ensures aircraft never fly over the mall at low altitude.|$|E
25|$|Many social wasp (Vespidae) species exhibit Müllerian mimicry, where a {{group of}} {{unpalatable}} species benefit from sharing the same kind of warning (aposematic) colouration. Wasps are decidedly noxious: nasty-tasting and with a painful sting. They form a Mullerian 'ring' of similarly coloured models; the wasps are often accompanied by clusters of hover-fly mimics, who tend to arrive at the flowers at a similar time of day, and whose <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> is passably similar to wasp flight.|$|E
5000|$|It {{would require}} a radical upgrade to the current <b>flight</b> <b>patterns</b> {{which are based on}} 1970s patterns, and the {{proximity}} to Dutch and Belgian airspace may cause knock-on effects in other countries if not planned properly like Heathrow.|$|R

25|$|The {{accident}} occurred around 7:20am, {{when the}} balloon {{was attempting to}} land after completing a partial figure-8 <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> over the Carterton area. The pilot had indicated to the chase team he was likely to land near Somerset Road, a rural through road just north of Carterton in the locality of Clareville. At first the balloon was heading north-east over Somerset Road, around 700metres east of the road's intersection with State Highway 2. Around 400metres north of Somerset Road, the balloon reversed direction and headed back towards the road. The two chase vehicles, carrying some {{of the family members}} of the passengers, positioned on the road ready to assist with the landing.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{population}} control {{has been used}} on species that cannot be excluded from the airport environment. A nesting colony of laughing gulls at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98-315 bird strikes per year, from 1979-1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually the gulls would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5-6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with laughing gulls decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more {{a function of the}} population reduction than the gulls altering their <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> (Dolbeer et al. 1993, Dolbeer et al. 2003, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E
25|$|Some paleontologists have {{doubted the}} biplane hypothesis, and have {{proposed}} other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander et al. described {{the construction of}} a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for Microraptor. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on Microraptor and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> for Microraptor. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of Microraptor which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur Hesperonychus, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{note the}} {{discovery}} of the program's means of transportation, rendition aircraft, by aviation enthusiasts, who spotted discrepancies in the flights of four aircraft, and correlations between their unusual <b>flight</b> <b>patterns</b> and the list of sites reputed to be the destination for ghost detainees.|$|R

He has had short stories published in journals including the London Magazine and Critical Quarterly.|$|R
500|$|The wing {{shape of}} Pteranodon {{suggests}} {{that it would have}} flown rather like a modern-day albatross. This is {{based on the fact that}} Pteranodon had a high aspect ratio (wingspan to chord length) similar to that of the albatross — 9:1 for Pteranodon, compared to 8:1 for an albatross. Albatrosses spend long stretches of time at sea fishing, and use a <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> called [...] "dynamic soaring" [...] which exploits the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface to travel long distances without flapping, and without the aid of thermals (which do not occur over the open ocean the same way they do over land). While most of a Pteranodon flight would have depended on soaring, like long-winged seabirds, it probably required an occasional active, rapid burst of flapping, and studies of Pteranodon wing loading (the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight, contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide.|$|E
500|$|The {{barn owl}} is a medium-sized, pale-coloured owl with long wings and a short, squarish tail. There is {{considerable}} size variation across the subspecies with a typical specimen measuring about [...] in overall length, {{with a full}} range of [...] across the species. Barn owls have a typical wingspan of some , with {{a full range of}} [...] Adult body mass is also variable with male owls from the Galapagos (T. a. punctatissima) weighing approximately [...] on average while male eastern barn owls (T. javanica) average [...] The full known weight range for the barn owl species can range from [...] In general, owls living on small islands are smaller and lighter, perhaps because they have a higher dependence on insect prey and need to be more manoeuvrable. However, the largest bodied race of barn owl, T. a. furcata from Cuba and Jamaica, is also an island race, albeit being found on more sizeable islands with larger prey and few larger owls competing for dietary resources. The shape of the tail is a means of distinguishing the barn owl from typical owls when seen in the air. Other distinguishing features are the undulating <b>flight</b> <b>pattern</b> and the dangling, feathered legs. The pale face with its heart shape and black eyes give the flying bird a distinctive appearance, like a flat mask with oversized, oblique black eye-slits, the ridge of feathers above the beak somewhat resembling a nose.|$|E
2500|$|Nickell {{concluded}} that the shape, movement, and sounds reported by witnesses were also consistent with the silhouette, <b>flight</b> <b>pattern,</b> and call of a startled barn owl perched on a tree limb, leading researchers to conclude that foliage beneath the owl may have created the illusion of the lower portions of the creature (described as being a pleated green skirt). Researchers also {{concluded that}} the witnesses' inability to agree on whether the creature had arms, combined with Kathleen May's report of it having [...] "small, claw-like hands" [...] which [...] "extended in front of it", also matched the description of a barn owl with its talons gripping a tree branch.|$|E
