40|$|At this, {{the dawn}} of the 21 st century, Korean society can be said to have entered a {{transitional}} period characterized by notions such as globalization, informatization, and localization. In this regard, localization has served as a launching point for a new round of democratization and the facilitation of globalization and informatization. In addition, localization has been carried out by local autonomous entities in accordance with the concept of regional development as the foundation for national development. Along with these changes that have taken place at the macroscopic level, society has also been faced with a new growth and development paradigm characterized by the notion of low-carbon green growth. In this new environment, the development of human resources has come to play an even more enhanced role in the <b>invigoration</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>industries</b> and economic growth. As such, {{the time has come for}} both central and local governments to pay increased attention to the development of human resources and the support thereof. Here, various elements which greatly influence regional development can be suggested. That being said, the securing of human resources and the improvement of the quality of human resources remain key elements that cannot be ignored. To this end, the activation of a regional human resources development (HRD) policy requires the following: an analysis of the current state of such policy, the establishment of a regional green growth human resources development (HRD) system that is based on the notions of specialization and necessity, and the effective management of this system as a tool for regional development. ...|$|R

40|$|Korkut, Umut (Dogus Author) This paper {{argues that}} democratization does not {{necessarily}} bring <b>invigoration</b> <b>of</b> civil society in post-transition countries. Rather than taking for granted democratization as {{a positive effect on}} the development of civil society, democratic theory should magnify the conditions under which democratization will {{have a positive impact on}} the development of civil society in post-transition countries. In order for that one should put institutionalization of policy-making and internal democracy in civil society organizations under scope. In this sense the main argument of the paper is the following: to an extent that elitism remains embedded into the operations of the political and civil societies during the democratic consolidation period, the effect of democratization on the <b>invigoration</b> <b>of</b> civil society will be crippled. Hungary and Poland are the case studies for this paper...|$|R

The integrated smoke emission dataset improves the prediction of modeled AODs. We find that the modeled cloud properties and precipitation are extremely sensitive to the smoke loadings.
