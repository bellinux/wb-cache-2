500|$|The {{version of}} [...] "Resentment" [...] on B'Day {{contained}} writing and production credits for Beyoncé {{along with the}} team {{who worked on the}} original version of the song. During an interview with 4Music, the singer talked about the song, saying, [...] "The song on my new album [...] I am [...] proudest of is probably 'Resentment'. I feel like vocally I've grown, I feel like all the chord changes and the beautiful harmonies and the lyrics <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really am proud of".|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{created a}} pair of razor-blade sunglasses—which she {{believed}} portrayed tough female spirit—to wear in the video, explaining [...] "I wanted to design a pair {{for some of the}} toughest chicks and some of my girlfriends ... they used to keep razor blades in the side of their mouths ... That tough female spirit <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to project. It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity." [...] The white latex suits in the video were inspired by the wolf costume from the film Where the Wild Things Are. Gaga also wore designer Alexander McQueen's [...] high shoes and the famous [...] "Alien" [...] shoes.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2003, Cousins {{injured his}} ankle {{in a game}} against Hawthorn but played on through five weeks of pain-killing injections. In Round 15, 2004, he injured his back and missed six games. Cousins said, [...] "That injury <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got over and am {{probably}} no chance of getting a relapse... The other side to it is, because I have played 10 years of consistent AFL footy, I've probably got an older back than someone my age". In Round 1, 2005, he dislocated a finger and missed one round after undergoing an operation. West Coast chief executive Trevor Nesbitt said, [...] "There's no doubt that he's at his best when under pressure and he's so resilient; he plays with injuries that other players wouldn't".|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{film critic}} Stephen Hunter, a {{historian}} of the era, said: [...] "Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, and that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am afraid has been lost to history....he presence of the Loyalists (colonists {{who did not want}} to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties." [...] The historian Richard F. Snow, editor of American Heritage magazine, said of the church-burning scene: [...] "Of course it never happened—if it had do you think Americans would have forgotten it? It could have kept us out of World War I." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October, 2013, megachurch pastor Bishop Jim Swilley {{came out}} to his congregation. The YouTube video of the service went viral. Interviews with People magazine, Joy Behar, Don Lemon ABC News and NPR focused on the bullycides that {{prompted}} Bishop Swilley to [...] "come out". One year and five years later, he confirmed the costs but also the freedom he has experienced. [...] "To {{be able to have}} freedom <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't trade anything for."

2500|$|Winwood recalled, [...] "There were no chord sheets, no nothing. [...] He [...] {{just started}} playing. [...] It was a one-take job, with him singing and {{playing at the}} same time. [...] He just had such mastery of the {{instrument}} and {{he knew what he}} was and knew his abilities". [...] Engineer Eddie Kramer saw it differently: [...] "The idea that these jam sessions were informal <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> completely disagree with. [...] They may have seemed casual to the outside observer, but Jimi plotted and planned out nearly all of them. [...] He'd reason that if he had his songs together, if he really wanted to pull out what he heard in his head, he needed the right people... and that's what he did". [...] During the recording session, Hendrix is heard advising Winwood on his organ part.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E

2500|$|Philip Liechty, {{a senior}} CIA officer in Indonesia, stated: [...] "I saw {{intelligence}} {{that came from}} hard, firm sources in East Timor.

We knew the place was a free-fire zone and that Suharto was given the green light by the United States {{to do what he}} did. We sent the Indonesian generals everything that you need to fight a major war against somebody who doesn't have any guns. We sent them rifles, ammunition, mortars, grenades, food, helicopters. You name it; they got it. ... None of that got out in the media. No one gave a damn. It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will be forever ashamed of. The only justification I ever heard for what we were doing was the concern that East Timor {{was on the verge of}} being accepted as a new member of the United Nations and there was a chance that the country was going to be either leftist or neutralist and not likely to vote [...] at the UN.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't think ever happened before.

5000|$|Haynes was {{considered}} to be among the greatest ballhandlers who ever lived.
