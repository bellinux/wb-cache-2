500|$|Section 1 of the Act inserts {{sections}} 43A to L {{into the}} Employment Rights Act 1996, titled [...] "Protected Disclosures". It provides that a disclosure which the whistleblower makes to their employer, a [...] "prescribed person", {{in the course}} of seeking legal advice, Ministers of the Crown, individuals appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose, or, in limited circumstances, [...] "any other person", is protected. In addition, the disclosure must be one which the whistleblower [...] "reasonably believes" [...] shows a criminal offence, a failure to comply with legal obligations, a miscarriage of justice, danger to {{the health and safety of}} employees, damage to the environment, or the hiding of information which would show any of the above actions. These disclosures do not have to be of confidential information, and this section does not abolish the public interest defence; in addition, it can be the disclosure of information about actions which have already occurred, are occurring, or could occur in the future. In Miklaszewicz v Stolt Offshore Ltd, the Employment Appeal Tribunal confirmed that the disclosure does not have to have been made after the Act came into force; it is sufficient for the dismissal or other persecution by the employer to have <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> time.|$|E

Couples who have left their youth behind them have their own little romance quite as much as their juniors, and it is occasionally the more heartfelt of the two.|$|E
60|$|He {{never quite}} knew what <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> There {{was a horrible}} crash, and the {{schooner}} appeared to be rolling over bodily. The spokes he clung to desperately reft themselves from his grasp, the deck slanted until one could not stand upon it, and something heavy struck him on the head. He dropped, and Dampier flung himself upon the wheel above his senseless body.|$|E
60|$|Of what <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> Martin did {{not know}} much, except that the man seemed very happy after feeding him. He set Martin {{on the back of}} a horse, then jumped and danced round him, making funny chuckling noises, after which he rolled horse-like on the grass, his arms and legs up in the air, and finally, pulling Martin down, he made him roll too.|$|E

60|$|Of what <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> I {{have only}} a {{confused}} recollection.

60|$|Evelyn {{never could}} {{remember}} distinctly what <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> She {{had only a}} hazy recollection of climbing upon the mule and trying to cling there, while the man trotted beside her carrying a long, iron-pointed staff.

And there they had stopped at a small hacienda, where Evelyn was hospitably received.|$|E

Only in one way did she believe in Stede Bonnet, and <b>that</b> was, <b>that</b> <b>after</b> some fashion or another he would come between her and her bright dreams for her dear Dickory.|$|R

Labia tells Pink why all the Yin Monsters are after her, because she has a latent ability to purify them. Labia managed to wound the sisters and keep them at bay. Pink stood before the mutated Anne as she can only watch in horror as the Slave Eel impales Pink {{straight}} through her body. Whatever <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> is unknown.|$|R

60|$|I was too dazed {{to realise}} very clearly what <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that.</b> Dompierre, I know, kicked {{open the door}} of the house, and the crowd rushed in, in his wake.

I must have gone on mechanically, almost unconsciously, for the next thing that I remember with any distinctness was that I found myself once more speeding down the Rue Blanche, with all the yelling and shouting some little way behind me.|$|E
60|$|Also, as is {{commonly}} {{the case with}} bold and beautiful women, she was popular among them, especially as she was just and very liberal to the poor. These were many, as the country was over-populated, which accounted for its wonderful state of cultivation. Lastly they trusted to her skill and courage to defend them from the continual attacks of the Mountain tribes who raided their crops and herds. Their one grievance against her {{was that she had}} no child to whom the khanship could descend, which meant that after her death, as had <b>happened</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> of her father, there would be struggles for the succession.|$|E

[...] Peck believes U.S. Middle East policy should be more balanced and even-handed. He urges a dialogue with and between all parties as the most productive way to resolve the region's problems, which are large, numerous and contentious.|$|R

In each step, all possible events having threshold capillary occurrence pressure higher than the current capillary pressure in the network, will <b>happen.</b> <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> fluid’s saturations in the entire network element are updated (using the same Eqs.  10 – 15, but with θr replaced by θh,i) and printed in the outputs along with the current capillary pressure.|$|R
