5|$|Early on March28, an upper-level low tracked eastward {{into the}} Southern United States {{along with its}} {{associated}} shortwave trough, sending the subtropical jet through Texas and bringing along with it strong west-northwesterly winds in the upper-levels of the troposphere. Concurrently, a cold front extended zonally tracked south across the Great Plains before eventually stalling near the Red River valley, providing an additional <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> for storm development. Favorable conditions for severe weather were expected ahead of the upper-level low over areas of North Texas; accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center(SPC) issued a moderate risk for severe weather for the region, citing an unstable atmosphere caused by steep lapse rates of 7.5-8.0°C/km and high convective available potential energy values. The environment {{was expected to be}} conducive for the development of supercells as the warped subtropical jet produced strong wind shear over Texas.|$|E
5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design to make it better suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1892, Ellen Swallow Richards {{called for}} the [...] "christening of a new science" [...] – [...] "oekology" [...] (ecology) in a Boston lecture. This new science {{included}} the study of [...] "consumer nutrition" [...] and environmental education. This interdisciplinary branch of science was later specialized into what is currently known as ecology, while the consumer nutrition focus split off and was eventually relabeled as home economics., which provided another avenue for women to study science. Richards helped to form the American Home Economics Association, which published a journal, the Journal of Home Economics, and hosted conferences. Home economics departments were formed at many colleges, especially at land grant institutions. In her work at MIT, Ellen Richards also introduced the first biology course in its history {{as well as the}} <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> of sanitary engineering.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeology at La Trobe University {{is taught}} within the Department of Archaeology and History (School of Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Arts, Social Science and Commerce) and was graded {{at the highest}} level {{possible}} (5) for research in the 2012 and 2015 Excellence for Research in Australia initiative (ERA). La Trobe Archaeology has major focuses in Australian Indigenous Archaeology, African Archaeology and Palaeoanthropology, Palaeolithic Archaeology, Middle Eastern Prehistoric Archaeology, Australian Historical Archaeology, Biomolecular Archaeology, Asian Archaeology, Archaeology and GIS, Geoarchaeology and Archaeological Geophysics. La Trobe Archaeology currently runs excavations, field schools and conducts research in Australia, Jordan, South Africa, Kenya, Bulgaria, and Sri Lanka. This includes the Australian Palaeoanthropological and Geoarchaeology Field School at the Drimolen early hominin site in South Africa, run jointly with the University of Johannesburg since 2013. Archaeology is also aligned to La Trobe's research <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> in Transforming Human Societies. In 2011 the university, in conjunction with the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and Andy Herries, an associate professor, built the Australian Archaeomagnetism Laboratory (TAAL), based within the Department of Archaeology, Environment and Community Planning. The main aim and focus of research in the laboratory is promoting the use of magnetic methods of analysis (palaeomagnetism, rock magnetism, archaeomagnetic dating and magnetostratigraphy) for understanding the age, palaeoenvironmental/climate context and site formation history of archaeological and fossil sites, as well as archaeometric archaeometry) analysis of archaeological artefacts for understanding behavioural information such as material sourcing and the development of pyrotechnology. The laboratory also undertakes other research with the Department of Physics, including comparative work at the Australian Synchrotron. In conjunction with the Geomagnetism Laboratory at the University of Liverpool, TAAL has a major focus on reconstructing palaeosecular variation from southern hemisphere archaeological sources (mostly in Australia and southern Africa) over the last 5 Ma, with the aim of constructing an Australian Archaeomagnetic Curve. This currently includes work on the 50 ka long sequence of human occupation at Lake Mungo in Australia where La Trobe Archaeology directs field excavations and survey. In 2011 the laboratory was involved in dating the age of the new South African hominin species Australopithecus sediba, which was published in the journal [...] "Science". TAAL's director, Andy Herries is currently an Australian Research Council funded Future Fellow in the Geochronology of Human Evolution and is a recognised world leader in the magnetic analysis of karst deposits (caves sediments and speleothem, e.g., stalagmites). He been responsible with colleagues for providing many of the first dates for South African hominin sites. African Archaeology and Paleoanthropology is a major focus of the TAAL and archaeology at La Trobe. Main focuses of research in the laboratory are 1) the role of heat treatment of stone for the manufacture of stone tools in the archaeological record; 2) the age of Australian marsupial fossil sites; 3) creating a chronological framework for the Palaeolithic and human evolution in Africa and Asia; 4) reconstructing occupation intensity, spatial patterning, fire use and palaeoclimatic records from archaeological sites. La Trobe Archaeology in conjunction with the School of Molecular Sciences also runs a stable isotope facility directed by Colin Smith, an ARC Future Fellow. The laboratory's main research emphasis is investigating the preservation of biomolecules in archaeological skeletal tissue and how this affects the information they contain.|$|E
