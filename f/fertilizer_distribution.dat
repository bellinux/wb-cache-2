[...] The subsidy programs often suffered from multiple problems. Inefficient bureaucracies contributed to delays in fertilizer delivery. Overstaffing and lack of efficiency incentives increased overall program costs. In cases of inadequate budgets, fertilizer was rationed, barring farmers from accessing sufficient amounts to apply to their crops. Finally, below market-level pricing disincentivized and displaced private distributors of fertilizer who no longer found it economically feasible to compete with subsidized fertilizer.

40|$|Background: Broadcast <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distribution</b> using spinner-disc {{spreaders}} {{equipped with}} variable-rate technology {{has become a}} widely adopted practice. However, a few spinner-disc spreaders provide dual bins permitting the independent metering of two products. The questions at hand does the individual <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern vary if two products are applied in blended form or independently metered onto the spinner discs. Therefore, this study compares the distribution uniformity of a common phosphorus and potassium fertilizers applied using variable-rate technology in blended versus independently metered forms. Methods: A common US spinner-disc spreader with a dual bin, {{and the ability to}} independently meter two products onto the spinner-discs was used for this study. Prior to spreading fertilizer, particle analysis determined that the bulk density of diammonium phosphate (DAP), muriate of potash, and a blended fertilizer (10 - 26 - 26) were 1009, 1105, and 1025 kg m- 3, respectively. All three fertilizer mixtures were broadcast and nutrient distributions determined using standard procedures. Different spinner disc speeds (600, 700 and 800 RPM) and application rates (220 and 440 kg ha- 1) were included as treatments. Results and discussions: Results indicated differences between independently metered DAP and potash versus blended. Distribution patterns did not vary at the different application rates. Also, {{it was found that the}} application rate and divider position had no effect on the efficiency of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distribution,</b> while the disc speed improved distribution uniformity.

40|$|Agricultural {{subsidies}} {{that encourage}} production and productivity {{have been widely}} criticized {{because of the cost}} of subsidies and they are perceived to be far from uniformly distributed. There is a general view in academic, policy and political circles that agricultural subsidies are concentrated geographically, they are concentrated on relatively few crops and few producers and in many cases do not reach the targeted group(s). One of the most contentious issues surrounding input subsidies in general and fertilizer in particular in India is how much of what is paid out actually finds its way into the pocket of the farmer, and how much is siphoned away by the input companies. There has also been a debate about the issue of real beneficiaries of fertilizer subsidy like small vs. large farmers, well-developed vs. less developed regions, etc. Therefore, there is need to understand the <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy <b>distribution</b> pattern to assess whether the subsidy benefits the target group(s), an argument often made while giving any farm subsidy. This paper examines trends in fertilizer subsidy and the issue of <b>distribution</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> subsidies between farmers and fertilizer industry, across regions/states, crops and different farm sizes. The study shows that fertilizer subsidy has increased significantly in the post-reforms period from Rs. 4389 crore in 1990 - 91 to Rs. 75849 crore in 2008 - 09. As a percentage of GDP, this represents an increase from 0. 85 per cent in 1990 - 91 to 1. 52 per cent in 2008 - 09. The paper shows that general perception that about one-third of fertilizer subsidy goes to fertilizer industry is misleading because the underlying assumptions (i) that India’s entry into world market as an importer does not affect world prices, and (ii) world fertilizer markets are perfectly competitive, do not hold true. The world fertilizer trade-flows and markets are more concentrated and volatile and imports by India have significant impact on world prices. Moreover, with shift from the earlier cost-plus based approach to import parity pricing (IPP), the Indian fertilizer industry would be exposed to the world competition and efficient units would survive. Therefore, the proposed policy of direct transfer of fertilizer subsidy to farmers is misconceived and inappropriate and its adverse effects outweigh the perceived benefits of it. The study shows that fertilizer subsidy is more concentrated in few states, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab. Inter-state disparity in <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy <b>distribution</b> is still high though it has declined over the years. Rice is the most heavily subsidized crop followed by wheat, sugarcane and cotton. These four crops account for about two-third of total fertilizer subsidy. The study highlights the existence of fair degree of equity in <b>distribution</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> subsidy among farm sizes. The small and marginal farmers have a larger share in fertilizer subsidy in comparison to their share in cultivated area. A reduction in fertilizer subsidy is, therefore, likely to have adverse impact on farm production and income of small and marginal farmers as they do not benefit from higher output prices but do benefit from lower input prices. This paper justifies the fertilizer subsidies and questions the rationale for direct transfer of subsidy to farmers. ...|$|R

Required urea fertilizer was applied in four stages: before planting, in seven leaves stage, shooting stage and earring stage. The first stage was accomplished by traditional method and other stages were applied with irrigation water (fertigation). Fertigation timing was respectively 60, 35, and 20 min in the three fertigation stages. Results showed that distribution uniformity of water and fertilizer of low half (DULH) provided high values for all experiments.
