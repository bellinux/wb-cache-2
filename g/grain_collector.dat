40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the possibility of using agricultural products as direct solar energy collectors in solar energy crop drying systems by determining the solar absorptance and emittance properties, and collector efficiencies of the products. For a good grain solar energy absorber, such a system would result in considerable savings in the equipment and maintenance costs, and would be more suitable to developing countries. Solar absorptances and collector efficiencies of grain absorbers were determined by calorimetric technique and compared, under identical conditions, with those of a reference standard-flat-black paint-which is known to be a good solar energy absorber. Seven experiments were conducted under relatively clear sky conditions using previously dried wheat, brown rice, white rice, brown beans, yellow corn, Peanuts in-shell and cowpeas (black-eyed white beans) as grain absorbers. The relative absorptance (ratio of the total solar energy absorbed by the grain and the reference flat-black paint) and the relative efficiency (ratio of useful energy gain by the <b>grain</b> <b>collector</b> and the reference flat-black paint collector) were also obtained for the seven grain absorbers. The experimental results obtained showed that the solar absorptance and collector efficiency of the flat-black paint varied from 0. 97 to 0. 91 and 0. 524 to 0. 638, respectively, for solar angle of incidence ranging from 38. 5 to 58. 9 Â°. A relative absorptance and relative efficiency of 80 percent with respect to the reference flat-black paint was used as a criterion for determining the performance of each grain as a good solar energy absorber. All the seven products tested, except white rice, had relative absorptances and relative efficiencies above the 80 percent rating. Peanuts in-shell had the highest relative solar absorptance and relative efficiency of 0. 967 and 1. 09, respectively, with the corresponding values of 0. 726 and 0. 718 for white rice. Colour, porosity, surface roughness, and the amount of exposed surface area seemed to affect the solar absorption characteristics and collector efficiencies of these agricultural products. As far as absorption of solar energy and heat exchange with the drying air are concerned, the six different grains tested and most other agricultural products could be effectively used as absorbers in solar energy crop drying systems. The major hindrance might be consideration for handling ease and possible reduction in the air drying effectiveness due to the level of and variations in outdoor air relative humidity, and initial grain moisture content. The material cost for a covered metal flat-plate solar energy collector is estimated at about $ 2. 00 /m 2 more than for a covered <b>grain</b> <b>collector...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} and fate of particles including microorganisms during physico-chemical filtration in natural and engineered aquatic environments remains essential for effective and sustainable drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation, {{as well as}} understanding and assessing the risk of environmental contamination of water supplies. The development of models to predict particle deposition by physico-chemical filtration has been ongoing since the 1960 ’s. What is now considered classical colloid filtration theory (CFT) {{was developed in the}} 1970 ’s to predict particle removal during granular media filtration used for drinking water treatment. More recently, CFT has been applied to various applications related to subsurface particle and microbial {{transport and}} fate, including riverbank filtration, aquifer storage and recovery, bioremediation, and assessment of contaminant transport and fate. Significant discrepancies between predictions of particle deposition from current CFT models and experimental observations have been reported. While several model variations of CFT have been reported, models focusing on integration of impacts of collector surface geometry and physically-based mechanisms such as hydrodynamics have been rarely reported. The overall goal of this work was to describe and evaluate the contribution of media <b>grain</b> (<b>collector)</b> surface roughness on particle removal by physico-chemical filtration. Four phases of experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of surface roughness on particle deposition in porous media and parallel plate systems. Bench scale “proof of concept” experiments (Phase I) were conducted using small filtration columns, two sizes of colloidal particles (1. 0 and 4. 5 μm diameter polystyrene microspheres), two sizes of glass beads (0. 71 to 0. 85 mm and 0. 5 to 0. 595 mm), and three different levels of surface roughness. The experiments demonstrated that surface roughness not only enhanced particle deposition, but also decreased it. Classic colloid filtration theory, chemical heterogeneity, and hydrophobicity fail to explain this non-linear, non-monotonic impact of surface roughness on particle deposition; particularly decreased deposition resulting from increased surface roughness. The results indicated the existence of a minimum particle deposition efficiency that is unique to each combination of sizes of colloidal particle, collector, and collector roughness. To verify this research finding, particle deposition experiments were conducted using a parallel plate chamber (Phase II) to further confirm and characterize the contribution of surface roughness to particle deposition. The impacts of different nano-scale quartz surface roughness sizes (10, 20, 50, 200 and 400 nm) on deposition kinetics of three sizes (0. 55, 0. 985 and 1. 765 μm) of polystyrene microspheres suspended in 100 mM KCl were examined. A non-linear, non-monotonic relationship between surface roughness and particle deposition flux was again observed. A critical roughness size associated with a minimum deposition flux was identified for the experimental conditions investigated. A numerical model approach incorporating the effect of surface roughness on flow field profile, hydrodynamic retardation functions, and DLVO interaction energy was developed for a parallel plate chamber system (Phase III). Key physical and chemical properties of the flow field, colloids and the modified rough surface were precisely measured and utilized in the simulation. Changes to the flow field, the hydrodynamic retardation functions, and the DLVO interaction energy due to the presence of nano-scale collector surface roughness were implemented in the developed model. The numerical solutions obtained using the developed model had excellent agreement with the experimental results obtained in research Phase II. This work provided a mathematical framework that was more applicable to real practice by including the effect of the collector surface roughness on particle deposition. The importance of the gravity effect was identified, underscoring the importance of precise measurements of particle size and density for model development. The verified model framework developed for a parallel plat chamber in Phase III was extended to spherical geometry and utilized to simulate particle deposition behavior in porous media in Phase IV. Functions that were validated in Phase III for the flow field profile, the hydrodynamic retardation functions, and the DLVO interaction energy were utilized. Various operational scenarios including particle size, loading rate and ionic strength were investigated. The Phase IV results could also be used to explain experimental results observed in the porous media experiments (Phase I). It was found that the presence of nano-scale surface roughness was able to improve the particle deposition on spherical collectors; the enhancement became more significant when roughness element height increased. Overall, this work demonstrated that nano-scale surface roughness and associated hydrodynamics can impact on particle deposition. These impacts can and should be incorporated into predictive mathematical models of clean bed colloidal particle deposition. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Sun drying is the {{traditional}} method for drying and still preferred in Asia because cheap compared to mechanical drying. Since it uses the sun as heat source it is friendly to the environment, many farmers, <b>grain</b> <b>collectors,</b> traders and millersoften dry their paddy on pavements that specifically constructed for drying. Sundrying pavements have the advantages of high capacity and thus economics of scale, but the weakness is very dependent on the weather. The amount of paddy that can be dried with a drying depends {{on the number of}} sunny days, so {{it is important to know}} the probabilities of rainy day based on the historical climate data in a region. From these, simulations can be done to calculate how many dryer machines should be provided to overcome the lack of drying capacity. This methodis known as Monte Carlo. This paper presents a study to determine the amount mechanical dryer needed based on the failure probability of sun drying pavements using monte carlo simulation methods in the District of Ciomas, Bogor. The study results based on 10 years daily rainfall data the probability of rainy days in March (0. 62) was greater than in September (0, 37), so that the total capacity of dryer machine to be prepared is 110 tons/ day.

40|$|In {{this work}} the problem {{related to the}} {{transport}} of nanoparticles in anisotropic porous media is investigated numerically using the multipoint flux approximation. Anisotropy of porous media properties are an essential feature that exist almost everywhere in subsurface formations. In anisotropic media, the flux and the pressure gradient vectors are no longer collinear and therefore interesting patterns emerge. The transport of nanoparticles in subsurface formations is affected by several complex processes including surface charges, heterogeneity of nanoparticles and soil <b>grain</b> <b>collectors,</b> interfacial dynamics of double-layer and many others. We use {{the framework of the}} theory of filtration in this investigation. Processes like particles deposition, entrapment, as well as detachment are accounted for. From the numerical methods point of view, traditional two-point flux finite difference approximation cannot handle anisotropy of media properties. Therefore, in this work we use the multipoint flux approximation (MPFA). In this technique, the flux components are affected by more neighboring points as opposed to the mere two points that are usually used in traditional finite volume methods. We also use the experimenting pressure field approach which automatically constructs the global system of equations by solving multitude of local problems. This approach facilitates to a large extent the construction of the global system. A set of numerical examples is considered involving two-dimensional rectangular domain. A source of nanoparticles is inserted {{in the middle of the}} anisotropic layer. We investigate the effects of both anisotropy angle and anisotropy ratio on the transport of nanoparticles in saturated porous media. It is found that the concentration plume and porosity contours follow closely the principal direction of anisotropy of permeability of the central domain...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) {{is caused}} by a species complex of Fusarium and Microdochium. This disease, common in wheat, can induce losses of yield but also degrade safety quality of grains. Indeed, the most common species of Fusarium in France is Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph=Gibberella zeae) and it can produce toxins, in {{particular}} deoxynivalenol (DON) regulated by the European Commission for cereals intended for human consumption. As this standard has been in effect since July 1 st 2006, it is critical for grain producers and processors to have a better knowledge of DON content as well as the factors influencing its level and the agronomic practices that reduce risk. Therefore, ARVALIS - Institut du vegetal has developed decision-making tools to help them manage this risk of grain contamination before its commercialisation. Three kinds of approaches have been performed: a decision-grid to help farmers spray, an epidemiologic model to assess the risk of infection by F. graminearum spores and a statistical model to predict DON content in grain before harvest. Decision grid and statistical model have been developed by exploiting data from a field survey started in 2001 in collaboration with grain store partners. Over 2700 field samples were harvested and analysed for their DON content. For each field, agronomic parameters and weather conditions during flowering were recorded. A variance analysis has led to the identification of critical factors involved in DON content, namely: the previous crop, the tillage practice, the susceptibility of wheat varieties to DON and the sum of rain around flowering. These factors have been integrated in a DON risk assessment grid which classifies risk categories according to agronomy and weather. This grid is now used by farmers to help them spray or not at flowering. Although this grid is useful for farmers, a model has been set up for <b>grain</b> <b>collectors</b> in order to manage DON risk in silo. The model is based on a linear regression with the backward selection method applied to agronomic and weather parameters. The reliability of these models have been evaluated through a cross validation and show an efficiency modelling (EF) of about 40...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of microstructural stability in an alloy depends {{not only on}} a sound knowledge of the thermodynamics of the system {{but also of the}} kinetics of the phase changes involved. Conventionally, precipitate growth mechanisms have been inferred from the variation with aging time of various single parameters such as the mean, mode or maximum of the precipitate size distribution, which has then been compared to theoretical models of growth of an individual precipitate. In the present study, the development, with aging time at 1003 K (730 °C), of the size and shape distributions of grain boundary precipitates in Co- 20 Fe has been examined to determine the rate-controlling processes, and the conclusions compared to those from conventional analysis. The growth of the precipitates was well described by the <b>grain</b> boundary-dependent <b>collector</b> plate mechanism of Brailsford and Aaron.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} virus transport in physically and geochemically heterogeneous subsurface porous media is presented. The model involves {{solution of the}} advection–dispersion equation, which additionally considers virus inactivation in the solution, as well as virus removal at the solid matrix surface due to attachment (deposition), release, and inactivation. Two surface inactivation models for the fate of attached inactive viruses and their subsequent role on virus attachment and release were considered. Geochemical heterogeneity, portrayed as patches of positively charged metal oxyhydroxide coatings on <b>collector</b> <b>grain</b> surfaces, and physical heterogeneity, portrayed as spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, were incorporated in the model. Both layered and randomly (log-normally) distributed physical and geochemical heterogeneities were considered. The upstream weighted multiple cell balance method was employed to numerically solve the governing equations of groundwater flow and virus transport.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to assess the impact of}} media aging on Cryptosporidium parvum transport and retention in granular filters. Column experiments were conducted with sand, anthracite and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. All columns possessed an identical filter design and grain size distribution. Oocyst removal was evaluated with both new and aged media. The variation of performance amongst new media was attributed to the shape of the tested granular media and to the concentration of extractable metals on the surface of <b>collector</b> <b>grains.</b> Media aging significantly increased the treatment performance of sand (26 %) and of GAC (31 %) but had no influence on the performance of anthracite. This enhanced performance of aged media correlated well with the extent of biofilm development. The best removal performance was observed with aged GAC (71 ± 2 %) which supported the highest amount of biomass according to polysaccharide and protein measurements. The results of this investigation are of particular interest as they suggest that media aging increases the removal of protozoan parasites in full-scale granular filters.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have been}} one of the most studied nanoparticles and incorporated into various consumer products. It has been reported that CNTs can enter groundwater systems by accidental or intentional release into the subsurface. As transport mechanisms of CNTs are not well understood, investigation on mobility of CNTs in the subsurface will be helpful to define disposal regulations of CNTs. The objective in this study is to investigate the effect of solution chemistry (pH and ionic strength) and physical factors (<b>collector</b> <b>grain</b> size and flow rate) on the transport of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). One-dimensional convection-dispersion model incorporated with collector efficiency for cylindrical nanoparticles was used to simulate the transport of MWCNTs in porous media. It was observed that higher pH led to increase in mobility of MWCNTs. The critical point of ionic strength for MWCNTs getting mobilized was narrowed down in the range of 2 to 5 mM. It was observed that the finer porous media could retain more nanoparticles.

40|$|Values of {{the applied}} {{hydrodynamic}} torque (T aplied) and the resisting adhesive torque (Tadhesion) {{will determine whether}} a colloid will be immobilized (T aplied Tadhesion) or roll (Tapplied &# 62; Tapplied) on a solid water interface. Previous literature has demonstrated in 1 - 2 <b>collector</b> (<b>grain)</b> systems that the influence of Tapplied on colloid retention can be significant under unfavorable attachment conditions and that {{only a fraction of}} the solid surface may contribute to retention. However, many questions remain on how to obtain, analyze, and upscale information on the forces and torques that act on colloids near solid surfaces in porous media. To address some of these gaps in knowledge, high resolution pore-scale water flow simulations were conducted for sphere packs (25 spheres) over a range of Darcy velocities, grain sizes and distributions, and porosities. The spatial variability of T aplied was calculated from this information, and successfully described using a lognormal cumulative density function (CDF). Linear interpolation and scaling techniques were subsequently used to predict the lognormal CDF of T applied for various colloid sizes, grain sizes and distributions, and water velocities. The lognormal CDF of T applied was then evaluated at select values of Tadhesion (i. e, interaction energy) to quantify the fraction and locations on the solid surface that contributes to colloid retention (Sf), and the theoretical maximum solid phase concentration of retained colloids (Smax) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and deposition of colloidal particles in porous media are important phenomena involved in many environmental and engineering problems as, for instance, {{the use of}} micro- and nanoscale zerovalent iron, a promising reagent {{in the field of}} groundwater remediation [1]. Particle {{transport and}} deposition in the proximity of injection or pumping wells and in porous media in general may also be relevant in other fields of chemical and petroleum engineering. Mathematical models able to predict particles transport and deposition in porous media are often needed in order to design field applications. The basic concept of these models is the single collector efficiency η, which predicts particles deposition onto a single grain of a complex porous medium in terms of probability that an approaching particle would be retained on a solid grain. Many different approaches and equations exist in the literature, however most of them are valid only under specific conditions (eg. specific range of flow rate, particle size, etc.), and predict, for certain parametric conditions, efficiency values exceeding unity, which is, for an efficiency concept, a contradiction [2][3]. The objectives of this study are to analyze the causes of the failure of the existing models in predicting the deposition rate in certain conditions and to modify the definition of collector efficiency {{in order to have a}} more general equation. The definition of collector efficiency, first proposed by Yao at al. [4], is based on the particles deposition onto a spherical <b>grain</b> (the <b>collector)</b> in an infinite domain. It is defined as the ration between the flux of particles that deposit on the grain and the total amount of particles that could reach the collector by advective flux from an area equal to the projection of the spherical grain itself. In the present work Yao's model has been implemented by COMSOL Multiphysics and solved with an Eulerian approach; particles deposition simulations were run. From these results a new definition of η is proposed, considering all the flux that potentially reach the collector. A new equation, valid in a broader range of parameters (eg. low Pe number, big particle size, etc.), has been formulated starting from the numerical result...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies were undertaken {{to explore the}} coupling effects of chemical conditions and pore space geometry on bacteria transport in porous media. The retention of Escherichia coli D 21 g was investigated {{in a series of}} batch and column experiments with solutions of different ionic strength (IS) and ultra pure quartz sand. DLVO calculations and results from batch experiments suggested that bacteria attachment to the sand surface was negligible when the IS was {{less than or equal to}} 50 mM. Breakthrough data from column experiments showed significant cell retention was strongly depending on the IS. This finding indicates that cell retention was dependent on the depth of the secondary energy minimum which increased with IS. When the IS of the influent solution was decreased to 1 mM only a small fraction of the retained bacteria were released from the column. The remaining retained bacteria, however, were recovered from the sand that was excavated from the column and then placed in excess amounts of solution having the original IS. These observations suggest that the solution chemistry is not the only mechanism controlling bacteria retention in the porous media. Computational simulations of flow around several <b>collector</b> <b>grains</b> revealed another retention mechanism, which is dependent on both the solution chemistry and the pore space geometry. Simulations demonstrate that the pore space geometry created low velocity regions. The number of bacterial cells that may be transported to these relatively “immobile” regions will theoretically be dependent on the depth of the secondary energy minimum (IS). Once the bacteria are trapped in these immobile regions, reduction of the secondary energy minimum does not necessarily release them due to hydrodynamic constraints...|$|R
