My first {{response was to}} study the photograph of the dead president; after closely covering his comings and goings {{for the past several}} months, it struck me as odd that the first time that I would see his face was in a newspaper article announcing his death. Then I felt frustration bordering on exasperation. As a political officer at the U. S. Mission to the United Nations who was assigned to cover Rwanda, I had spent the last part of March consumed by the negotiations on the mandate extension of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). Although many of the Security Council debates on whether to <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> <b>mandate</b> and under what conditions have a scripted quality that foreordain renewal, this instance was uncharacteristically lengthy and contentious. UNAMIR was charged with overseeing the implementation of the Arusha Accords, the blueprint to end the civil war between the Tutsi-backed Rwandan Patriotic Forces (RPF) and the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government, and t...|$|E
40|$|In the {{economic}} literature various political institutions designed {{to control the}} government have been analyzed. However, an important institution has been neglected so far: independent auditing institutions with <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>mandate</b> to analyze the budget draft and individual policy proposals. We argue that auditors with <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>mandate</b> improve transparency and provide essential information {{on the impact of}} policy proposals on common pool resources. This leads to less wasteful spending and a more efficient allocation of public resources. We empirically analyze the policy impact of local auditors with <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> audit <b>mandate</b> in Switzerland. Auditors, who can evaluate and criticize policy proposals ex ante to policy decisions, significantly reduce the general tax burden and public expenditures. We find similar results with different datasets. These results are robust to various changes in the econometric specification. auditor; audit court; special interests; political economics; public finance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Thailand’s Education Act was <b>extended</b> to <b>mandate</b> <b>a</b> 12 -year {{education}} only recently. A {{large portion}} of population, especially the elders, do not have chance to further their study after the mandatory education. However, human development {{is at the core}} of community, and national, development. Community colleges were established with a special purpose to provide both formal education and vocational trainings to adults who did not have a chance to attend colleges and universities during their childhood. This research project aims to study the process in which community colleges offered education to their target group who are adult population. In-depth interviews were conducted with directors of community colleges in the northeastern part of Thailand together with administrators of vocational programs as well as leaders in communities. Data were content analyzed and inductively interpreted. Results described the curriculum development process, teacher recruitment process, location and equipment organization, and evaluation process...|$|R

40|$|Summary High oil prices, {{increased}} {{reliance on}} imported oil, and environmental concerns {{have led to}} calls for mandating the blending of domestically-produced ethanol with petrol (‘fuel ethanol’). The most common proposal is for a blend with 10 per cent by volume of ethanol (E 10). Mandate advocates cite fuel security, a smaller trade deficit resulting from lower oil imports, regional development, and environmental benefits as reasons for adopting <b>a</b> <b>mandate.</b> Concern that the domestic industry {{would not be able}} to compete with imports is also a factor behind the calls for <b>a</b> <b>mandate.</b> Reduced oil imports are only one effect of <b>an</b> ethanol <b>mandate</b> on the trade account. Any diversion of feedstock from exports or increased imports of feedstock needed to meet the mandate would increase the trade deficit. <b>A</b> <b>mandate</b> is only one way of reducing reliance on imported oil. Importing ethanol, for example, would be less economically costly than <b>a</b> <b>mandate,</b> and would diversify geographic supply sources and the composition of fuel. The evidence suggests that the costs of creating jobs under <b>an</b> E 10 <b>mandate</b> would be high. <b>A</b> <b>mandate</b> could also adversely affect other rural industries. The Biofuels Taskforce that the Howard Government established concluded that greenhouse gas benefits alone would not warrant further assisting biofuels given the availability of much cheaper carbon reduction options. The additional demand for feedstock under <b>a</b> <b>mandate</b> might lead to competition for land from other uses such as food and exports. Views differ on the potential for competition for land use in Australia. <b>A</b> <b>mandate</b> could benefit the economy if domestic ethanol could compete with imports without government assistance. Even though a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of <b>an</b> ethanol <b>mandate</b> has not been undertaken, no prima facie economic case for <b>a</b> <b>mandate</b> has been established...|$|R
