5|$|Organolithium {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used {{in the production of}} polymer and fine-chemicals. In the polymer industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals,</b> organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.|$|E
5|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{produce a}} vast array of biologically active chemicals that are used in competition and communication. Many of the drugs in use today were originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals,</b> agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals.</b> A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E

The <b>Fine</b> <b>Chemical</b> Companies are active in industrial scale production, both of standard and exclusive products. If the latter prevails, they are referred to as <b>Fine</b> <b>Chemical</b> / Custom Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs).

[...] Palladium(II) acetate, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4, and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) serve either as catalysts or precatalysts.|$|E
50|$|An {{indicative}} {{cost structure}} for a <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> company {{is shown in}} Table 10. Nowadays, a full 7-day/week operation, consisting {{of four or five}} shift teams, each working 8h per day, has become the standard. In terms of production costs, this is the most advantageous scheme. Higher salaries for night work are more than offset by better fixed cost absorption. As part of the budgeting process, standard costs for a production campaign of a particular <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> are determined on the basis of past experience. The actual results of the campaign are then compared with the standard. The capability of a <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> company to make dependable manufacturing cost forecasts is a distinct competitive advantage.|$|R
