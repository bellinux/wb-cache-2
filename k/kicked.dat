50|$|A flying <b>kick,</b> in martial arts, is {{a general}} {{description}} of <b>kicks</b> that involve a running start, jump, then a <b>kick</b> in mid-air. Compared to a regular <b>kick,</b> the user is able to achieve greater momentum from the run at the start. Flying <b>kicks</b> {{are not to be}} mistaken for jumping <b>kicks,</b> which are similar maneuvers. A jumping <b>kick</b> is very similar to a flying <b>kick,</b> except that it lacks the running start and the user simply jumps and <b>kicks</b> from a stationary position. Flying <b>kicks</b> are often derived from the basic <b>kicks.</b> Some of the more commonly known flying <b>kicks</b> are the: flying side <b>kick,</b> flying back <b>kick</b> and the flying roundhouse <b>kick,</b> as well as the flying reverse roundhouse <b>kick.</b> Flying <b>kicks</b> are commonly practiced in Taekwondo, Karate, Wushu, and Muay Thai for fitness, exhibitions and competition.

50|$|Drop <b>kicks</b> are {{optional}} for {{a conversion}} <b>kick</b> after a try has been scored.

Also, if {{a gust of wind}} blows the ball over on a place <b>kick</b> attempt after the kicker has begun his run-up, thus allowing the opposing team to begin a charge down, then there is no time to reset the ball, and the kicker may attempt a quick drop <b>kick.</b> Drop <b>kicks</b> are also optional for a penalty <b>kick</b> to score a penalty goal.

The joint angles of the trunk and hip, knee and ankle of the <b>kicking</b> leg at the moment of ball contact were also compared between the two types of <b>kick.</b> Calculated data was analyzed using a One Way Repeated Measures ANOVA and follow-up Student-Newman-Keuls tests. The statistical analysis of the angular accelerations of the hip, knee and ankle of the <b>kicking</b> leg at the moment of ball contact of the free <b>kick</b> were not significantly different from the instep <b>kick.</b> The statistical analysis of the angular velocity of the hip of the <b>kicking</b> leg at the moment of ball contact revealed no significant difference of the free <b>kick</b> from the instep <b>kick.</b> The statistical analysis of the angular velocity of the knee and ankle of the <b>kicking</b> leg at the moment of ball contact revealed a significant difference (p<. 05) for the free <b>kick</b> from the instep <b>kick.</b> The statistical analysis of the trunk angle and hip, knee and ankle angles of the <b>kicking</b> leg at the moment of ball contact revealed no significant difference of the free <b>kick</b> from the instep <b>kick.</b> The results indicate no consistent difference in the technique employed to complete the free <b>kick</b> when compared to the instep <b>kick.</b> Each individual used different combinations of changes from the technique used to complete the instep to complete the dipping free <b>kick.</b> School of Physical EducationThesis (M.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} joint kinematics of the <b>kicking</b> leg in Taekwondo and to examine the role of inter-joint coordination of the leg in producing the <b>kicking</b> velocity. A new inter-joint coordination index that encompasses three- dimensional hip and knee motions, was defined and applied to the joint kinematic results. Twelve elite Taekwondo athletes participated in this study and performed the back <b>kick,</b> thrashing <b>kick,</b> turning-back <b>kick</b> and roundhouse <b>kick.</b> Our results indicate that the back <b>kick</b> utilized a combination of hip and knee extension to produce the <b>kicking</b> velocity, and was characterized by a pushlike movement. The thrashing <b>kick</b> and turning-back <b>kick</b> utilized a greater degree of hip abduction than the roundhouse <b>kick</b> and back <b>kick,</b> and included complicated knee motions. The new index successfully categorized the thrashing <b>kick</b> and turning-back <b>kick</b> into a push-throw continuum, indicating a change from negative index (opposite direction) to positive index (same direction) of hip and knee motions at the end of the movement.
