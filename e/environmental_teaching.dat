40|$|This {{case study}} {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} context, school policy and <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning processes at a community-based early childhood development centre in South Africa. The study recognises that educational practices in the early childhood development field are shaped by historical, cultural, economic and political realities at both local and national levels. It is from the understanding that each school is a unique composition of these shaping factors that the research was designed to consider the community-based school participating in this study. By compiling a contextual profile, this study attempts to consider dominant contextual factors affecting the school. Through the critical discourse analysis of a school policy document, this study considers local level policy, and through the literature chapter, national policy. Teacher interviews provide insight into teacher understanding of school policy in response to contextual issues, {{as well as providing}} insight into how teachers perceive their translation of policy into teaching practice. Observations of lessons in the centre provided an. opportunity to see how context and policy translated into and influenced <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning processes. This study looks at how environmental education is addressed in the Raglan Road Child Care Centre, and provides insight into how environmental education {{within the context of the}} school and in relation to school policy may be strengthened. It comments on the tensions and ambivalences arising from the relationships between context, policy and <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning processes and makes recommendations to address these ambivalences in ways that are contextually relevant. The main recommendations were designed to be practically useful for the school involved in the study and are focused around engaging the ambivalences emerging from this study to open up 'spaces' for deliberating <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning processes and other tensions arising out of the study at an ECD level. Recommendations included: 1) engaging with the strong development focus in school policy and the educational focus in national policy and teacher discourse; 2) deliberating the ways in which school policy and national policy respond to risk; 3) engaging with the ambivalence in the school-parent relationship; 4) the re-alignment of the explicit curriculum and broadening the contextually-based view of whole child development; and 5) engaging the ambivalence in approaches to education at the centre. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Title: “We borrow {{this earth}} from our children. ” A study about {{teaching}} {{for sustainable development}} in the ecological dimension and teacher’s choice of teaching materials. Author: Jeanette Molin Haag, spring term 2017 Supervisor: Tomas Bollner This study {{is an attempt to}} bring some light on to four teachers different perspectives on education for sustainable development with special focus on the ecological dimension. The first aim is to investigate in what subjects and how teachers in grades 1 - 3 are teaching for sustainable development with special focus on the ecological dimension. The second aim is to investigate the material teachers use in their lessons and if it can be linked to a specific <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> tradition. The following questions were formulated: In which school subjects do teachers teach about sustainable development in the field of environment and ecological sustainability? Do they teach along interdisciplinary lines? What teaching materials do teachers choose to work with?  Within which environmental education tradition do teachers and teaching materials belong to? In the curriculum, the concept of sustainable development appears many times and dictates that it should work along interdisciplinary lines. However, various reports show that teachers are experiencing difficulties with teaching for sustainable development. The main reasons are lack of time and an unclear guidance from school administrations and the curriculum.    This study is based on interviews and the educational materials that teachers use. It will be analysed based on <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> traditions, the variation theory and Dewey´s views on democratic deliberative conversations and interdisciplinary work.    The results show that teachers, although they are experiencing unclear guidance, plan and educate for sustainable development from some school books but mostly from teaching materials they have found from different organizations websites.

30|$|The pedagogic-didactic {{discourse}} underlines much of MTE philosophising. In {{more general}} terms, {{the study of}} education is called pedagogics. However, specifically, pedagogics entails “a study of the phenomena of pedagogy, where pedagogy means the education of a child by a responsible adult person” (Harmse [1982]), p. 13. As a part-discipline of pedagogics, “didactics is scientific reflection centring on educative teaching-learning acts {{in the school and}} the related aspects such as didactic principles (teaching principles), teaching and learning materials (knowledge) development and teaching methods” (Duminy and Sohnge [1982]), p. 22. Among general didactic principles, which include totality, individualisation, interest and motivation, perception, <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching,</b> and selection, mother-tongue teaching features prominently. For children, language provides the power to start, in a much more efficient and differentiated way, a dialogue with their world, and also with the people in their world. Through mother tongue, a child gains a whole cultural heritage, which will, to a large extent, determine his further thinking, feelings, desires and attitudes.|$|E

The paper deals with the topic of primary prevention in relation to teaching programs carried out by CEGV Cassiopeia. The Center of Ecologic and Global Education Cassiopeia (CEGV Cassiopeia) was established in 1995. At present its primary occupation is education, particularly education specialized in environmental, multicultural and personal-social topics. The center co-operates with nursery, primary, high schools, specialized schools and universities. It {{is the object of}} this paper to evaluate individual teaching programs on the basis of standards of "Competence certification of providers of programs of primary prevention of high-risk behavior at schools". The theoretical part deals with basic terms in primary prevention in relation to education and compiles the historical development as well as environmental education. The practical part provides an analysis {{of teaching}} programs on the basis of certification standards. The analysis gives an overview of teaching programs appropriate for the certification process. There are also results of interviews with CEGV Cassiopeia lectors and teachers relating to helpfulness of <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> programs from the perspective of primary prevention...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a teaching innovation where a “Central Character ” was interwoven with the stories shared in a kindergarten, {{and how that}} innovation was documented. The paper traces the origins and evolution {{of the notion of}} a Central Character, what directed it and what children, families and teachers learned through it. We found that the central character concept was the vehicle used by this kindergarten to build family connections and support holistic learning for children and their families. We gained deep understandings about the values, threads of learning and historical and <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> practices that underpinned the use of Central Character stories. This paper explores some of the key methodological insights that guided and emerged from our research. The authors argue first that the sociocultural understandings of learning which underpin the early childhood curriculum point towards collaborative ways of researching and learning about the impacts of our practices as teachers and researchers, second that understandings of complexity thinking and theory about self-organising systems can enable teachers involved in practice-based research to be innovative in their investigations, and third, that the collective knowledge which emerges as we work together influences the culture of the learning community...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{argue for the}} {{importance}} of the formal teaching of environmental ethics. This is, we argue, both because environmental ethics is needed to respond to the environmental issues generated by the neoliberal movement in politics and economics, and because a form of environmental ethics is implicit, but unexamined, in that which is currently taught. We maintain that students need to become aware of the latent ethical dimension in what they are taught. To help them, we think that they need to understand how models and metaphors structure and impact their worldviews. We describe how a simple in-class exercise encourages students to experience the way metaphors organize feelings, courses of action, and cognitive understandings. This is then intellectualized by way of Clifford Geertz 2 ̆ 7 s concept of culture and his model for the analysis of sacred symbols. From there we present a brief interpretation of modern economics as the embodiment of the dominant modern ethos. This leads into a consideration of ecology as a science, and to the environmental ethic embodied in Aldo Leopold 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Land Ethic. 2 ̆ 2 We close with a personal experience that highlights how <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> can make students aware of the presence of an implicit, but unexamined, environmental ethic...|$|E
40|$|The {{planning}} {{and implementation of}} legal units of environmental management have been conflicting, generating social and economic predicaments. These conflicts generate cognitive, emotional and affective movements, that somehow contribute to learning with the operation. The Environmental Education, as a mediating process, enables the collective construction of the sustainable development process for the productive sectors, with an open methodological proposal, whose model is to generate solutions from social participation. In this sense, it is understood that Environmental Education {{is a process of}} educational praxis that aims at building values, attitudes, concepts, skills, standards, knowledge and shared practices for the constructing a style of thinking that contributes to environmental citizenship. Trying to understand and contribute with this social dynamics, have been conducted, from 2001 to 2006, numerous and multiple <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> actions in the highlands region of Santa Catarina. This movement resulted in the development of an open model of environmental education which is mediated by the environmental perception of social actors involved, understanding perception as the integration of biological, psychological and social dimensions. Thus, the proposition for the Open Model of Environmental Education with the paradigm of transdisciplinary opening mediated by the environmental perception of social actors involved will result in the collective construction of solutions to local environmental problems...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability is conceptualized, {{approached}} and acted upon differently by people, sectors, societies, nations and educational systems. Consequently, the “sustainability thinking”-related scientific, technological, environmental, societal, economic and policy/political components {{are expected to}} transform differently. The related necessary transformative paradigm shifts in science, technology, environment, society, economy and policy (STESEP) —education from the contemporary disciplinary science, technology and <b>environmental</b> <b>teaching</b> to “know”—to transdisciplinary learning to “think” are to be expected. The overriding purpose: ensuring “sustainability thinking” by responsible, capable “STESEP literate” citizens. Consequently, “sustainability thinking” in the STESEP interfaces contexts, requires (1) the development of students’ higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS) via a transformative/transdisciplinary “STESEP Education”; (2) a research-based shift from the conventional algorithmic lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) -based teaching to “know”, to “HOCS learning” to “think”; and (3) a special focus on HOCS-promoting teaching, assessment and learning strategies in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, environment, society and education. A pre-post research design of system thinking, evaluative thinking, and decision making capabilities of 10 grade high school, undergraduate and graduate students, in Israel, are presented and discussed in the learning for “sustainability thinking” context. In conclusion: contemporary science education in secondary and tertiary levels is mainly, disciplinary (biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics) in science, technology and engineering courses. The LOCS-to-HOCS paradigm shift still constitutes a major issue of concern, with respect to ensuring a transformative science/STESEP education, targeting “sustainability thinking” in secondary and tertiary education...|$|E
