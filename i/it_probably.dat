5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Middle Kingdom period, in the early 12th Dynasty (19911802 BC), pharaoh Senusret I (19711926 BC) commissioned a statue of Sahure. The statue was located in the temple of Karnak and <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> belonged to a group of portraits of deceased kings.|$|E

5|$|The stone-carved Zimbabwe Bird {{appears on}} the {{national}} flags and the coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia, {{as well as on}} banknotes and coins (first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar). <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E
5|$|Burrow Mump, {{an ancient}} {{earthwork}} {{owned by the}} National Trust, is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl, standing at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of Athelney {{at the end of}} the 9th century.|$|E

5|$|Crocus cartwrightianus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Iridaceae, native to Greece and Crete. C.cartwrightianus is the presumed wild progenitor of the domesticated triploid Crocus sativus – the saffron crocus. Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, Crocus cartwrightianus; <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> appeared first in Crete. An origin in Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research.|$|E
5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> did not cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> functioned for only a short time or was never completed.|$|E

5|$|In 597 {{the mission}} landed in Kent, and it quickly {{achieved}} some initial success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where {{they used the}} church of St. Martin's for services, and this church became {{the seat of the}} bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> took place in 597.|$|E
5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} to walk on either two legs or four. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> {{preferred}} to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{was first}} {{described}} by Haruki Takahashi (2002) {{in an article}} in Mycoscience, based on specimens collected from Ikuta Ryokuchi Park, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 2000 and 2001. The specific name sasicola refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of Sasa species. The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa-no-houraitake. Within the genus Mycena, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> belongs to the section Marasmius, and the subsection Penicillati, due to characters of the stem, gills and pileipellis (the outer-most layer of the cap).|$|E

5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Pingré also {{reported}} that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. Along with direct hunting of the parrots, this likely led {{to a reduction in}} the population of Rodrigues parrots. Pingré's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, and <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> became extinct soon after.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Wales's feathers, often {{adopted as}} {{insignia}} {{by members of}} the College, appear as decorative elements within the college buildings and appear on the official College tie. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> represents Edward, the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, who first adopted the device, the senior grandson of King Edward II, although it may represent King Charles I, who was Prince of Wales when the building of First quad began in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture}} of turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> did not form {{where it is}} found today. Because of the {{decreased}} gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common in the 4th century BC and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the 1st century AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BC in the island of Thasos. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act {{on the part of the}} master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).|$|E
