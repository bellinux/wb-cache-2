She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap."

500|$|The {{character}} of Daphne {{was introduced to}} Neighbours as a [...] "saucy stripper with a heart of gold." [...] In their 1989 book, The Neighbours Factfile, Neil Wallis and Dave Hogan wrote that Daphne came from a rich, but uncaring family. They were rarely mentioned on-screen, making her past somewhat of a mystery. Daphne had received a good education and worked in an office as a secretary, until she told her sexist boss to [...] "jump in a lake." [...] Daphne then chose to become a stripper rather than ask her mother, Tina (Beverley Dunn), for a loan. Of Daphne's profession as a stripper, Smith explained [...] "The whole point of Daphne being a stripper is that she's completely counter to the black stockings and garters cliche. She's a bright girl from a good background who gets fed up with being ogled and pinched by men in her secretarial job and says, right <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make some money out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Holtz's {{first job}} at {{his alma mater}} was to serve as wide {{receivers}} coach, and he filled the position for two years. In 1992, the team began {{a search for a}} new offensive coordinator. Lou's first choice, Joe Moore, declined. Lou then asked Skip for recommendations to fill the position. Skip initially said he wanted the position but said of Lou, [...] "he couldn't do it at that time with me [...] being his son." [...] Skip then mentioned Mark Richt, who was then the offensive coordinator at Florida State. Lou Holtz called Coach Bowden to ask permission to speak to Mark Richt. Coach Bowden said Holtz could hire Richt {{as long as he could}} hire Skip. Coach Holtz said, [...] "Well, if I'm just going to switch coaches, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> hire Skip." [...] Skip became Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994, Skip and his father recorded 40 wins, eight losses, and one tie, an 82.7% winning percentage. Together, they coached Notre Dame to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice, beating Texas A both times. Skip had the third-best total offense in the NCAA during the 1992 football season.|$|E

500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Woodhouse had {{a history}} of theft, robbery and affray, and said that he had [...] "fallen out of love" [...] with football. He {{admitted}} to have been involved in around 100 street fights. He said; [...] "Boxing has always been my first love, even as a kid", and [...] "I love fighting...Rather than get locked up for it, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get paid for it." [...] He also stated that he used to spar in the boxing gym after football training without his manager's knowledge, saying [...] "A few times at Sheffield United, Neil Warnock would drag me in and say ‘I hear you’ve been boxing’. I’d be standing there with a big black eye and a fat lip and deny it." [...] He trained under former British featherweight champion, Gary De Roux, and made his boxing debut on 8 September 2006 at Grosvenor House Hotel, London, in a welterweight contest against Dean Marcantonio, despite not having any previous amateur experience. The former footballer had lost two stone in weight since his playing days with Grimsby Town. The fight was scheduled for four rounds of two minutes, Woodhouse knocked his opponent down twice in the final round and won on points.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] tonearm), an ashtray, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible {{on the table with}} the record player, is the cover of the 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The only sound is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> go public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E

500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

2500|$|In early March 1888, he {{travelled}} to Bristol {{and began}} making preparations {{for a second}} attempt to jump from it, despite facing certain prison if caught. Several planned attempts were aborted, owing to bad weather or apparent police vigilance. He declared, [...] "I came from America to do it, and I cannot go back without having done it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be dead." [...] There is much uncertainty {{about whether or not}} he achieved that objective on the night of March 13, 1888. Several lengthy newspaper articles appeared, having interviewed him, friends, witnesses, the police, and hospital staff, but remained uncommitted either way.|$|E

Arriving in his De Dion-Bouton motorcar, he gave one of the most quoted lines of the rising – [...] "Well, I've helped to wind up the clock -- <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> hear it strike!"

2500|$|Relations {{between new}} {{producer}} Freiberger and the Year One veterans were strained. Landau complained about stories he felt were light-weight or absurd {{when compared to}} the previous year's efforts.

It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if I am not the star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had gotten them a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E

Because why should I not--why should I feel bad about something I can't really change? <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> look at the good things about it." [...] Another boy says to Cross [...] "I don't like being autistic", and when Cross asks why, the boy responds: [...] "Because it's {{hard for me to}} have changes and all the other stuff." [...] A woman states to Cross of her experiences with autism: [...] "I cry, I scream, I wish to God I wasn't different and I didn't have to struggle with everything...", and a boy tells him of the negative aspects of the condition: [...] "The bad thing about autism is that it gets hard to understand other people and to understand what people say and what--what other people try to tell me to do and how to explain me better." ...|$|E

Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate.
