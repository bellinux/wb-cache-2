500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|The {{starship}} [...] {{encounters a}} rift in spacetime {{while on a}} routine mission. As they monitor the anomaly, the heavily damaged USS Enterprise-C, a ship {{believed to have been}} destroyed more than two decades earlier, emerges. Instantly, the Enterprise-D undergoes a sudden and radical change from its current timeline: it is now a warship, and the United Federation of Planets is at war with the Klingons. Neither Worf nor Counselor Troi are seen or referred to, and Tasha Yar– who was killed years before– is now running the tactical station. None of the crew notice the change, but [...] senses that reality has shifted, and has a meeting with Captain Picard to discuss her concerns. She senses that there are supposed to be children on the ship, which of course is completely impractical on a warship. She suggests that the Enterprise-C does not belong in their time and must return to the past. Picard, who <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be a suicide mission, refuses to give such an order on Guinan's intuition alone.|$|E

He is a thief who steals bread in order to feed children who are not able to feed themselves. However, he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not a solution to the underlying problem. He has decided that he must do something in the hopes that someday none will go hungry. Voiced by: Hiro Shimono (Japanese), Sam Riegel (English) ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 14, 2006, Tad and Dixie {{finally come}} face to face since her presumed death. Tad looks at Dixie with an {{astonished}} expression and leaves with her, resulting in him punching Dr. David Hayward, who was and is determined to keep Tad from Dixie. Tad first thinks that David's obsession with Dixie has led him to have plastic surgery performed on someone, but once Dixie says the words [...] "Ozzie and Harriet", he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> woman is his true love.|$|E
2500|$|Nickles said, [...] "If {{some state}} wishes to {{recognize}} same-sex marriage, {{they can do}} so". He said the bill would ensure that [...] "the 49 other states don't have to and the Federal Government does not have to." [...] In opposition to the bill, Colorado Rep. Patricia Schroeder said, [...] "You can't amend the Constitution with a statute. Everybody <b>knows</b> <b>that.</b> <b>This</b> is just stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash." [...] Barr countered that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution grants Congress power to determine [...] "the effect" [...] of the obligation of each state to grant [...] "full faith and credit" [...] to other states' acts.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the return}} of Kat's father Charlie, Wallace said that this will provide a [...] "big boost" [...] to her character. Talking to We Love Telly, asked whether it's {{important}} for Kat to see Charlie again, Wallace replied: [...] "Yes, definitely. With what happened the night they thought Tommy died, things were still unresolved for them. Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now {{makes it all the}} more special. It's also Charlie that makes Kat realise that she needs to bond with Tommy. He makes her see that she can do this." [...] Discussing what type of mother Kat will be, Wallace added: [...] "I think she wants to be the best mum possible. She <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is her second chance to make a go of it and she is determined to do a good job." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2011, {{division}} emerged {{within the}} Labor Party over Prime Minister Gillard's initial {{support for a}} Greens proposal to remove the commonwealth veto over Territory legislation. Joe de Bruyn, head of the Shop, Distributors and Allied Employees Association, said [...] "Everybody in the federal parliament <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is simply a way of letting the territories into euthanasia or whatever else they want to do". Anti-euthanasia Labor senators called on Gillard to overturn Labor's support for the Greens plan and press reports said some Labor senators had complained that the issue had not been discussed in Cabinet. Prime Minister Gillard said that no caucus members had raised concerns with her over {{the influence of the}} Greens over Labor policy. Amidst suggestions that Labor was [...] "too close" [...] to the Greens, Prime Minister Gillard said in March: [...] "The Greens are not a party of government and have no tradition of striking the balance required to deliver major reform".|$|E
2500|$|On August 28, Olmert {{announced}} {{that there will}} be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry. Instead, two internal inspection probes were to be created, one to investigate the political echelon and another to examine the IDF, while a third investigation of the Home Front to be possibly undertaken by the state comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss (although Lindenstrauss, to the [...] "amazement" [...] of the PMO, said that he already has [...] "the authority to investigate the war in Lebanon" [...] and that he [...] "report only to the Knesset"). These were to have a far more limited mandate and narrower authority than a single commission headed by a retired judge. Olmert stated that [...] "we do not have the luxury to submerge in investigating the past. Anyone honestly <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not what would fix the shortcomings." [...] Haaretz noted that Olmert feared an inquiry commission could end up recommending he resigns the primeministership. The Israeli media was largely critical over the probes. Reactions from the protesters were wholly negative.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] two-parter, [...] "In Purgatory's Shadow" [...] and [...] "By Inferno's Light", Gowron restores {{the broken}} {{peace with the}} Federation in the Khitomer Accords after the Cardassian Union joins the Dominion and the real Martok is rescued from a Dominion prison. Gowron makes his final {{appearances}} in [...] "When It Rains…" [...] and [...] "Tacking into the Wind", where he assumes direct command of Klingon military forces and launches multiple reckless attacks with minimal success, wanting Martok (who he regards as a rival) to suffer a string of defeats. Martok, although he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is Gowron's intention, tells Worf not to involve himself. Worf disregards Martok's request and confronts Gowron, provoking a duel to the death, killing Gowron. Worf is entitled to assume {{the leadership of the}} Empire, but he refuses the Chancellorship in favor of Martok. Despite the questionable nature of Gowron's actions towards the end of his life, he does die in honourable combat, as evidenced by Worf's performance of the traditional Klingon death howl (done as a warning to those in Sto-Vo-Kor – the place of the honored dead in Klingon mythology – that a warrior is about to arrive) over the body.|$|E
