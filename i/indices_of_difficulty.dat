40|$|Introduction: Evaluation of {{emergency}} medicine (EM) learners based on observed {{performance in the}} emergency department (ED) is limited by factors such as reproducibility and patient safety. EM educators depend on standardized and reproducible assessments such as the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The validity of the OSCE as an evaluation tool in EM education has not been previously studied. The objective {{was to assess the}} validity of a novel management-focused OSCE as an evaluation instrument in EM education through demonstration of performance correlation with established assessment methods and case item analysis. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of fourth-year medical students enrolled in a required EM clerkship. Students enrolled in the clerkship completed a five-station EM OSCE. We used Pearson’s coefficient to correlate OSCE performance with performance in the ED based on completed faculty evaluations. <b>Indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and discrimination were computed for each scoring item. Results: We found a moderate and statistically-significant correlation between OSCE score and ED performance score [r(239) = 0. 40, p< 0. 001]. Of the 34 OSCE testing items the mean index of difficulty was 63. 0 (SD = 23. 0) and the mean index of discrimination was 0. 52 (SD = 0. 21).

50|$|Pointing at {{stationary}} targets such as buttons, windows, images, menu items, {{and controls}} on computer displays is commonplace {{and has a}} well-established modeling tool for analysis - Fitts law (Fitts, 1954) - which states that {{the time to make}} an aimed movement (MT) is a linear function <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the movement: MT = a + bID.

Fitts law is actually responsible for the ubiquity of the computer mouse, due to the research of Card, English, and Burr (1978). Extensions of Fitts law also apply to pointing at spatially moving targets, via the steering law, originally discovered by C.G.

This study aimed to verify the speed-accuracy trade-off in individuals with CP. Methods. Forty eight individuals with CP and 48 with typical development (TD) were evaluated (32 females and 64 males {{with a mean age}} of 15. 02 ± 6. 37 years: minimum 7 and maximum 30 years). Participants performed the “Fitts’ Reciprocal Aiming Task v. 1. 0 (Horizontal) ” on a computer with different sizes and distance targets, composed by progressive <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (IDs) : ID 2, ID 4 a and ID 4 b. Results. There were no statistical differences between the groups in relation to the slope of the curve (b 1) and dispersion of the movement time (r 2). However, the intercept (b 0) values presented significant differences (F(1. 95) = 11. 3; p =. 001]), with greater movement time in the CP group compared to the TD group. It means that for individuals with CP, regardless of index difficulty, found the task more difficult than for TD participants. Considering CP and TD groups, speed-accuracy trade-off was found when using different <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (ID 2 and ID 4). However, when the same index of difficulty was used with a larger target and longer distance (ID 4 a) or with a narrow target and shorter distance (ID 4 b), only individuals with CP had more difficulty performing the tasks involving smaller targets. Marginally significant inverse correlations were identified between the values of b 1 and age (r = − 0. 119, p =. 052) and between r 2 and Gross Motor Function Classification System (r = − 0. 280, p =. 054), which did not occur with the Manual Ability Classification System. Conclusion. We conclude that the individuals with CP presented greater difficulty when the target was smaller and demanded more accuracy, and less difficulty when the task demanded speed. It is suggested that treatments should target tasks with accuracy demands, that could help in daily life tasks, since it is an element that is generally not considered by professionals during therapy...|$|E

This versatile instrument proved capable of providing quantitative, accurate and sensitive measures of the various processes sustaining voluntary movement in healthy subjects.

Whereas TAC tests provides an anthropomorphic visual representation of the limb {{at the cost of}} confusing visual feedback, FLT clarifies the current and target locations by simplified non-anthropomorphic representations. Here, we investigated these two approaches and quantified differences in common performance metrics that can result from the chosen method of visual feedback. Ten able-bodied and one amputee subject performed target achievement tasks corresponding to the FLT and TAC test with equivalent <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Able-bodied subjects exhibited significantly (p< 0. 05) better completion rate, path efficiency, and overshoot when performing the FLT, although no significant difference was seen in throughput performance.

Results from the FLT showed a strong linear relationship between the movement time and the index of difficulty (R- 2 = 0. 96), whereas TAC test results showed no apparent linear relationship (R- 2 = 0. 19).

An examination seat can be considered as a workstation operated by an examiner which is essential in the education process. Unlike common workstations which are designed to improve the working accuracy, the examination seats are designed to minimize the copy accuracy. A major propose of examination management is to protect the academic dishonesty. A common way to reduce cheating is the seat arrangement by increasing the distance between the examination seats. However the cheating problems may occur when the large number of examiners is set in a relative small room.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{graphical}} user interfaces, electronic information has grown exponentially, whereas the size of screen displays has stayed almost the same. Multiscale interfaces were designed to address this mismatch, allowing users to adjust the scale at which they interact with information objects. Although the technology has progressed quickly, the theory has lagged behind. Multiscale interfaces pose a stimulating theoretical challenge, reformulating the classic target-acquisition problem from the physical world into an infinitely rescalable electronic world. We address this challenge by extending Fitts ’ original pointing paradigm: we introduce the scale variable, thus defining a multiscale pointing paradigm. This article reports on our theoretical and empirical results. We show that target-acquisition performance in a zooming interface must obey Fitts ’ law, and more specifically, that target-acquisition time must be proportional to the index of difficulty. Moreover, we complement Fitts ’ law by accounting for the effect of view size on pointing performance, showing that performance bandwidth is proportional to view size, up to a ceiling effect. The first empirical study shows that Fitts ’ law does apply to a zoomable interface for <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> up to and beyond 30 bits, whereas classical Fitts ’ law studies have been confined in the 2 - 10 bit range. The second study demonstrates a strong interaction between view size and task difficulty for multiscale pointing, and shows a surprisingly low ceiling.

40|$|Fitts' Law is {{commonly}} found {{to apply to}} motor tasks involving precise aiming movements. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have severe difficulties in such tasks and it is unknown whether they obey Fitts' Law despite their motor difficulties. If Fitts' Law still does apply to these children, this would indicate that this law is extremely robust and that even performance of children with damaged central nervous systems can adhere to it. The integrity of motor control processes in spastic CP is usually tested in complex motor tasks, {{making it difficult to}} determine whether poor performance is due to a motor output deficit or to problems related to cognitive processes since both affect movement precision. In the present study a simple task was designed to evaluate Fitts' Law. Tapping movements were evaluated in 22 children with congenital spastic hemiplegia (CSH) and 22 typically developing children. Targets (2. 5 and 5 cm in width) were placed at distances of 10 and 20 cm from each other in order to provide <b>Indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Difficulty</b> (ID) of 2 - 4 bits.

Although, the slope b (which reflects the sensitivity of the motor system to a change in difficulty of the task) and the reciprocal of slope (that represents the cognitive information processing capacity, expressed in bits/s) were similar in both groups.

Next, the extension to the multiple-factor model is considered, and multidimensional counterparts of the item indices are proposed. The interpretation of the proposed measures and their usefulness in personality and attitude measurement are discussed and illustrated by means of two empirical examples. Index terms: factor analysis, item response theory, item difficulty, item discrimination, item information, multidimensional item indices, personality and attitude measurement When it is used for item analysis, linear factor analysis (FA) can be conceptualized as a domi-nance model (Coombs, 1964) intended for continuous-unlimited item responses. In practice, item responses are bounded and, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, discrete, so the FA model can be only approximately correct. More specifically, because the response is bounded, the simple linear and homoscedastic model cannot be strictly correct because some trait values would lead to expected response values outside the boundaries of the item format. Furthermore, the conditional distribu-tion of the item responses would be expected to become more asymmetrical and have decreased variance toward the ends of the scale (e. g., Ferrando, 2002). If a nonlinear heteroscedastic model such as Samejima’s (1973, 1974) is considered to be theoretically correct, and if linear FA is considered to be an approximation, then a generally well-known result is that the approximation will be better when the items have moderate or low discriminations and not extreme locations (Ferrando, 2002; Lord, 1952, 1953). In practical applications, evidence suggests that the use of linear FA can be problematic in the case of binary items or graded items with very few response points.

The software which simulated the task was F̈itts´ Reciprocal Aiming Task v. 1. 0 (Horizontal). ̈ MANOVA demonstrated statistically significant differences in dispersion data of between DMD group (r 2 : M= 0. 70, SD= 0. 04) and TD group (r 2 : M= 0. 85, SD= 0. 04) [F(1, 32) = 5. 93; p= 0. 021; ? 2 = 0. 16] and intercept values [F(1, 32) = 5. 16; p= 0. 030; ? 2 = 0. 14], with greater movement time in DMD group (M= 321 ms, SD= 73 ms) compared to TD group (M= 86 ms; SD= 73). ANOVA indicated effect among groups between ID, except among ID 4 and ID 6. Individuals in DMD group had significantly longer movement time when compared to DT group only in ID 2 and ID 4. In ID 6, where there is greater demand on the accuracy of the movement, the groups had similar performance. These data show that the development of individuals with DMD is more affected when the task involves spee...|$|E
40|$|Background The inverse {{relationship}} between movement speed and accuracy in goal-directed aiming is mostly investigated using the classic Fitts’ paradigm. According to Fitts’ law, movement time scales linearly with a single quantity, the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (ID), which quantifies task difficulty through the quotient of target width and distance. Fitts’ law remains silent, however, on how ID affects the dynamic and kinematic patterns (i. e., perceptual-motor system’s organization) in goal-directed aiming, a question that is still partially answered only. Methods Therefore, we here investigated the Fitts’ task performed in a discrete {{as well as a}} cyclic task under seven IDs obtained either by scaling target width under constant amplitude or by scaling target distance under constant target width. Results Under all experimental conditions Fitts’ law approximately held. However, qualitative and quantitative dynamic as well as kinematic differences for a given ID were found in how the different task variants were performed. That is, while ID predicted movement time, its value in predicting movement organization appeared to be limited. Conclusion We conclude that a complete description of Fitts’ law has yet to be achieved and speculate that the pertinence <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in studying the dynamics underlying goal-directed aiming may have to be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Human {{performance}} in selection tasks is frequently described by Fitts' law, {{which states that}} the average time needed {{to move to a}} target and select it is linearly related to the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> for the task, which is the logarithm of the task characteristic C=A/W, where A is the target distance and W is the target width. The coefficients in this linear relationship can vary across interaction conditions, such as when using distinct interaction devices, and can for instance be used to define throughput, which is a standardized measure to compare interaction conditions. Although Fitts' law has proven very useful in the field of human–computer interaction (HCI) over the past 50 years, there are several issues with Fitts' law that argue in favor of more advanced statistical modeling of experimental data. More specifically, we propose two generalizations of Fitts' law. The first generalization is not to limit the data analysis to average movement times, but to consider the distributions of the observed times instead. The second generalization is to extend Fitts' law to a more general relationship between task characteristics and <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> and to use this generalized model to come up with additional measures that can be used alongside throughput...|$|R

40|$|Throughput (TP) {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} metric in quantifying input system performance. TP is a concept based on Fitts' law, an essentially two parameter (a, b) relationship between movement time (MT) and Fitts' <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (ID). In part thanks to ISO 9241 - 9, the final draft international standard (FDIS) of "Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals - Part 9 : Requirements for non-keyboard input devices", research and testing of computer input system {{in recent years have}} increasingly relied on TP as the sole measure of performance quality of input devices. The goal was to standardize studies onto one metric that can be generalized and compared across different experimental studies. Unfortunately TP as defined in ISO 9241 - 9 is an ill-defined concept that changes with the mean <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> used in measuring it and therefore cannot be generalized beyond specific experimental settings. Furthermore, important properties can be hidden when TP is used as a single metric to input system evaluation. We reason that it is more informative to use (a, b) parameters in Fitts' law as separated metrics of an input system. One related issue, the foundation for post-hoc target size adjustment, known as effective width, is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} by {{psychologists and}} human factors researchers {{have shown that}} when young children execute pointing tasks, they perform at levels below older children and adults. However, these experiments were not conducted {{with the purpose of}} providing guidelines for the design of graphical user interfaces. To address this need, we conducted a study {{to gain a better understanding}} of 4 and 5 year-old children's use of mice. We compared the performance of thirteen 4 year-olds, thirteen 5 year-olds and thirteen young adults in point-and-click tasks. As expected, we found age had a significant effect on accuracy, target reentry and Fitts' law's <b>index</b> <b>of</b> performance. We also found that target size had a significant effect on accuracy and target reentry. Measuring movement time at four different times (first entering target, last entering target, pressing button, releasing button) yielded the result that Fitts' law models children well only for the first time they enter the target. Another interesting result was that using the adjusted <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (IDe) in Fitts' law calculations yielded lower linear regression correlation coefficients than using the unadjusted <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (ID). These results provide valuable guidelines for the design of graphical user interfaces for young children, in particular when it comes to sizing visual targets. They also suggest designers should adopt strategies to accommodate users with varying levels of skill. 1...|$|R
