The effects of management practices on N 2 fixation in mucuna and lablab were examined using 15 N isotope dilution technique. Dry matter yield of both legumes at 12 weeks was two to five times more in in situ mulch (IM) than live mulch (LM) systems. Land Equivalent Ratios, however, showed 8 to 30 % more efficient utilization of resources required for biomass production under LM than IM systems. Live mulching reduced nodule numbers in the legumes by one third compared to values in the IM systems. Similarly, nodule mass was reduced by 34 to 58 % under LM compared to the IM systems. The proportion of fixed N 2 in the legumes was 18 % higher in LM than IM systems. Except for inoculated mucuna, the amounts of N fixed by both legumes were greater in IM than LM systems. Rhizobia inoculation of the legumes did not significantly increase N 2 fixation compared to uninoculated plots.

Six years later, an adoption study was conducted to assess factors driving the adoption process. Four types of land tenure systems based on mode of access to land were identified: divided inheritance, purchasing, gifts, and sharecropping/renting. The first three provide long-term security over land, and together, they represent about 76 percent of the survey fields. Results from three variants of a probit model indicated that security over land was among the factors that significantly affect the adoption of the technology, with a high marginal effect on the probability of adoption, while gender did not have a significant effect. The most important determinant for adoption is the number of times a field is weeded during a cropping season (a proxy for the amount of labor required to tend a crop for better yields). High weeding requirements favorably affect the adoption of velvet bean only if farmers have full security on the degraded (weedy) land. The predominance of land tenure systems that provide secure property rights, namely the traditional acquisition of land through inheritance or gift mode and the gradual development of a land market, facilitated a quick spread of the Mucuna planted fallows in the study region.

The experiment was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with above mentioned treatment and replicated three times. The spacing used for coffee and plantain was 3 m apart respectively while rice was sown 30 cm apart. Morphological parameters such as plant height, stem girth, leaf area and canopy score were taken on coffee monthly while the survival count were taken after two months of field establishment. Yields of the component crops were also collected at maturity. Data collected were subjected to statistical analysis of variance and LSD used to separate the means that were significant. Result obtained showed 98 % survival without any significant difference among the treatments. On vegetative growth, coffee/rice and coffee/plantain were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than coffee sole and coffee/rice/plantain in plant girth and leaf area but not significantly higher in all the months. Plant height however did not follow the same trend as height in coffee sole was slightly higher than coffee/rice. However, {{the difference was not}} significant.

This study involved the use of Dioscorea rotundata Poir, fertilized with NPK (15 : 15 : 15) at rates of 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 kg/ha using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The crop was planted early (April) 2004 and 2005 in each of the ecological zones (<b>Derived</b> <b>Savanna</b> (Ubiaja), Forest-Savanna transition (Sabongidda-Ora) and Forest (Evboneka)). Based on the objective function of profit maximization, the optimum returns were recorded at a fertilizer application rate of 300 kg/ha in the <b>Derived</b> <b>Savanna</b> zone with a gross margin of $ 18, 577. 38, net returns of $ 18, 225. 21 and a benefit-cost ratio of 5. 10.

In the southern Guinea savanna; humid forest, midaltitud savanna, and <b>derived</b> <b>savanna,</b> 88 farmersâ ields were visited. Each field was assessed for the incidence and severity of the disease. The CMD status was rated as mild, moderately severe, or severe. Cassava leaf samples were collected from plants showing the disease symptoms from farmersâ ields on which CMD severity was also rated on a 5 -point scale. Whitely populations were estimated in each ield as low, moderate, or high. Samples of diseased leaves were sent to Germany, DSMZ Plant Virus Division, for the identiication of associated pathogens. The CMD status in most farmersâ fields was moderately severe or severe. The lowland humid savanna had the highest severity (2. 67) and ranged from 1. 9 to 4. 07. Only one ield with an improved variety in the humid forest did not have any CMD symptoms. Across the country, the CMD symptoms were found in 73. 61 % of the farms. The highest incidence of the disease was in the <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> ecozone (81. 9 %). The mid altitude savanna had the lowest incidence (64. 9 %).

40|$|Soil erosion is {{a serious}} problem in the forest-savanna {{transition}} zone or <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> of West Africa and Nigeria and needs to be reduced to maintain soil quality and to ensure food security. In 2007, the use of the fallout radionuclide 137 Cs as a tracer for estimating the magnitude of medium-term (40 â 50 years) rates of soil redistribution was tested at a research station in Ibadan, Nigeria, to investigate, for the first time, its applicability in the <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> of West Africa. Because of the traditional tillage practice for cassava cultivation of creating downslope oriented ridges and furrows during the annual ploughing, there was a need to adapt the 137 Cs approach to these specific condition. The mean inventory was determined for cores collected from both ridges and furrows at different positions down the slope and this value was used to estimate the downslope variation in the longer term soil redistribution rate. The mean 137 Cs reference inventory obtained for an undisturbed site was 568 Â± 138 Bq mâ 2. The average inventory for the upper slope of the cassava field (423 Â± 323 Bq mâ 2) was generally lower than the average inventory for the middle slope (509 Â± 166 Bq mâ 2) and for the lower slope (606 Â± 245 Bq mâ 2) and these results provided clear evidence of the downslope movement of soil. The mean 137 Cs inventory for the study area within the cassava field (496 Â± 273 Bq mâ 2) was 13 % lower than the reference inventory, indicating that some of the soil mobilised and redistributed by erosion had been exported beyond the field. Using 137 Cs data set and the conversion model mass balance model 2 (MBM 2), the gross erosion rate from the cultivated site was estimated to be 18. 3 t haâ 1 yearâ 1 and the net erosion rate 14. 4 t haâ 1 yearâ 1, providing a sediment delivery ratio of 78 %.

40|$|Abstract: The {{dearth of}} fertile âvirgin â land and inaccessibility to {{standard}} chemical fertilizers, coupled with low tuber yields has made cassava cultivation unprofitable {{in parts of}} traditional cassava zone of West Africa. Field experiments were conducted at Ajibode and Alabata villages located in Ibadan (<b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> zone), Nigeria to evaluate cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) root yield response to alley cropping species and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF) inoculations. On farm trials were conducted during two growing seasons, in Rhodic Kandiustalf soil type with low nutrients. The alley cropping systems used Leuceana leucocephala and Senna siamea as hedgerow tree species (main blocks), while AMF inoculation (with or without Glomus clarum, G. mosseae, or G. fasciculatum) served as the subplots. Improved cassava cvs. TMS 30572 and TMS 91934 were intercropped within alleys. The leaf dry weight and cassava tuber yield were greatly enhanced by AMF inoculation, whether alley-cropped or sole-cropped in Ajibode fields. The positive contribution of mycorrhizae to cassava root yield ranged from 20. 7 to 39. 3 %, depending on the treatment combination. However, in Alabata fields, out of four farms, cassava yield was suppressed {{in three of the}} farms by hedgerow trees. The suppression in yield was between 138. 9 and 2. 7 %. However, the combination of the multipurpose trees and AM fungi greatly enhanced the cassava root yield (between 20. 6 and 166. 7 %) even more than AMF inoculation alone.

Farmers in this region grow plantain and banana around their houses, where the plants receive ample water and supplies of organic matter from household refuse and from the litter of fruit and shade trees. Increasing population pressure calls for the expanded production of staple foods, such as plantain, on a commercial scale. Due to limited land in the humid zone, production has expanded primarily into the derived savanna: but yields have started to decline. This {{has been attributed to}} a rapid decrease in soil organic matter. Staff at the Department of Crop Science at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka have conducted an experiment to evaluate the establishment and growth performance of six sucker sources of plantain. The suckers were in a site adjacent to a rubber plantation and it was observed that the suckers were healthier and grew better the closer they were to rubber trees. Observations {{in other parts of the}} <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> zone confirmed that banana and plantain tend to grow better near trees, in particular the locust bean tree (Parkia sp.). The observations raised a number of questions and point to the need for a well-planned evaluation study. One aspect would be to identify the most suitable indigenous or exotic tree species for plantain and banana plantations in Nigeria's <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> zone. The object would be to design agroforestry practices suitable for current mixed-farming systems in the region.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the extraction of}} chlorophylls from selected forest mosses (Hyophila involuta and Thuidium gratum) and <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> moss (Archidium ohioense) using dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 80 % acetone. The mosses were collected from natural populations found in the Central Campus of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The chlorophyll extractions process followed standard methods and the absorbance of the extracts were read on spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 645 nm and 663 nm respectively. The data obtained were later subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. The results showed that DMSO was a better chlorophyll extractant for mosses than 80 % acetone. Although {{there were significant differences}} in the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a/b ratio and total chlorophyll accumulation within all three species using DMSO and 80 % acetone as extractant (P 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Herds of mainly zebu cattle were {{examined}} in the Ogun, Oyo, Ondo, Bendel and Kwara states of Nigeria between February 1986 and March 1987. A total of 757 animals were bled in the rainy season, and 768 during the dry season. Infection rates were as follows: Ogun, 2. 7 %; Bendel, 6. 7 %; Kwara, 17. 3 %; Oyo, 19. 4 %; and Ondo, 28. 2 %. Trypanosoma congolense occurred more often than T. vivax, and T. brucei was not detected. Glossina palpalis and G. tachinoides were the only tsetse encountered. The overall infection rate was higher in the wet season than in the dry season.

30|$|Rotted tuber {{samples of}} D. rotundata were {{collected}} from different locations across three agroecological zones (AEZ): Humid rainforest, <b>Derived</b> <b>savanna</b> and southern Guinea savanna. Fifteen tubers showing rot symptoms {{were collected from}} fourteen locations across the three AEZ. A total of 210 rotten tubers were collected and evaluated for fungal rot pathogens. Each rotten sample was washed in running tap water and cut to expose the fresh necrotic tissues. From the areas {{in advance of the}} necrosis, tissue pieces were surface-sterilized with 10 % sodium hypochlorite for 2 Â minutes, and rinsed in five changes of sterile distilled water (SDW) before plating on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The inoculated plates were incubated in the dark in a Gallenkamp incubator operating at a temperature of 28 Â°C for 3 to 4 Â days and examined for fungal growth from the tissue pieces. Identification of the isolates was carried out using standard procedure (Barnett and Hunter 1998).|$|E
40|$|Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex (N = 1, 336) were sampled (2001 - 2005) across Angola to {{identify}} taxa, study inversion polymorphisms, and detect the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum. Anopheles gambiae s. s. {{was found in}} all sites; it was characterized as M-form in localities of the tropical dry and semi-desertic belts, whereas the S-form was predominant in comparatively more humid and less anthropized sites. Both forms were characterized by low degrees of chromosomal polymorphism {{based solely on the}} 2 La inversion, a pattern usually associated with An. gambiae populations from forested, humid, and <b>derived</b> <b>savanna</b> areas. Unexpectedly, this pattern was also observed in M-form populations collected in dry/pre-desertic areas, where this form largely predominates over An. arabiensis, which was also detected in central/inland sites. Anopheles melas was found in northern coastal sites. Three of 534 An. gambiae s. s. were positive for P. falciparum CS-protein, whereas none of the 1. 05 An. melas were positive...|$|E
