40|$|Introduction. Stress urinary {{incontinence}} (SUI) is an involuntary release of urine through the urethra during {{the increase of}} abdominal pressure {{in the absence of}} m. detrusor contraction. The exercise of pelvic floor muscles is recommended as the first line of cure. It is the least invasive and the only method without any undesirable side effects, which leads to either improvement or complete cure of SUI in 80 - 85 % of cases. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish whether the strengthening of pelvic floor muscles using proprioceptive neural facilitation (PNF) spiral dynamic technique was more efficient in comparison to classical <b>Kegel</b> <b>exercise.</b> Methods. The research was carried out at the Centre for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Clinical Centre Kragujevac. Sixty-six female patients with the symptoms of SUI were monitored in the period of two years. Thirty-four patients did pelvic floor muscle exercises twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, with 15 - 20 contractions. Thirty-two patients used PNF spiral dynamic technique for strengthening pelvic floor muscles. The patients who used the spiral dynamic technique also did some exercises from the program; they exercised twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, following the prescribed schedule. Treatment outcome was assessed by measuring the pelvic floor muscles by a vaginal dynamometer. Results. The values of the pelvic floor muscle force that were measured using the vaginal dynamometer in both examined groups (PNF spiral dynamic technique or <b>Kegel</b> <b>exercise)</b> were statistically significantly higher after the implemented exercise program (t-test; p= 0. 000). No statistically significant difference in pelvic floor muscle values was found between the patients who applied PNF spiral dynamic technique and those who did <b>Kegel</b> <b>exercise</b> either before or after the exercise (two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measurements, factor of exercise type; p= 0. 899). Conclusion. Strengthening of pelvic floor muscles by exercises results in a significant increase of pelvic floor muscle strength and reduction of SUI symptoms, regardless of the used exercise program, PNF spiral dynamic technique or <b>Kegel</b> <b>exercise</b> program...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{confirm the}} {{correlation}} between the ability to focus attention on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse and the consistency of vaginal orgasm (Brody & Weiss, 2010) in our sample. To create a psychological method which would help women to improve their ability to focus the attention on vaginal sensations during PVI. The core of the method consists of mindfulness-based techniques and the <b>Kegel</b> <b>exercise.</b> In the next step we empirically verify the effectivity of such training. Based on the previous findings (Brody & Weiss, 2010) we hypothesized that the improvement in ablity to focus attention on vaginal sensations would result in higher VO consistency, higher satisfaction with partner sexuality and in gaining the ability to reach VO in women who had never experienced it. Methods: The vast majority of the study is based on the methods of quantitative statistics. The sample of 96 women (experimental group N= 44, control group N= 52) daily filled out a questionnaire on sexual behaviour for thirty days before and another 30 days after the training.

These exercises also serve to contract, among others, the ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus, and cremaster muscle in men, as voluntary contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle also engages the cremasteric reflex, which lifts the testicles up, although this does not occur in all men. <b>Kegel</b> <b>exercises</b> have been prescribed to ameliorate erectile dysfunction due to venous leakage and to help men control premature ejaculation and to treat urinary incontinence in both sexes.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{important}} factors for successful treatment of female {{stress urinary incontinence}} (SUI) are described: type of urinary incontinence (UI), degree of UI, pelvic floor relaxation and associated diseases (genital and extragenital). Indications for conservative and operative treatment are presented. Methods. Conservative treatment: pelvic floor <b>exercises</b> – <b>Kegel’s</b> <b>exercises</b> and functional electrical stimulation (FES) are proposed to female patients with mild and moderate degree of SUI. Separate indications for vaginal and retopubic operations are quoted. Results. With conservative treatment of SUI – pelvic floor exercises, 33. 3 % of female patients were cured and 36. 7 % were improved. With FES treatment of SUI, 50 % of patients were cured and 23. 4 % were improved. Results of operative treatment of SUI: vaginal approach – our modification of vaginal operation with preparation of pubovesico-cervical fascia and suburethral application – 97. 5 % of female patients were primary cured and recurrence after 2 years was found in 9 % of female patients.

40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The major manifestation of COPD includes dyspnea, decreased oxygenation and reduced exercise tolerance. The other manifestations such as urinary incontinence are less noted and treated inadequately. The prevalence of urinary incontinence in Indian COPD population has not been well documented. The treatment of urinary incontinence includes pelvic floor <b>exercises</b> (<b>Kegel’s</b> <b>exercises),</b> biofeedback, and acupuncture etc. Methods: Forty female moderate COPD patients diagnosed according to American Thoracic Criteria with a complaint of urinary incontinence were selected for the study. Pelvic floor therapy exercises were given daily 5 sets per day (1 set = 1 - 3 counts) for seven days. Baseline evaluation was done using International Consultation on Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-SF) on the day of referral for physiotherapy and the post study measurements were taken on 7 th day of hospital stay. Wilcoxon Signed Rank calculator was used to assess the data collected. Results: The z value of ICIQ-SF questionnaire was 5. 5109 (p≤ 0. 05) based on Wilcoxon Sign rank test and it was significant when we compared the pre and post test mean difference. The pre test mean score of ICIQ-SF was 14. 175 and post test mean score was 4. 4. Based on the findings, the results showed significant improvement in patient symptoms and reduced stress incontinence post pelvic floor therapy exercises.

40|$|I have {{selected}} the bachelor thesis {{on the subject}} of The Provision of the Process of Nursing Incontinent Patients because I am interested in the issues of urinary incontinence. With increasing age, the need for voiding urine becomes an increasingly topical problem. Many think that urinary incontinence is a natural part of the ageing process and {{that it is possible to}} combat it by reducing the intake of liquids. A nurse should refute this opinion of incontinent patients and to recommend that they should restrict beverages containing caffeine during incontinence. Most of incontinent patients, however, are shy of talking about their problem. Therefore, the understanding of the patients behaviour can help a nurse solve the problem of incontinence. Furthermore, a nurse should provide incontinent patients with information on suitable and unsuitable sports, on the technique of interrupted urination, on compensatory aids for incontinent patients and about the necessity to limit the intake of irritable food as well. Also, a nurse should teach an ill woman exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor (<b>Kegel</b> <b>exercise).</b> Urinary incontinence is defined as the unwanted leakage of urine, which causes a hygienic or social problem and, at the same time, it is also objectively demonstrable. It is a symptom that may have various causes. Consequences of incontinence translate into all areas of social life. In the interest of uniting the diagnostics and treatment of incontinence, the ICS (International Continence Society) classification is currently recommended, which distinguishes four types of incontinence: urgent, reflex, stress and paradoxical. The most frequent subtype is stress incontinence, followed by mixed and urgent incontinence. The organization of the care of incontinent patients has three levels: primary care, secondary care and tertiary care. The present situation in the Czech Republic is marked by the merging of the secondary and tertiary level of care, for the majority of specialized workplaces are part of in-patient establishments in the sense of urogynaecologic clinics. The care of incontinent patients requires a holistic approach. The aim of the nursing care of incontinent patients is to minimize the leakage of urine, to preserve or restore the normal excretion of urine while preventing relevant risks at the same time. In the course of my research I would like to find out how nurses ensure the process of nursing incontinent patients, whether nurses inform incontinent patients about the exercises of pelvic floor muscles and about the drinking regimen and whether these patients are informed about compensatory aids for the incontinent. The hypothesis that nurses, within the nursing process, do not focus on the support of a patients self-assessment has not proven true. The hypothesis that nurses instruct the patients in exercises of pelvic floor muscles has proved true. The hypotheses that patients who suffer from incontinence are informed about aids that compensate their incontinence and that nurses instruct patients suffering from incontinence in the drinking regimen have proven true. Urinary incontinence continues to be taboo in our society. Many consider it as a natural part of the ageing process. Nowadays, there already exists effective treatment, it is only necessary to confide in a physician about ones problem. However, prevention is also important here. Basically simple and mostly also generally known prevention will save many finances and, first and foremost, complaints...|$|R

40|$|Background: Currently, the {{reference}} standard used to clinically assess sexual function among women is a qualitative questionnaire. Hence, a generalised and quantitative measurement tool {{needs to be}} available as an alternative. This study investigated whether an electromyography (EMG) measurement tecnique {{could be used to}} help quantify women's sexual function. Material/Methods: A preliminary intervention study was conducted on 12 female subjects, who were randomised into a control (n= 6) and an intervention (n= 6) group. Intervention involved a set regimen of pelvic floor muscle <b>exercises</b> (<b>Kegel)</b> and the control group did not have any treatment. All subjects were asked to answer a validated, self-rated Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ). EMG measurements of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and the abdominal muscles were taken from all women at recruitment and 8 weeks after study commencement. Results: After 8 weeks, most of the subjects in the control group did not display any noted positive difference in either PISQ score (4 / 6) or in their muscle strength (4 / 6). However, a noted progressive difference were observed in subjects who were placed in the Kegel group; PISQ score (5 / 6) and muscles strength (4 / 6). Conclusions: The noted difference in the Kegel group subjects was that if progress is observed in the sexual function, improvement is also observed in the strength of at least 2 types of muscles (either abdominal or PFM muscles). Thus, EMG measurement is a potential technique to quantify the changes in female sexual function. Further work will be conducted to validate this assumption...|$|R

This study also investigates whether or not the young athletes that do experience UI have ever received formal training in pelvic floor exercises that have been previously proven as effective in the treatment of UI. Methods: The study includes 49 middle school and high school aged female athletes. Permission was granted from the parent/guardian(s) through consent forms as well as from the subjects themselves through assent forms. Once consent and assent were granted, a second meeting with the team was scheduled to administer the survey, which consisted of the ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire as well as one created by the investigators titled "Female Urinary Incontinence Survey. " Furthermore, prevalence of urinary incontinence and the effect it has on quality of life was investigated. Results: Among the 49 participants, 27 young women (55. 1 %) reported urinary leakage. The mean age was 15. 6 (+/- 1. 3) years of the total participants and 15. 6 (+/- 1. 1) years for those that reported leakage. Of the 49 participants, 26 played volleyball with 16 out of 26 (61. 5 %) reporting leakage; 25 played basketball with 14 out of 25 (53. 8 %) reporting leakage; 12 played softball with 5 out of 12 (19. 2 %) reporting leakage; 7 played track field events with 5 out of 7 (19. 2 %) reporting leakage; 4 running track with 2 out of 4 (7. 7 %) reporting leakage; and 9 participate in other sports including swimming, rodeo, cheer, and soccer with 4 out of 9 (15. 4 %) reporting leakage. Out of those reporting leakage (27), 17 (63. 0 %) reported feeling embarrassed, 4 (14. 8 %) reported feeling afraid, and 5 (18. 5 %) reported feeling bad about themselves. Among the young athletes that reported UI, 55. 6 % reported no previous education on the performance of pelvic floor <b>exercises</b> (<b>Kegels)</b> in order to prevent the occurrence of UI. Conclusions: The study found that there is a prevalence of urinary incontinence in middle school and high school aged female athletes. This in turn has a negative effect on the quality of life of these young female athletes causing them to feel embarrassed, afraid, and bad about themselves. Because the study showed that urinary incontinence is occurring at such a young age and that many of these young athletes have never been educated in Kegels, a preventative education program is now being developed in order to enhance the quality of life of these young female athletes.
