5|$|Tamar's {{association}} with the period of political and military successes and cultural achievements, combined with {{her role as a}} female ruler, has led to her <b>idealization</b> and romanticization in Georgian arts and historical memory. She remains an important symbol in Georgian popular culture and has been canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church as the Holy Righteous Queen Tamar (წმიდა კეთილმსახური მეფე თამარი, ts'mida k'etilmsakhuri mepe tamari), with her feast day commemorated on 14 May (O.S. 1 May).|$|E

All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred {{the distinction between the}} idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between <b>idealizations,</b> competence and multi-level explanations in cognitive psychology is discussed, {{in response to}} Patterson's ([1998]) reply to Franks ([1995]). I argue that <b>idealizations</b> are inherent in competence explanations and as a result, such explanations cannot be formulated in the multi-level terms widely used in the cognitive sciences. Patterson's argument was that neither competence nor performance involve <b>idealizations,</b> and since they are separate 'systems', it is inappropriate to apply a single multi-level explanation to them. I {{suggest that there is}} evidence that, although competence and performance are very often explicated in terms of levels of description, both none the less involve <b>idealizations.</b> However, I also suggest that Patterson's argument rests on confounding the demarcation of cognitive systems. Hence, even if competence and performance are different levels of a single system, questions concerning <b>idealizations</b> still arise when they are combined in an explanation...|$|R

5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the <b>idealization</b> for pure states.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of <b>idealization.</b> The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an <b>idealization.</b> O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and <b>idealization</b> suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Facts in Feminist Philosophy track. Due to influence of the work of Carol Gillian (1982), Susan Moller Okin (1989), Nancy Fraser (1990), and Charles Mills (1997, 2005), there has been an assumption among many feminists that political philosophy should take a direction towards facts, toward a greater understanding and appreciation for the lives of actual women, and away from <b>idealizations,</b> which will ultimately be harmful to women. The recent popularity of non-ideal theory in political philosophy has reinvigorated these old debates (see Schwartzman 2006, Sen 2006, Farrelly 2007, Robeyns 2008, Stepmplowska 2008, Swift 2008, Valentini 2009). Some argue that since <b>idealizations</b> are inevitable, moving forward is a matter of choosing nonoppressive ideals and using them wisely (Schwartzman 2006, Valentini 2009), while the rest move to separate ideal theory from non-ideal theory and thus mitigate or eliminate the influence of <b>idealizations</b> entirely. Focusing on this trend in the recent literature, I will show that in general the role of <b>idealizations</b> in political philosophy has been misunderstood and that the move towards a greater reliance on “facts” is in fact a step backwards for the feminist movement. In a recent article, Laura Valentini (2009) suggests that <b>idealizations</b> of the subject to which the theory applies are often dangerous and will tend to benefit the dominant group or groups, while <b>idealizations</b> of a subject that plays only a theoretical role, and is not the same subject to which the theory is supposed to apply, are benign. Taking this helpful suggestion, we can see why Nancy Fraser’s influential criticism of Habermas (1990) is different, and I argue, more successful, than Susan Moller Okin’s similar and also influential criticism of Rawls (1989). Taking this idea further, I will show that Rawlsian <b>idealizations</b> are not only benign, but invaluable for a feminist philosophy. Unfortunately, this is only true of Rawlsian style <b>idealizations,</b> and not of Rawls’ actual <b>idealizations,</b> for reasons already argued by Buchanan (2000) in his criticism of Law of Peoples. The reason such <b>idealizations</b> are necessary is because they alone allow for a feminist criticism of the basic structure of society, and without <b>idealizations</b> this criticism is impossible. In fact, a lack of <b>idealizations,</b> coupled with a lack of distinction between principles that apply to the basic structure and principles that apply to individuals, is what has lead recent attempts at producing non-ideal theory to be so concerned with individual charity to the detriment of structural political change (see especially Murphy 2000). A surprising offshoot of this trend toward facts in political philosophy is that it leads philosophers to ignore or deny feminist advances in other fields, most notably the social sciences. A quick look at the remarks in recent philosophy journals asking philosophers {{to pay more attention to}} economists, sociologists, and psychologists show a clear preference for methodologies that have been strongly criticized by feminists in those same fields (see especially remarks by Farrelly 2007 and Swift 2008). In conclusion, I advocate that while interdisciplinary methods in political philosophy are supremely important, they should not take the form of uncritical acceptance of ALL results and methodologies. Instead, feminist political philosophy should be wary of how the methodologies of science and social science can limit or increase the possibility of structural change. Doing this ensures that feminist thought retains the power to imagine new worlds, rather than making only small adjustments to the old ones...|$|R

40|$|Extending "body-brain" {{evolution}} to {{the real-world}} presents {{a number of}} difficulties due to conflicting <b>idealizations</b> between evolutionary and constructional models.

Furthermore the substrate can enable the evolution of adaptive responses to nondeterministic developmental effects...|$|R
40|$|On {{standard}} {{accounts of}} scientific theorizing, {{the role of}} <b>idealizations</b> is to facilitate the analysis of some real world system by employing a simplified representation of the target system, raising the obvious worry about how reliable knowledge {{can be obtained from}} inaccurate descriptions. The <b>idealizations</b> involved in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect do not, it is claimed, fit this paradigm; rather the target system is a fictional system characterized by features that, though physically possible, are not realized in the actual world. The point of studying such a fictional system is to understand the foundations of quantum mechanics and how its predictions depart from those of classical mechanics. The original worry about the use of <b>idealizations</b> is replaced by a new one; namely, how can actual world experiments serve to confirm the AB effect if it concerns the behavior of a fictional system? Struggle with this issue helps to account for the fact that almost three decades elapsed before a consensus emerged that the predicted AB effect had received solid experimental support. Standard accounts of <b>idealizations</b> tout the role they play in making tractable the analysis of the target system; by contrast, the <b>idealizations</b> involved in the AB effect make its analysis both conceptually and mathematically challenging. The <b>idealizations</b> required for the AB effect are also responsible for the existence of unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations and of the current algebra, representations which an observer confined to the electron's configuration space could invoke to 'explain' AB-type effect without the need to posit a hidden magnetic field. The goal {{of this paper is to}} bring to the attention of the philosophers of science these and other aspects of the AB effect which are neglected or inadequately treated in literature...|$|R

25|$|Another paradox due to {{mathematical}} <b>idealization</b> is D'Alembert's {{paradox of}} fluid mechanics.

The mathematical model breaks down at the surface of the body, and new solutions involving boundary layers have to be considered to correctly model the drag effects.|$|E

The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to say anything about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E
