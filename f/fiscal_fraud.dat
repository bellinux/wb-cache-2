Typically, <b>fraud</b> experts identify patterns which are used by a development team to implement a system to run over existing data for the identification of suspicious behaviour. The process of defining rules is lengthy, expensive and error prone; even for minor variation of properties. In this {{paper we propose a}} framework enabling fraud experts to directly experiment with fraud patterns, getting immediate feedback based on past data so as to enable their verification and refinement. Using a domain-specific language, the framework will empower fraud experts to design the patterns, whilst the use of automated fiscal trail analysis enables feedback from the effect of the rules onto the system.

40|$|The Swamp Land Act of 1849, {{originally}} intended to give the state of Louisiana the unproductive swamplands within its borders and use the proceeds to construct the drains and levees necessary to reclaim these lands, was extended to Oregon in 1860. Oregon did not act on the matter until 1870, but once begun, it became a prolific source of political corruption, <b>fiscal</b> irresponsibility, <b>fraud,</b> and land speculation and monopolization. Even though the physiography of Oregon was much different than {{the states in the}} Mississippi Valley, millions of acres of 2 ̆ 2 swampland 2 ̆ 2 were filed upon and the state sold hundreds of thousands of acres long before it received legal title to these lands. In most cases final patents were never issued by the federal government. Rather than the proceeds of the sales of these lands going toward reclamation, the funds often went to the friends of state officials for dubious services. Appropriations, based on the anticipated sale of swampland, were made for the owners of wagon roads for projects never completed. This created a state indebtedness which the sale of swampland alone could not erase. A major result of the Swamp Land Act in Oregon was the withholding of arable land and water rights from actual settlers in the predominantly semiarid regions of Oregon by land speculators and by cattle barons who used it to monopolize vast tracts of grazing land. Litigation over disputed swampland claims occurred well into the twentieth century. Because little has been written on this topic, primary sources have been extensively relied upon for the research. The most important of these sources were the Portland Oregonian, government documents of the state of Oregon, and the documents of the United States Department of Interior...|$|R

Goubert and Mouttoupoulle (mayor of Pondicherry) went underground to evade capture. The party began planning to build a parallel administration in the peripheries of the Pondicherry district. The party was able to use its dominance of local communities, which had been established with French patronage, to mobilize resistance against French rule. The civil disobedience campaign of the Socialist Party (with support from other nationalist parties) was launched on 27 March 1954.

Following the amount of press coverage, proof and criticism stemming from the recording’s leakage, President Hollande had no other choice but to release him from his duties as Minister of Budget on the 19th of March, 2013. Mr. Cahuzac was accused of money laundering and <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud,</b> two crimes that inevitably go hand-in-hand. He later admitted to having transferred 600,000 euros to a bank account in Singapore. Subsequently, he was condemned to three years in Prison along with a 375,000 euro fine. The judges on the case deemed this sentence necessary because of the “traitorous” nature of his acts and words - “especially when put in contrast with his job responsibilities and requirements” said one of the judges. He can however decide to appeal the decision reached by the Justice officials.

5000|$|France’s President and {{government}} subsequently decided to implement new reforms. There were two main reforms announced by President Hollande following this incident.

And the second one states that the financial details {{of each and every}} single minister and Member of Parliament have to be examined and published.

However, to fight perjury as much as possible, a specific law is trying to be put forth and passed by the National Assembly. This law states that a 75,000 euro fine and up to five years of prison was required for any elected politician or Member of Parliament who lies in front of Parliament about a fiscal or criminal matter. These laws and new regulations were put in place after French politicians realized how dissatisfied the French population was. [...] "LeMonde,” “LeFigaro,” and “LCI," [...] three famous and reliable French news companies, conducted a study that indeed confirmed the preceding statement: 33% of France's citizens wanted President Hollande to dissolve the National Assembly - one of the Fifth French Republic’s most important and emblematic pillars.|$|E
40|$|In our {{paper we}} shall try to present two {{mechanisms}} of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> used by economical agents and {{also found in}} the control actions performed by the fiscal organs at different commercial societies from Romania. The presented mechanisms refer to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> resulted from fictitious acquisitions of goods and services done by Romanian firms which have as beneficiaries other commercial societies which are fiscally registered in Romania. Being empirically examined, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> will be presented through the use of some figures which will describe the detailed operations step by step. For the cases we have chosen to present we will describe the real circuit of goods and money according to the documents. We will also refer to the possibility of identifying the risk of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> that results from the reports provided by the economic agents for different state institutions. We will also consider the information provide by the books of prime entry and bookkeeping, documents which have to be written by the commercial societies according to the Law accountancy nr. 82 / 199, with further modifications and completions. The mechanisms of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> in use can be identical with the ones presented in this paper or they can be different as „new elements” can appear; these „new elements” depend on the type of activity performed, the modifications the legislative framework, the performers’ creativity or other external or internal factors which are not identified by the fiscal organs. By identifying the <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> mechanisms {{and the way in which}} they function, the fiscal organs will be given the opportunity to take the necessary measures so that the fiscal resources of the state consolidated budget should not be affected by such operations. It is will known that we can speak of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and shadow economy in any country but,according to the reports and statistics published by different international institutions, Romania’s shadow economy represent almost 30 % from the Gross Domestic Product.

40|$|In {{a society}} in which all firms and {{citizens}} want to be balanced and in which exists respect for others, it would be reasonable to suppose that firms, in general, and citizens, in particular, paid their respective taxes, more motivated by a conscience of civic duty and social responsibility perspective, than, properly, for fear of the sanction of a non-execution order. Actually, <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and evasion became a "current" practice for firms to decrease their payments to the State Budget in consequence of the no taxes payment. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and evasion, usually, involves a deliberate act with the intention of obtaining an unauthorized benefit. Some examples of these actions in firms are: making or altering documents; purposely inaccurate financial reporting; improper handling or reporting of money transactions; authorizing or receiving compensation for goods not received or services not performed. In this sense, directors and all levels of management are responsible for preventing and detecting situations of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and evasion. Also, for establishing and maintaining formal internal controls that, inside of a sphere of social responsibility and functional segregation, provide security for the resources of the firms. Thus, directors and managers of firms must recognise risks and exposures inherent in their responsibility area, and be, particularly, attentive of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and evasion indicators. The authors defend that, it is urgently that the Governments reinforce the fight against <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and evasion of the firms to provide the increase of their revenues through the implementation of formals internal preventative measures. This aim sets, on one hand, in the effectiveness of the combat measures of fraud and evasion. On other hand, it centres in the social responsibility of citizens and in generalization of its ethical behaviour. The success of these measures on the taxes services depends on the level of modern information and communication technologies. In this context, the progressive computerisation of taxes services remains a priority for the Government, because low automation levels limit the efficiency of the execution of taxes payments, of tax audits and the fight against <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> and evasion...|$|E

We have also referred to the registering obligations towards the fiscal institutions, types of declarations and the penalties for not obeying the current legislation {{in the case of the}} economic agents undergoing intracommunitary operations. At the end of the present paper, we have chosen to present three cases of <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> as well as the measures which have been adopted by Romania in 2012 in order to prevent the <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> in the field of intracommunitary acquisitions. As a research method, the authors have used not only the theoretical approach, but also the empirical one. First of all, the theoretical approach has been chosen because there have been analyzed a lot of notions on intracommunitary acquisitions and deliveries of goods and services in accordance to the current legislation. Secondly, we have considered the empirical approach as we have concentrated on three <b>fiscal</b> <b>fraud</b> cases highly met in the case of the intracommunitary trade.
