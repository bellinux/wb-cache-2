40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> when applied to the AlSi 9 Cu 3 alloy when compared with other <b>degassing</b> techniques. The mechanism of aluminium <b>degassing</b> is discussed. A suitable ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> apparatus including a novel MMM (Multi-frequency Multimode Modulated) technology, able to supply up to 1. 2 kW power under a frequency up to 25 kHz, was developed specially for this purpose. Ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> is compared with rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> using argon and nitrogen as purging gases. Results characterization focuses the assessment of alloy density and final hydrogen content of the samples, using the Straube-Pffeifer method. Experimental results reveal that a constant value of density and hydrogen content can be reached after less than 2 minutes processing time, using ultrasonic energy, which is 3 times faster than rotary impeller <b>degassing.</b> Regardless of the processing time, final results (density and hydrogen concentration) achieved with ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> are much better than those reached using the gas purging technique...|$|R
30|$|The {{long-term}} stable <b>degassing</b> {{with a large}} {{emission rate}} is characteristic of persistent <b>degassing,</b> which is caused by conduit magma convection (Shinohara, 2008). Considering the large magma <b>degassing</b> rate, the conduit magma convection is the likely mechanism of the <b>degassing</b> at Shin-moedake after the lava effusion. The Shinmoedake volcanic gas composition, however, is quite S-poor compared with other persistently <b>degassing</b> volcanoes at subduction zones (Fig. 8). Melt inclusion analyses suggests that the H 2 O and S contents of the bulk magma are about 2 wt.% and 500 ppm (Saito et al., 2011), implying that the H 2 O/S mol ratio of the bulk magma is 70, {{which is similar to}} other persistently <b>degassing</b> volcanoes, such as the Satsuma-Iwojima and Miyakejima volcanoes (Saito et al., 2001, 2010). The S-poor volcanic gas composition of the Shinmoedake can be due to high-pressure <b>degassing.</b> Based on empirically estimated gas solubility, Giggenbach (1996) modeled the evolution of the gas composition with <b>degassing.</b> The model suggests that a shallow <b>degassing</b> results in a S-rich gas and the composition becomes S-poor with increasing pressure, then becomes also H 2 O-poor with further pressure increase (Fig. 8). This <b>degassing</b> trend qualitatively agrees with the results of recent experimental work by Lense et al. (2011) for basaltic magmas. This <b>degassing</b> trend suggests that the composition difference between the volcanic gases of the Shinmoedake and other persistently <b>degassing</b> volcanoes can be caused by higher pressure <b>degassing</b> at the Shinmoedake than at other volcanoes. The quantitative modeling of the gas composition evolution, however, is still not possible {{because of the lack of}} the experimental sulfur partitioning coefficient; in particular, with silicic magmas at low pressure ranges (Webster and Botcharnikov, 2011). The H 2 O-rich composition of the Shimoedake gases can also be due to the incorporation of meteoric water heated by the lavas in the crater.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{plasticity}} of 4004 Al alloy and subsequently the productivity of 4004 Al foil, the research studied in detail {{the influence of the}} rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> process on the refining effect of 4004 Al alloy, in which the impacts of four major parameters: gas flow, rotational speed, refining time, and stewing time, on <b>degassing</b> rate of 4004 Al alloy was systematically studied by using an orthogonal experiment methodology. Results show that the rotational speed has the greatest impact on the <b>degassing</b> of 4004 Al alloy, followed by gas flow and refining time; stewing time has the least impact. The optimum purification parameters obtained by current orthogonal analysis were: rotor speed of 500 r·min- 1, inert gas flow of 0. 4 mL·h- 1, refining time of 15 min, and stewing time of 6 min. <b>Degassing</b> rate using the optimum parameters reaches 68 %. In addition, the comparison experiments among C 2 Cl 6 refining, rotary impeller <b>degassing,</b> and combined treatment of C 2 Cl 6 refining and rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> for 4004 Al alloy were performed. The experimental data indicated that the combined treatment of C 2 Cl 6 refining and rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> has the best <b>degassing</b> effect. <b>Degassing</b> rate of C 2 Cl 6 refining, rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> and combined refining treatment is 39 %, 69. 1 % and 76. 9 %, respectively. The mechanical properties of the specimen refined by rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> were higher than those by C 2 Cl 6 refining, but lower than those by combined refining treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of gases in groundwater under contaminated locations by geochemical and biological processes is not uncommon. <b>Degassing</b> of these gases from groundwater and repartitioning of noble gases between water and gas phase distorts groundwater dating by 3 H/ 3 He. We observed noble gas concentrations below atmospheric equilibrium in 20 out of 34 groundwater samples from agriculturally polluted sandy {{areas in the}} Netherlands. From the absence of nitrate in <b>degassed</b> samples, we conclude that denitrification causes <b>degassing.</b> The 22 Ne/ 20 Ne ratios show that <b>degassing</b> had attained solubility equilibrium and had not caused isotopic fractionation by diffusion. To correct {{for the loss of}} tritiogenic 3 He due to <b>degassing,</b> we present a single-step equilibrium <b>degassing</b> model. We use the total dissolved gas pressure at the monitoring screen to estimate the depth and timing of <b>degassing,</b> which is essential to estimate travel times from <b>degassed</b> samples. By propagating the uncertainties in the underlying measurements and assumptions through the travel time calculations, we found a travel time uncertainty of 3 years (a). We therefore conclude that 3 H/ 3 He dating can produce valuable information on groundwater flow even at sites with strong <b>degassing.</b> Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|The <b>degassing</b> of the Earth during {{accretion}} is {{constrained by}} Pu-U-I-Xe systematics. <b>Degassing</b> {{was much more}} efficient during the first 100 - 200 Ma than subsequently, and it was more complete for Xe than for the lighter gases. More than 90 percent of the <b>degassed</b> Xe escaped from the atmosphere during this period. The combination of fractional <b>degassing</b> of melts and rare gas escape from the atmosphere is able to explain the deficit of terrestrial Xe as a simple consequence of this early <b>degassing</b> history. By the time Xe was quantitatively retained in the atmosphere, the abundances of Kr and the lighter gases in the Earth's interior were similar to or higher than the present-day atmospheric abundances. Subsequent transfer of these lighter rare gases into the atmosphere requires {{a high rate of}} post-accretion <b>degassing</b> and melt production. Considerations of Pu-U-Xe systematics suggest that relatively rapid post-accretion <b>degassing</b> was continued to ca. 4. 1 - 4. 2 Ga. The present-day <b>degassing</b> history of the Earth is investigated through consideration of rare gas isotope abundances. Although the Earth is a highly <b>degassed</b> body, depleted in rare gases by many orders of magnitude relative to their solar abundances, it is at the present-day losing primordial rare gases which were trapped at the time of accretion...|$|R
5|$|In 1868, Moore's {{father was}} again elected MP for Mayo {{and the family}} moved to London the {{following}} year. Here, Moore senior tried, unsuccessfully, to have his son follow a career in the military though, prior to this, he attended the School of Art in the South Kensington Museum where his achievements were no better. He was freed from any burden of education when his father died in 1870. Moore, though still a minor, inherited the family estate that was valued at £3,596. He handed it over to his brother Maurice to manage and in 1873, on attaining his majority, moved to Paris to study art. It took him several attempts to find an artist who would accept him as a pupil. Monsieur Jullian, who had previously been a shepherd and circus masked man, took him on for 40 francs a month. At Académie Jullian he met Lewis Weldon Hawkins who became Moore's flatmate and whose trait, as a failed artist, show up in Moore's own characters. He met many of the key artists and writers of the time, including Pissarro, <b>Degas,</b> Renoir, Monet, Daudet, Mallarmé, Turgenev and, above all, Zola, who was to prove an influential figure in Moore's subsequent development as a writer.|$|E
5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two <b>Degas</b> sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E

30|$|Radionuclide and sulfur {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} samples from plume and hot fumarolic gas discharged from Satsuma Iwojima volcano, Japan.

At Satsuma Iwojima, inferred emanation coefficients of 210 Pb and 210 Po were estimated to be 0.07 and 2.5 %, respectively, the lowest values obtained to date in volcanic gases. These values may be “apparent” emanation coefficients, due to the high viscosity of the <b>degassing</b> magma, which prevents efficient <b>degassing</b> of such low concentration components.

25|$|Cassatt and <b>Degas</b> worked {{most closely}} {{together}} {{in the fall and}} winter of 1879–80 when Cassatt was mastering her printmaking technique. <b>Degas</b> owned a small printing press, and by day she worked at his studio using his tools and press while in the evening she made studies for the etching plate the next day. However, in April 1880, <b>Degas</b> abruptly withdrew from the prints journal they had been collaborating on, and without his support the project folded.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reports the}} results of batch and semibatch experiments involving bubbling of nitrogen in aqueous solutions of magnesium bicarbonate, with and without the addition of either carbonic anhydrase (CA) or Scenedesmus alga to the solution. Precipitation of nesquehonite occurred during both an accelerated <b>degassing</b> of CO 2 induced by sparging small nitrogen bubbles (representative diameter of 20 μm), and during slow <b>degassing</b> engendered by introducing large nitrogen bubbles (representative diameter of 5 mm). The response of the system during low rates of <b>degassing</b> closely approached quasi-thermodynamic predictions, which permitted an estimation {{of the level of}} supersaturation of nesquehonite, prior to the onset of precipitation. Small bubbles and CA significantly increased rates of <b>degassing</b> and indirectly the production of nesquehonite, as the rate of <b>degassing</b> can limit the precipitation process. The response of the system during rapid rates of <b>degassing,</b> prior to precipitation, was not entirely consistent with quasi-thermodynamic predictions. During precipitation, higher rates of <b>degassing</b> produced similar alkalisation and precipitation trends to that observed for lower rates of <b>degassing.</b> Our results agree with the formation of travertine deposits in nature, where the <b>degassing</b> of solutions enriched with inorganic carbon, and enhanced alkalisation by microorganisms, have been shown to influence carbonate formation. The results demonstrate a catalytic effect of CA on the rate limiting carbonate reactions, increasing CO 2 exchange between nitrogen and water, and indirectly accelerating the precipitation of carbonates for a system controlled by rate of <b>degassing.</b> The results of this study have applications to large-scale storage of CO 2 by mineralisation...|$|R

25|$|Degas's style {{reflects}} his deep {{respect for the}} old masters (he was an enthusiastic copyist well into middle age) and his great admiration for Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugène Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principles influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, <b>Degas</b> began with conventional historical paintings such as The Daughter of Jephthah (c.1859–61) and The Young Spartans (c.1860–62), in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, <b>Degas</b> also painted portraits of individuals and groups; {{an example of the}} latter is The Bellelli Family (c.1858–67), a brilliantly composed and psychologically poignant portrayal of his aunt, her husband, and their children. In this painting, as in The Young Spartans and many later works, <b>Degas</b> was drawn to the tensions present between men and women.

30|$|In the conduit magma {{convection}} model, <b>degassing</b> occurs under {{low pressure}} {{conditions at the}} top of the convecting magma column and the dense <b>degassed</b> magma descends through the magma column where a volatile-rich less dense magma ascends from a magma chamber to compensate the descending magma (Kazahaya et al., 1994; Shinohara, 2008). The low pressure <b>degassing</b> is consistent with the efficient H 2 O discharge from the H 2 O-poor magma at Shinmoedake.
