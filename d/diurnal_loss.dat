40|$|The tos 1 (tomato osmotically sensitive) mutant, {{isolated}} from an in vitro screen of root growth during osmotic stress, was less sensitive to exogenous ABA, but accumulated more ABA under osmotic stress than WT plants. We assessed growth and water relations characteristics of hydroponically grown tos 1 seedlings (in {{the absence of}} osmotic stress) at low and high evaporative demands. Growth of tos 1 was severely inhibited at both high and low evaporative demands. Twenty DAS, WT and tos 1 genotypes had a similar leaf water and turgor potential, but mature tos 1 plants (45 day old) showed a significant <b>diurnal</b> <b>loss</b> of leaf turgor, with recovery overnight. Increased evaporative demand increased turgor loss of tos 1 plants. High evaporative demand {{at the beginning of}} the day decreased stomatal conductance of tos 1, without diurnal recovery, thus whole plant transpiration was decreased. De-topped tos 1 seedlings showed decreased root hydraulic conductance and had a 1. 4 -fold increase in root ABA concentration. Impaired root function of tos 1 plants failed to meet transpirational water demand and resulted in shoot turgor loss, stomatal closure and growth inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Bamboos are {{prominent}} components of many tropical ecosystems, yet {{little is known}} about the physiological mechanisms utilized by these gigantic forest grasses. Here, we present data on the water transport properties of Chusquea ramosissima and Merostachys claussenii, monocarpic bamboo grasses native to the subtropical Atlantic forests of Argentina. C. ramosissima and M. claussenii differed in their growth form and exhibited contrasting strategies of water transport. Maximum xylem hydraulic conductivity of C. ramosissima culms was 2 -fold higher than that of M. claussenii. C. ramosissima cavitated at relatively high water potentials (50 % loss of conductivity at ≥ 1 MPa), whereas M. claussenii was more drought tolerant (50 % loss at ≤ 3 MPa). Both species exhibited significant loss of hydraulic conductivity during the day, which was reversed overnight due to the generation of root pressure. The photosynthetic capacities of both bamboo species, estimated based on electron transport rates, were moderate, reflecting both the large amount of leaf area supported by culms and <b>diurnal</b> <b>loss</b> of hydraulic conductivity due to cavitation. Leaf hydraulic conductance was also relatively low for both species, congruent with their modest photosynthetic capacities. Within its native range, C. ramosissima is highly invasive due to its ability to colonize and persist in both forest gaps and land cleared for agriculture. We propose that a highly vulnerable vasculature, coupled with diurnal root pressure and an allometry that allows substantial leaf area to be supported on relatively slender culms, are key traits contributing to the ecological success of C. ramosissima...|$|E
40|$|Growth at {{elevated}} CO 2 {{and temperature}} {{often leads to}} decreased Rubisco activity. We investigated the effects of increased CO 2, temperature and nitrogen on the diurnal changes in the control of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) activity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Spring wheat was grown at ambient and 700 μmol mol- 1 CO 2, under ambient and 4 ºC warmer temperatures, and with two levels of nitrogen supply in field tunnels in a Mediterranean environment. At ear emergence, elevated CO 2 increased Rubisco activation, but decreased Rubisco protein and, with high nitrogen, Rubisco specific activity, and {{had no effect on}} the rbcS transcript. Warmer temperatures tended to decrease the rbcS mRNA level and Rubisco protein, although the effect on Rubisco activity was small. High nitrogen decreased Rubisco activation or specific activity, depending on the CO 2 concentration. It increased Rubisco protein {{at the end of the}} night, but accelerated its <b>diurnal</b> <b>loss.</b> The main changes after anthesis were the disappearance of the decrease in Rubisco specific activity caused by elevated CO 2, an increase in this activity with above-ambient temperatures combined with high nitrogen, and that high temperature and nitrogen did not affect Rubisco protein contents. This study suggests that decreased leaf protein and increased levels of a Rubisco inhibitor, rather than gene repression by sugars, are involved in acclimation to elevated CO 2. High nitrogen increases this down regulation. Changes during growth in levels of leaf metabolites and protein may alter the relative importance of levels of inhibitors and Rubisco amounts for Rubisco regulation.

40|$|Genotypic {{variability}} in vulnerability of leaf xylem to water-stress-induced cavitation was determined in four sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) clones using detached leaf segments in a hydraulic conductivity apparatus. Vulnerability curves were constructed by plotting {{the percentage of}} maximum conductivity versus leaf water potential (ψI) and fitting curves using a Weibull function. The ψI at which each clone lost 10, 50, and 80 % of maximum conductivity was determined. Maximum conductivity per unit of leaf width was positively associated with metaxylem vessel diameter. The commercial clone H 65 - 7052 exhibited the highest and the nondomesticated S. spontaneum exhibited the lowest conductivity. All four clones lost substantial conductivity at values of ψI less negative than − 1. 4 MPa, but H 65 - 7052 was able to maintain 50 % conductivity to lower ψI than the other clones. S. spontaneum sustained the most negative ψI (− 1. 99 MPa) before reaching the 80 % conductivity loss point. Clone H 69 - 8235 was consistently the most vulnerable to initial loss of conductivity. These vulnerability functions were {{used in conjunction with}} field measurements of ψI to estimate <b>diurnal</b> <b>losses</b> in leaf hydraulic conductivity under irrigated and droughted conditions. H 69 - 8235 lost up to 50 % of its conductivity during the day, even when well irrigated, and more than 80 % when subjected to drought. The other clones exhibited lower conductivity losses. These losses are apparently reversed overnight by root pressure. Despite their close genetic relationships, these clones exhibited large differences in conductivity, in the vulnerability of their xylem to cavitation, and in gas exchange behavior. The potential for altering water relations by selecting for particular hydraulic characteristics is discussed...|$|R

Measurements were made in a Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determination over a range of ambient temperatures. The standard diurnal test shows that evaporative emissions increase progressively with increasing fuel temperature.

40|$|Extensive {{anatomical}} differences {{suggest that}} cervical and lumbar discs may have functional differences also. We investigated human cervical discs using “stress profilometry”. Forty-six cadaveric cervical motion segments aged 48 - 90  years {{were subjected to}} a compressive load of 200  N for 20  s, while compressive ‘stress’ was recorded along the posterior-anterior midline of the disc using a pressure transducer, side-mounted in a 0. 9  mm diameter needle. Stress profiles were repeated with the transducer orientated horizontally and vertically, and with the specimen in neutral, flexed and extended postures. Profiles were repeated again following creep loading (150  N, 2  h) which simulated <b>diurnal</b> water <b>loss</b> in vivo. Stress profiles were reproducible, and measured “stress” at each location was proportional to applied load. Stress profiles usually showed a hydrostatic nucleus with regions of higher compressive stress concentrated anteriorly in flexion, and posteriorly in extension. Stress concentrations increased in degenerated discs and following creep. Some features were unique to cervical discs: many showed a stress gradient across their central regions, even though vertical and horizontal stresses were equal to each other, and stress concentrations in the posterior annulus were generally small. Central regions of many cervical discs show {{the characteristics of a}} “tethered fluid” which can equalise stress over small distances, but not large. This may be attributable to their fibrous texture. The small radial diameter of the cervical posterior annulus may facilitate buckling and thereby prevent it from sustaining high compressive stresses...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal warm layers are {{as regular}} as {{the rising sun}} in many ocean regions, {{particularly}} those regions where winds are insufficient to vertically mix the accumulated heat. This widespread and infinitely repeating process {{has a number of}} important consequences for sea surface pCO 2 and air-sea fluxes. Surface heating alters CO 2 fluxes by increasing the pCO 2 at the surface [McNeil and Merlivat, 1996; Ward et al., 2004]. Nocturnal breakdown of the warm layer leads to a strong increase in convective velocities that subsequently increase gas fluxes [McGillis et al., 2004]. Isolation of the warm layer can deplete or accumulate CO 2 at the surface and change the sea surface pCO 2 within a short time frame [DeGrandpre et al., 2004]. The mixed-layer also determines the volume over which the loss or gain of CO 2 through the air-sea interface is distributed. Prediction of the evolution of sea surface pCO 2 at a given saturation level is therefore strongly dependent upon mixed-layer depth. In this presentation, we focus on depletion of CO 2 in the isolated warm layer and the importance of the diurnal mixed layer in ocean CO 2 models. We use a mixed-layer model to show that the <b>diurnal</b> air-sea <b>loss</b> of inorganic carbon in eastern equatorial Pacific water reduces the sea surface pCO 2 by 1 - 2 µatm [DeGrandpre et al., 2004]. The importance of including the diurnal mixed-layer depth in models is evaluated by comparison of model results using mixed-layer depth...|$|R

40|$|Drooling is an incapacitating {{feature of}} Parkinson's disease. Better {{pathophysiological}} insights {{are needed to}} improve treatment. In this study, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} cause of drooling is multifactorial. We examined 15 patients with Parkinson's disease with distinct <b>diurnal</b> saliva <b>loss</b> ("droolers") and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease without drooling complaints ("nondroolers"). We evaluated all factors that could potentially contribute to drooling: swallowing capacity (maximum volume), functional swallowing (assessed with the dysphagia subscale of the Therapy Outcome Measures for rehabilitation specialists), unintentional mouth opening due to hypomimia (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale item), posture (quantified from sagittal photographs), and nose-breathing ability. We also quantified the frequency of spontaneous swallowing during 45 minutes of quiet sitting, using polygraphy. Droolers had more advanced Parkinson's disease than nondroolers (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score 31 vs 22; P=. 014). Droolers also scored significantly worse on all recorded variables except for nose breathing. Swallowing frequency tended to be higher, possibly to compensate for less efficient swallowing. Logistic regression with adjustment for age and disease severity showed that hypomimia correlated best with drooling. Linear regression with hypomimia as the dependent variable identified disease severity, dysphagia, and male sex as significant explanatory factors. Drooling in Parkinson's disease results from multiple risk factors, with hypomimia being the most prominent. When monitored, patients appear to compensate by increasing their swallowing frequency, much like the increased cadence that is used to compensate for stepping akinesia. These findings can provide a rationale for behavioral approaches to treat drooling...|$|R
40|$|Summary Relationships between diel {{changes in}} stem ex-pansion and {{contraction}} and discharge and refilling of stem wa-ter storage tissues were studied in six dominant Neotropical sa-vanna (cerrado) tree species from central Brazil. Two stem tis-sues were studied, the active xylem or sapwood {{and the living}} tissues located between the cambium and the cork, made up predominantly of parenchyma cells (outer parenchyma). Outer parenchyma and sapwood density ranged from 320 to 410 kg m – 3 and from 420 to 620 kg m – 3, respectively, depending on the species. The denser sapwood tissues exhibited smaller rela-tive changes in cross-sectional area per unit change in water po-tential compared with the outer parenchyma. Despite undergo-ing smaller relative changes in cross-sectional area, the sap-wood released about 3. 5 times as much stored water for a given change in area as the outer parenchyma. Cross-sectional area decreased earlier {{in the morning in}} the outer parenchyma than in the sapwood with lag times up to 30 min for most species. The relatively small lag time between dimensional changes of the two tissues suggested that they were hydraulically well connected. The initial morning increase in basal sap flow lagged about 10 to 130 min behind that of branch sap flow. Spe-cies-specific lag times between morning declines in branch and main stem cross-sectional area were a function of relative stem water storage capacity, which ranged from 16 to 31 % of total <b>diurnal</b> water <b>loss.</b> Reliance on stored water to temporarily re-place transpirational losses is one of the homeostatic mecha-nisms that constrain the magnitude of leaf water deficits in cerrado trees...|$|R
40|$|Aims Nocturnal {{sap flow}} is {{a driving force}} not only for {{chemical}} transport and nutrient movement within trees, but also for water recharge caused by <b>diurnal</b> transpiration <b>loss.</b> Therefore, it is both ecologically and physiologically significant for estimating tree and stand transpiration at larger spatial and longer temporal scales. Our objective was to analyze nocturnal sap flow (18 : 00 – 5 : 00 next morning) and its biophysical controls in four tree species (Cedrus deodara, Zelkova schneideriana, Euonymus bungeanus and Metasequoia glyptostroboides) in Laodong Park in Dalian, China. Methods During June 1 –August 31, 2008, we measured sap flow of twelve urban trees of four species and three diameter at breast height (DBH) classes of each species continuously by thermal dissipation probes, soil moisture by ECH 2 O soil moisture probe and microclimate data by an automatic weather station. SPSS 13. 0 was used for statistical analysis of sap flow and environmental factors. Important findings Nocturnal sap flow was measured in all sampled trees, but varied from 0. 44 % to 75. 96 % of total daily water consumption. Nocturnal flow was larger and more active on rainy days than that on sunny ones, {{to the extent that}} it equaled or exceeded the diurnal volume. Vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were significantly correlated with nocturnal water movement (R 2 > 0. 6), which could provide an explanation for nocturnal transpiration. Nocturnal sap flow mainly contributed to nocturnal transpiration and water recharge. It peaked before midnight and dropped to nearly zero afterwards. Furthermore, nocturnal sap flow was remarkably correlatedwith diurnal sap flow (R 2 = 0. 356, p = 0. 00) and DBH (R 2 Spearman > 0. 80), substantiating the important role of specific structural and physiological characteristics. Nocturnal sap flow of individuals accounted for an average of < 14. 4 % of the total transpiration volume. Total water consumption of a forest ecosystem scaled up by daytime sap flux measurements can be underestimated without integration of nocturnal sap flux...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{the most}} {{limiting}} factor for crop production. These issues necessitate the study of water use efficiency (WUE; CO 2 assimilated/H 2 O transpired), an important trait of plants, particularly crop species. The need to develop crops with higher WUE is becoming increasingly urgent as global water shortages continue and periods of agricultural drought increase. Consequently, the genetic basis of WUE is of great interest for manipulation in plant breeding improvement programs to reduce water consumption, maintain yield stability, and food security as the world population continues to grow. Much {{attention has been paid}} to determinants that affect water use, such as ABA metabolism and the regulation of stomatal dynamics and density. However, WUE is also largely dependent on the timing of life cycle completion in the plant; longevity requires a higher efficiency if plants are to survive in environments with low water availability. Specifically, a linkage has been consistently observed in nature between flowering time and overall WUE. ^ Recent quantitative trait loci (QTL) data in Arabidopsis thaliana indicate that flowering time and WUE QTL co-locate with one another; FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) was identified as a candidate flowering time transcription factor that acts on other unknown determinants that also affect WUE, as measured by carbon isotope discrimination (CID). FLC is a central floral repressor that, when up-regulated, suppresses the transition to flowering in A. thaliana. These QTL data provide direct evidence for linkage of these traits on a molecular level. It is unknown whether the genetic linkage of these traits is due to pleiotropic effects or coordinated selection on specific groups of alleles that affect both traits, as flowering time and WUE are both heritable traits. Thus, the extent to which these traits can be regulated and/or separated is critical for future breeding programs designed to selectively improve WUE. Therefore, the central hypothesis for this research is that flowering time transcription factors also regulate WUE in A. thaliana. Experiments were specifically designed to test several measures of WUE and traits associated with WUE e. g. stomatal density, transpiration, water loss, etc., in a collection of A. thaliana flowering time transcription factors mutants. ^ CID data from three genotypes is consistent with previously published values and suggests that the delayed flowering genotype ColFRI has increased integrative WUE. However, no differences in instantaneous and integrative measures of WUE were detected in any genotype, which indicates that this group of flowering time transcription factors does not regulate WUE in A. thaliana. Transpiration rates, with the exception of one genotype, and <b>diurnal</b> water <b>loss</b> also did not differ among these genotypes. This is consistent with the WUE data. Transpiration and <b>diurnal</b> water <b>loss</b> did show the expected negative correlation with integrative WUE despite the lack of significant differences among genotypes for these three traits. ^ This group of genotypes did display interesting stomatal patterning phenotypes. Specifically, almost all delayed flowering genotypes had reduced abaxial stomatal density. But, this reduction in abaxial stomatal density was compensated for by a subsequent increase in adaxial stomatal density in these genotypes. This compensation in stomatal density resulted in very few genotypes that differed from the wild type in total stomatal density (abaxial plus adaxial stomatal density). Therefore, all late flowering genotypes displayed significantly lower abaxial:adaxial stomatal ratios that the wild type genotypes. Lastly, results from this research suggest that it is not sufficient to examine only the abaxial epidermis for stomatal characteristics, as both abaxial and adaxial stomatal density are significantly correlated with total stomatal density, but do not have a significant correlation with each other. All genotypes responded similarly with stomatal patterning phenotypes in long day (LD) and short day (SD) conditions as well, which suggests that the phenotype is photoperiod independent, even though this hypothesis was not explicitly tested. However, not all delayed flowering genotypes display the same response in stomatal density overall. Therefore, this alteration in stomatal patterning is not simply a result of altered rosette leaf development, but rather endogenous signals that are affecting patterning of the abaxial and adaxial epidermises. ...|$|R
40|$|Stratospheric {{constituents}} {{are determined}} by continuity equations including photochemical pro-duction and loss {{as well as the}} transport and diffusion terms and explicit time variation. Photochemical models self-consistently solve these equations to determine species concentrations. Recent Nimbus 7 measurements give us a first chance to analyze diagnostically the global atmosphere for consistency. We compute the diurnal average photochemical production and loss terms of ozone using monthly and zonally averaged limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS) 03, H 20, HNO 3, NO 2, and temper-ature and stratospheric and mesospheric sounder (SAMS) CH, • data. The loss rates of ozone by pure oxygen species, by the nitrogen oxides, and by the hydrogen oxides are calculated along with the production rate of ozone by oxygen photolysis. The other major loss rate for ozone, which is the loss rate by the chlorine family, is calculated from a two-dimensional model including SAMS CH, • measurements and a total C 1 x of 3 ppbv at the stratopause, yielding a C 10 profile in good agreement with balloon measurements. All loss rates of ozone are therefore tied to experimental measurements. Ozone is thought to be in photochemical equilibrium at low latitudes near 2 mbar; however, our calculations show the <b>diurnal</b> average ozone <b>loss</b> to be about 40 - 60 % higher than the production. Therefore photochemical models using LIMS H 20, HNO 3, NO 2, and temperature and SAMS CH, • will predict lower ozone concentrations than those measured by LIMS.

40|$|Climatic {{variables}} and soil present a high spatio-temporal variability. Evapotranspiration estimations based on climatic variables may be inadequate for assessing soil water {{content in the}} root-influenced zone and/or soil water consumption by plants.

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the soil moisture dynamics in the root-influenced zone and to assess the daily water consumption by the crop using Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR). The studied site is located in A Coruña (Spain). The study was carried out from June to October in 2008 and 2009, in a maize (Zea mays, L.) field on a silt-clay textured soil. Evapotranspiration was estimated by the Penman-Monteith equation using meteorological data from a station located on the experimental site. Soil water content in the root-influenced zone (0 – 60 cm depth) was hourly monitored each 20 cm (0 – 20 cm, 20 – 40 cm, and 40 – 60 cm) using FDR. Evaluations were performed on days with slight or no rainfall. During the study period, the magnitude of the <b>diurnal</b> soil water <b>loss</b> was more evident in the first layer (0 – 20 cm depth) and less important in the subsequent soil layers. The greatest consumption occurred between 14 and 19 h, up to 53. 64 % of the total. Overall, daily water consumption increased significantly with soil water content (p-value < 0. 001). In general, water losses from the 0 – 20 cm soil layer were greater than in subsoil horizons due to maize water-uptake and evaporation. In contrast, water content in the deepest part of the soil profile was close to saturation, even on the driest days of the studied period. Evapotranspiration overestimate maize water requirements as its values were greater than those measured with the probe. In conclusion, FDR allows a more accurate estimation of the soil water balance. Therefore, monitoring soil water content would be useful in the assessment of saturation risks or water stress (drought), thus aiding in the decision making, for instance, in irrigation management. Results from this study may help to improve irrigation practices in humid zones...|$|R
40|$|Depression and {{depressive}} symptoms are consistently reported {{as a problem}} for patients with daytime sleepiness in various studies. The present dissertation attempts to compare depression severity and daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy and Idiopathic Hypersomnia. The main objective of this dissertation is {{to determine whether the}} {{depressive symptoms}} of narcoleptic patients are different from the depressive symptoms of depressed non-narcoleptics. Given the large discrepancy in previous results on this topic, this hypothesis was to be tested in steps, therefore this dissertation is divided into three studies. The first study assesses depressive symptoms in 86 narcoleptic patients with (NC+) and without (NC-) cataplexy (46 women, 40 men), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) patients (three women, 12 men) and age- and sex- matched healthy controls. Seventy patients were under treatment with stimulants and/or anticataplectics. The second study compares depressive symptoms between 36 narcoleptics (26 women, 10 men) and 34 outpatients with mild to moderate depression (22 women, 12 men). The group of narcoleptics was selected from the sample of patients of the first study (n = 86) who had ≥ 10 points in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Global Impression of Severity of Depression (GSD), the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The third study identifies the components of depressive symptoms of narcoleptic patients using BDI. The total number of patients had to be increased to meet the basic requirements of a factor analysis. The sample was made up of 114 Caucasian narcoleptic patients (62 women, 52 men). The results show that patients with narcolepsy were more depressed than controls (higher scores in BDI, GSD, SDS, and POMS [in the total score and in all sub scale scores]); however, between the NC+ and NC- patient groups, no differences were found. Women and the patients using antidepressants and stimulants (combination) have a higher probability for depressive symptoms independent of the presence of cataplexy. The daytime sleepiness measured by the ESS (mean score) for the narcoleptic group was higher than the mean scores for the depressive group (p<. 001). In the item analysis, differences between the narcoleptic group and depressive disorder group in BDI were found regarding anhedonia. Narcoleptic patients were more likely to continue to feel pleasure compared to patients with depression. Further differences were found in the items loss of appetite and health worries. In SDS, narcoleptics were less impaired in <b>diurnal</b> variation, <b>loss</b> of libido, appetite and weight than patients with depression. Narcoleptics and depressives were more impaired in POMS (total and all sub scales) compared to controls. The factor analysis of BDI revealed that the negative attitude towards self was the component that explained most of the symptoms of depression. Even though this is a component also found in patients with depression without narcolepsy, it is interesting because in patients with narcolepsy it is more manifest than in depressives without this sleep disorder. Taken together, the findings support the assumption that the major psychosocial burden in narcolepsy is associated with sleepiness and not with cataplexy. Female sex and the intake of antidepressants and stimulants together are two determinants connected with depressive symptoms in patients with narcolepsy. The prevention of depressive symptoms should have special focus in women with narcolepsy independent of the presence of cataplexy. Furthermore, with regards to prevention, the focal point should be the negative attitude toward self as the most relevant component. Future studies should concentrate on the impact of medication on depression in patients with narcolepsy. ...|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1800 s, {{monitoring}} {{networks were}} established to investigate atmospheric composition impacts, {{and the conditions}} giving rise to them. The development of these networks, in terms of coordination and standardisation between contributing sites, has resulted in large advances in knowledge {{of the nature of}} atmospheric composition. Currently thousands of sites collect high quality atmospheric composition measurements globally. This thesis contends that in order to maximise the information derived from these measurements, a further advancement in standardisation is required to encompass the interpretation of monitoring network data. Currently there are limited examples of a common interpretation of data applied across all sites in a monitoring network, especially in relation to specific atmospheric composition impacts. In this thesis, a ‘chemical climatology’ framework is outlined which provides a common basis for targeting analysis towards identifying the linkage between a specific atmospheric composition impact and its causal drivers. Case studies apply the chemical climatology framework to demonstrate its utility in deriving scientific and policy relevant conclusions using measurement data from the UK monitoring supersites located at Harwell and Auchencorth. Prior to this, the representativeness of each site is quantified through the application of cluster analysis to ozone data at 100 rural European sites to identify groupings of sites with similar ozone variation. Harwell was representative of rural locations within 120 km of London, while Auchencorth was representative of a larger, transboundary spatial domain including the remainder of the rural UK. The first case study links the impact of ozone on human health (quantified by SOMO 10 and SOMO 35 metrics) and vegetation (flux-based PODY) to meteorological and emissions drivers. Between 1990 and 2013 at Harwell, there was a significant decrease in the contribution of European ozone to determining the impacts. Improvement in the human health impact was heavily dependent on the choice of metric (SOMO 35 decreased, no change in SOMO 10), and the vegetation impacts had not improved as high ozone episodes frequently coincided with plant conditions which reduced ozone uptake. These chemical climates emphasise the need for ozone mitigation on larger (hemispheric) scales than currently implemented. Secondly, the impact of 27 measured VOCs on the extent of the regional ozone increment is assessed. The photochemical loss of VOCs is then linked to reported gridded VOC emissions using air mass back trajectory analysis. Ethene and m+p-xylene had the largest <b>diurnal</b> photochemical <b>loss</b> during maximum monthly regional ozone increment, but the key conclusion was the limitation introduced through the reporting of gridded VOC emissions in heavily aggregated source sectors. Finally, the conditions producing the long term health impact of particulate matter (quantified by annual average PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations) at each site are derived through integration of measurements of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 with measurements of PM constituents. It is shown that the frequent, moderate PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations made a larger contribution to annual average values compared to the relatively infrequent high, episodic concentrations. The contribution of PM constituents and the contribution of local vs regional emissions to the range of PM concentrations is investigated. It was concluded that similar reductions in the contribution of secondary inorganic aerosol to the moderate PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations could be achieved from both the reduction of frequently traversed, smaller emissions sources, and less frequently traversed, larger emissions sources. The final chapter demonstrates the benefits from the extension of this framework to an entire monitoring network. It is envisioned that for each atmospheric composition impact, a standard set of statistics would be calculated which quantify the ‘impact’, ‘state’ and ‘drivers’ of that chemical climate. Calculation of ozone human health chemical climates across 100 European monitoring sites demonstrate this concept. This standardised interpretation of monitoring network data not only allows consistent comparison of an impact, but the common basis for determining how the impact is derived allows for the consideration of novel mitigation strategies and their spatial applicability...|$|R
40|$|Depression {{is still}} underestimated, despite its high incidence, {{and its impact}} on sub- jective quality of life. To {{accurately}} diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and {{to reduce the risk of}} relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symp- toms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in en- ergy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a ma- jor depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symp- toms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and some- times by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing signif- icant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, espe- cially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, <b>diurnal</b> vari- ations, <b>loss</b> of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Some- times, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective well- being. The aim of our observation is to reconsider the importance of a complete psy- chopathological assessment of patients with physical/somatic complaints. This is im- portant for two main reasons: 1) to consider physical complaints as a part of a more complicated syndrome; 2) to achieve as a treatment goal, a remission and not only a reduction of frequency or intensity of these symptoms. Findings from the literature show that physical symptoms may precede and follow ma- jor mood episodes, and may contribute, as residual manifestations, to increasing the risk or relapse or recurrence. Our aim is to consider as a new treatment option, these drugs that seem to be as equally effective on mood as on physical symptoms (SNRI). A new SNRI (duloxetine) seems to be useful in order to improve mood symptomatol- ogy during acute major depression episodes and to reduce distress due to the persis- tance of physical symptoms...|$|R
