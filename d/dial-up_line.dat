(More usually, the terminal type set by the getty program for the <b>dial-up</b> <b>line,</b> that the system administrator has determined to be used most often by dial-up users with remote terminals, matches the one used by the dial-up user and that user has no need to override the terminal type.) ...|$|E
50|$|Telecommunications {{lines at}} the time were of much lower quality. For example, it was almost {{impossible}} to run a <b>dial-up</b> <b>line</b> at more than 19,200 bits per second because of the overwhelming error rate, as comparing with 56,000 bits per second today on dial-up lines; and in the early 1970s few leased lines were run at more than 2400 bits per second (these low speeds are a consequence of Shannon's Law in a relatively low-technology environment). Telecommunications companies had little incentive to improve line quality or reduce costs, because at the time they were mostly monopolies and sometimes state-owned.|$|E
5000|$|TACACS {{is defined}} in RFC 1492, and uses (either TCP or UDP) port 49 by default. TACACS allows a client to accept a {{username}} and password and send a query to a TACACS authentication server, sometimes called a TACACS daemon or simply TACACSD. TACACSD uses TCP and usually runs on port 49. It would determine whether to accept or deny the authentication request and send a response back. The TIP (routing node accepting <b>dial-up</b> <b>line</b> connections, which the user would normally want to log in into) would then allow access or not, based upon the response. In this way, {{the process of making}} the decision is [...] "opened up" [...] and the algorithms and data used to make the decision are under the complete control of whomever is running the TACACS daemon.|$|E

40|$|Since {{starting}} to use Kerberos [1], which provides {{the option to}} encrypt rlogin sessions at the application layer, we noticed that using encryption caused a severe performance impact across <b>dial-up</b> <b>lines,</b> e. g., a 14. 4 kbps line using PPP with modem compression of data. We took measurements and verified {{the source of the}} problem as a non-synergistic interaction between the application, transport, and lower network layers. We modified the Kerberized rlogin (klogin) to accommodate this situation, and will make the modifications publicly available.

50|$|FTPmail {{gateways}} allowed {{people to}} retrieve such files. The file was broken into smaller pieces and encoded using a popular format such as uuencode. The receiver {{of the email}} messages would later reassemble the original file and decode it. As the file was broken into smaller pieces, the chances of losing the transmission was much smaller. In case of loss of connectivity, the transmission could be restarted from that part. The process was slower but much more reliable. It also allowed people who accessed the Internet only through email using <b>dial-up</b> <b>lines</b> to download files that were located remotely.
