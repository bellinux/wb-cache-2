5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits.

5|$|On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all {{former high}} {{officials}} of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard. The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five. Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half an <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and were not permitted to address each other or their guards. As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation. Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.|$|E

In fact, almost half of the Sub-Saharan households that according to WHO/UNICEF 'have access to improved water supply', spend more than half an <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> collecting the water. Although this loss of time is mentioned in the WHO/UNICEF report, it does not affect their 'improved' vs. 'non-improved' distinction.|$|E

25|$|God-fearers are {{considered}} to be of significant importance to the popularity of the Early Christian movement. They represented a group of gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to one degree or another. However, they were not converts, but a separate gentile community, engaged in Judaic religious ideas and practices. Actual conversion to Judaism would require adherence to all of the Laws of Moses, which includes various prohibitions (kashrut, circumcision, Sabbath observance etc.) which were generally unattractive to would-be gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unpopular in Classical civilization because it was the custom to spend an <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> or so exercising in the nude in the gymnasium and males {{did not want to be}} seen in public deprived of their foreskins.|$|E
500|$|According to Demarest, {{after the}} {{building}} was completed, college president William Henry Campbell was charged with raising $3,000 to acquire reference books for the library. [...] An 1876 survey by the U.S. Bureau of Education reported that Rutgers held 6,814 volumes in its college library and 3,800 in libraries of its two student literary societies—the Peithessophian Society and Philoclean Society. In 1884, President Merrill Gates appointed a recent alumnus then serving as the college's registrar, treasurer, and faculty secretaryIrving S. Upson (A.B. 1881)to take on additional responsibilities as librarian. Upson agreed [...] "to devote at least one <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to library work, for which he received a stipend of $15 a month, out of which he paid an assistant $2.50 per week. At this time, the library was open daily from 8:00 to 8:40 A.M., noon to 12:30 P.M., and 2:00 to 4:30 P.M." [...] Upson increased the holdings by 21,000 volumes before informing the president and trustees in 1894 that the library was inadequate to house the collection. The trustees feared that the collection posed a fire hazard or would collapse {{the floor of the}} second-floor library.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an <b>hour,</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|Although Lundgren {{has never}} competed as a {{professional}} bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said, [...] "Looking like {{a man in his}} 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years." [...] In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that [...] "it's just one <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours". Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. Lundgren has professed never to have been [...] "super strong", saying that, [...] "I'm too tall and my arms are long. I think back then [...] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat." ...|$|E
500|$|With Black Ice, Brendan O'Brien {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the rock sound of AC/DC's early work on albums such as Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. He thought the two previous studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, were blues-influenced. O'Brien {{tried to focus on}} the choruses, which he felt were {{the best part of the}} AC/DC songs, and encouraged the band to emphasise the [...] "hooky, melodic side" [...] of its song-writing, which Angus complimented, since he had [...] "never been great with harmonies". Mike Fraser said the band aimed [...] "towards The Razors Edge era, a little bit more up-tempo stuff." [...] O'Brien made suggestions about the band's performance, got Angus to play slide guitar on [...] "Stormy May Day", and told Johnson to swap some screaming for [...] "soul crooning" [...] as Johnson was a soul singer. Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band's style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive. Because of the highly demanding singing style, Johnson only recorded his vocals for one <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes, and Phil Rudd's drumming was a consistent 4/4 time, mostly on his snare, kick drum and hi-hat cymbal. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd said, [...] "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added [...] "n AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it".|$|E
