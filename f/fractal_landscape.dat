40|$|We {{propose a}} flat-histogram Monte Carlo method to {{efficiently}} sample <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes</b> such as escape time functions of open chaotic systems. This {{is achieved by}} using a random-walk step which depends on {{the height of the}} landscape via the largest Lyapunov exponent of the associated chaotic system. By generalizing the Wang-Landau algorithm, we obtain a method which simultaneously constructs the density of states (escape time distribution) and the correct step-length distribution. As a result, averages are obtained in polynomial computational time, a dramatic improvement over the exponential scaling of traditional uniform sampling. Our results are not limited by the dimensionality of the phase space and are confirmed numerically for dimensions as large as 30. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures; Published versio...|$|R
40|$|Typically, in the {{dynamical}} theory of extremal events, the function that gauges {{the intensity of}} a phenomenon {{is assumed to be}} convex and maximal, or singular, at a single, or at most a finite collection of points in phase [...] space. In this paper we generalize this situation to <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes,</b> i. e. intensity functions characterized by an uncountable set of singularities, located on a Cantor set. This reveals the dynamical rôle of classical quantities like the Minkowski dimension and content, whose definition we extend to account for singular continuous invariant measures. We also introduce the concept of extremely rare event, quantified by non [...] standard Minkowski constants and we study its consequences to extreme value statistics. Limit laws are derived from formal calculations and are verified by numerical experiments. Comment: 20 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|Models {{describing}} {{the evolution of}} dispersal strategies have mostly focused {{on the evolution of}} dispersal rates. Taking trees as a model for organisms with undirected, passive dispersal, we have developed an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation tool to investigate the evolution of the dispersal kernel, P(r), and its resulting cumulative seed-density distribution, D(r). Simulations were run on a variety of <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes</b> differing in the fraction of suitable habitat and the spatial autocorrelation. Starting from a uniform D(r), evolution led to an increase in the fraction of seeds staying in the home cell, a reduction of the dispersal mortality (arrival in unsuitable habitat), and the evolution of 'fat-tailed' D(r) in autocorrelated landscapes and approximately uniform D(r) in random landscapes. The evolutionary process was characterized by long periods of stasis with a few bouts of rapid change in the dispersal rate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Populations live in {{habitats}} whose quality varies spatially and temporally. Understanding how populations {{deal with}} these variable habitats can aid our understanding of theoretical issues, and practical issues of biological invasions and biodiversity conservation. I investigate these issues by superimposing simple models of population growth and dispersal on spatiotemporally <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and examining {{the properties of the}} landscapes, and of the populations inhabiting them. The properties of the simulated landscape sequences are comparable to those of real habitats. The simulated populations exhibit a range of dynamic behaviors; these behaviors are strongly influenced by the fractal parameters of the landscapes. The results may help explain several important phenomena seen in reintroductions of threatened and endangered species, introductions of biological control agents, and biological invasions. These phenomena include frequently observed lags between population introduction and initial population growth and spread, and the observed high frequency of failure of introductions...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalized}} Levy walk to model <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes</b> observed in noncoding DNA sequences. We {{find that this}} model provides a very close approximation to the empirical data and explains a number of statistical properties of genomic DNA sequences such as the distribution of strand-biased regions (those with an excess of one type of nucleotide) {{as well as local}} changes in the slope of the correlation exponent alpha. The generalized Levy-walk model simultaneously accounts for the long-range correlations in noncoding DNA sequences and for the apparently paradoxical finding of long subregions of biased random walks (length lj) within these correlated sequences. In the generalized Levy-walk model, the lj are chosen from a power-law distribution P(lj) varies as lj(-mu). The correlation exponent alpha is related to mu through alpha = 2 -mu/ 2 if 2 < mu < 3. The model is consistent with the finding of "repetitive elements" of variable length interspersed within noncoding DNA...|$|R
40|$|Mapping {{nucleotide}} sequences onto a "DNA walk" {{produces a}} novel representation of DNA that {{can then be}} studied quantitatively using techniques derived from <b>fractal</b> <b>landscape</b> analysis. We used this method to analyze 11 complete genomic and cDNA myosin heavy chain (MHC) sequences belonging to 8 different species. Our analysis suggests an increase in fractal complexity for MHC genes with evolution with vertebrate > invertebrate > yeast. The increase in complexity {{is measured by the}} presence of long-range power-law correlations, which are quantified by the scaling exponent alpha. We develop a simple iterative model, based on known properties of polymeric sequences, that generates long-range nucleotide correlations from an initially noncorrelated coding region.

40|$|A <b>fractal</b> <b>landscape</b> realizer {{has been}} {{developed}} that generates synthetic landscape maps to user specifications. The alternative landscape realizations are not identical to the actual maps after which they are patterned, but are similar statistically (i. e., the areas and fractal character of each category are replicated). A fractal or self-affine pattern generator is used to provide a spatial probability surface for each category in the synthetic map. The Fractal Realizer arbitrates contentions among categories {{in a way that}} makes it possible to preserve the fractal patterns of all the categories in the resulting synthetic landscape. Each synthetic landscape is one equally likely realization from among an infinite ensemble of possible <b>fractal</b> <b>landscape</b> combinations. Synthetic landscapes produced by the Fractal Realizer have been tested using a variant of the Turing Test. More than 100 map experts were presented with a series of 20 selections of paired maps, and asked to distinguish the real map from the synthetic realization. The resulting population of scores was not significantly different from a random binomial, suggesting that the experts were unable to discern the synthetic maps from the actual ones. Statistical landscape indices computed for 25 different synthetic realizations are compared with the values computed for the actual maps. The Fractal Realizer can be used as a stochastic generator of synthetic input maps to a spatially explicit simulation model to test the effects of landscape rearrangement on the uncertainty of model parameter estimates. The sensitivity of stochastic spatial simulations to prescribed input landscapes can be evaluated by supplying them with a series of synthetic maps that obey particular statistical characteristics and by monitoring changes in selected output responses. Statistically similar input landscapes with different spatial arrangements can be generated and supplied to spatial models as a hedge against pseudoreplication...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{hypotheses}} proposed to explain ecotones {{are based on}} an individualistic paradigm and are essentially static. While they include local feedbacks, they ignore the interactions between pattern and process across scales. These feedbacks in ecotones are nonlinear in nature and complicate the relations of pattern and process in vegetation, which, combined with observed fractal patterns, suggests a complexity science approach to investigate ecotone dynamics. A cellular automaton of alpine treeline, including nonlinear, local, positive, and negative feedbacks in tree establishment and mortality, as reported in field studies, {{is used as a}} model system. Fourier analysis of simulated alpine treelines shows fractal patterns across the treeline landscapes, which are created by patch development. The temporal evolution of the spatial pattern is also <b>fractal.</b> <b>Landscape</b> scale linear correlations between spatial pattern and the rate of advance of trees into tundra arise from localized nonlinear interactions. A tree-patch-landscape scale explanation of pattern-process interaction is proposed in which the endogenous feedbacks determine the spatial and temporal fractal properties of the ecotone.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} driving diversity in nature {{is an important}} and ongoing challenge in our changing world. To efficiently protect ecosystem diversity {{it is crucial to}} explain why and how species coexist. Over the last decades models explaining species coexistence have increased in complexity but usually don't incorporate a detailed spatial context. However, spatial structure has been shown to affect species coexistence and habitat deterioration {{is one of the biggest}} threats to biodiversity. We therefore explore a spatially explicit two-species model and assess the effects of habitat structure on species coexistence using a wide diversity of <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Each species is specialized in a particular habitat type. We find that landscape structure has a major influence on the stability and constitution of a two species system and may be sufficient to explain the coexistence of two species. Well connected and highly structured habitat configurations allow spatial segregation of both species and this decreases local interspecific competition; in our model this is the most important process stabilizing coexistence...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has begun to}} explore not just the spatial distribution of eye fixations but also the temporal dynamics of how {{we look at the}} world. In this investigation, we assess how scene characteristics contribute to these fixation dynamics. In a free-viewing task, participants viewed three scene types: <b>fractal,</b> <b>landscape,</b> and social scenes. We used a relatively new method, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), to quantify eye movement dynamics. RQA revealed that eye movement dynamics were dependent on the scene type viewed. To understand the underlying cause for these differences we applied a technique known as fractal analysis and discovered that complexity and clutter are two scene characteristics that affect fixation dynamics, but only in scenes with meaningful content. Critically, scene primitives-revealed by saliency analysis-had no impact on performance. In addition, we explored how RQA differs from {{the first half of the}} trial to the second half, as well as the potential to investigate the precision of fixation targeting by changing RQA radius values. Collectively, our results suggest that eye movement dynamics result from topdown viewing strategies that vary according to the meaning of a scene and its associated visual complexity and clutter. © 2014 ARVO...|$|E
40|$|Representations of {{real and}} virtual landscapes are often {{abstracted}} and quantified as 2 ̆ 2 landscape metrics 2 ̆ 2 in landscape ecology, and while much {{is known about}} them after 20 years of use, some relations are as yet unexplored. The objective {{of this research is}} {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of spatial representation in landscape ecology. Nine hundred artificial landscapes were generated with varying spatial patterns created using a <b>fractal</b> <b>landscape</b> generator with 3 D fractal dimensions ranging from 2. 1 to 2. 9 in increments of 0. 1. The 3 D landscapes were reduced to 2 D patterns by putting the cells into five classes. Forty-four landscape metrics were used to measure the resulting 2 D landscape spatial patterns, and the relations of nine of these to the generating 3 D fractal dimensions and to each other across these fractal dimensions were analyzed. The expected nonlinear relations between metrics and the generating 3 D fractal dimensions led to unimodal correlation structures between some of the metrics, with low, nonsignificant correlations in the middle range of the 3 D fractal dimensions. The selection of metrics and their interpretation, especially in the midrange of landscape complexity, may need to be reassessed...|$|E
40|$|Many animals perform two {{distinct}} alternating movement strategies when foraging: intensive searches with low speed and high turning {{to cover a}} small area in high detail and extensive searches with high speed and low turning to cover a large area in low detail. Observed movement paths will tend to exhibit differences in speed and correlation between these different search strategies. Identifying transitions between strategies can enable one to acquire information regarding both the distribution of resources and the underlying behavioural mechanisms performed by a foraging animal. Methods such as the moving average, first-passage time, residence time and <b>fractal</b> <b>landscape</b> methods {{have been used to}} identify behavioural states of various real and simulated foragers. We provide a review of these current methods and identify a set of common limitations associated with each procedure. We develop a new mathematical approach: the partial sum method, which is designed to avoid these limitations. A comprehensive test is undertaken to evaluate and compare the performance of the partial sum and the existing methods using a carefully constructed set of computer-generated movement paths. Each simulated track was designed to replicate the possible paths performed by an animal under different foraging conditions. Our results provide strong evidence that the partial sum method is better than existing analytical methods for identifying transitions between two different search strategies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

5000|$|Not only do {{animated}} images {{form part of}} computer-generated imagery, natural looking <b>landscapes</b> (such as <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes)</b> are also generated via computer algorithms. A simple way to generate fractal surfaces is to use {{an extension of the}} triangular mesh method, relying on the construction of some special case of a de Rham curve, e.g. midpoint displacement. For instance, the algorithm may start with a large triangle, then recursively zoom in by dividing it into four smaller Sierpinski triangles, then interpolate the height of each point from its nearest neighbors. The creation of a Brownian surface may be achieved not only by adding noise as new nodes are created but by adding additional noise at multiple levels of the mesh. Thus a topographical map with varying levels of height can be created using relatively straightforward fractal algorithms. Some typical, easy-to-program fractals used in CGI are the plasma fractal and the more dramatic fault fractal.|$|R

Super cially {{realistic}} worlds {{can easily}} be created using <b>fractal</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Such landscapes are limited in that real-world geological features such as caves and overhangs are impossible using a standard height eld representation. Interactive, realistic simulation of terrain evolution on such landscapes has proved elusive and does not generally provide direct control over the placement of landscape features. This thesis presents an interactive terrain design system, which enables the user to generate localised, speci c terrain features, as well as generalised global characteristics. A fully volumetric terrain representation is used to allow varied three dimensional terrain features. A hybrid rendering algorithm is employed to e ciently render the volumetric data set, while allowing interactive terrain deformation. Small terrain deformation is enabled using voxel carving, while larger terrain features is generated using an adoption of the Wires algorithm.

In order for the field to advance it is necessary to carry out effective camparative evaluations of these algorithms, and thereby better identify and understand those properties that optimise performance. This paper discusses the difficulties of providing benchmarking of evolutionary and allied algorithms that is both meaningful and logistically viable. To be meaningful the benchmarking test must give a fair comparison that is free, as far as possible, from biases that favour one style of algorithm over another. To be logistically viable it must overcome the need for pairwise comparison between all the proposed algorithms.
