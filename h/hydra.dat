5|$|<b>Hydra</b> the Revenge (sometimes simply {{shortened}} to <b>Hydra)</b> is a steel Floorless Coaster at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States. It is {{the only}} Floorless Coaster in Pennsylvania and was built where the former wooden roller coaster Hercules once stood, which was closed and demolished {{at the end of}} the park's 2003 season. Its name comes from the Greek Mythology story where Hercules battled the <b>Hydra.</b>|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the roller}} coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After {{defeating}} the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the <b>Hydra,</b> a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow each time they were cut off, including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered {{the remainder of the}} story- after Hercules managed to defeat the <b>Hydra</b> initially, he buried the immortal head stuck under a stone, with the intention of sealing it for all time. Years later however, the head slowly grew back, resurrecting the <b>Hydra</b> and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the <b>Hydra</b> roller coaster sits where Hercules once did.|$|E

5|$|In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg {{set out for}} the Netherlands, with Linnaeus to take a {{doctoral}} degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk. On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed <b>hydra.</b> Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the <b>hydra</b> suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the <b>hydra</b> for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.|$|E
5|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on {{the tail of the}} Serpent (Greek <b>Hydra).</b> The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that <b>Hydra</b> signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with <b>Hydra)</b> were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, <b>Hydra</b> had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E

5|$|Site {{preparation}} {{began in}} late 2003, when on September 1, 2003, Hercules, a wooden roller coaster that {{sat in the}} current location of <b>Hydra</b> the Revenge, was closed and demolished. On September 14, 2004, the $13 million <b>Hydra</b> the Revenge was announced.

5|$|By 1914, <b>Hydra</b> and Psara {{had been}} reduced to {{secondary}} duties: <b>Hydra</b> became a gunnery training ship while Psara was used to train engine-room personnel. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war {{on the side of the}} Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space for a decade. All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, <b>Hydra</b> {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} from active duty {{to serve as}} a gunnery training ship. At the outbreak of World War I in at the end of July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. In October 1916, <b>Hydra</b> and a pair of torpedo boats defected to the Venizelist faction in the National Schism. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve {{for the remainder of the}} war. <b>Hydra</b> was decommissioned in 1918 and stricken from the naval register the next year. She was to be sold for scrapping in 1921, but instead returned to her role as a naval artillery school from 1922 until 1929 when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E

When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to <b>Hydra.</b> Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the <b>Hydra</b> agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hydra</b> and {{her sisters}} saw heavy service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the GrecoTurkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and {{prevented}} the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy. <b>Hydra</b> saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and {{was present at the}} Naval Battle of Lemnos, but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during World War I, and was reduced to a gunnery training ship {{after the end of the}} war. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{recruits}} Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier {{to attack}} other known <b>Hydra</b> bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers {{and his team}} sabotage various <b>Hydra</b> operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final <b>Hydra</b> stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using {{weapons of mass destruction}} on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off, and during the subsequent fight the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, causing him to dissolve in a bright light. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.|$|E

New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the <b>Hydra,</b> and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new <b>Hydra</b> is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E
