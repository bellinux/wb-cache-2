40|$|Abstract Background Biological invasions can be {{considered}} one of the main threats to biodiversity, and the recognition of common ecological and evolutionary features among invaders can help developing a predictive framework to control further invasions. In particular, the analysis of successful invasive species and of their autochthonous source populations by means of genetic, phylogeographic and demographic tools can provide novel insights into the study of biological invasion patterns. Today, long-term dynamics of biological invasions are still poorly understood and need further investigations. Moreover, distribution and molecular data on native populations could contribute to the recognition of common evolutionary features of successful aliens. Results We analyzed 2, 195 mitochondrial base pairs, including Cytochrome b, Control Region and rRNA 12 S, in 161 Italian and 27 African specimens and assessed the ancient invasive origin of Italian crested porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata)</b> populations from Tunisia. Molecular coalescent-based Bayesian analyses proposed the Roman Age as a putative timeframe of introduction and suggested a retention of genetic diversity during the early phases of colonization. The characterization of the native African genetic background revealed the existence of two differentiated clades: a Mediterranean group and a Sub-Saharan one. Both standard population genetic and advanced molecular demography tools (Bayesian Skyline Plot) did not evidence a clear genetic signature of the expected increase in population size after introduction. Along with the genetic diversity retention during the bottlenecked steps of introduction, this finding could be better described by hypothesizing a multi-invasion event. Conclusion Evidences of the ancient anthropogenic invasive origin of the Italian <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata</b> populations were clearly shown and the native African genetic background was preliminary described. A more complex pattern than a simple demographic exponential growth from a single propagule seems to have characterized this long-term invasion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Several odorant binding {{proteins}} (OBP) {{have been}} previously purified from the nasal mucosa {{of the old}} world porcupine <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata.</b> In this paper, we report their N-terminal amino-acid sequences and accurate molecular weights, as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry. The partial amino acid sequences reveal significant similarity with OBPs of other mammalian species and segregate the eight proteins purified into two subclasses. Mass spectrometry has revealed microheterogeneity among the proteins belonging to each of these two groups, suggesting a total number of OBPs of at least nine. The molecular weight differences between OBPs cannot be readily accounted for by common post-translation modifications and indicate different gene products. Such a large number of different OBPs may represent. further support to an odour discriminating role for these proteins. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the arteria mesenterica cranialis and its branches in the porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata).</b> Nine adult porcupines (5 males, 4 females) were each injected with a coloured latex mixture from the aortic arch for demonstration of the arteria mesenterica cranialis. The results indicated that the arteria colica dextra was anastomosed with the arteria colica media and the ramus colicus. The arteria pancreaticoduodenalis caudalis separated from the arteria mesenterica cranialis as a third branch after the arteria colica media and the arteria colica dextra. Vascularization of the jejenum was made by the jejunal arteries, which originated from the arteria mesenterica cranialis and truncus jejunalis. The arteria ileocolica was continuous with the arteria mesenterica cranialis after giving off the jejunal arteries. Vascularization of the ileum was supplied by the ramus ilealis and the ramus ilei mesenterialis. The arteria ileocolica ended by separating into the rami colici and arteria cecalis. In summary, in the present study the branches of the arteria mesenterica cranialis were studied for the first time in porcupines. The results of this study may contribute to the data in this area of science.

40|$|The {{combination}} of tiletamine HCl and zolazepam HCl {{has been used}} on many species of wild mammals. Short induction time low dosage, satisfactory safety margins, relatively constant immunobilization time, and smooth recovery are benefits reported. This combination (Zoletil(R) 100) was used during a study on bebavioural ecology of the crested porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata)</b> in a Mediterranean coastal area (Maremma Regional Park, Tuscany, Italy). We used this mixture 42 times on 31 individuals. Mean adult dose was (+/-SE) 7. 24 +/- 0. 37 mg/kg (74. 0 +/- 3. 0 mg/individual). Average adult induction time was 5. 3 min (+/- 1. 1) and average adult immunobilization time was 22. 6 min (+/- 6. 0). One adult male porcupine died after chemical restraints. The use of tiletamine-zolazepam seems adequate for chemical immunobilization of crested porcupines under field conditions, mainly because of its short induction time, small volume to be injected and wide safety margin...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} wild boar Sus scrofa and feral pigs on {{ecosystems}} and human activities {{is of interest}} worldwide. Bait-delivered pharmaceuticals such as contraceptives or disease vaccines are increasingly advocated to assist the management of such impacts. We evaluated the Boar-Operated-System (BOS™) to deliver baits to wild boar in a Mediterranean area with a large community of potential nontarget species. In a pre-trial phase (BOS™ open), both wild boar and 12 nontarget species (wildlife and livestock) visited the BOS™ and eight species consumed the baits. In the trial phase, when the BOS™ were closed, only wild boar consumed baits. From pre-trial to trial, the rate of visits by nontarget species to the BOS™ decreased significantly, but that of wild boar did not change. We observed that crested porcupines <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata</b> prevented the wild boar from using BOS™.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{the spinal}} nerves that {{constitute}} the plexus lumbosacrales of porcupines (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata)</b> were investigated. Four porcupines (two males and two females) were used in this work. Animals were appropriately dissected and the spinal nerves {{that constitute the}} plexus lumbosacrales were examined. It {{was found that the}} plexus lumbosacrales of the porcupines was formed by whole rami ventralis of L 1, L 2, L 3, L 4, S 1 and a fine branch from T 15 and S 2. The rami ventralis of T 15 and S 2 were divided into two branches. The caudal branch of T 15 and cranial branch of S 2 contributed to the plexus lumbosacrales. At {{the last part of the}} plexus lumbosacrales, a thick branch was formed by contributions from the whole of L 4 and S 1, and a branch from each of L 3 and S 2. This root gives rise to the nerve branches which are disseminated to the posterior legs (caudal glu-teal nerve, caudal cutaneous femoral nerve, ischiadic nerve). Thus, the origins of spinal nerves that constitute the plexus lumbosacrales of porcupine differ from rodantia and other mammals...|$|E

A total of 312 household samples were identified for interview. Group discussion and field observation were also carried out. Among the respondents, the majority (83. 9 %) faced crop damage. African elephant (Loxodonta africana), Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), Desert warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), Wild pig (Sus scrofa), Porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata),</b> Vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) and Anubis baboon (Papio anubis) were identified as the most problematic animals in the area. However, buffalo, monkey and warthog were considered as the notorious pest. Crop damage and threats to human safety were the major problems encountered resulting in conflict between human and wildlife. Most respondents had a negative attitude towards the problem-posing animals. This will lead to a change in public attitude from one that supports wildlife conservation to sees wild herbivores as a threat and a potential negative consequence for wildlife conservation.

40|$|Ehrlichiosis and Q fever {{caused by}} the {{intracellular}} bacteria Ehrlichia canis and Coxiella burnetii, respectively, are tick-borne diseases with zoonotic potential and widespread geographical distribution. This study investigated the prevalence of both infections in wild mammals in southern Italy. Tissue samples obtained from the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), gray wolf (Canis lupus), beech marten (Martes foina), and crested porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata)</b> were processed for molecular detection of both pathogens. E. canis was detected in 55 out of 105 (52  %) red foxes and three out of six gray wolves. Four sequence types were identified, three of which {{were found in the}} spleen and liver samples of red foxes and wolves, and one in the kidney of a red fox. None of the examined mammals was positive to C. burnetii type. This represents the first report of E. canis in free-ranging wolves worldwide, as well as the first evidence of this pathogen in red foxes in the peninsular Italy. Our results suggest that E. canis infection is common in free-ranging canids in southern Italy and that a sylvatic life cycle of this pathogen may occur...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{evidence}} for {{the introduction of the}} crested porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata</b> L. 1758) in Italy is reviewed and hypotheses concerning the timing and modalities of this event are brought forward. The crested porcupine current distribution outside Africa is limited to Sicily and the Italian Peninsula. Palaeontological data indicate that porcupines were present in Italy and other parts of Europe in the Pleistocene (possibly up to the early Holocene), but there is now broad consensus that these belonged to different species, now extinct. Apart from some unreliable prehistoric finds, {{there is no evidence that}} porcupines occurred again in Italy and the rest of Europe before historic times. This led many authors to suggest that the Romans may have been responsible for the introduction of the species in Italy, but such assumption was largely speculative. The available evidence in fact indicates that the crested porcupine does not occur in Italy before late Antique or even early medieval times and that it never spread in Europe beyond the Italian Peninsula (and Sicily). The long chronological gap existing between Pleistocene and late Holocene specimens strongly suggests that the presence of the species in historic times in Italy is the result of a human-induced introduction. Variations in the morphometric and genetic characteristics of current porcupine populations in Italy and differences in the timing of the introduction between different regions suggest that the species was probably introduced as a consequence of multiple events. ...|$|E
40|$|The crested {{porcupine}} <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata</b> {{is the largest}} rodent in Italy; it is strictly protected according to national and international laws. Despite this, porcupines in Italy are still poached for meat and complained for crop damages. The species is almost exclusively nocturnal and quite elusive. Its presence may be yet recorded through the detection of quills lost on the ground. In the last 40 years, the {{crested porcupine}} showed a remarkable range expansion in Italy. In 2013, {{in the framework of}} the www. naturaesocialmapping. it recording site, a web page devoted to H. cristata was set up. The aim of the project was to give people the opportunity to contribute to a continuous updating of the distributional map of this rodent. Samples (quills) were also collected as being easily available sources of DNA. In 2016, some field samplings provided for the first time evidence of the presence of another species of porcupine: the Indian porcupine H. indica. Species identification was carried out through DNA barcoding analysis, since it cannot be performed only through quill morphology. We increased the international genetic database with sequences of both species, so to allow a rapid identification of samples through molecular analyses. Both species were introduced to Italy by man (H. cristata in historical times). Our findings also support the relevance of citizen science contribution in the process of updating species’ distribution range and the potential of spotting new invasive species...|$|E
40|$|Studying the {{evolutionary}} dynamics {{of an alien}} species surviving and continuing to expand after several generations can provide fundamental information on the relevant features of clearly successful invasions. Here, we tackle this task by investigating {{the dynamics of the}} genetic diversity in invasive crested porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata)</b> populations, introduced to Italy about 1500  years ago, which are still growing in size, distribution range and ecological niche. Using genome-wide RAD markers, we describe the structure of the genetic diversity and the demographic dynamics of the H.  cristata invasive populations and compare their genetic diversity with that of native African populations of both H.  cristata and its sister species, H.  africaeaustralis. First, we demonstrate that genetic diversity is lower in both the invasive Italian and the North Africa source range relative to other native populations from sub-Saharan and South Africa. Second, we find evidence of multiple introduction events in the invasive range followed by very limited gene flow. Through coalescence-based demographic reconstructions, we also show that the bottleneck at introduction was mild and did not affect the introduced genetic diversity. Finally, we reveal that the current spatial expansion at the northern boundary of the range is following a leading-edge model characterized by a general reduction of genetic diversity towards the edge of the expanding range. We conclude that the level of genome-wide diversity of H.  cristata invasive populations is less important in explaining its successful invasion than species-specific life-history traits or the phylogeographic history in the native source range...|$|E
40|$|Old World porcupines are elusive, nocturnal rodents who pair for life, exhibiting {{frequent}} socio-sexual behaviour also {{outside the}} breeding period. Only anecdotal observations on captive individuals {{are available on}} the reproductive behaviour of the crested porcupine <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata,</b> a Sub-Saharan and North African large rodent probably introduced to Italy over 1500 years ago. Our work reports the first data on reproductive biology and paternal behaviour of free-living crested porcupines in Europe. A total of 44 litters was recorded at 4 den systems, over 3 years: 59 % singletons, 32 % twins, 9 % triplets. Reproduction occurs throughout the year, but two significant birth peaks have been detected on February and October. The reproductive peak in October falls in the period of short rains in Sub-Saharan Africa, and coincides with the start of Autumn rains in Italy, thus preceding the vegetation regrowth in both areas, but especially in Africa. On the other hand, porcupines are unusual, as their "spring" peak of births in Central Italy falls actually in mid-winter (i. e. February), when snowfalls and the coldest temperatures tend to occur. By contrast, births in February anticipate the long rains in Sub-Saharan Africa by c. 30 days, when cubs leave the natal den {{for the first time and}} vegetation starts sprouting. Haphazard observations of cubs over 12 years (N = 72) have confirmed this pattern. Both partners (N = 2 radio-tagged pairs) share parental duties: alternation of cub guarding in den occurs in the first two months of life, i. e. when quills are still soft and relatively short, thus making cubs an easy prey for small and mesocarnivores...|$|E
40|$|As {{for other}} rodents, peri-anal glands are well {{developed}} in the crested porcupine <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata.</b> Their waxy secretion has a Peculiar odour, usually perceivable around the dens. Male African H. africaeaustralis use this secretion to mark feeding sites in captivity, but its function in H. cristata has never been studied yet. Through live-trapping in Central Italy, we sampled gland contents of 33 freely living crested porcupines (19 males and 14 females), and, in 5 animals, 2 - 3 subsequent collections were made at different times. GC-MS analyses showed that the secretion volatile component is a complex mixture. mainly constituted by aliphatic Compounds. The principal constituents were saturated and unsaturated gamma-lactones, macrolactones, primary alcohols and fatty acids. The composition was similar between sexes, but for two compounds (nonadecan- 1 -ol and a compound tentatively identified as 16 -methyl oxacyclohexadecan- 2 -one) that were significantly more frequent in males than in females. We compared the Squared Euclidean distances of the relative abundances of constituents in all possible couple of specimens, {{and found that the}} average distance between males and females was significantly higher than the distance between males, but significantly lower than the distance between females. We hypothesized that, although all the females were adult, this variability might be due to physiological differences between individuals (e. g. reproductive status). Using the same approach, we found that the chemical profiles of different individuals (inter-individual variability) was greater than intra-individual variability, suggesting that the peri-anal secretions {{may play a role in}} individual recognition.

There was high similarity {{in the number of}} species caught during the two seasons (Sørensen Coefficient (CCs) = 0. 92), implying there to be minimal migration of the species in the area. A total of 159 individuals were caught during the dry season, rodents accounting for 89. 3 % of the total catch and insectivores 10. 7 %. The most common species were Cricetomys gambianus and Grammomys dolichurus that had trap successes of 2. 83 and 1. 11 respectively. During the wet season 185 animals were caught, rodents accounting for 92. 4 % of the total catch and insectivores 7. 6 %. Cricetomys gambianus was significantly more abundant during the dry season. Graphiurus murinus was not caught in this season and no trend in abundance was detected for the other species. Forest specialist species included Paraxerus palliatus and Petrodromus petersi. No species was endemic to the forest, near-endemic species that occur in coastal and Eastern Arc forests included P. petersi and Beamys hindei. B. hindei also occurs in a few other East African forests. Threatened species are B. hindei and P. palliatus that are vulnerable and P. petersi that is endangered. Lepus capensis is in Appendix I of CITES list and <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata</b> and Mellivora capensis in Appendix III. The forest, though small is in good health and fairly well protected, therefore the species are not in danger of being locally extinct in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Two {{strains of}} obligately {{anaerobic}} cellulolytic bacteria designated as PS 7 and PS 8 (PS for porcupine species) were isolated from hindgut fluid of a crested porcupine (<b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata).</b> The rates of cellulose degradation, total volatile fatty acids, and gas production from cellulose by the isolates were determined {{in comparison with}} Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD- 1. Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD- 1 degraded acid swollen cellulose and produced total volatile fatty acid {{at a faster rate}} (0. 03145 mg/d; 3. 8350 mumol/mL) than PS 7 (0. 03113 mg/d' 2. 5278 mumol/mL) and PS (0. 0125 mg/d; 2. 1080 mum/mL). However, PS 7 degraded cellulose strips (untreated) faster (1. 5 weeks) than R. flavefaciens FD- 1 (2 weeks). Furthermore, PS 7 produced gas at a higher rate (0. 1055 ml/d) than R. flavefaciens FD- 1 (0. 03145 ml/d) more produced butyric, isovaleric acids and almost twice the amounts of total volatile fatty acids from acid swollen cellulose. Both PS 7 and PS 8 were Gram variable, rod shaped and motile. On cellobiose medium, PS 7 grew at temperature ranges from 25 to 45 degree C while PS 8 did not grow at 25 and 45 degree C. Both isolates grew at pH levels between 6. 2 and 11. Characteristation based on carbohydrate fermentation and morphology indicated that these two isolates were similar. Characterisation by RAPD-PCR suggested that PS 7 and PS 8 were genotypically similar but distinct. Phylogenetic analysis using the nucleotide sequence (1450 bp) of the 16 S rRNA gene suggested that PS 7 clustered with Clostridium sub-phylum and exhibited the highest similarity (95 percent) with Clostridium lentocellum. The phylogenetic results suggest that PS 7 might represent a new taxon...|$|E
40|$|The crested {{porcupine}} <b>Hystrix</b> <b>cristata</b> {{is a large}} rodent which pairs for life. We studied the space use of 17 female and 9 male radio-tracked porcupines in an evergreen coastal woodland (“macchia”, EW) and in an agricultural estate (AE), with special reference {{to the use of}} cultivations. Home range sizes of male porcupines (4. 72 – 323. 40) ranged around 114 ha (median) during the warm period (April–September) and 162 ha during the cold one (October–March). Home ranges of females (2. 48 – 323. 40) were c. 91 ha during the warm period and c. 143 ha during the cold one. Habitat composition and selection changed from the cold to the warm months, with porcupines being present in agricultural areas especially in the latter. Home range overlap between members of the same pair varied from 57 % to 97 % (median, 75 %). Habitat selection was analyzed at the second (within study area) and at the third (within home range) order of selection. Within study areas, porcupines avoided cultivations and selected habitats with dense vegetation, providing cover and food. Within home ranges, in the warm period, porcupines selected agricultural areas in EW, where this habitat represented a minor portion of the study site. In that season, the Mediterranean “macchia” is a poor source of food, forcing porcupines to travel long distances to reach feeding sites. No significant difference of habitat selection within home ranges was detected between members of the same pair. Cultivations may play a key-role for porcupine survival, especially in poor habitats, as they provide abundant food resources in the warm period...|$|E
