[...] However, {{it turns out that the}} Wahlquist fluid cannot be matched to any asymptotically flat vacuum region. [...] In particular, contrary to naive expectation, it cannot be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior. [...] A tiny minority of physicists (actually, a minority of one) appear to believe that general relativity is unacceptable because it does not allow sufficiently general asymptotically flat solutions (evidently this argument implicitly assumes that we have decisively rejected at least some Machian principles!), but a sequence of increasingly sophisticated and general existence results appears to contradict this assumption.|$|E

6000|$|The chief {{theoretical}} {{objection to}} this threefold system of classification {{lies in the}} existence of certain compound patterns, by far the most common of which are Whorls enclosed within Loops (Plates 7, 8, Fig. 12, ~15~, ~18~, ~19~, and Fig. 13, ~20-23~). They are as much Loops as Whorls, and properly ought to be relegated to a fourth class. I have not done so, but called them Whorls, for a practical reason which is cogent. In an imperfect impression, such as is made by merely dabbing the inked finger upon paper, the enveloping loop is often too incompletely printed to enable its existence to be surely ascertained, especially when the enclosed whorl is so large (Fig. 13, ~23~) that there are only one or two enveloping ridges to represent the loop. On the other hand, the whorled character of the core can hardly fail to be recognised. The practical difficulties lie almost wholly in rightly classifying a few transitional forms, diagrammatically and roughly expressed in Fig. 11, ~4~, ~5~, and Fig. 12, ~8~, ~18~, ~19~, with the words [...] "see" [...] so and so written below, and of which actual examples are given on an enlarged scale in Plates 9 and 10, Figs. 15 and 16. Here Fig. 15, a is an undoubted arch, and c an undoubted nascent loop; but b is transitional between them, though nearer to a loop than an arch, d may be thought transitional in the same way, but it has an incipient curl which becomes marked in e, while it has grown into a decided whorl in f; <b>d</b> <b>should</b> also be compared with j, which is in some sense a stage towards k. g is a nascent tented-arch, fully developed in i, where the pattern as a whole has a slight slope, but is otherwise fairly symmetrical. In h there is some want of symmetry, and a tendency to the formation of a loop on the right side (refer back to Plate 7, Fig. 11, ~4~, and Fig. 12, ~12~); it is a transitional case between a tented arch and a loop, with most resemblance to the latter. Plate 10, Fig. 16 illustrates eyed patterns; here l and m are parts of decided loops; p, q, and r are decided whorls, but n is transitional, inclining towards a loop, and o is transitional, inclining towards a whorl. s is a nascent form of an invaded loop, and is nearly related to l; t and u are decidedly invaded loops.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{conversion}} {{based on}} SOFC technology {{has made significant}} progress {{in the last few}} years. The MEA (membrane electrolyte assembly) is a key component of SOFC modules used as an electricity and heat power plant with high electrical efficiency. For research and development of planar SOFC a detailed knowledge of individual material behavior such as long-term stability, electrochemical performance, degradation rates, durability for reduction/oxidation as well as thermal cycles and performances in different gas compositions is required. In consideration of such comprehensive cell characterization an optimal measurement environment need to be provided. Cell housings have to be hightemperature-qualified up to 1000 °C, chemically inert and reduction- /oxidation resistant. Furthermore, the hous <b>ing</b> <b>should</b> provide lossless gas-supply and a non-destructive mechanical compression. In order to fulfill these requirements Fraunhofer IKTS in close collaboration with FuelCon developed a ceramic housing for cell characterization at SOFC operating conditions. The housing offers possibility of measurement for three different cell types (ESC, ASC and MSC). For an individual characterization of single cell a standard measurement procedure has been developed, which allows comparability of SOFC related characteristics independently from cell type.
