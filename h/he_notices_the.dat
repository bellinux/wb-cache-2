2500|$|But this is {{not quite}} aestheticism {{for the sake of}} it [...] they are not {{extraneous}} things but are observations that shape and determine Ivanov's world. The barber notices the glittering wheels of the cars; a few minutes later <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>the</b> Soviet's [...] "minuscule eyes that glittered like the tiny wheels of a watch movement".

Wie du bist"). To avoid scandal, Octavian hides when a small black boy, Mohammed, brings the Marschallin's breakfast. During breakfast loud voices are heard in the garderobe and not the main door. The Marschallin believes that it is her husband who has returned unexpectedly from a hunting trip and has Octavian hide behind the bed. He reappears disguised as a chambermaid, [...] "Mariandel" [...] ("Befehl'n fürstli' Gnad'n, i bin halt noch nit recht..."), and tries to sneak away through the garderobe. But the Marschallin's country cousin Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau has unexpectedly entered through that same door.

[...] After boorishly describing his personal pastime of seducing peasant girls on his estate, he asks the Marschallin to recommend a young man to serve as his Rosenkavalier ("Knight of the Rose"), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. She suggests Octavian. When Ochs sees the young count's picture, <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>the</b> count's resemblance to the chambermaid [...] "Mariandel", and infers that she must be Octavian's illegitimate sister. Ochs boasts that nobility should be served by nobility, which leads to a confession that he has an illegitimate son working for him. The coarse Ochs propositions the [...] "chambermaid". Octavian plays coy and leaves at the first chance.|$|E

In his letters and journals, instead of detailing circumstances with the technical precision of a mere navigator, <b>he</b> <b>notices</b> <b>the</b> beauties of nature with the enthusiasm of a poet or a painter. As he coasts the shores of the New World, the reader participates in the enjoyment with which he describes, in his imperfect but picturesque Spanish, the varied objects around him; the blandness of the temperature, the purity of the atmosphere, the fragrance of the air, [...] "full of dew and sweetness," [...] the verdure of the forests, the magnificence of the trees, the grandeur of the mountains, and the limpidity and freshness of the running streams. New delight springs up for him in every scene. He extols each new discovery as more beautiful than the last, and each as the most beautiful in the world; until, with his simple earnestness, he tells the sovereigns, that, having spoken so highly of the preceding islands, he fears that they will not credit him, when he declares that the one he is actually describing surpasses them all in excellence.|$|E
