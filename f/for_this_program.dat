5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} Air Medals {{presented}} {{by the president of}} the United States to the Civil Air Patrol went to Hugh Sharp and Eddie Edwards, who conducted the rescue in the S-39. This successful program, which spotted 173 German U-Boats, dropped 57 depth charges, hit 10 of the U-Boats, and sank two of them, was inevitably discontinued after the end of the second World War. Many of the planes used specifically <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> are now parts of exhibits, replaced by new aircraft that are more suited to teaching young students to fly and performing search and rescue, the current missions of the Civil Air Patrol. Currently, CTWG has two Cessna 172s, two Cessna 182s and one Cessna 182T with Garmin G1000 Glass cockpit. Connecticut Wing has the highest number of hours flown per aircraft of any state in the North East Region, and ranks high on a national scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E

25|$|Under the program, the {{abatement}} {{lasts for}} three years of construction and 35 additional years. A full abatement on the tax increase will take place for the first 25 years after the construction period, with the tax benefits {{in the last ten}} years being tied to the number of affordable units created. For condominium projects, the new 421-a program is also an option. However, condominium projects only qualify <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> if the project has 35 units or less, is not located in Manhattan, and has a per unit assessed value at $65,000 or less. The abatement program excludes luxury condominiums projects after a proposal to include them was defeated in the state legislature. Including them would have raised the program's cost by $1 billion over ten years.|$|E
25|$|It {{was clear}} {{to a number of}} {{developers}} that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior, and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means. Converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances. The two key advances were Philo Farnsworth's electronic scanning system, and Vladimir Zworykin's Iconoscope camera. The Iconoscope, based on Kálmán Tihanyi's early patents, superseded the Farnsworth-system. With these systems, the BBC began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936, but these were shut down again with the start of World War II in 1939. In this time thousands of television sets had been sold. The receivers developed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>program,</b> notably those from Pye Ltd., {{played a key role in}} the development of radar.|$|E
