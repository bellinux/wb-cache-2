5|$|The {{scientific}} study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|Mulder has {{a fellow}} FBI agent, Barrett Weiss, visit Baker's residence. Weiss and Baker are both {{killed by the}} Bounty Hunter, who impersonates Weiss and tells Mulder and Scully {{that no one is}} home. After Walter Skinner hears of Weiss' death and closes the case, the agents meet CIA {{official}} Ambrose Chapel, who tells them that the doctors are clones from a Soviet genetics program, and are being systematically killed by the Russian and U.S. governments. Mulder, Scully and Chapel head to pick up another doctor named James Dickens, but Dickens flees at the sight of Chapel, who <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> disguised Bounty Hunter. Dickens is killed by the Bounty Hunter in the subsequent pursuit, unknowingly aided by Mulder and Scully.|$|E

25|$|Most Seventh Day Adventists in Samoa {{planned to}} observe Sabbath on Sunday after Samoa's {{crossing}} the date line in December 2011, but SDA groups in Samatau village {{and other places}} (approx. 300 members) decided to accept the IDL adjustment and observe the Sabbath on Saturday. Debate continues within the Seventh-day Adventist community in the Pacific as to which day <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> seventh-day Sabbath.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently, one {{can take}} the Stone space of the {{complete}} Boolean algebra of all subsets of X as the Stone–Čech compactification. This <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> same construction, as the Stone space of this Boolean algebra is the set of ultrafilters (or equivalently prime ideals, or homomorphisms to the 2 element Boolean algebra) of the Boolean algebra, {{which is the same}} as the set of ultrafilters on X.|$|E

25|$|One {{might say}} {{the second stage}} of the {{amplifier}} is just a voltage follower, transmitting the voltage at the collector of the input transistor to the top of R2. That is, the monitored output signal <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> voltage at the collector of the input transistor. That view is legitimate, but then the voltage follower stage becomes part of the feedback network. That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.|$|E
25|$|However, {{more recent}} {{biological}} analyses, such as Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, have contended that Morgan's Canon {{is not the}} simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent features of evolution.|$|E
25|$|Corinne Tate Flotsky (Diana Canova)—Jessica and Chester's daughter, who {{acknowledges}} {{she slept}} {{with most of}} the male population of Dunn's River. It is later revealed that she is adopted and <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> daughter of Jessica and Mary's long-lost brother Randolph Gatling and family maid Ingrid Svenson. After a disastrous affair with Peter Campbell, Corinne marries ex-priest Tim Flotsky and gives birth to a baby named Timmy who turns out to be demon-possessed (due to Tim's outraged mother, Flo, cursing the marriage). She later has an affair with Dutch Leitner and then leaves Dunn's River for California to raise Timmy, after Dutch leaves her to get back together with Eunice.|$|E

25|$|In the narrative, {{just prior}} to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his {{brothers}} (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular, and he gives Benjamin {{five times as much}} food as he apportions to the others. According to textual scholars, this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.|$|E
25|$|Javuto finds Katia {{and takes}} her to Asa. Asa begins to drain Katia, who ages rapidly during the act. Just as the witch goes {{to take her}} blood, she is thwarted by the {{crucifix}} around Katia's neck. Gorobec enters the crypt to save Katia but finds Asa instead. Asa pretends to be Katia and tells Gorobec that the now weakened and unconscious Katia <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> witch. She tells him to kill Katia immediately by staking her. He agrees {{but at the last}} possible moment he notices the crucifix she is wearing. He turns to Asa and opens her robe, revealing a fleshless skeletal frame. The priest then arrives with numerous torch-carrying villagers, and they burn Asa to death. Katia awakens from her stupor, her life and beauty restored, and is reunited with Gorobec.|$|E
25|$|One must {{be careful}} when {{measuring}} temperature {{to ensure that the}} measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E

25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual viewers will like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> same quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has two mechanical floors between the 8th and 9th floor and two mechanical floors between 51 and the roof level. They {{are known as}} 8A, 8B and 51A, 51B. They are not accessible {{from any of the}} building's passenger elevators and contain HVAC equipment. As a result, the 9thfloor <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> 11thfloor and the 51stfloor is really 53rd. This can be elucidated from the outside of the building or by walking down the stairwell from the 9thfloor or higher. There is also a floor 2A which is inaccessible except from the freight elevators. There are also three floors beneath the IDS called P1, P2, and P3. These are storage levels for tenants and also are connected to the parking ramp below the IDS. Neither 2A, or P's 1, 2, and 3 are counted as actual floors. Half of the space of the complex (floors 9 to 57 of the Tower) is located above the 8th floor and half (including the retail, hotel, and floors 1 to 8 of the Tower and annex building) is located below the 8th floor.|$|E
25|$|As a baby, Harry was in {{the room}} when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul had been {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E

25|$|English {{may have}} been spoken in the North West from around the 7th century AD, when the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria first appears to have made inroads west of the Pennines. The {{language}} at this time {{would have been the}} Northumbrian dialect of Old English. The high percentage of English place names in the region as a whole suggests English became almost ubiquitous over the coming centuries, particularly in the area south of the Lake District. Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Blackburn and Preston are among the region's many English place names. In the 9th-11th centuries, Danes from the east and Norsemen from Ireland and Scotland began settling in the area. The North West <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> only area of England where Norse settlement was significant and their influence remains in the place names and dialect of the region. Elements like fell, thwaite and tarn, which are particularly common in Cumbria, are all Norse. The numerous Kirkbys and place names with 'holm' and 'dale' show the Scandinvian influence throughout the North West.|$|E
25|$|There is {{controversy}} in the academic world though as to who <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> topic of the machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy {{after the death of}} Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana. This does not make much sense to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when there is absolutely no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus he speaks of.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
