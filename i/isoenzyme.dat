5|$|Bupropion is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 <b>isoenzyme</b> CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances. This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of drug interactions.|$|E

25|$|In addition, heme {{degradation}} {{appears to}} be an evolutionarily-conserved response to oxidative stress. Briefly, when cells are exposed to free radicals, there is a rapid induction of the expression of the stress-responsive heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) <b>isoenzyme</b> that catabolizes heme (see below). The reason why cells must increase exponentially their capability to degrade heme in response to oxidative stress remains unclear but this {{appears to be}} part of a cytoprotective response that avoids the deleterious effects of free heme. When large amounts of free heme accumulates, the heme detoxification/degradation systems get overwhelmed, enabling heme to exert its damaging effects.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine is {{extensively}} metabolized in the liver, via the cytochrome P450 system, to polar metabolites {{suitable for}} elimination {{in the urine}} and feces. The major metabolite, norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 <b>isoenzyme</b> 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well. Agents that induce (e.g., cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g., theophylline, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies showed}} that, when {{inflammation}} is induced, the affected organ unexpectedly develops an enormous capacity to generate prostaglandins. It was {{demonstrated that the}} increase is due to de novo synthesis of fresh enzyme. In 1991, during {{the investigation of the}} expression of early-response genes in fibroblasts transformed with Rous sarcoma virus, a novel mRNA transcript that was similar, but not identical, to the seminal COX enzyme was identified. It was suggested that an <b>isoenzyme</b> of COX had been discovered. Another group discovered a novel cDNA species encoding a protein with similar structure to COX-1 while studying phorbol-ester-induced genes in Swiss 3T3 cells. The same laboratory showed that this gene truly expressed a novel COX enzyme. The two enzymes were renamed COX-1, referring to the original enzyme and COX-2.|$|E
40|$|Improving an {{identification}} method was purposed using electrophoretic profiles of seed proteins and four <b>isoenzymes</b> of Karaelci and Sarielci varieties of Vicia sativa L. In addition five different extraction buffers were tested for seed proteins. Also seed proteins and four <b>isoenzymes</b> polymorphism between two varieties were investigated. Electrophoresis {{was carried out}} with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Catechol oxidase and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase <b>isoenzymes</b> exhibited identical patterns but esterase and superoxide dismutase <b>isoenzymes</b> showed different patterns. These two <b>isoenzymes,</b> which showed polymorphism, can use as marker suchlike studies with these varieties. Seed proteins band patterns among five buffers were different. One of the buffers revealed maximum band numbers. This buffer was the best seperator buffer. <b>Isoenzymes</b> and seed proteins band patterns which find out can be useful for identification...|$|R

40|$|Transglutaminase (TGase) <b>isoenzymes</b> are {{involved}} in the process of the differentiation and cornification of keratinocytes in the epidermis. This study investigates the presence and localization of three TGase <b>isoenzymes</b> to elucidate the nature and differentiation status of the squamous epithelium in human aural cholesteatoma. Twenty cholesteatoma specimens were used. The presence and localization of three TGase <b>isoenzymes</b> were studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. mRNA expression of three TGase <b>isoenzymes</b> were detected in the tested cholesteatomas with variable levels. The immunohistochemical staining patterns of three TGase <b>isoenzymes</b> showed variations within specimens, relating to keratinizing activity. TGase K is the most abundant among three <b>isoenzymes.</b> Keratinizing epithelium of cholesteatoma have similar expression profiles of TGase <b>isoenzymes</b> with those of epidermis of the skin. Other areas, particularly those showing non-keratinizing epithelium, showed weak immunostaining of TGase E and C, suggesting its different maturation status from keratinizing epithelium. The results {{of this study indicate that}} epithelium of cholesteatoma undergoes same direction of maturation and differentiation characteristics as the epidermis of skin, evidenced by similar expressions of TGases both in mRNA level and immunohistochemistry...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two major}} isoforms of 5α-reductase, SRD5A1 (type I) and SRD5A2 (type II), with the latter being the most biologically {{important}} <b>isoenzyme.</b> SRD5A2 is most highly expressed in the genitals, prostate gland, epididymides, seminal vesicles, genital skin, facial and chest hair follicles, and liver, while lower expression is observed in certain brain areas, non-genital skin/hair follicles, testes, and kidneys. SRD5A1 is most highly expressed in non-genital skin/hair follicles, the liver, and certain brain areas, while lower levels {{are present in the}} prostate, epididymides, seminal vesicles, genital skin, testes, adrenal glands, and kidneys. In the skin, 5α-reductase is expressed in sebaceous glands, sweat glands, epidermal cells, and hair follicles. Both isoenzymes are expressed in scalp hair follicles, although SRD5A2 predominates in these cells. The SRD5A2 subtype is the almost exclusive isoform expressed in the prostate gland.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with {{at least}} 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into {{systemic}} circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 <b>isoenzyme</b> to desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine), which is just as potent a SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically {{important in terms of}} efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of venlafaxine has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of venlafaxine and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of venlafaxine is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 <b>isoenzyme</b> to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
40|$|Aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) <b>isoenzymes</b> {{separated}} {{by means of}} electrophoresis on cellulose acetate gel were examined. Five GOT <b>isoenzymes</b> were discovered in cucumber roots after several days of their growth. The activity of these <b>isoenzymes</b> was dependent upon the mineral composition of the medium. If the medium did not contain nitrogen, <b>isoenzymes</b> 1, 3, and 4 showed only slight activity. Activity {{of all of the}} <b>isoenzymes</b> in the roots of seedlings assimilating NH 4 + ions was higher than in the roots of seedlings assimilating N 03 - ions.

50|$|Another {{clinical}} {{application of}} ion chromatography {{is in the}} rapid anion exchange chromatography technique used to separate creatine kinase (CK) <b>isoenzymes</b> from human serum and tissue sourced in autopsy material (mostly CK rich tissues were used such as cardiac muscle and brain). These <b>isoenzymes</b> include MM, MB, and BB, which all carry out the same function given different amino acid sequences. The functions of these <b>isoenzymes</b> are to convert creatine, using ATP, into phosphocreatine expelling ADP. Mini columns were filled with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and further eluted with tris- buffer sodium chloride at various concentrations (each concentration was chosen advantageously to manipulate elution). Human tissue extract was inserted in columns for separation. All fractions were analyzed to see total CK activity and {{it was found that}} each source of CK <b>isoenzymes</b> had characteristic <b>isoenzymes</b> found within. Firstly, CK- MM was eluted, then CK-MB, followed by CK-BB. Therefore, the <b>isoenzymes</b> found in each sample could be used to identify the source, as they were tissue specific.|$|R
25|$|In {{people with}} {{alcoholic}} hepatitis, the {{serum aspartate aminotransferase}} (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1.AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal-6-phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST <b>isoenzyme</b> release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate {{in the presence of}} alcohol, and increased urinary loss.The magnitude of leukocytosis reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration at the perivenular area. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury.Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|All statins are (metabolized) by the liver, {{which causes}} their low {{systemic}} bioavailability. Lovastatin and simvastatin are administered in their lactone forms, {{which is more}} lipophilic than their free acid forms, and therefore {{they have to be}} activated by hydrolysis to the active anionic carboxylate form. Cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of the statins, with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes being the most dominant. CYP3A4 <b>isoenzyme</b> is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin.

40|$|The cytosolic and proplastid <b>isoenzymes</b> of 6 -phosphogluconate {{dehydrogenase}} were purified {{from the}} developing endosperm of the castor bean (Ricinis communis L.).

The <b>isoenzymes</b> were separated by acetone fractionation of soluble plasmodial homogenates acidified to pH 5. 0. The M-MDH was purified 201 -fold by cetylpyridinium chloride treatment, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, gradient elution from sulfoethyl cellulose at pH 6. 0, and Sephadex G- 100 chromatography. The S-MDH was purified 155 -fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, gradient elution from sulfoethyl cellulose at pH 5. 5, and Sephadex G- 100 chromatography. The optimal cis-oxalacetate concentrations were 0. 35 mM for M-MDH and 0. 25 mM for S-MDH, and the optimal pH for both <b>isoenzymes</b> was 7. 6 for oxalacetate reduction.
