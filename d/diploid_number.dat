5|$|The <b>diploid</b> <b>number</b> of {{chromosomes}} in the wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes {{were studied}} in {{a male and}} a female wildebeest. In the female, all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes {{were found to be}} acrocentric. Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. Other chromosomes were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric and the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
5|$|The <b>diploid</b> <b>number</b> of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, {{the same}} as in most other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay the number is 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be the}} reason behind this anomaly. The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E
50|$|There is {{very little}} {{variation}} in the karyotype of Necromys, where 2n=34 is the rule, with N. lactens and N. lasiurus having <b>diploid</b> <b>numbers</b> of 2n=36.

5|$|The <b>diploid</b> <b>number</b> of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids {{are usually}} reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E

40|$|Presented {{study is}} aimed to {{determine}} basic trends of karyotype evolution in velvet spiders (Eresidae; Araneae). Eresids are burrowing spiders; they includes also some social species. Karyotypes of 16 {{species of the}} family Eresidae as well as 2 species of the other families of the superfamily Eresoidea, Hersiliidae and Oecobiidae, are presented. Furthermore, DNA content and base proportion was determined in 14 species. In two species, DNA content of sex chromosomes was also measured. Obtained results revealed considerable variability of <b>diploid</b> <b>numbers,</b> and sex chromosomes systems in eresids. Obtained karyotype data allow to divide eresids into four groups. Karyotypes of the genera Gandanameno, Dresserus and S. lineatus are close to proposed ancestral karyotype of entelegynae spiders and they show the ancestral state of karyotype in velvet spiders. Karyotypes of S. lineatus and E. annulipes differ substantially from other representatives of the genera Stegodyphus and Eresus which indicates paraphyly of these genera. Karyotypes of basal forms are formed by acrocentric chromosomes. Further evolution of eresid karyotypes included considerable reduction of <b>diploid</b> <b>numbers</b> as well as changes of chromosome morphology.

25|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} variability between {{closely related species}} is the muntjac, which was investigated by Kurt Benirschke and his colleague Doris Wurster. The <b>diploid</b> <b>number</b> of the Chinese muntjac, Muntiacus reevesi, {{was found to be}} 46, all telocentric. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian muntjac, Muntiacus muntjak, they were astonished to find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Investigation {{into the}} human {{karyotype}} took many years to settle the most basic question: How many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the <b>diploid</b> <b>number</b> of man is 46 or 48, at first favouring 46.

25|$|The {{next stage}} took {{place after the}} {{development}} of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that the set of chromosomes (the karyotype) was the carrier of the genes.

Other hybrids have been documented, such as a male common eland x greater kudu resulting from an accidental crossing from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the 1970s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. The individual was, however, azoospermic as analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes.|$|E
