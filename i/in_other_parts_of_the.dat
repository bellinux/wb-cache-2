5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
