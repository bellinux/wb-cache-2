500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When I was young I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know when I was young, and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of a little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E
