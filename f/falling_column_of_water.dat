50|$|Where {{there is}} a {{plentiful}} head of water {{it can be made}} to generate compressed air directly without moving parts. In these designs, a <b>falling</b> <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air {{in the top of the}} chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the Montreal River at Ragged Shutes near Cobalt, Ontario in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.|$|E
60|$|Then was flung {{high in the}} air {{what might}} be likened to a shaft of fire filled with {{fragments}} of iron, wood, and human flesh, rising higher and higher until its force was spent, when it fell outwardly as <b>falls</b> a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> broken by the wind.|$|R
40|$|Ben Cap, LLC, has a {{technology}} that utilizes bebtonite to plug wells. The bentonite is encapsulated in a cardboard capsule, droped {{down to the bottom}} of the well where it is allowed to hydrate, causing the bentonite to expand and plug the well. This method of plugging a well is accepted in some, but not all states. This technology can save a significant amount of money when compared to cementing methods currently used to plug and abandon wells. The test objective was to obtain the terminal velocity of the capsule delivery system as it drops through a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in a wellbore. Once the terminal velocity is known, the bentonite swelling action can be timed not to begin swelling until it reaches the bottom of the well bore. The results of the test showed that an average speed of 8. 93 plus or minus 0. 12 ft/sec was achieved by the capsule as it was <b>falling</b> through a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Plotting the data revealed a very linear function with the capsules achieving terminal velocity shortly after being released. The interference of the capsule impacting the casing was not readily apparent in any of the runs, but a siginal sampling anomaly was present in one run. Because the anomaly was so brief and not present in any of the other runs, no solid conclusions could be drawn. Additional testing would be required to determine the effects of capsules impacting a fluid level that is not at surface...|$|R
50|$|The Plateau-Rayleigh {{instability}} {{is named}} for Joseph Plateau and Lord Rayleigh. In 1873, Plateau found experimentally that a vertically falling stream <b>of</b> <b>water</b> will break up into drops if its wavelength is greater than about 3.13 to 3.18 times its diameter. Later, Rayleigh showed theoretically that a vertically <b>falling</b> <b>column</b> <b>of</b> non-viscous liquid with a circular cross-section should break up into drops if its wavelength exceeded its circumference.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{practical}} ways <b>of</b> checking <b>water</b> quality, {{the most direct}} being some measure of attenuation (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or JTU) is essentially the inverse measure of the length <b>of</b> a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the <b>water.</b> <b>Of</b> course <b>water</b> alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.|$|R

50|$|The Gymnasium {{was first}} built at around 330 B.C., whereas {{additions}} and restoration works {{took place in}} various phases throughout its history.

40|$|We {{studied the}} cooling <b>of</b> a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> {{primarily}} in a freezer, and analyzed {{the development and}} movement of an isothermal line at ~ 4 degC in H 2 O and ~ 11 degC in D 2 O. Our experiments show that the vertical velocity of the symmetrical isothermal line moving up the <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is inversely proportional to the diameter <b>of</b> the <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> It has a measured maximum velocity of 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 cm/min when the column diameter is 22 mm and decreases to 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 cm/min when the diameter is increased to 125 mm. The measurement of the velocity becomes increasingly difficult to obtain when the column diameter is less than 22 mm {{because of the lack}} of complete development of the isothermal line.

5000|$|Tensile {{strength}} can {{be defined}} for liquids as well as solids under certain conditions. For example, when a tree [...] draws water from its roots to its upper leaves by transpiration, the <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is pulled upwards from the top by the cohesion <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> in the xylem, and this force is transmitted down the column by its tensile strength. Air pressure, osmotic pressure, and capillary tension also plays a small part in a tree's ability to draw up water, but this alone would only be sufficient to push the <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to a height of less than ten metres, and trees can grow much higher than that (over 100 m).|$|R

50|$|A {{sewer pipe}} is {{normally}} at neutral air pressure {{compared to the}} surrounding atmosphere. When a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> waste <b>water</b> flows through a pipe, it compresses air ahead {{of it in the}} pipe, creating a positive pressure that must be released so it does not push back on the waste stream and downstream trap water seals. As the <b>column</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> passes, air must freely flow in behind the waste stream, or negative pressure results. The extent of these pressure fluctuations is determined by the fluid volume of the waste discharge.|$|R
