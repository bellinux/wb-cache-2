5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Paul asks Mark {{to steal}} some police files, {{hoping to find}} a lead in Kate's case, but Mark decides against it. Mark {{witnesses}} Paul buying a gun and he and Matt Turner (Josef Brown) stop Paul from shooting Victor Cleary (Richard Sutherland), who confesses to shooting Kate in revenge for Paul killing his brother Gus (Ben Barrack). Paul gives Mark a written confession saying he killed Gus, but Mark does not <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the police.

25|$|The {{new king}} was popular, but his {{security}} was not certain. Murat had occupied the city only the day before, and, despite increasingly abject attempts to win France's favour, refused to recognise Fernando. Carlos IV protested his abdication and appealed to Napoleon for assistance. With the two rivals openly craving his mediation, the emperor {{was placed in}} an ideal position to control events. He summoned Carlos, María Luisa and Fernando to meet him for a conference at Bayonne (Godoy was rescued from captivity and transported to France). With all the contestants united in his presence, Napoleon demanded that the rival kings renounce the throne and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the emperor. Carlos assented, and on 5 May, Fernando's defiance was overcome and the throne was formally signed over to Napoleon in exchange for generous pensions for the royal family and guarantees of territorial and religious integrity for Spain.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the book}} Who Killed Karen Silkwood, the {{assassination}} scene in the movie The China Syndrome, in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, {{is based on a}} theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents come up behind Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the villains because their company's name is on the documents. This could be construed as an attempt by the film's producers to influence the jury in the Silkwood case. According {{to the book}}, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.|$|E

According to the most popular account of the events, the Evzone soldier on guard duty, Konstantinos Koukidis, took down the Greek flag, refusing to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the invaders, wrapped himself in it, and jumped off the Acropolis. [...] Whether the story was true or not, many Greeks believed it and viewed the soldier as a martyr.|$|E

Shobhaa De of the Bangalore Times {{was critical}}, concluding [...] "Let’s <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Salman who has pulled off the stunts and pelvic thrusts. Nothing new there.

The photo shows Bubbles held on Jackson's hip, {{and has been}} cited {{as one of the}} best taken of Jackson. In the black and white photograph, Bubbles is dressed casually in a long sleeved shirt and overalls. Jackson is also dressed casually; he wears jeans and a simple shirt. Rogers said: [...] "Bubbles was so human it was almost frightening. He would take Christopher [...] by the hand, walk over to the refrigerator, open it, take out a banana and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him. Christopher was amazed... we all were." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the then-tradition of alumni {{coming back}} to assist their {{undergraduate}} teams in rivalry games, Cornell's coach Marshall Newell left for several weeks to assist Harvard in its rivalry game with Yale. [...] As a captain, Warner {{was put in charge}} during the coach's absence. It was during this time that Warner came up with his first original play: Three backs who normally protected the rusher would fake a run to one side, while the quarterback kept the ball and would <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the runner, who now had an open field to run through on the other side. During the first, in-game execution of the play, Warner carried the ball and was able to run clear for 25 yards. However, as Warner was a guard and not a runner, he was incorrectly holding the ball, and fumbled upon being tackled.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, without all the glamour of a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E

500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant, Jean was asked about her reaction when she heard that Beyoncé was recording [...] "If I Were a Boy". She was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as [...] "do the whole artist thing as well". Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's {{going to be on}} my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when I got this, people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Leach had {{troubles}} gaining confidence {{as he was}} recording his vocals, but {{was determined}} to make them a [...] "masterpiece". Leach spoke of Dutkiewicz and recording vocals stating, [...] "I definitely <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Adam D. – he's the man. We're taking our time, dissecting things. It's made me push myself to my limits – getting a lot more passion and deliver out of what I'm doing." [...] After struggling with nervousness for a while, Dutkiewicz and Leach went to Leach's home in Rhode Island to finish recording vocals. Mike Gitter was reluctant to hear of this when Killswitch Engage turned the record into Roadrunner, but was ultimately pleased with the results. Before {{the completion of the}} record, the band brought in Tom Gomes to play drums as Dutkiewicz moved to the empty guitar position. Though Dutkiewicz recorded most of the drums himself, Gomes provided additional percussion on the album, before he was an official member of the band. Backing vocals on Alive or Just Breathing were done by Leach, Dutkiewicz, as well as Dutkiewicz's sister Becka, and All That Remains singer Philip Labonte.|$|E

You have to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't {{remember the last time}} I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} that Coon got in touch, Gerrold had just been {{employed}} at CBS as a typist working on scripts such as the pilot of Hawaii Five-O. As {{soon as he got}} the response, he quit the job. Gerrold and Coon met once more, and revealed that the network had recently made a request for more episodes based on other planets. Coon told Gerrold to work up a further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons, and moved the action from planetside to a space station. During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day's shoot of the episode [...] "" [...] which was being filmed at the time. This version of the story was entitled [...] "A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...", which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline. He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> another writer for a month. However, Coon {{made it clear that he}} was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but was giving him the option of submitting a draft.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce {{a new way of}} making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that!

And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E

500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E
