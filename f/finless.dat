5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the <b>finless</b> sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the <b>finless</b> sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not thrive in captivity, and {{are very difficult to}} maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three <b>finless</b> porpoises. In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a harbour porpoise on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The <b>finless</b> sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the <b>finless</b> sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{cetacean}} live in rivers and lakes, but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze <b>finless</b> porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>finless</b> {{porpoise}} {{is known}} to also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations {{in the mouth of}} the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{only five}} hundred and five Yangtze <b>finless</b> {{porpoises}} {{remained in the}} main section of the Yangtze, with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang. While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification, population decline rates of the porpoise are actually accelerating. While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged {{at a rate of}} 6.06% annually, from 2006 to 2012, the porpoise population decreased by more than half. <b>Finless</b> porpoise population decrease of 69.8% in just a 22-year span from 1976 to 2000. 5.3%. A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation. Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity. To protect the species, China's Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal, the strictest classification by law, meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a porpoise. Protective measures in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in twenty five years. The Chinese Academy of Science's Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology has been working with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure the future for this subspecies, and have placed five porpoises in another well-protected area, the He-wang-miao oxbow. Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas. There have also been efforts to study porpoise biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding. The Baiji Dolphinarium, was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the <b>finless</b> porpoise, specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior.|$|E
5|$|<b>Finless</b> {{porpoises}} have commonly {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.|$|E
5|$|The first Mew Mew Ichigo {{encounters}} is Minto Aizawa, a spoiled, wealthy {{girl and}} ballerina who is infused with {{the genes of}} the blue lorikeet; Retasu Midorikawa, a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and absorbs the genes of the <b>finless</b> porpoise; a hyper and yet young girl named Bu-Ling Huang who receives the genes of the golden lion tamarin; and Zakuro Fujiwara, a professional actress and model infused with the genes of the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the <b>finless</b> sleeper ray extends from the eastern Andaman Sea, near {{southern}} border between Thailand and Myanmar, through the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, and northward to Vietnam. Its exact distribution off Thailand is uncertain. There is a single record of this species from Sarawak in Borneo. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits fine sediment habitat over the continental shelf in both inshore and offshore waters. In the 19th century, it was reportedly abundant year-round in the Straits of Malacca. It is locally common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine {{documented}} their {{encounters with}} the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See. The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (淇淇) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (白鱀豚水族馆) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (石首半自然白鱀豚保护区), which had contained only <b>finless</b> porpoises since 1990, was flooded.|$|E
5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five <b>finless</b> porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the <b>finless</b> animal {{back into the}} water. Shark finning {{involves}} removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the <b>finless</b> sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. A curtain of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River {{is another}} species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, {{it does not}} {{perfectly}} fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the <b>finless</b> porpoise that, although the species {{may be found in}} both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers {{may not be able to}} survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).|$|E
25|$|Cetacean {{species that}} have become rare along Chinese coasts are a still present here such as false killer whales and <b>finless</b> porpoises, {{providing}} opportunistic observations at times. <b>Finless</b> porpoises in this areas are generally smaller than other subspecies, and it is unique that two subspecies inhabit in this region where Matsu region is the northern limit for one of these.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{organisation}} {{are dedicated}} to protecting certain species that do not fall under any international treaty, such as the Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita, and the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology (for the Yangtze <b>finless</b> porpoise).|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Type H was, {{like that}} of its predecessors, a single step design. A pair of flat {{bottomed}} floats, mounted below the outer interplane struts, stabilized the aircraft on the water. Two flight crew members were accommodated side-by-side and a front gunner sat separately in the nose. The rounded, <b>finless</b> rudder mounted above the high tailplane distinguished the Type H from earlier FBA flying boats, which had angular vertical tails.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Irrawaddy dolphins' colour is grey to dark slate blue, paler underneath, with no {{distinctive}} pattern. The {{dorsal fin}} {{is small and}} rounded behind {{the middle of the}} back. The forehead is high and rounded; the beak is lacking. The front of its snout is blunt. The flippers are broad and rounded. The <b>finless</b> porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) is similar and has no back fin; the humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is larger, has a longer beak and a larger dorsal fin.|$|E
25|$|The Yangtze River or Baiji dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) is {{the most}} {{endangered}} cetacean and is only found in the Yangtze River, China. A survey conducted in 1997 found only thirteen dolphins. The Yangtze River <b>finless</b> porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) also lives in the Yangtze River. Abundance has declined and there are fewer than 2000 dolphins left. This may be due, in part, {{to the construction of}} the Three Gorges Dam which covers a significant amount of the dolphin’s habitat. Both species are often subject to entanglement in gillnets.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{mediterranean}} {{regions of the}} Arabian Sea, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Kutch, the Gulf of Suez, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Gulf of Aden, and the Gulf of Oman, dolphins and <b>finless</b> porpoises {{are the most common}} marine mammals in the waters, while larger whales and orcas are rarer today. Historically, whales had been abundant in the gulf before commercial hunts wiped them out. Whales were reduced even further by illegal mass hunts by the Soviet Union and Japan in the 1960s and 70s. Along with Bryde's whales, the most common and possible resident and still can be seen in deeper marginal seas such as Gulf of Aden, Israel coasts, and in Strait of Hormuz. Other species such as the critically endangered Arabian humpback whale (also historically common in Gulf of Aden, and sighting records increased in Red Sea since in 2006 including in Gulf of Aqaba), omura's whale, minke whale, and orca also swim into the gulf, while many other large species such as blue whale, sei, and sperm whales were once migrants into the Gulf of Oman and off the coasts in deeper waters, and still migrate in Red Sea, but mainly in deeper waters of outer seas. In 2017, waters of Persian Gulf along Abu Dhabi was revealed to hold world's largest population of Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Various {{species of}} toothed whales, mainly dolphins, {{are kept in}} captivity, {{as well as several}} other species of {{porpoise}} such as harbour porpoises and <b>finless</b> porpoises. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species kept in dolphinariums, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity, and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Killer whales are well known for their performances in shows, but the number kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captives being held in aquaria as of 2012. Other species kept in captivity are spotted Dolphins, false killer whales, and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. Also, fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi are in captivity. Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins, known as wolphins, are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale. Also, two common/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at Discovery Cove and the other at SeaWorld San Diego.|$|E
500|$|The <b>finless</b> sleeper ray (Temera hardwickii) is {{a species}} of {{electric}} ray in the family Narkidae, and the sole member of its genus. It is found over the continental shelf of Southeast Asia from the eastern Andaman Sea to Vietnam and Borneo. Typically growing no more than [...] long, {{it may be the}} smallest cartilaginous fish. The <b>finless</b> sleeper ray is the only electric ray that lacks dorsal fins. It has an oval pectoral fin disc that varies from longer than wide to wider than long, depending on age, and a short, robust tail that terminates in a short, deep caudal fin. The trailing margins of its pelvic fins are sexually dimorphic, being more concave in males.|$|E
500|$|Reproduction in the <b>finless</b> sleeper ray is viviparous, {{with the}} embryos {{sustained}} through gestation by a yolk sac. A single account exists of a pregnant female [...] long that contained four late-term foetuses each [...] long; the young {{were similar in}} form and colouration to the adult, but had thicker discs. Males reach sexual maturity at around [...] in length, and females at around [...] in length.|$|E
500|$|The <b>finless</b> sleeper ray {{can produce}} a {{moderate}} electric shock for defence against predators. The shock originates from the two electric organs, each about one-third {{as long as the}} ray. The organs consist of numerous fluid-filled pentagonal or hexagonal columns, which essentially act as batteries connected in parallel. This species probably feeds on small invertebrates. The robust structure of its jaws suggest that it may prefer hard-shelled prey. Theodore Edward Cantor wrote in an 1850 account that this species was often infested by minute worms under the skin, which he termed [...] "Cysteocercus temerae" [...] and classified as [...] "entozoa" [...] (an obsolete grouping that included acanthocephalans, trematodes, cestodes, and nematodes).|$|E
500|$|The <b>finless</b> sleeper ray was {{described}} as a new species and genus by English zoologist John Edward Gray in an 1831 issue of the scientific journal Zoological Miscellany. His account was based on two specimens collected from Penang in Malaysia by General Thomas Hardwicke and presented to the British Museum. Hence, Gray named the ray Temera hardwickii, or [...] "Hardwicke's Temera". He noted that the new genus was most closely affiliated to the genus Narke, because it has no dorsal fins while Narke has only one and other electric rays have two. A 2012 phylogenetic study, based on morphology, corroborated the close relationship between Temera and Narke.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins {{are only}} {{slightly}} overlapped by the disc; each is long, wide, and roughly triangular, with trailing margins {{that are more}} concave in males than in females. The tail is stout and much shorter than the disc. Unique amongst electric rays, there are no dorsal fins. The tail terminates in a fairly large, triangular caudal fin {{about as long as}} wide, with rounded corners. The skin entirely lacks dermal denticles. This species is plain light brown dorsally, sometimes with darker markings and whitish spots, and pale ventrally, with broad darker margins on the pectoral and pelvic fins. Possibly the smallest cartilaginous fish, the smallest known adult <b>finless</b> sleeper ray measured only [...] long and weighed [...] Few individuals exceed [...] and the maximum length is thought to be , though there is a dubious old record of a specimen [...] long.|$|E
500|$|... is a green-haired {{girl who}} is the third member of the Mew Mews {{formally}} introduced to the readers. Infused with the DNA of a <b>Finless</b> Porpoise, Retasu's legs can change into a porpoise's tail while she is underwater, greatly improving her swimming ability and giving her an appearance of a mermaid. In the anime adaptation, this change can only occur when Retasu is {{in the presence of}} Mew Aqua. Retasu is portrayed as a shy and intelligent character lacking self-confidence and is the subject of frequent bullying from three girls. She is afraid of her Mew Mew powers at first, causing them to go out of control at her school until she is calmed by Ichigo and Minto. The other members of the group consider Retasu to be a kind and selfless person. As the series progresses, Retasu becomes a more confident person through the other Mew Mews' regular encouragement. In the anime, Retasu has a strong love interest towards Ryou and kissed him once, that only Bu-Ling is aware of their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Domestic media {{repeatedly}} reported by-catches of <b>finless</b> porpoises {{and other}} species on the Korean Peninsula as regarding as [...] "endangered whale species", [...] "infesting of illegal catches utilizing by-catches" [...] to foment anti-Korean sentiment, understandably raising the shelf of its own illegal and mass by-catches.|$|E
2500|$|LeSabre and {{all other}} {{full-sized}} Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring <b>finless</b> rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at [...] but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{commercial}} {{use of the}} river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the <b>finless</b> porpoise, baiji (Yangtze River dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of <b>finless</b> porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze River dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji. However, as {{there have been no}} confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. [...] "Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins". It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rest of the}} {{aircraft}} was conventional. [...] It had a <b>finless,</b> comma shaped rudder, a tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, braced from below and carrying separate elevators. [...] Tailplane incidence was adjustable from the cockpit. [...] The undercarriage was the divided type with wide splayed main oleo legs joining the fuselage below and between the wing struts. There were bracing struts forward to the engine bulkhead and the axles sloped inwards and upwards to a post below the fuselage, all rather like a strengthened version of the on the Parnall Elf.|$|E

When the L.1 first appeared its suitability for more powerful engines was noted; rotaries with powers of up to [...] were suggested. [...] The Ponnier M.1, flown in 1915 and the only Ponnier fighter to reach production, benefited from the L.1; it was smaller and better streamlined, but shared some features like the thick wings, large gap, moderate [...] stagger and slight span difference between upper and lower planes, the <b>finless</b> vertical tail and simple undercarriage. Its engine was a [...] Le Rhone.|$|E
2500|$|The Yangtze plays a {{large role}} in the history, culture and economy of China. [...] The prosperous Yangtze River Delta generates as much as 20% of the PRC's GDP. The Yangtze River flows through a wide array of {{ecosystems}} and is habitat to several endemic and endangered species including the Chinese alligator, the <b>finless</b> porpoise, the Chinese paddlefish, the (possibly extinct) Yangtze River dolphin or baiji, and the Yangtze sturgeon. [...] For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking and war. [...] The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Fins soon lost popularity. By {{the late}} 1950s, Cadillac and Chrysler - {{driven by the}} {{respective}} competing visions of GM's Earl and Chrysler's Exner - had escalated the size of fins till some thought they were stylistically questionable and they {{became a symbol of}} American excess in the early '60s. The 1961 models are considered the last of the [...] "Forward Look" [...] designs; Exner later referred to the <b>finless</b> 1962 down-sized Plymouth and Dodge models as [...] "plucked chickens". Although fins were out of favor by the early 1960s, fins could still give aerodynamic advantages. In the early 1970s Porsche 917 racing automobiles sported fins reminiscent of Exner's designs.|$|E
2500|$|The Ponnier D.III was {{a single}} seat, mid wing {{monoplane}} designed {{to compete in the}} 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy race. Pairs of landing wires on each side met over the fuselage at a pyramidal four strut pylon and parallel flying wires went to the lower fuselage. An oil deflecting cowling, open at the bottom, surrounded the powerful double row, fourteen cylinder Gnome Lambda-Lambda rotary engine, which delivered [...] to a 2 m diameter propeller. The oval, open cockpit was placed at mid-wing, just aft of the pylon centre. It had a <b>finless</b> rudder at the extreme rear of the fuselage and a straight edged tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage ahead of it. The elevators were aerodynamically separate but interconnected, controlled by central wires. The D.III had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a single axle mounted to the fuselage by pairs of wire cross-braced V-struts, plus a simple elliptical leaf spring tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The Vickers Vellore, {{named after}} the Indian city of Vellore {{in the state of}} Tamil Nadu, was a {{response}} to Air Ministry specification 34/24, which called for a civil mail and freight carrier. It was a large single-engined two-bay biplane, metal framed and fabric covered. [...] The wings were of equal span with a slight stagger and swept with simple parallel interplane struts. [...] Both upper and lower planes carried balanced ailerons. [...] The gap between the wings was large enough so that there were gaps both above and below the fuselage which increased diameter rapidly behind the uncowled radial engine. The crew sat side by side in an open cockpit at the highest point of the fuselage {{just in front of the}} wings, giving an excellent view. [...] Behind them was the cargo hold with the fuselage tapering gently towards the tail which carried biplane tailplanes with balanced elevators.
