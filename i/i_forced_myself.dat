I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to play the guitar. I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E
2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to take a}} long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{back to my}} own affair.|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think she}} has done badly for herself, so far,” <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to say. “I suppose you know that she began life by herding the village goats.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{different}} then," [...] he explained. [...] "I was scared--badly scared--but I felt I {{could do the}} thing if <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to it. Now I'm almost certain that I can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The young lady," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> {{to assume}} {{an air of}} pleasantry, which, I believe, became me {{extremely}} ill, [...] "would perhaps have been inclined {{to look a little}} lower on the family-tree, for the branch to which she was desirous of clinging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing in the world," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> upon confession, as {{the best}} way of {{clearing}} myself out of the scrape,--"only--only I sent you a little parcel, and as you are so regular in acknowledging letters and communications, I--I thought it might have miscarried--that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, Aunt Roxy," [...] said Mara, [...] "at any rate, it's {{a relief}} to speak out to some one. It's {{more than two months}} that I have felt every day more and more that there was no hope,--life has hung on me like a weight. I have had to make myself keep up, and make myself do everything, and no one knows how it has tried me. I am so tired all the time, I could cry; and yet when I go to bed nights I can't sleep, I lie in such a hot, restless way; and then before morning I am drenched with cold sweat, and feel so weak and wretched. <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to eat, and <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to talk and laugh, and it's all pretense; and it wears me out,--it would be better if I stopped trying,--it would be better to give up and act as weak as I feel; but how can I let them know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Secretary as {{suddenly}} brightened, and returned: 'Upon my honour I had no thought but for you. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to be constrained, lest you might misinterpret my being more natural. There. It's gone.' ...|$|E
60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|E
60|$|My voice faltered {{a little}} in spite of me. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> from the room. It was no time, then, for parting with the {{self-control}} which might yet serve me in my need before the day was out.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>forced</b> from <b>myself</b> a laugh, {{that only}} in part, however, broke the spell, and inquired of Dick {{how he had}} {{acquired}} possession of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll go together,' {{repeated}} Lagnier. 'You {{shall see}} how soon <b>I</b> will <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to be recognised as a gentleman, and you shall profit by it. It is agreed? Are we one?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Amal. Assist me, Venus, for I tremble when I am to speak, but <b>I</b> must <b>force</b> <b>myself.</b> [...] [Aside. Sir, I would crave but {{one short}} minute with you, And some few words.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to {{take part}} in conversation, {{speaking}} of this or that trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth.|$|E
60|$|This much Jacob {{must have}} {{understood}} {{as well as}} I, for when <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> backward, pushing vigorously against him, he gave way, and we thus slowly retreated until having gained such {{a distance from the}} feasting murderers that it seemed safe to rise to our feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bess, {{the fact}} is I've been dreaming a lot. This valley makes a fellow dream. So <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to think. We can't live this way much longer. Soon I'll simply {{have to go to}} Cottonwoods. We need a whole pack train of supplies. I can get--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, it's not my fault. <b>I</b> can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to believe. If {{there is}} a God after all and he punishes me because I {{honestly}} don't believe in Him I can't help it." ...|$|R
60|$|So far <b>I</b> had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to listen}} to him. At those last words {{the picture of the}} future that he was placing before me became too hideous to be endured. I refused to hear more.|$|R
6000|$|... "What have I done?" [...] {{he asked}} fiercely. [...] "What have I failed to do? Why {{do you look}} as though <b>I</b> had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> upon you? Haven't I the right? Don't you wish to see me?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} to give up {{pursuing}} the inquiry to that final point, but <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to abandon all idea of continuing it. Seeing her as I saw her now, {{it would have been}} cruel to think of anything but the necessity and the humanity of restoring her composure.|$|E
6000|$|... "One evening {{coming in}} with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} the end of the battle. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to endure}} it as long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so I made frank {{confession}} to that effect, and we retired. We heard afterward that the black cock died in the ring, and fighting to the last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{promise that}} you will never tell James that he owes {{anything}} to me. I couldn't bear him to think <b>I</b> had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> on him so as to {{have a sort of}} claim. Please promise me that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon you," [...] Dominey said {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "It seems strange, though, to meet right out here, far away even from the by-ways of life, just to shake hands and pass on. I am sick to death of niggers and animals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Village of Treen, October 22nd.)--The {{events of}} this one day have changed the whole future of my life. <b>I</b> must <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to write of them at once.

6000|$|... "I {{turned and}} led the way to the higher part of the beach, where some fishing-boats were drawn up which {{completely}} screened us from the view of any one landing on the shore below. Seeing probably that I had a purpose of some kind, Manuel followed me without uttering a word. As soon as we were safely under the shelter of the boats, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself,</b> in my own defense, to look at him again.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had really}} not {{supposed}} {{it possible that}} she could be more unendurable than ever. When she mentioned her Christian name, she succeeded nevertheless in producing that result. In the whole list of women's names, is there any one to be found so absolutely sickening as [...] "Selina"? <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to pronounce it; I made another neatly-expressed apology; I said English servants were so very peculiar. Selina was more than satisfied; she was quite delighted.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned in}} an instant, and tore the {{hair back from}} her face. For a moment, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to look at her; for a moment, I confronted the {{smouldering}} fever in her cheeks; {{the glare of the}} bloodshot eyes; the distortion of the parched lips; the hideous clutching of the outstretched fingers at the empty air--but the agony of that sight was more than I could endure: I turned away my head, and hid my face in horror.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in earnest," [...] {{replied the}} other, [...] "and since <b>I</b> have <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> into your confidence, I think it but fair {{to give you}} mine. The cause of my going is love! Yes, Guy, I too am in love, but alas! my love is not returned; it is hopeless." ...|$|R
60|$|While he {{uttered the}} last words, I felt my self-possession returning. <b>I</b> could not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to speak, as I would fain have spoken--I could only move away, to leave him.|$|R
60|$|Andr. I cannot, for my hand obeys me not; But, as in slumbers, when we fain {{would run}} From our {{imagined}} fears, our idle feet Grow to the ground, our struggling voice dies inward; So now, when <b>I</b> would <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to chear you, My faltering tongue can give no glad presage: Alas, I am no more Andromache.|$|R
