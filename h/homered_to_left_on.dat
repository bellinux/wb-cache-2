5000|$|In 2012, Gentry batted [...]304, {{a career}} high. He also hit his first outside-the-park home run, a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> in Toronto <b>on</b> April 30. Gentry pitched the final inning of a 12-1 loss {{at the hands}} of the Oakland Athletics on June 4. He allowed two runs on three hits and a walk.|$|R
50|$|In {{the top of}} the ninth, Hamilton hit another solo {{home run}} off Yankees {{reliever}} Sergio Mitre which tied the ALCS home run records. Guerrero followed up with an infield single. Cruz then <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> make the score 10-3.|$|R
50|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Biittner walked the Expos' Dave Cash and then retired Chris Speier. Then, Ellis Valentine <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> make the game 16-2. Biittner then gave up two more singles and served up a third home run to Andre Dawson.|$|R
50|$|The NL {{got off to}} a {{quick start}} against Chris Sale when Kris Bryant homered {{in the top of the}} first to give the NL a 1-0 lead. In the bottom of the second inning, the AL got to Johnny Cueto when Eric Hosmer <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> tie the game. Two batters later, Salvador Pérez hit a two-run shot to give the AL a 3-1 lead.|$|R
50|$|He {{also hit}} {{the first of}} his three career walk-off home runs in 1993. The Angels trailed the Minnesota Twins 3-2 {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning with Salmon on base and one out. Pérez <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field off Twins {{reliever}} Rick Aguilera for a 4-3 Angels win.|$|R
50|$|Florida did {{not give}} up {{in the bottom of}} the seventh, {{beginning}} their rally with a walk for Aja Paculba. Bruder doubled to put them both in scoring position, and with one out, Francesca Enea hit a 3-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> center, shrinking Alabama's lead to two. After Brooks and Bush consecutively walked, Hilberth struck out, and Michelle Moultrie hit a fly to deep right that was about five feet from going out of the park.|$|R
50|$|In {{their opening}} {{game of the}} Cox Invitational, Florida uncharacteristically allowed five earned runs, but still {{managed to get the}} win. Corrie Brooks started off the scoring slowly with a solo shot {{in the top of the}} second inning. Three more came in the third off the bat of Kelsey Bruder, who <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> {{bringing}} home Francesca Enea and Tiffany DeFelice, who both singled. They'd add one more an inning later after Kim Waleszonia was hit by a pitch with one out. Waleszonia stole second and Enea got the RBI <b>on</b> a single <b>to</b> <b>left.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gators {{bounced back}} from their first loss of the season, scoring 11 runs in 6 innings. The first scoring of the day {{happened}} {{in the top of}} the third when Kim Waleszonia, Aja Paculba, and Ali Gardiner had back-to-back-to-back singles, the third of which scored Waleszonia. Two innings later, Megan Bush took a lead-off walk, was moved over to 2nd on a sacrifice bunt by Michelle Moultrie and to 3rd on a groundout by Waleszonia. All the small ball proved unnecessary as Paculba <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field, increasing Florida's lead to 3.|$|R
50|$|With the Series tied at {{one game}} apiece, John Smoltz faced off against the Pirates' twenty-game winner, John Smiley. Orlando Merced hit Smoltz's first pitch {{over the right}} field wall for a home run and a 1-0 lead. But the Braves rallied with four runs {{in the bottom of}} the first, topped off by Greg Olson's two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> Smiley was gone by the third inning with the Braves leading, 6-1. In the seventh, with the score 7-3, Alejandro Peña struck out Jay Bell with the bases loaded to end the Pirates' last threat. Ultimately, the Braves won 10-3 with home runs from Ron Gant, Greg Olson, and Sid Bream.|$|R
50|$|Nine {{walks in}} {{fewer than five}} innings proved the undoing of Rex Barney in this start for Brooklyn. A pair of walks and RBI single by {{opposing}} pitcher Spec Shea in the fourth put the Yankees up 1-0. Joe DiMaggio <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> in the fifth. That was all the runs the visiting Yanks would get at Ebbets Field, but this was Shea's stadium this day. A hit by Jackie Robinson in the sixth scored Al Gionfriddo to pull the Dodgers within 2-1. Then in the ninth, after a Bruce Edwards leadoff single and sacrifice bunt by Carl Furillo, the tying run died on base. Shea got Spider Jorgensen on a fly to right, and with Brooklyn's fans on their feet, pinch-hitter Cookie Lavagetto struck out.|$|R
50|$|June saw a turn in {{play for}} the Yankees, as they won seven {{straight}} to begin the month of June. In the month, various achievements were reached. Alex Rodriguez hit his 3000th career hit at home on June 19, hitting a home run to right field off from Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. The achievement was similar to Derek Jeter's 3000th hit in 2011, when he <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> off from Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price. Price and Verlander happen to both be winners of the Cy Young Award. Ironically, Price and Verlander were both members of the Tigers organization the date of Rodriguez's 3000th hit. A few weeks later, Rodriguez was given the ball back from Zack Hample, the fan who caught it.|$|R
5000|$|A {{line drive}} single by Julio Franco {{in the fifth}} inning broke a 3-3 tie Cleveland {{defeated}} Cincinnati to win the final Ohio Cup in [...] Manny Ramírez had given Cleveland a 3-1 lead with a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field in the second off the Reds' Mark Portugal. Hal Morris drove in two runs for the Reds with a first-inning single and a double in the third, with Bret Boone scoring both times. A single by Vince Coleman in the fifth drove in Jeff Branson and tied the score at 3-3. The victory gave the Indians a 6-2 lead in the Ohio Cup series and was viewed by 16,697 people, the largest crowd in the game's history and the second largest at Cooper Stadium. Indians starter Joe Roa was the winning pitcher.|$|R
25|$|González got off {{to strong}} start, quickly {{retiring}} the Cubs in order {{in the top of}} the first with two strikeouts. With two outs in the bottom of the first, third baseman Anthony Rendon hit a solo home run into the Nationals′ bullpen in right field to give the Nats their first run and first lead of the series, but Cubs catcher Willson Contreras responded with a towering leadoff <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> {{in the top of the}} second to tie the game at 1-1. González then kept the Cubs off the bases until the top of the fourth inning, when third baseman Kris Bryant led off with a double and first baseman Anthony Rizzo followed immediately with a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> right to give Chicago a 3–1 lead, becoming the Cubs' career leader in postseason homers (with six) and in postseason RBIs (with 16). González left the game after five innings, having given up three earned runs on three hits and two walks while striking out six Cubs.|$|R
50|$|Derek Lowe and Cole Hamels {{faced each}} other at Citizens Bank Park for Game 1. In the first inning, Manny Ramírez missed a home run by mere feet to center field and settled for an RBI double to give LA a 1-0 lead, {{and later in the}} fourth, Matt Kemp scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Blake DeWitt. However, in the sixth inning, as Lowe was rolling, a throwing error by Dodgers shortstop Rafael Furcal put Shane Victorino on second base, apparently breaking the momentum for Lowe, who on the next pitch surrendered a home run to Chase Utley that tied the score. After a Ryan Howard groundout, Pat Burrell <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> and put the Phillies out front 3-2, and that would prove to be the final score. Brad Lidge tossed a perfect ninth for the save.|$|R
50|$|Florida started badly when Megan Bush {{committed}} {{an error}} on a hard-hit grounder, allowing the runner to reach. Then, with two outs, starting pitcher Stephanie Brombacher walked clean-up hitter Jessica Spigner. The next batter scored Tennessee's first {{run on a}} single, which also moved the other runner to third. After a double from right fielder Erin Webb scored both runners and a walk, Brombacher forced a pop-up to Bush for the third out. With Tennessee leading 3-0, the Gator offense put Florida back on top. Aja Paculba led off with a double <b>to</b> <b>left</b> center, and after a groundout from Kristina Hilberth moved Paculba to third, Ali Gardiner brought the Gators back to within one with a <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> With two outs, Kelsey Bruder was hit on the helmet with a pitch. Corrie Brooks brought her home with a triple, and Brooks gave Florida the lead with an RBI single from Bush.|$|R
5000|$|One {{night after}} {{becoming}} a father, Bret Saberhagen tossed a five-hitter and the Royals {{became the first}} team to ever rally from a three games to one deficit twice in the same postseason to win the World Series. They also were {{the first team to}} lose the first two games at home and rally to win the Series. Saberhagen got all the offense he needed when Darryl Motley <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> off John Tudor in the second inning, after a walk to Steve Balboni. In the third, Lonnie Smith led off with a walk, and with one out George Brett hit an accidental infield single. After a double steal, Tudor issued walks to Frank White and Jim Sundberg, making it 3-0. Tudor was replaced with Bill Campbell after only [...] innings. Balboni singled <b>to</b> <b>left</b> off Campbell for two runs to make it 5-0. Tudor walked four and was charged with all five runs. In the dugout, he angrily punched an electrical fan, cutting his pitching hand.|$|R

5|$|Kershaw had a 41 inning {{scoreless}} inning streak {{that ended}} {{in the top of}} the sixth inning on July 10 when, with two outs, Chase Headley <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history. He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in a row. He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in a row he had reached that number, trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|R

50|$|The Gators got on {{the board}} early when Francesca Enea <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field, also {{bringing}} home Aja Paculba who was walked and Ali Gardiner who singled. Then, in the 2nd, Corrie Brooks doubled, Megan Bush hit a sacrifice bunt to move her to third, and Michelle Moultrie hit a sacrifice fly <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field <b>to</b> bring her home. Center fielder Kim Waleszonia immediately homered, making the game 5-0 in favor of Florida. Two innings later, {{in the bottom of}} 5th, Paculba added to the Gators' home run total, bringing the lead to six. Gardiner was hit by a pitch, Lauren Heil (who was pinch running for Gardiner) stole second, and advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher Courtney Oberg. After Kelsey Bruder was walked, Brooks singled and both she and Bruder advanced an extra base as the Bears attempted, but failed to prevent Heil from scoring. In the bottom of the 6th, Alicia Sisco pinch hit for Moultrie and got her first collegiate hit. Paculba doubled to center field to score Sisco after she advanced to second on a walk of Hilberth. Up by eight, the game ended because of the mercy rule.|$|R

50|$|Another 18-inning contest {{was played}} between the Atlanta Braves and the Houston Astros on October 9, 2005. In the 4th game of a National League Division Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, the Braves (who were {{trailing}} the series two games {{to one and}} facing elimination) took a 6-1 lead into the 8th inning. A grand slam by Lance Berkman {{in the bottom of}} the 8th brought the score to 6-5, and with two outs {{in the bottom of the}} 9th, Brad Ausmus <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> tie the game and send it to extra innings. The score remained deadlocked at 6-6 until the 18th, when the Astros' Chris Burke (who entered the game in the 9th inning as a pinch runner) <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field <b>to</b> win the game and send Houston to the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Roger Clemens, who was brought in to pinch-hit in the 15th and pitched the last three innings in relief, was credited as the winning pitcher in the 5-hour, 50-minute contest. In a somewhat odd coincidence, Adam LaRoche and Tim Hudson played in both 18 inning games. This one as Atlanta Braves and the other one as opposing sides of one another with Hudson pitching in both games as the visiting team's starting pitcher. It is the longest winner in a potential clinching game in baseball history.|$|R

50|$|Florida sailed {{in their}} NCAA Tournament opener against Florida A&M. Stephanie Brombacher threw a two-hit, five-inning shutout and the Gator offense hit three home runs. In {{the bottom of}} the first, Aja Paculba led off with a home run, Kristina Hilberth {{followed}} up with a high chopper up the middle, and Ali Gardiner walked. With one out, Kelsey Bruder hit an RBI double that moved Gardiner to third. A sacrifice fly from Corrie Brooks scored her but left Bruder at second. Megan Bush brought her home in the following at-bat with the Gators' second home run of the game, upping the Florida lead to five. The second inning was more of the same; with Paculba (walk), Hilberth (single), and Gardiner (walk) all on base, Florida's all-time RBI leader got two more with a single to center field. Brooks cleared the bases two batters later <b>on</b> a <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> center, increasing the lead to 10. The final scores for Florida came on Paculba's two RBI single that brought home Bush, who was on third after a walk, and Kim Waleszonia, who was on second after a double.|$|R

50|$|Facing {{elimination}} and {{the last}} game at Wrigley Field for the season, the Cubs sent ace Jon Lester to the mound while the Indians countered with Trevor Bauer. Lester surrendered a second inning <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> José Ramírez as the Cubs fell behind 1-0. However, Kris Bryant answered in the fourth, <b>homering</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> lead off the inning. Anthony Rizzo doubled following Bryant's homer and Ben Zobrist singled. Addison Russell followed with an infield single to score Rizzo and put the Cubs up 2-1. Following a Jason Heyward strikeout, Javier Báez singled on a bunt to load the bases with one out. David Ross hit a sacrifice fly to score Zobrist, but Lester struck out to end the inning. Bauer {{was removed from the}} game after pitching four innings, but the Cubs could do no further damage. Leading 3-1, Lester allowed a run in the sixth following a single and stolen base by Rajai Davis and a Francisco Lindor single. Lester was lifted with the 3-2 lead after six innings. Carl Edwards Jr. replaced Lester in the seventh and gave up a single. Following a flyout, Cub manager Joe Maddon went to closer Aroldis Chapman for an eight-out save. Chapman closed out the seventh and gave up a single to Davis in the eighth. Davis stole second and third, but Chapman stranded him there. In the ninth, Chapman retired the side, striking out José Ramírez to end the game and extend the series to a Game 6 in Cleveland.|$|R
