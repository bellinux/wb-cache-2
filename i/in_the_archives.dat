30|$|For the {{experiments}} with HMOR-S 2 PAS, an archive of size 5 is considered, chosen empirically after extensive experimentation. Here, the practical {{conclusion is that}} an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> size will not necessarily lead to better final results {{because at the end}} of the heuristic run (when the final solution is chosen from those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>archive)</b> <b>the</b> top 5 solutions tend to be the same regardless of <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> size (≥ 5).|$|R

5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they were placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many {{wound up in the}} hands of a coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of the Society, where the world in general, or even {{the members of the}} Society, would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E

5|$|Reich and Ilse Ollendorff {{divorced}} in September 1951, ostensibly {{because he thought}} she had had an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.|$|E
