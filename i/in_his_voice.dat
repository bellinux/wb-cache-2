5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure {{she would be able to}} effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E

25|$|Orbison's severe {{stage fright}} was {{particularly}} noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During {{the first few}} songs in a concert, the vibrato <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable. This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that {{he was unable to}} control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.|$|E
50|$|Musngi {{developed}} an interest <b>in</b> developing <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> home province back then, {{there is no}} television and often listened to the radio. Musngi said that he initially imitated the voice he hears on the radio before developing <b>his</b> own <b>voice</b> over style. He also read newspapers aloud as part of honing <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> He has cited Joonee Gamboa as one of <b>his</b> inspirations <b>in</b> developing <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> over talent.|$|R

Ludmila eludes Chernomor’s henchmen by remaining invisible, but then is tricked by the wizard into revealing herself when he {{takes the form of}} Ruslan and calls to her <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> He is thwarted by the sound of a horn and hurries off, leaving his hat behind.|$|E
25|$|A new mix {{was created}} for the stereo version of the album, and on 25 February 1963 Martin made one created from {{original}} takes 16, 17 and 18. This stereo version has Lennon fluffing the final verse, causing him to sing 'come on' with a slight chuckle <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> Also different in the stereo mix is Harrison's lead guitar line before the final verse; rather than duplicating the overdubbed harmonica exactly as he had earlier in the song, Harrison drops down a fourth for the third note, rather than continuing down by stepwise motion.|$|E
25|$|With emotion still <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{and eyes}} watering, Cronkite once again {{recapped}} the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire {{photos of the}} visit and explaining {{the significance of the}} pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, {{and that there was no}} report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and left the room for a while.|$|E

25|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois, Cleveland began singing {{as a boy}} soprano at Pilgrim Baptist Church where Thomas A. Dorsey was {{minister}} of music and Roberta Martin was pianist for the choir. He strained his vocal cords as a teenager while part of a local gospel group, leaving the distinctive gravelly voice that was his hallmark in his later years. The change <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> led him to focus on his skills as a pianist and later as a composer and arranger. For his pioneering accomplishments and contributions, he is regarded {{by many to be}} one of the greatest gospel singers that ever lived.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Dark Lord, Saruman {{convinced}} Treebeard, possibly using what little enchantment was left <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> to release him from Isengard. He travelled to the Shire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the name Sharkey. Under his command ruffians entered The Shire and ruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took (Merry and Pippin) in the Battle of Bywater on 3 November. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and Wormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue however killed Saruman, before he himself was killed by the Hobbits and their arrows. With the death of the wizard Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, on the {{occasion}} of the festival of Eid ul-Adha, he is said to have delivered an hour-long sermon extempore in Arabic expounding the meaning and philosophy of sacrifice. This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the Khutba Ilhamiyya, the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> he appeared as if in a trance, in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into prostration, followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{sought to}} reflect the Rhino's simplistic {{thinking}} style <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> He believes [...] "the quintessential 'thug' was played by William Bendix in The Glass Key. The simpler the character, the simpler the thought process. That means Rhino's 'motivation' is never too complicated he's very elemental. He's mad or happy or angry or sad or hungry or whatever. And it never gets beyond his appetites or ego." [...] Brown considers that Bendix's performance perfectly portrayed this type of character.|$|E
500|$|Keenan's {{ability as}} a vocalist has been {{characterized}} more subjectively by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: After his performance during an Alice in Chains reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as [...] "a natural fit at replacing Layne Staley". Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, The New York Times wrote that [...] "both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> adding a touch of profundity".|$|E
500|$|Describing Keenan's {{contribution}} to Tool and A Perfect Circle, The New York Times wrote that [...] "both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> adding {{a touch of}} profundity". He ranked No. 21 in Hit Paraders 2006 list of [...] "Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists", and his unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as Pete Loeffler of Chevelle and Jared Leto of Thirty Seconds to Mars.|$|E

500|$|Fanning {{has been}} {{described}} as having a strong vocal range when singing, but has stated that he is not highly confident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> In a 1998 interview, Fanning said, [...] "I don't think I have the perfect voice or anything", and stated that delivering the message of the song was more important than [...] "showing off [...] chops". He noted he was not interested in singing for the purpose of singing alone, but rather because he enjoyed getting the purpose of the song across. Fanning has stated: [...] "For me, writing songs comes from anywhere", drawing inspiration from his experiences.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Fear Factory in 2002, guitarist Dino Cazares {{was looking for}} a drummer that [...] "fit in" [...] with the band. First he tried drummers John Sankey from Devolved and Nicholas Barker from the bands Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. But both drummers had to return to their homelands of Australia and England respectively due to visa issues. He then met former Vital Remains drummer Tim Yeung. Cazares and Yeung recorded the material they wrote and sent tapes to Cummings for his vocal audition. Cazares comments [...] "We heard passion and anger <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> which was something we wanted. It was also very aggressive." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> {{or whatever you want}} to call it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with {{subjects}} {{as diverse as}} [...] "isolated communities, old school teachers and Roman roads", but maintains a [...] "warped coherency". According to Rhys, Mwngs lyrics—which he considers to be some of his best—were written [...] "very simply" [...] and convey simple messages. The singer {{made an effort to}} be economical with his words, not communicating a lot of information with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> I think equally people can get off on this record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Schulz of The New Zealand Herald {{said that}} the song, {{alongside}} the album tracks [...] "Paddling Out" [...] and [...] "Bavarian #1 (Say You Will)", [...] "will swirl around in your head for days and demand repeat plays". Spin Josh Modell named it a highlight of the album; he wrote that if the album as a whole sounded like [...] "The Wave", [...] "it could fill arenas". Chris Martins of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Though Wyatt's vocals recall a sad-faced Peter Gabriel, the song is steeped {{in the kind of}} effervescent magic that makes Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John stars in their own right." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of Wyatt's vocal performance; he wrote that [...] "we really {{get a sense of how}} Wyatt's voice hinders the group". He {{said that the}} singer intones the lyrics [...] "somewhat abstractly, but with absolutely no sense of gravity to be found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> at all".|$|E
500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a twinge of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
