The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, El juego de Cuba, so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film {{as if it were}} entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored. He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the rushes with Bartley and ÓBriain, Zoido asked them, [...] "What do we want to tell in this scene?" [...] He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.|$|E

Philips' CD-i players with the Full Motion Video MPEG-1 decoder cartridge would play both formats. Only a few CD-i DV titles were released before the company switched to the current VCD format for publishing movies.|$|R

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> (<b>DV)</b> is a {{standard}} protocol used by some digital camcorders. All DV cameras that recorded to tape media had a FireWire interface (usually a 4-conductor). All DV ports on camcorders only operate at the slower 100 Mbit/s speed of FireWire. This presents operational issues if the camcorder is daisy chained from a faster S400 device or via a common hub because any segment of a FireWire network cannot support multiple speed communication.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>DV</b> technology, {{the means of production}} have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as YouTube and Veoh has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public.|$|E

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> (or <b>DV)</b> is a {{technology}} that has had {{a major impact on}} how films are made in {{a relatively short period of}} time. The new digital technology was first being used to create special effects and animated movies, by the late 1990s digital cameras were becoming more and more common on film sets. In 2002, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was the first major feature length film to be shot entirely on digital cameras. With the ability to instantly playback footage and the easy transfer of footage to computers for editing, digital cinema helped to speed up post production time. Digital film making was given a big boost in 2005 when the Digital Cinema Initiative created a guide for manufacturers to create a universal standard, to make the technologies more compatible with each other and more user friendly. shooting movies on digital also lead to new technologies for distributing films. Titan A.E., released in 2000, was the first feature film to be released for viewing over the internet. Digital distribution changed the ways people received and watched media, it also gave viewers access to huge amounts of online content on demand.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evaluation of}} a video stereo-image capture tool for photogrammetric applications. The 'NuView Adapter', a commonly available video-image splitting device, and a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> camera (<b>DV)</b> {{could be used to}} capture stereoscopic video footage for many photogrammetric applications in which low-cost near-simultaneous stereo-images are required for 3 D viewing or for 3 D spatial data capture. Relevant photogrammetric applications might include: aerial surveillance, human/animal motion study (tracking), bank/security surveillance and precise 3 D animation. The device permits two distinct views (left and right perspective views) to enter a single lens DV. A single convergence control in the device allows the user to obtain a stereo view of near and far objects. The system is easy to operate and the stereo-images give a good visual 3 D effect. Research was carried out to determine the quality of the stereo-image for 3 D measurement. The investigation involved: (1) the calibration of a customised system for optimum close range photogrammetric application; and (2) a case study involving motion tracking. A semi-automated monodigitising photogrammetric technique was used to determine the accuracy of the system. The results show that this system could achieve a spatial data accuracy of better than 13 mm at an object distance of 9 m. The horizontal and vertical accuracies are similar to those obtained by the conventional stereoscopic camera technique using a ''normal case'' configuration with 86 % overla...|$|R

To depict these locations as desolate, the film crew closed off sections of street for {{minutes at a}} time, usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays and would have typically around 45 minutes after dawn, to shoot the locations devoid of traffic {{and members of the}} public - to minimise disruption. Portions of the film were shot on a Canon XL1 <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> camera. <b>DV</b> cameras are much smaller and more manoeuvrable than traditional film cameras, which would have been impractical on such brief shoots. The scenes of the M1 motorway devoid of traffic were also filmed within very limited time periods. A mobile police roadblock slowed traffic sufficiently, to leave a long section of carriageway empty while the scene was filmed. The section depicted in the film was filmed at Milton Keynes, nowhere near Manchester. For the London scene where Jim walks by the overturned double-decker bus, the film crew placed the bus on its side and removed it when the shot was finished, all within 20 minutes. Much of the filming took place prior to the 11 September attacks and in the audio commentary, Boyle notes the parallel between the [...] "missing persons" [...] flyers seen {{at the beginning of the}} film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for automatic selection and transfer of corresponding image points in <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> (<b>DV)</b> image sequences. This approach utilizes and extends some well-known techniques and theories (e. g. the optical flow theory) {{as well as a}} designed simple error-detection mechanism to achieve a much better efficiency than the well-known Lucas-Kanade optical flow estimation (LK) method. Our test results use the SONY DCR-PC 115 DV image sequences and show that the trackable range of 3 - 4 pixels in the LK method can apparently be enlarged to 30 pixels in this new approach. The proposed error-detection mechanism simply utilizes the average gradient, normalized cross-correlation, and a simple image registration aided by least squares adjustment. Test results show that it can efficiently detect and delete wrong tracked points, and thus improve the quality of point transfer, and provide accurate coordinates {{of a large number of}} corresponding image points in DV image sequences.

Proceeding from participants' {{accounts of the}} production of their videonarratives, the article analyses the relations between doctoral research, reflexivity {{and the use of}} DV, and their articulation in different ways by the participants. As an ‘assemblage’, the written form of the article aims to evoke both the collaborative design of the project, in that it is constructed as a multivocality, a series of ‘plateaus’, and also the multiple, shifting and always in-process nature of identity, immanent in each individual's account. The accounts address how epistemological, ontological and ethical considerations are articulated within visual and vocal re-presentations of the self in the individual videonarratives. Each narrative both does (and does not) resonate with the other narratives and each offers insights into the specificities of particular doctoral journeys. In experimenting with this form of presentation, we aim to bypass traditional accounts of research ‘findings’ as a form of transparent knowledge production and, instead, work within a mode of representation which seeks to acknowledge the ‘masks of methodology’...|$|E
40|$|Software {{architecture}} {{was developed}} to automate site specific field data acquisition, processing, and geo-referenced crop plant parameters extraction. The architecture supported acquisition and processing of different data streams such as digital video for machine vision and digital serial communications of NMEA strings. The number of channels for data import could be easily expanded for multiple video, GPS, and other signal sources. The architecture was objectoriented and each component in the architecture was developed as a separate class. A key component of this architecture was a supervisor class, which communicated and coordinated the operations on all other classes. Based on this framework, early stage corn population estimation (ESCOPE) software was developed which grabs pre-recorded digital video from a vehicle-mounted camera, that was passed over corn rows, and acquires GPS strings which were modulated and recorded on the audio channel. A <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> (<b>DV)</b> capture class was written to acquire video using Microsoft’s DirectShow® technology which enables camera control and video acquisition using higher level hardware functions.

40|$|In {{this article}} we define and conceptualize the notion of ‘intercreating’ and how the notion relates to interthinking. This new {{characterization}} of the processes of collective creativity emerges from an empirical study, reported here, examining how intercreating was constituted in interaction between primary-aged learners who were working in groups to create <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> (<b>DV)</b> stories. The study focuses on one group, comprising three girls and two boys. Whilst the context of DV production was motivating for the members, their differing ideas regarding ‘violent’ versus ‘soft’ themes (representing their different lifeworlds) appeared to provoke conflicts. Despite initially disputational and superficial interactions, the group was subsequently able to negotiate joint strategies, constraints and norms and to establish and sustain intersubjectivity – which in turn {{appeared to be a}} prerequisite for intercreating. In this open-ended fictive DV task, there was relatively little common ground that could provide an initial basis for discussion and the suggestions made were accepted or rejected according to implicit, tacitly shared criteria. There was little evidence of explicit reasoning in talk; the norms and constraints in play related to the school-based nature of the task and it was these that were used as justifications for ideas or possible solutions. As pedagogical solutions, sub-tasks with tangible goals and the requirement to establish consensus on ideas seemed to facilitate and enhance group discussion. We suggest that intercreating, in the context of divergent fictive content creation, can be defined as a process involving shared meaning-making and group flow...|$|E
