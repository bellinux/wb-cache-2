Abstract Wood pallets are often put in circulation for several years. In a pallet’s lifetime it goes through several wet-dry cycles. In this study, softwood pallet specimens were compressed statically and impacted at different water contents through an accelerated drying process for three repeated wet-dry cycles. A static compressive strength test was performed along the grain of pallet stringers to avoid the effect of loadings in different grain directions.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} two crucial {{issues related to}} the {{numerical}} simulation of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) processes. The first issue is the identification of microstructural parameters for precipitates dissolution in precipitation hardenable aluminium alloys. Here the main goal is to get the effective activation energy and master curve using Neural Networks (NN). Based on the model of kinetics of dissolution of precipitates for hardenable aluminium alloys given by Myhr & Grong (1991), a new parametrization of the master curve is proposed. The novel methodology, which has been applied to different aluminium alloys, such as the AA 2014 T 6, AA 6005 A T 6 and AA 7449 T 79, tends to avoid both the overestimation and underestimation of the relative volume faction of precipitates at later and early stages, respectively, shown by the Myhr & Grong (1991) and Shercliff et al. (2005) models. Numerical results for the effective activation energy and the new parametrized master curve are given. A good comparison with experimental results available is shown. The second issue addressed in this work is the process parameters optimization in FSW. Here the main goal is to identify and to optimize the key material process parameters, {{on the basis of a}} suitable measure of the weld quality. The optimization of the process parameters is performed using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The advancing and rotating tool velocities have been selected as the key process parameters to be optimized. The measure of the quality of the weld has been defined in terms of the maximum <b>hardness</b> <b>drop</b> at the cross section under the tool.

The raceway of a roller bearing race for cylindrical rollers having two concentric cylindrical surfaces (one surface being the raceway and the other cylindrical surface comprise elastic loads of seating).

For both strength and corrosion, {{the transition from the}} thermo-mechanically affected to the heat affected zone (TMAZ/HAZ) {{turned out to be the}} most critical site. Higher welding speeds produced both a smaller <b>hardness</b> <b>drop</b> in the TMAZ/HAZ and a smaller width of the softened zone.

SEM examinations of the top surface of FSW 2024 -T 3 joints revealed the presence of constitutionally melted Al 2 MgCu (S-phase) particles in that region.

The <b>hardness</b> <b>drop</b> and conductivity increase in the novel alloy following a low cooling rate are much reduced compared to AA 7050 and 7 B 04 because of a lower sensitivity to quench-induced precipitation on dispersoids.

With increased size of SiCp especially with higher temperature, density and hardness doesn’t supplement each other. Possible pooling/agglomeration in the case of medium and coarse sized reinforcement account for this. Wear decreases with increase in sintering temperature for 23 and 37 µm SiCp reinforced composites where as it increases for 67 µm SiCp reinforced composites. This could be attributed to formation of silanium compound contributing to discrete hardening of matrix. Wear tends to drop with sliding velocity being less contact between the pin and the disc but increases with normal load acting on the composite...|$|R

The principle aim of {{this research}} project is to measure parameters which are pertinent for numerical simulations in discontinuous media. One such numerical tool, the Discrete Element Method (DEM), is a promising technique for predicting the dynamics of charge motion with in a mill. Particle interactions in DEM are calculated by contact force and force displacement laws at each particle contact. These contact events are characterized by parameters that are often fitted or estimated {{due to the lack}} of accurate experimental measurements. The {{aim of this}} project is to experimentally measure the necessary interaction properties required for the DEM analysis and to test the DEM models against the measured experimental results. An in-ﬂight binary collisions <b>drop</b> <b>tester</b> is constructed to measure the material interaction properties of two spheres. The collision event is captured photographically and pre- and post- relative velocities are measured. The binary collisions of the particles are carefully controlled by relay timing circuits and they are captured on digitized images using a SLR digital camera. The particles are illuminated using digital strobes controlled by a signal generator. The heights of the colliding particles are adjusted to vary the drop velocities prior to collision. The measured relative velocities arc applied in rigid body theory of binary impact to extract the required material interaction properties. The parameters measured from the binary collision include coefficients of tangential and normal restitution and friction. The analysis presented here draws on the work of Maw et al and Foerster et al, which is an extension of the Hertz theory of impact to the oblique impact of the elastic bodies with circular contacts. Initial numerical simulations using the viscous damping model is performed in Particle Flow Code (PFC) and a comparison between experimental and numerical results presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUltrahigh {{strength}} steels like press hardened 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL {{make good}} construction materials, however when fusion welded they bring {{the disadvantage of}} softening in heat affected zones (HAZ). State of the art research of Laser welding ultrahigh strength steels shows that neither increasing the welding velocity, nor {{post weld heat treatment}} {{have an effect on the}} strength and <b>hardness</b> <b>drop</b> in the HAZ. The key to improving these material characteristics is to increase heat dissipation out of the workpiece. To do so, the cooling conditions while laser welding press hardened 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL were dramatically increased. Experiments were carried out at subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C by using a mixture of liquid and gaseous nitrogen. To further improve heat dissipation, the clamping jaws were entirely made of copper. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were conducted to compare joints welded at room temperature with those welded at - 98 °C. Whilst an improvement of the hardness values could be achieved for the press hardened 22 MnB 5 and the S 1100, no change in the mechanical behavior regarding tensile tests could be observed. Thus, it can be noticed that there is no possibility to improve the strength levels of martensitic steels throughout varying process parameters (like welding velocity) or utilizing an active cooling, even if subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C are applied. A further improvement at lower temperatures is unlikely because heat dissipation in the work piece itself is the limiting factor...|$|R
