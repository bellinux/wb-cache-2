40|$|Soil {{information}} {{is vital for}} a range of purposes; however, soils vary greatly over short distances, making accurate soil data difficult to obtain. Soil surveys were first carried out in the 1920 s, and the first national soil map was produced in 1940. Several regional studies were done in the 1960 s, with the national Land Type Survey completed in 2002. Subsequently, the transfer of soil data to digital format has allowed a wide range of interpretations, but many data are still not freely available as they are held by a number of different bodies. The need for soil data is rapidly expanding to a range of fields, including health, food security, hydrological modelling and climate change. Fortunately, advances have been made in fields such as digital soil mapping, which enables the soil surveyors to address the need. The South African Soil Science fraternity will have to adapt to the changing environment in order to comply with the growing demands for data. At a recent Soil <b>Information</b> <b>Workshop,</b> soil scientists from government, academia and industry met to concentrate efforts in meeting the current and future soil data needs. The priorities identified included: interdisciplinary collaboration; expansion of the current national soil database with advanced data acquisition, manipulation, interpretation and countrywide dissemination facilities; and policy and human capital development in newly emerging soil science and environmental fields.

40|$|Trend {{information}} is a summarization of temporal statistical data, such as changes in product prices and sales. We propose {{a method for}} extracting trend information from multiple newspaper articles and blogs, and visualizing the information as graphs. As target texts for extraction of trend information, the MuST (Multimodal Summarization for Trend <b>Information)</b> <b>workshop</b> focuses on newspaper articles. In addition to newspapers, we focus on blogs, because useful information for analysing trend {{information is}} often written in blogs, such as the reasons for increases/decreases of statistics {{and the impact of}} increases/decreases of statistics on society. To extract trend information, we extract temporal expressions and statistical values, and we devised methods for both operations. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted some experiments. We obtained a recall of 6. 3 % and precision of 31. 3 % for newspaper articles, and a recall of 44. 8 % and precision of 60. 3 % for blogs. From the error analysis, we found that most errors in newspaper articles were caused by misconversion of temporal expressions such as “�� ” (the same year) or “�� ” (the previous month), into “YYYY-MM-DD ” form, although temporal expressions were detected correctly. In contrast to newspaper articles, there are few temporal expressions in blogs for which resolution is required, such as “�� ” (the same day) or “�� ” (the previous month). As a result, recall and precision for blogs are higher than those for newspaper articles...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary: 1. Environmental {{specimen}} banking is recognised internationally as {{an integral}} part of long-term environmental research and monitoring. Analysis of preserved environmental samples is often needed to detect and quantify patterns and rate of environmental change, and the emergence and progression of environmental hazards and risks. 2. National Environmental Specimen Banks have been established in several countries; they vary in scope and breadth. There are a few specialised environmental specimen holdings in the UK but no national-scale catalogue of holdings, despite an estimated annual spend of £ 16 million to store specimens. This lack of information results in under-exploitation of archived specimens and is a lost opportunity to facilitate world-class science and identify emerging pressures and threats on the environment. 3. An earlier project had identified key stakeholder organisations either engaged in archiving nationally important environmental specimens or who wished to utilise such specimens. These stakeholders had agreed there was a need for a national metadata catalogue of environmental specimens (subsequently termed a virtual UK-ESB). The objective of the current project was to further develop a virtual UK-ESB. Specifically, the aim was to work with stakeholders to establish the correct metadata entry fields, the search capabilities, the functionality and the nature of the hosting website of a virtual UK-ESB. 4. More than 80 stakeholder organisations that had previously expressed an interest in a UK-ESB were approached to provide feedback either electronically or by attending a stakeholder workshop. Thirty eight organisations responded. All remained interested in the UK-ESB concept and seventeen answered the survey questions. 5. Mock-ups of data entry screens, search screens and ideas around the functionality of a UK-ESB were developed by the CEH project team. These were mailed to stakeholders for feedback. Initial feedback was incorporated into the mock-ups which were then presented for discussion at a workshop comprising 15 attendees from across the specimen archiving community, CEH and the UK-EOF. 6. Workshop participants reviewed and agreed the format of 23 mandatory or optional data-entry fields for a virtual UK-ESB that, in the absence of standard for material samples and archives, were aligned with ISO 19115 (geospatial metadata standard) and DublinCore (metadata standard). These fields were sub-divided into the following headings: Sample description, Categorisation, keywords and links, Storage Information and Contact <b>information.</b> <b>Workshop</b> participants also made a number of recommendations as to the format of the data entry screens and inclusion of extra fields. 7. Workshop participants reviewed options for search capabilities and made recommendations as to simple and advanced searching methods and their formats. It was also recommended that search facilities of the ESBs of other countries be examined to determine what is used, ease of use, and how they match the recommendations from the workshop. 8. Workshop participants reviewed options for functionality and agreed a detailed list of prioritised requirements. 9. Workshop participants agreed that a virtual UK-ESB should be hosted through a dedicated website that would also provide wider information, such as recently updated or added specimen holdings, most downloaded information, links to other groups, standard operating procedures, etc. 10. The next step for the development of a virtual UK-ESB is to implement the design and development ideas captured in the current report and build a test version of a virtual UK-ESB. This would be tested and refined, and could then be launched on a specifically designed website. This would need to be accompanied by a communication strategy. There is potential to link and co-brand a virtual UK-ESB with the UK-Environmental Observation Framework (UK-EOF). ...|$|E
40|$|Those {{who have}} had even a passing {{acquaintance}} with the field of crop protection cannot fail to have been overwhelmed {{by the amount of}} information that exists on the subject. There is, for example, the basic information about the diagnostic characters and the biology of the virus, bacterium, fungus, weed, nematode or whatever. To this must be added information about the host, be it crop or noncrop, plant-cultural information, information about the basis of any resistance or tolerance of all the cultivars and so on. Then there is information about the pest's natural predators; about its occurrence world-wide, and about changes occurring in its distribution pattern; and there is information about the economic significance of the damage it causes. There is an equally vast amount of data regarding control measures: quarantine legislation, the methods of application of pesticides, their cost, effectiveness, availabilitv and safety. The task of collecting, processing, storing and distributing this vast amount of information is necessarily immense and complex. Is it being done efficiently? By the standards of today's most advanced information technologies, it is not. Modern technology has reached the stage where all the written text so far produced by mankind can be fitted on a single laser disc with an area of 2 square metres. And, while in 1978 it cost US$ 20 per page to store information electronically, it now costs only US$ 0. 016 per page; and the present cost will fall by 50 per cent over the next two years. Colour slides, as well as text, can also be stored electronically: 108, 000 can be fitted on a 1 2 -inch analog video disc, and a machine which can print these images now costs only US$ 2. 500. Although there are endless possibilities for utilizing these technologies in the service of plant protection, the priorities are not at all clear. In order to examine these possibilities further, CAB International, in association with FAO, organized an International Crop Protection <b>Information</b> <b>Workshop</b> at Wallingford, UK, from April 9 - 14. The Workshop was attended by 76 delegates from 32 countries. CTA supported this initiative in several ways: by serving on the Organizing Committee, by supporting a preparatory study on existing electronic databases and by supporting the attendance of seven ACP nationals at the Workshop itself. The Workshop's objectives were to review present systems of making crop protection information available to users (with an emphasis on the needs of developing countries); to identify deficiencies in present methods of disseminating crop protection information, and opportunities arising from new communication techniques; and, finally, to develop proposals to ensure that information reaches users in a timely and efficient manner It was evident that few information technologists have a broad experience of plant pathology in developing countries, and that relatively few plant pathologists are aware of the latest developments in computer technology. Both groups of specialists have much to learn from each other, though effective integration of their skills and needs will require a great deal more opportunity, resources and encouragement. The Workshop highlighted a wide range of key needs: to establish the level of relevance of information (site-specific to international); to establish its quality and to agree upon the appropriate level of organization of information; to determine appropriate levels of technology, which must be considered in relation to the cost of new proposals: and appropriate sources of funding must be considered, as must their timing. Even if we have been only marginally involved with these newtechnologies, it is easy to appreciate why some participants were concerned with the importance of compatibility and standardization of information systems. Among the more difficult areas discussed were the need to establish the relevance and utility of the 'grey literature'; to define 'economic importance' as precisely as possible, and to keep in mind linguistic considerations, especially with regard to quarantine procedures. At least one aspect received the consensus of all delegates: the need for international co-operation. Among delegates' priorities were the compilation of directories and inventories; the establishment of networks which would, for example, help to make grey literature available; the development of identification services, reference collections and training opportunities; and the need for newthesauri to avoid confusion in terminology. An international species occurrence system was proposed, as was the creation of Pesticide Information Resource Centres. Delegates also saw a need to standardize, validate and update pest distribution maps and to improve field survey and detection systems so as to obtain more field data and outbreak reports. The selection and distribution of information were seen as essential activities, and some delegates favoured a broadening of the literature covered by abstracting services. Integrated Pest Management should continue to be promoted, through support to a new or existing international entity. Finally, attention must be given to securing long-term funding forsuch activities. The Workshop was in broad agreement on three general recommendations: firstly that information systems and training should be actively pursued at national and international levels; secondly that positive action was needed to increase the awareness of policy makers to the strategic importance of crop protection information as an instrument in national planning and protection of natural resources, human health and the environment. Finally, donor agencies were urged to recognize the importance of ensuring that projects are not isolated from world information needs and that they include provision for full advantage to be taken of all appropriate information sources. New technologies can revolutionize delivery systems, but where to begin...|$|E
40|$|Research {{on policy}} {{implementation}} {{suggests that many}} education reforms designed {{to improve the quality}} of education in general have been more rhetorical than substantive in their impact on the organisation of schools and classrooms. Schools and classrooms do change, but the extent and directions of change are not always consistent with the intention of policy initiatives. This same argument applies to the South African education policy process, where a substantial body of literature has documented the gaps between the intention of policy makers (intended policy) and their implementation (implemented policy) in schools. The gap has been especially relevant for those policies focusing on the change of the knowledge, skills and competency levels of teachers through accountability and professional development policies. The purpose of this investigative and descriptive study originated in a hypothesis that the lack of orientation, knowledge sharing, understanding and the capacity building of teachers on policy intentions make it difficult for teachers to implement policies. I assumed therefore that through information and workshop sessions the gap between the policy intentions and the practice of teachers can be solved. In particular, my involvement in the drafting of the Developmental Appraisal System (DAS) policy gave me the sense that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the policy, but that the lack of capacity building among teachers is what is undermining the implementation of the policy in schools. The study therefore intended to investigate the impact of a five-day information session on the implementation process of the DAS policy at Cape Flats Secondary School (CFSS) – this is a pseudo name. These sessions were facilitated by me during the last semester of 2001. Thereafter, the school was given a year to implement the policy during 2002. Regular contact with the chairperson of the Staff Development Team (SDT) to ascertain the progress of implementation brought me to the realisation after eighteen months and still no implementation that the focus of my study had to change to understand the challenges of implementation at the school. As a member of the Policy Formulation team, I could not understand why a policy with such immense potential in enhancing professional development among teachers could not be implemented in a school where staff members publicly stated their commitment to implement the policy. This school (CFSS) in particular, had a high number of union leaders involved at numerous levels within the union who researched and developed the initial ideas and proposals of the DAS policy. The study is therefore guided by the following questions: 1. What made it difficult for the staff of Cape Flats Secondary School to implement the DAS policy, despite a high level of stated commitment to implement the policy and a thorough five-day information session (both theoretical and practical) on how to implement the policy? a) What was the expected level, scope or depth of the policy change, envisaged by policy formulators, necessary by the school to implement the policy? b) Which elements of the policy and the conditions at the school needed to be supported by implementation support agents (national, provincial and district officials) to facilitate the implementation at school level? and c) What was the level of functionality of the school to facilitate the successful implementation of this policy? This research explains how the different levels of functionality of schools affect the potential of implementation of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy. In particular, I reflect on the deliberations which inform the features of the DAS policy, during the policy formulation stage. I furthermore pay special attention to what interviewees called the ‘what was going on’ at the school, as if ‘outsiders’ don’t know what was going on in the school. The research therefore focuses on the functionality of the school through the lenses of ten school functionality components. Teachers at CFSS believe that policy makers do not understand and know what is going on at their school and therefore the effect, relevance and implementability of their policies are disconnected from the operational implementation contexts of schools. The data was collected over a period of six months. In this regard, I used multiple methods of data collection which include critical engagement with the entire staff through <b>information</b> <b>workshop</b> sessions, semi-structured interviews, critical engagements with the strategic liaison team, structured questionnaires, document analysis and photographic records. The main insights of the study include the following: [...] Policy makers have to re-assess and re-conceptualise the current policy making paradigm in operation in developing ‘professional’ policy; [...] The influence and power relations of employers and employee parties in the policy-making process must be re-assessed and re-conceptualised in order to clarify the policy-making process in South Africa; [...] The lack of systems (both technical and human), at different levels of education, makes it impossible to monitor and evaluate the effective and efficient implementation of the DAS policy; [...] Understanding schools as individual organisations with unique characteristics, is a key pre-requisite for developing policies that are aimed at addressing real problems at specific schools; [...] Leadership and management skills are seriously lacking at South African schools; [...] Educators should implement reform policies around clear performance standards and accountability expectations; [...] Intervention support agents should help schools make informed choices among a variety of implementation strategies; [...] Policy makers should allocate target funding to encourage adoption of proven change practice; [...] Policy makers should focus on schools that are ready for change with an expectation that many schools not ready for change this year may in the normal course of events become ready within a few years. The key insights of this research make this study unique and offer critical advice to policy makers. In particular, the re-organisation of the literature on policy-practice gaps (PPG) is insightful. The utilisation of both qualitative and quantitative data adds validity and reliability to the study. More importantly, the study shows that quantitative data can contribute towards understanding the policy implementation challenges in schools. Finally, my ‘insider’ experience of the policy-making process shares rare deliberations of what are the ‘trade-offs’ during the policy formulation stage.
