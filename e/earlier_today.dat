[...] Referring to damage caused by black bloc protesters downtown, he claimed that calling the attackers protesters was [...] "not fair {{to the people who}} came to [...] protest," [...] and that they were in fact [...] "criminals."

[...] The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website but the company did not respond to requests for comment. In March 2014, new tax filings from 2012 showed that Chick-fil-A had stopped funding all but one organization which had been previously criticized by LGBT activists and supporters. The company created a new foundation, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, to fund outside groups. WinShape Foundation's 2012 tax filings showed funding only for its own programs, a Berry College scholarship fund, and Lars WinShape, a home for needy children in Brazil.|$|E

50|$|MSNBC's First Look, which airs {{one hour}} after the initial 4:00 a.m. {{broadcast}} of <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time, is a repurposed version of the network newscast using the same anchors, weathercasters, and segments. Until 2013, the sports segment was produced from the Los Angeles studios of NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC, using either Fred Roggin or Mario Solis as anchors; the segment was recorded after that station's 11:00 p.m. Pacific Time newscast for later airing and to account for most West Coast sports results, but was aired without any differences on both First Look and <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> (the segment is now conducted live-to-tape during both programs from the newsroom at NBC Studios). Some segments seen on <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> are excluded from First Look, mainly the local weather cut-in (which does not appear at all on many NBC stations that broadcast <b>Early</b> <b>Today,</b> showing only a list of forecasts for seven randomly selected U.S. cities) and a local event barker featuring a promotion for an NBC affiliate serving the city where the event is being held (which was dropped from the NBC program in 2013), while {{a small number of}} stories seen on <b>Early</b> <b>Today</b> may not be seen on First Look.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek <b>earlier</b> <b>today</b> to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E
