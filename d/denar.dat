25|$|After {{the conquest}} of Egypt by Alexander the Great and the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture {{initiated}} by Ptolemy I Soter, Isis became known as Queen of Heaven. Other Mediterranean goddesses, such as Demeter, Astarte, and Aphrodite, became identified with Isis, as did the Arabian goddess Al-‘Uzzá through a similarity of name, since etymology was thought to reveal the essential or primordial nature of the thing named. An alabaster statue of Isis from the 3rd century BCE, found in Ohrid, in the Republic of Macedonia, is depicted on the obverse of the Macedonian 10 <b>denar</b> banknote, issued in 1996.|$|E

2500|$|In the Roman {{currency}} system, the dēnārius (pronunciation: [...] dēnāriī (pronunciation: [...] ) {{was a small}} silver coin first minted about 211 BC {{during the}} Second Punic War. It became the most common coin produced for circulation but was slowly debased in weight and silver content until its replacement by the double denarius, called the antoninianus, early in the 3rd century AD. The word dēnārius {{is derived from the}} Latin dēnī [...] "containing ten", as its value was 10 assēs, although {{in the middle of the}} 2nd century BC it was recalibrated so that it was now worth sixteen assēs or four sēstertiī. It is the origin of several modern words such as the currency name dinar; it is also the origin for the common noun for money in Italian [...] denaro, in Slovene <b>denar,</b> in Portuguese dinheiro, and in Spanish dinero. Its symbol is X̶; a letter x with stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{after the}} denarius {{was no longer}} {{regularly}} issued, it continued {{to be used as}} a unit of account, and the name was applied to later Roman coins in a way that is not understood. The Arabs who conquered large parts of the land that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire issued their own gold dinar. The lasting legacy of the denarius can be seen in the use of [...] "d" [...] as the abbreviation for the British penny before 1971. It survived in France as the name of a coin, the denier. The denarius also survives in the common Arabic name for a currency unit, the dinar used from pre-Islamic times, and still used in several modern Arabic-speaking nations. The major currency unit in former Principality of Serbia, Kingdom of Serbia and former Yugoslavia was dinar, and it is still used in present-day Serbia. The Macedonian currency <b>denar</b> is also derived from the Roman denarius. The Italian word denaro, the Spanish word dinero, the Portuguese word dinheiro, and the Slovene word , all meaning money, are also derived from Latin denarius.|$|E
