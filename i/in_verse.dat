5|$|The Bhagavad Gita, a {{discourse}} by the god Krishna in the Mahabharata, twice refers to Kamadhenu as Kamadhuk. <b>In</b> <b>verse</b> 3.10, Krishna makes {{a reference to}} Kamadhuk while conveying that for doing one's duty, one would get the milk of one's desires. <b>In</b> <b>verse</b> 10.28, when Krishna declares {{to the source of}} the universe, he proclaims that among cows, he is Kamadhuk.|$|E

5|$|Dramatic {{poetry is}} drama written <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, {{sometimes}} related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> {{dates to the}} 6th century B.C., {{and may have been}} an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the bianwen verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera. East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, Layla and Majnun and Khosrow and Shirin, Ferdowsi's tragedies such as Rostam and Sohrab, Rumi's Masnavi, Gorgani's tragedy of Vis and Ramin, and Vahshi's tragedy of Farhad.|$|E
5|$|Beyond heaven, in the heart, {{that which}} shines within, states Brahma <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> 3 of the Upanishad, is the {{destination}} {{of those who}} have understood the meaning of Vedanta doctrine.

The Upanishad says, seclusion is their place, enthroned is their joy, calm is their Yoga.|$|E
5|$|In Iceland, {{where the}} kings' sagas {{continued}} to be copied and studied, the battle exercised the imagination of several poets. A 15th century rímur cycle, Svöldrar rímur, chronicles the battle <b>in</b> <b>verse,</b> largely following the account of Oddr Snorrason. Two more rímur cycles on the same topic were composed in the 18th century, {{one of which is}} preserved. In the 19th century, the popular poet Sigurður Breiðfjörð composed yet another rímur cycle on the battle, based on the account in Mesta.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>verse</b> 11, {{the text}} makes a {{reference}} to a fragment from section 1.14 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, to metaphorically describe how to gain this knowledge.

5|$|Other poems may be {{organized}} into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by {{a collection of}} rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.

5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> survives, and {{may have}} been placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E

The verses 53 ― 101 are the refutation of the theory of bondage and salvation of the dualist Śaiva Siddhānta and <b>in</b> <b>verses</b> 102 ― 128, Abhinavaguptaʼs own view based on the non-dualist theology is given. <b>In</b> <b>verses</b> 53 ― 65, the malaparipāka（ripening of material impurity） theory is refuted. <b>In</b> <b>verses</b> 66 ― 96 ab, the karmasāmya（balance of two contrary karmans）theory is refuted.

5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing <b>in</b> <b>verse.</b> As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that during the Parthian period the court {{minstrel}} (gōsān) recited poetic oral literature accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> form, were not written down until the subsequent Sasanian period. In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was written down in the following centuries. It is believed that such stories as the romantic tale Vis and Rāmin and epic cycle of the Kayanian dynasty {{were part of the}} corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later. Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written Greek literature.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing {{continued}} in the Byzantine Empire, although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did. In place of the detailed inscriptions of Roman racing statistics, several short epigrams <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> were composed celebrating some of the more famous Byzantine Charioteers. The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius, Julianus of Tyre, Faustinus, his son, Constantinus, Uranius, and Porphyrius. Although Anastasius's single epigram reveals almost nothing about him, Porphyrius is much better known, having thirty-four known poems dedicated to him.|$|E

5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
5|$|Parallels {{have been}} pointed out between Njörðr and the figure of Hadingus, attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' 13th century work Gesta Danorum. Some of these {{similarities}} include that, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál, Hadingus is chosen by his wife Regnhild after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs, and, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning, Hadingus complains <b>in</b> <b>verse</b> of his displeasure at his life away from the sea and how he is disturbed by the howls of wolves, while his wife Regnhild complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds. Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis, before ending as an Odinic hero, paralleling Njörðr's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir-Vanir War.|$|E
