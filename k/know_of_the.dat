5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E

5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine. The first the recipients would <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered that they did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} use {{of slavery}} was in agriculture, {{the foundation of}} the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.|$|E

5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{split into two}} blocks: A and B. Block A was sited near Lime Grove and housed {{personnel}} accommodation and administrative services, while Block B was protected by brick walls and military police since it contained the codebreaking computers. The public footpath passed between the two blocks. The level of security meant that support staff in the administrative block did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activities in Block B, nor did local residents.|$|E
5|$|After being {{contacted}} by Dean, Castiel, now wearing a new suit and trenchcoat and driving a stolen car {{as he can}} no longer teleport, returns to the bunker where he comes up with the plan to have Crowley help expel Gadreel from Sam. Castiel knocks Gadreel out and comforts Dean when the torture they have Crowley perform to bring forth Sam's mind proves too much for Dean. Castiel is furious to learn that it is Gadreel, blaming him for all the evil in the universe, but Dean calms him down. When Gadreel proves resistant to their efforts to expel him, Dean tries to have Castiel possess Sam to let him <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation but he can't without Sam's permission. Crowley agrees to do it instead in exchange for his freedom and though Castiel is reluctant, he removes Sam's anti-possession tattoo. The plan works and Sam expels Gadreel. After leaving Crowley to deal with Abaddon, Castiel heals Sam's injuries from the torture and informs him he can finish his healing from the Trials over time as Gadreel did most of the job. He remains behind with Sam as Dean leaves on his own.|$|E

He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry, who was Cunard's good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier. Cunard offered Parry a fortnightly service beginning in May 1840. While Cunard did not then own a steamship, {{he had been an}} investor in an earlier steamship venture, Royal William, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard's major backer was Robert Napier whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy's supplier of steam engines. He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political leaders at the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Devagiri, Shiva comes to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treacherous wars that the Chandravanshis are {{carrying}} on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and {{the royal family}} on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|In his 1877 {{monograph}} on North American rodents, Elliott Coues mentioned two {{specimens of}} Oryzomys from Jamaica in {{the collections of}} the United States National Museum (USNM). According to Coues, the specimens were similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) of the United States, but different in color. Although he wrote that they probably represented a separate form, he refrained from giving a scientific name to them because {{of the possibility that}} the form had already received a name he did not <b>know</b> <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> species was first formally described by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 based on a specimen that had been in the British Museum of Natural History since 1845. He recognized it as a separate species of Oryzomys, Oryzomys antillarum, but wrote that it was related to the mainland Central American O.couesi. Thomas suspected that the species was already extinct on Jamaica, but that it or a similar rice rat could still be found in the unexplored interior of Cuba or Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|Ramsay's request {{arrived at}} RAF Kenley. Two {{experienced}} pilots, Group Captain Francis Victor Beamish (10 victories) and Wing Commander Finlay Boyd (14 victories), were sent on patrol to investigate. Flying over the channel in Spitfires, {{they ran into}} large numbers of Bf 109s protecting a large fleet of warships and dived away. Holding radio silence they kept their discovery until they landed. They sighted the ships at 10:42 and landed at 11:09. It was another 16 minutes before Bomber Command was alerted and Ramsay did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation until 11:30. Soon afterwards, at around 12:16 GMT, the first naval actions began between escorting Schnellboots and British Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) and the British were alerted. Galland ordered all low flying to cease and allowed Max Ibel and his team aboard Scharnhorst to break radio silence. Ibel then began directing Fw 190 and Bf 109s toward RAF units heading to the area. As luck would have it, as the first outnumbered British units entered the airspace over the ships, the German vessels were now at their closest point to German airfields. It allowed the Luftwaffe to offer maximum protection.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E
