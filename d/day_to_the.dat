5|$|Armed Serbs burnt Croat-owned {{houses in}} the village of Cerovljani, just to the north of Hrvatska Dubica, on 13 September and once more on 21 September. Three days later, the gunmen {{returned}} and after some shooting, three civilians were found dead and four more houses were torched in the village. The same day, the Catholic church bell tower was shot at using rocket-propelled grenades. In October, the armed Serbs gathered ten out of eleven remaining Cerovljani residents in the village's community centre, telling them they were {{to take part in a}} meeting. Instead, they were detained for the night and shipped away the next <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Krečane area next to the village of Baćin, just to the west of Hrvatska Dubica and killed there. Approximately 30 elderly civilians remained in Baćin after SAO Krajina forces captured the village. All of them were taken to Krečane and killed in October as well, except for three men who were detained and killed in Hrvatska Dubica.|$|E

5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E

5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months.

One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal means of access.|$|E
5|$|The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), is a {{subsidiary}} of Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), established 23 April 1978 under the Development of Cities Act 1976. 2015 estimates indicate that WASA provides about 72% of the city's sewerage services and about 60% of their water services. The existing production capacity of WASA is , almost {{all of which is}} drawn from wells located in the old beds of the Chenab River.

5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E

Hershey lost the next <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Penguins, falling 2–1 in overtime after allowing a power play goal with 10.8 seconds left in overtime. In a 3–2 shootout win against the Lake Erie Monsters on February 5, Sabourin made 35 saves and the Bears killed seven power plays. They also defeated Binghamton 4–3 on February 9, scoring on two of eight power plays, better than their 1-for-11 power play record going into the game. Hershey lost 4–3 in a shootout against Norfolk on February 10, despite scoring three goals in the third period. Potulny made two of the goals, including the last with 34.4 seconds in regulation, marking his second multi-goal game of the season. Stoa also scored his second two-goal game of the season in the Bears' subsequent 4–3 loss against Norfolk on February 10, which marked the team's third consecutive shootout loss.|$|E

5|$|In Punjab, the CID, {{although}} {{aware of}} possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915. A dedicated force was formed, {{headed by the}} Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan (later head of Punjab CID himself). In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan. Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment. Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able {{to pass on the}} information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence. As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the mutiny <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day. No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Hayat Khan of the change of plans. Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to escape under the cover of answering the call of nature.|$|E
5|$|In early January2016, a {{stationary}} front was draped across the western Caribbean; a non-tropical low developed along this boundary over northwestern Cuba by January6. Moving northeast {{ahead of the}} subtropical jet stream, the system acquired a surface vortex the following <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast of the Bahamas. Initial conditions, including strong wind shear, low sea surface temperatures, and dry air, inhibited formation of a tropical cyclone as the storm moved northeast toward Bermuda. The large system featured gale-force winds, with maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h). On January8, the system passed about 75mi (120km) north of Bermuda, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the islands. On January9, an anomalous blocking pattern prevented the cyclone from continuing along a seasonal northeasterly track. Instead, the storm turned east-southeast into a region slightly more favorable for subtropical development. Hurricane-force winds developed around {{the core of the}} cyclone on January10 as it deepened to 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg), though convective activity near the center remained sparse. Separated from the jet stream, the cyclone dove south-southeast over the central Atlantic around a mid-latitude trough. Slight weakening took place on January11.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1861, {{three days}} after Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers to serve in putting down the insurrection. The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the {{existing}} regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from Acton, one from Groton, two from Lawrence, and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston. That night, {{the men of the}} 6th Massachusetts barracked in Faneuil and Boylston Halls. The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from Stoneham, and another from Worcester) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total. Thus comprised entirely of existing volunteer militia companies, the 6th Massachusetts was made up of volunteer soldiers. The regiment proceed that <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> State House, where Governor Andrew presented regimental colors to Colonel Jones. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston for Washington via railroad at 7 p.m. on April 17.|$|E
