40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards.

500|$|Romanek {{described}} {{working with}} child actors and [...] "knowing {{that the first}} act of the film was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried by 12-year-olds" [...] as probably the most difficult aspect of making the film. He said {{that most of the}} rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would be good. At rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then mix and match the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy). He also had them spend time together doing things like playing and talking. He took them to the school location and let them play games together so they could get a better idea of the layout of the place.|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest with her.|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to cut my movie? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fire me! You want to fire me? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|R

Finally, Kennedy warned of the risks of [...] "a subsequent assimilation within the Conservative fold", adding: [...] "David Cameron has been here often before: from the early days of his leadership he was happy to describe himself as a 'liberal Conservative'.

2500|$|Entering operation, the {{problems}} continued. The braking system {{had been designed}} to be fully automated, but was now being operated by manual control, and the brakes were being over-applied. This led to problems with the wheels being rubbed flat in spots when the brakes were applied too strongly, producing buzzing noises when running at speed. Since the vehicles were brand-new, the TTC {{did not have a}} machine capable of grinding the small-diameter wheels, and one had to be purchased for $1.5 million. Another $250,000 was needed for a rail grinder to remove [...] "totally unexpected rail corrugations".

2500|$|In {{response}} to Huntington's {{position on the}} functional imperative, Janowitz concluded that in the new nuclear age, the United States was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to deliver both strategic deterrence {{and an ability to}} participate in limited wars. Such a regime, new in American history, was going to require a new military self-conception, the constabulary concept: [...] "The military establishment becomes a constabulary force when it is continuously prepared to act, committed to the minimum use of force, and seeks viable international relations, rather than victory..." [...] Under this new concept of the military establishment, distinctions between war and peace are more difficult to draw. The military, instead of viewing itself as a fire company to be called out in emergency, would then be required to imagine itself in the role of a police force, albeit on the international level rather than domestically. The role of the civilian elite would be to interact closely with the military elite so as to ensure a new and higher standard of professional military education, one that would ensure that military professionals were more closely attuned to the ideals and norms of civilian society.|$|E
