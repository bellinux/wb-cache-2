Increasing <b>interconnect</b> <b>densities</b> imply a signi#cant increase in coupling capacitance as a fraction of self-capacitance. Faster clock rates imply faster on-chip slew times.

40|$|Abstract. As {{processor}} speeds rapidly {{approach the}} Giga-Hertz regime, {{the disparity between}} process time and memory access time plays an increasing role in the overall limitation of processor performance. In addition, limitations in <b>interconnect</b> <b>density</b> and bandwidth serve to exacerbate current bottlenecks, particularly as computer architectures continue to reduce in size. To address these issues, we propose a 3 D architecture based on through-wafer vertical optical interconnects. To facilitate integration into the current manufacturing infrastructure, our system is monolithically fabricated in the Silicon substrate and preserves scale of integration by using meso-scopic diffractive optical elements (DOEs) for beam routing and fan-out.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of chip to chip <b>interconnect</b> <b>density,</b> speed, {{and the demand for}} smaller and more {{portable}} devices has taken signal integrity engineers to the limits of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design. Special care has to be taken in the design stage to guarantee that noise specifications are met and power specifications and geometry of the links ensure minimal crosstalk noise in the system. In parallel links, specific parameters of layout geometry are dictated during the design stage to meet noise requirements, generally increasing the space between channels to minimize crosstalk noise. This step determines and fixes the characteristic impedance of the lines and the allowed crosstalk among them; once they are set up, not much freedom is given to the interconnect designers to vary them for a specific application or environment. Given that design planning is done to ensure that all specifications are met in the worst case scenario, this lack of layout freedom leads to a waste of space in high speed systems.

Elastic chip sockets and single elastic micro-bump contacts of different shapes and sizes were manufactured and characterized. The contact resistance measurements revealed that the elastic micro-bump contacts manufactured by using the developed methods require less than one tenth of the contact force to achieve the same low contact resistance as compared to commercial elastic interconnection structures. The analysis and measurements of the high frequency properties of the elastic micro-bump structures have shown that they can operate up to several tens of GHz without a serious degradation of the signal quality. The same methods were applied to manufacture very high density contact area array (approximately 80000 connections/cm 2), which until now was achieved only using so called chip-first techniques. The low contact resistance, the absence of environmentally harmful materials, no need of soldering, easy rework as well as capability of very high <b>interconnecting</b> <b>density</b> and very high frequency compatibility, indicates a high potential of this technique for assembly and packaging.
