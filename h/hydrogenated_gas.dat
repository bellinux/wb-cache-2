40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulations {{have been}} performed to investigate the mechanical properties of hydrogen functionalized graphene allotropes (GAs) for H-coverage spanning the entire range (0 - 100 %). Four allotropes (graphyne, cyclic graphene, octagonal graphene, and biphenylene) with larger unit lattice size than graphene are considered. The effect {{of the degree of}} functionalization and molecular structure on the Young's modulus and strength are investigated, and the failure processes of some new GAs are reported for the first time. We show that the mechanical properties of the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>GAs</b> deteriorate drastically with increasing H-coverage within the sensitive threshold, beyond which the mechanical properties remain insensitive to the increase in H-coverage. This drastic deterioration arises both from the conversion of sp 2 to sp 3 bonding and easy rotation of unsupported sp 3 bonds. Allotropes with different lattice structures correspond to different sensitive thresholds. The Young's moduli deterioration of fully hydrogenated allotropes can be up to 70 % smaller than that of the corresponding pristine structure. Moreover the tensile strength shows an even larger drop of about 90 % and higher sensitivity to H-coverage even if it is small. Our results suggest that the unique coverage-dependent deterioration of the mechanical properties {{must be taken into account}} when analyzing the performance characteristics of nanodevices fabricated from functionalized GAs.

40|$|Diamondlike carbon (DLC) {{films have}} {{attracted}} {{great interest in}} recent years mainly because of their unusual optical, electrical, mechanical, and tribological properties. Such properties are currently being exploited {{for a wide range}} of engineering applications including magnetic hard disks, gears, sliding and roller bearings, scratch resistant glasses, biomedical implants, etc. Systematic studies on carbon-based materials in our laboratory have led to the development of a new class of amorphous DLC films that provide extremely low friction and wear coefficients of 0. 001 to 0. 005 and 10 {sup - 11 } to 10 {sup - 10 } mm{sup 3 } /N. m, respectively, when tested in inert-gas or high-vacuum environments. These films were produced in highly <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>gas</b> discharge plasmas by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process at room temperature. The carbon source gases used in the deposition of these films included methane, acetylene, and ethylene. Tribological studies in our laboratory have established a very close correlation between the composition of the plasmas and the friction and wear coefficients of the resultant DLC films. Specifically, the friction and wear coefficients of DLC films grown in plasmas with higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratios were much lower than films derived from source gases with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios. Fundamental tribological and surface analytical studies have led us to conclude that hydrogen (within the film, as well as on the sliding surfaces) is extremely important for the superlubricity and wearless sliding behavior of these films. Based on these studies, a mechanistic model is proposed to explain the superlow friction and wear properties of the new DLC films...|$|E

The stoichiometry of the hydrogenated sample {{was found to}} be Ti 3 AlH 4. 76. From X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements it was found that there were two different hydride phases with fcc and hcp crystal structures. By differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and XRD measurements the decomposition temperatures of the two hydride phases were identified. It was found that the hexagonal hydride phase is more stable compared to the cubic hydride phase. The decomposition kinetics of the hydride phases were analyzed using the DSC data and the decomposition mechanism and the kinetic parameters were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis {{gasoline}} - PYGAS - is {{an intermediate}} boiling product of naphtha steam cracking {{with a high}} octane number and high aromatic/unsaturated contents. Due to stabilization concerns, PYGAS must be hydrotreated in two stages. The first stage uses a mild trickle-bed conversion for removing extremely reactive species (styrene, dienes and olefins) prior to the more severe second stage where sulfured and remaining olefins are <b>hydrogenated</b> in <b>gas</b> phase. This work addresses the reaction network and two-phase kinetic model for {{the first stage of}} PYGAS upgrading. Nonlinear estimation was used for model tuning with kinetic data obtained in bench-scale trickle-bed hydrogenation with a commercial Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. On-line sampling experiments were designed to study the influence of variables - temperature and spatial velocity - on the conversion of styrene, dienes and olefins...|$|R
40|$|A {{monitoring}} programme for halogenated climate-altering gases {{has been established}} in the frame of the SHARE EV-K 2 -CNR project at the Nepal Climate Laboratory - Pyramid in the Himalayan range at the altitude of 5079 m a. s. l. The site is very well located to provide important insights on changes in atmospheric composition in a region that is of great significance for emissions of both anthropogenic and biogenic halogenated compounds. Measurements are performed since March 2006, with grab samples collected on a weekly basis. The first three years of data have been analysed. After the identification of the atmospheric background values for fourteen halocarbons, the frequency of occurrence of pollution events have been compared {{with the same kind of}} analysis for data collected at other global background stations. The analysis showed the fully halogenated species, whose production and consumption are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, show a significant occurrence of "above the baseline" values, as a consequence of their current use in the developing countries surrounding the region, meanwhile the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>gases,</b> more recently introduced into the market, show less frequent spikes. Atmospheric concentration trends have been calculated as well, and they showed a fast increase, ranging from 5. 7 to 12. 6 %, of all the hydrogenated species, and a clear decrease of methyl chloroform (- 17. 7 %). The comparison with time series from other stations has also allowed to derive Meridional gradients, which are absent for long living well mixed species, while for the more reactive species, the gradient increases inversely with respect to their atmospheric lifetime. The effect of long range transport and of local events on the atmospheric composition at the station has been analysed as well, allowing the identification of relevant source regions the Northern half of the Indian sub-continent. Also, at finer spatial scales, a smaller, local contribution of forest fires from the Khumbu valley has been detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} and hydrogenation of ketopantolactone (KPL) and ethyl pyruvate (EP) on Pt electrodes, {{measured by}} surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, are compared. In addition, pure samples of self-condensation products of ethyl pyruvate including a dimer (in both linear and cyclized forms) and a lactone have been synthesized. These dimeric and aldol condensation intermediates have previously been proposed by ourselves as playing {{a crucial role}} in explaining the significant rate enhancement observed during enantioselective hydrogenation of α-ketoesters at supported platinum catalysts. The adsorption of the linear dimer at platinum leads to cyclization. At hydrogen evolving potentials in dimer-free aqueous sulfuric acid, the dimer may be hydrogenatively desorbed readily from the electrode surface. KPL is found to accumulate at the electrode surface under hydrogen evolving conditions. From comparison with the behavior of EP under similar hydrogenating conditions, it is deduced that self-condensed dimers do not form when EP is being either <b>hydrogenated</b> using <b>gas</b> phase hydrogen or electrocatalytically hydrogenated in aqueous sulfuric acid. In addition, unlike EP, KPL does not form a long-lived half-hydrogenated state surface intermediate, a significant contributory factor in rate enhancement observed when EP is hydrogenated at supported platinum catalysts. Hence, the role of cinchona alkaloids in establishing rate acceleration cannot be ascribed simply to a destabilization of self-condensation products of ethyl pyruvate under reaction conditions. Models to explain the relative degrees of rate acceleration in KPL and EP are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research project was to further develop a computer program modeling the hydrocracking of partially <b>hydrogenated</b> vacuum <b>gas</b> oil (HVGO), {{and to use the}} model to compare the theoretical product distribution to experimental data describing the product distribution of an industrial pilot reactor. The hydrocracking of HVGO on acid zeolites is effectively modeled utilizing a single-event kinetic approach developed by Froment and coworkers. The hydrocracking of HVGO can be described in terms of the fundamental reaction steps involving carbenium ions. Some 45 single-event rate parameters are used to dictate the rate of each single-event in the reaction network. The composition of the partially hydrogenated feed stock is detailed up to C 33. Each component and lump is considered in terms of the elementary steps to generate a network of continuity equations and single-event rate parameters. A reactor model comprising this kinetic model can be used to simulate the isothermal and nonisothermal hydrocracking of a HVGO feed stock. The results are represented in terms of the yields of 241 lumps and components in the gas phase and 241 components and lumps in the liquid phase. The predicted yields of various commercial oil fractions and particular components are then compared to experimental data from an industrial pilot reactor to verify the accuracy of the model and the single-event rate parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry is challenged with {{the processing of}} present heavy crudes caused by high composition of sulfur and metals, which lead to a higher yield of unfavorable bottom product as vacuum residue. Vacuum residue is the least valuable fraction of four, such as saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. However, it can be upgraded to recover more valuable products such as light hydrocarbons. The Delayed Coking process {{is going to be}} used to transform the vacuum residue at different experimental conditions. First of all, the behavior of the vacuum residue needs to be analyzed with no additions in feedstock. Secondly, the vacuum residue can be mixed with unhydrogenated and <b>hydrogenated</b> light <b>gas</b> oil at different concentrations. Finally, the addition of different catalysts at various concentrations could be another method to achieve high yield of the desired product. Expected experimental conditions are 475 oC for reactor temperature and bimetallic or trimetallic catalysts for the delayed coking process. In this research, 3 different catalysts will be tested in several proportions with respect to the weight of the feedstock material. The recommended feed concentration of light gas oil depends on the molecular structure of the vacuum residue and can be determined only by actual experiment. Based on these experimental conditions, a conclusion about the yield of the light hydrocarbons and ways to improving the process can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and hydrogenation of polynorbornenes with functionalized imide side groups, specifically, poly(N-phenyl-exo,endo-norbornene- 5, 6 -dicarboximide), {{as well as}} the sulfonation of the <b>hydrogenated</b> polymer. The <b>gas</b> transport characteristics and permselectivity of membranes prepared from the three separated polymers were thoroughly investigated. The results show that hydrogenation of the starting polymer promotes packaging efficiency, which is even enhanced by further sulfonation of the hydrogenated chains. The economy of free volume is reflected in the permeation and permselectivity coefficients of membranes prepared from the polymers. The study of electromotive forces of concentration cells with the sulfonated membrane separating hydrochloric solutions of different concentration suggests that the membranes exhibit high permselectivity to protons that decreases as concentration increases. However, a sharp increase in the electromotive force occurs at high concentrations. The fact that this increase is not observed in the electromotive forces of concentration cells with sodium chloride in the compartment cells suggests the formation of pair ions between protonated imide groups and chloride ions at high concentration that restrains co-ions mobility in the membrane. The membranes exhibit pretty good permselectivity to protons and sodium ions which makes them useful for ionic separation applications, such as electrodialysis. However, owing to the low water uptake, the protonic conductivity of the membranes equilibrated with water is nearly 2 orders of magnitude below that reported for Nafion membranesWe thank Dr. T.
