50|$|Polymerization of {{tetrafluoroethylene}} produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymers such as Teflon and Fluon. PTFE {{is one of}} the two {{fluorocarbon resins}} composed wholly of fluorine and carbon. The other resin composed purely of carbon and fluorine is the copolymer of TFE with typically 6-9% hexafluoropropene (HFP), which is known as FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer). TFE is also used in the preparation of numerous copolymers that also include hydrogen and/or oxygen, including both <b>fluoroplastics</b> and fluoroelastomers. Typical TFE-based <b>fluoroplastics</b> include ETFE, the alternating 1:1 copolymer with ethylene, and PFA, which is a random copolymer similar to FEP but with a minor amount of a perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PAVE) rather than HFP. DuPont uses primarily perfluoro(methylvinylether), whereas Daikin uses primarily perfluoro(propylvinylether) in manufacturing PFA. There are numerous other fluoropolymers that contain tetrafluoroethylene, but usually not at greater than 50% by weight.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} <b>fluoroplastics</b> other than perfluorinated. Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF, structural unit: -CF2CH2-), is an analog of PTFE {{with half the}} fluorines. PVF (polyvinyl fluoride, structural unit: -CH2CHF-) contains one one-fourth the fluorines of PTFE. Despite this, it still has many properties of more fluorinated compounds. PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene, structural unit: -CF2CFCl-) is another important compound. It differs from PTFE by having a quarter of fluorine replaced with chlorines, yet this difference brings even greater hardness, creep resistance, and moisture persistence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{placement}} of tubes {{is not a}} cure. If middle ear disease has been severe or prolonged enough to justify tube placement, {{there is a strong}} possibility that the child will continue to have episodes of middle ear inflammation or fluid collection. There may be early drainage through the tube (tube otorrhea) in about 15% of patients in the first two weeks after placement, and developing in 25% more than three months after insertion, although usually not a longterm problem. [...] Otorrhea is considered to be secondary to bacterial colonization. The most commonly isolated organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most troublesome is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Some practitioners use topical antibiotic drops in the postoperative period, but research shows that this practice does not eradicate the bacterial biofilm. [...] A laboratory study showed that tubes covered in the antibiotic vancomycin prevented in-vitro formation of MRSA biofilm as compared to noncoated ones, although no study has been conducted on humans yet. Comparing phosphorylcholine-coated <b>fluoroplastic</b> tympanostomy tubes to uncoated <b>fluoroplastic</b> tympanostomy tubes showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of post-operative otorrhea, tube blockage, or extrusion.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>fluoroplastic</b> is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, DuPont brand Teflon), {{which is}} a simple linear chain polymer with the repeating structural unit:-CF2-. PTFE has a backbone of carbons single bonded in a long chain, with all side bonds to fluorines. It contains no hydrogens and {{can be thought of}} as the perfluoro analog of polyethylene (structural unit: -CH2-). PTFE has high chemical and thermal stability, as expected for a perfluorocarbon, much stronger than polyethylene. Its resistance to van der Waals forces makes PTFE the only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. The compound, however, lacks an ability to transform upon melting, which is not a problem for various PTFE deratives, namely FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene, with some fluorines replaced with the-CF3 group) or PFA (perfluoroalkoxy, some fluorines replaced with -OCF3). They share most properties with PTFE, but there are still differences, namely maximum usage temperature (highest for the non-flexible PTFE).|$|E
50|$|The {{general design}} of voice {{prosthesis}} is quite consistent, {{even though there}} are unique characteristics. A voice prosthesis has retaining flanges at each end, the ‘tracheal flange’ and ‘esophageal flange’. Those flanges can vary in size and rigidity, e.g. indwelling prostheses have larger and more rigid flanges for stability and facilitate long-term placement. The flange near the food pipe (esophageal flange) is more rigid than the tracheal flange, near the windpipe. The one-way valve can be molded in one piece with the prosthesis and is often supported by a <b>fluoroplastic</b> valve seat (a colored ring that is tightly secured into the shaft of the prosthesis, adding rigidity and which is radiopaque). All voice prostheses have a safety strap, which is cut off in indwelling devices after the prosthesis is put in place; in non-indwelling devices the strap is not removed and is taped to the neck. A voice prosthesis has a one-way valve near the esophageal flange that enables pulmonary air to pass into the esophagus and pharynx for sound production and prevents content from the food pipe, such as liquids or saliva, from entering the trachea.|$|E

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] this work, {{a new generation of}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coatings based on polytetrafluoro-ethylene amorphous <b>fluoroplastics</b> (PTFE AF 2400) as a particle binder is presented. The developed coating was tested for thermal and solvent-assisted desorption, demonstrating its compatibility with both gas- and liquid-chromatographic platforms. The incorporation of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) adsorptive particles provided optimal extraction coverage for analytes bearing a broad range of hydrophobicities and molecular weights and of varied chemical diversity. The performance of the newly developed coating was compared to already established coatings based on different polymers such as divinylb enzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/Car/ PDMS) and octadecyl/benzenesulfonic acid/polyacrylonitrile (C 18 /SCX/PAN) in order to assess the new prototype versus the existing technology. As this is the first documented instance of PTFE AF being used as a particle immobilizer for SPME, an assessment of the analyte uptake rate and extraction capability of the developed coating was carried out in comparison to other conventionally used polymers. Moreover, the new SPME probes were used to validate an analytical method for deteimination of banned doping substances, achieving limits of quantitation below the minimum required performance limits (MRPLs) set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for most compounds. Considering the broad coverage of the coating in terms of analytes extracted and its suitability for both thermal- and solvent assisted desorption, these new SPME probes will properly suit various metabolomics applications that involve the use of both gas- and liquid-chromatography...|$|R
40|$|Specially {{designed}} liquid-core {{optical fiber}} can convey light with demand wavelength and analytes {{in the same}} pathway according to {{the application of the}} fiber. Water {{is one of the most}} useful and common core fluid due to its non- toxicity and other practical optical properties, and which makes water core optical fiber advantageous for biomedical sensing, optical imaging, non-linear optics and optical transmission. Since the numerical aperture of the liquid core fiber is not able to approach to an infinite small value, thus it is necessary to use expensive solid state lens to couple light into or out of the liquid core fiber. In this paper, we have demonstrated a unique method to fabricate water-core lensed fibers by filling light water and heavy water respectively into hollow Teflon-Amorphous <b>Fluoroplastics</b> fibers, and to control the focal length and the spot size by pumping water into or out of the fiber end. By simulation, the focal length over the range of f = 3. 87 - 1. 33 mm has been demonstrated using the distilled water, and f = 4. 95 - 1. 38 mm using the heavy water. To further reduce the focal length, we have limited the lens aperture by the fiber core and have demonstrated a focal length over f = 0. 34 - 0. 27 mm in response to the change of the heavy water lens volume from 0. 68 to 1. 54 nL. Further simulation shows that the focused spot size can be reduced to 2 - 6 μm by adjusting the refractive index and fiber geometry. Compared to other optical focusing methods, such lensed fiber and the tuning of its focal length are far easier to make at a much lower cost. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} past, ongoing, {{and short}} (to 2010) and medium-term (to 2030) future actions {{that can be}} taken to mitigate GHG emissions from the manufacturing and process industries. Globally, and in most countries, CO{sub 2 } accounts for more than 90 % of CO{sub 2 }-eq GHG emissions from the industrial sector (Price et al., 2006; US EPA, 2006 b). These CO{sub 2 } emissions arise from three sources: (1) the use of fossil fuels for energy, either directly by industry for heat and power generation or indirectly in the generation of purchased electricity and steam; (2) non-energy uses of fossil fuels in chemical processing and metal smelting; and (3) non-fossil fuel sources, for example cement and lime manufacture. Industrial processes also emit other GHGs, e. g. : (1) Nitrous oxide (N{sub 2 }O) is emitted as a byproduct of adipic acid, nitric acid and caprolactam production; (2) HFC- 23 is emitted as a byproduct of HCFC- 22 production, a refrigerant, and also used in <b>fluoroplastics</b> manufacture; (3) Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are emitted as byproducts of aluminium smelting and in semiconductor manufacture; (4) Sulphur hexafluoride (SF{sub 6 }) is emitted in the manufacture, use and, decommissioning of gas insulated electrical switchgear, during the production of flat screen panels and semiconductors, from magnesium die casting and other industrial applications; (5) Methane (CH{sub 4 }) is emitted as a byproduct of some chemical processes; and (6) CH{sub 4 } and N{sub 2 }O can be emitted by food industry waste streams. Many GHG emission mitigation options have been developed for the industrial sector. They fall into three categories: operating procedures, sector-wide technologies and process-specific technologies. A sampling of these options is discussed in Sections 7. 2 - 7. 4. The short- and medium-term potential for and cost of all classes of options are discussed in Section 7. 5, barriers to the application of these options are addressed in Section 7. 6 and the implication of industrial mitigation for sustainable development is discussed in Section 7. 7. Section 7. 8 discusses the sector's vulnerability to climate change and options for adaptation. A number of policies have been designed either to encourage voluntary GHG emission reductions from the industrial sector or to mandate such reductions. Section 7. 9 describes these policies and the experience gained to date. Co-benefits of reducing GHG emissions from the industrial sector are discussed in Section 7. 10. Development of new technology is key to the cost-effective control of industrial GHG emissions. Section 7. 11 discusses research, development, deployment and diffusion in the industrial sector and Section 7. 12, the long-term (post- 2030) technologies for GHG emissions reduction from the industrial sector.

Under influence of mechanomagnetochemical activation doxorubicin, which is diamagnetic, acquires the properties of paramagnetic without changing g-factors in the spectra of electron paramagnetic resonance. Mechanomagnetochemical activation of doxorubicin satisfies pharmacopoeia condi tions according to the results of liquid chromatography that points on perspective of this method using in technology of tumor therapy with nanosized structures and external electromagnetic radiation...|$|E
30|$|In this work, {{we studied}} a {{nanocomposite}} material made from <b>fluoroplastic</b> which contains 20  wt.% multi-walled nanotubes. In order {{to complete the}} present work, we have used different thermodynamic and mechanical techniques. The introduction of nanotubes in the F 4 polymer matrix has completely changed the tribological and thermodynamic properties of the studied nanocomposite material. The compression strength becomes 20 % {{higher than that of}} the F 4 polymer matrix. Meanwhile the wear resistance achieves an order of magnitude 100 times greaterthan that of F 4. Moreover, a friction coefficient is about 25 % to 30 % lower than that of a similar material and especially that of F 4 material. Differential scanning calorimetric study showed that the glassy phase transition appears at about 330 °C, which confirms that the degradation of the studied nanocomposite occurs at relatively higher temperature. This result confirms the one concerning the change in tribological properties. Dilatometric study revealed that the thermal expansion coefficient has been increased. The observed relative elongation measurement change depends on the direction along which the measurement has been done and confirms, in turn, the anisotropic character of the studied material. These results suggest that the metallic materials could be replaced by nanocomposite compounds which present good physical properties.|$|E
