PNH {{has been associated with}} various hematological disorders. Using a newly introduced method, the Sephacryl gel test microtyping system, we investigated the presence of CD 55 or CD 59 defective red cell populations in several hematological disorders.

40|$|Background: Vitamin A {{deficiency}} is {{an important}} dietary deficiency in the world. Thus, the ne-cessity of screening for <b>deficient</b> <b>populations</b> is obvious. This paper introduces a fast, cheap and relatively reliable method called “dried blood spot” (DBS) method in screening the <b>deficient</b> <b>populations.</b> The validity of this method for retinol measurement was investigated. Method: The “precision” and “agreement” criteria of the DBS method were assessed. The preci-sion was calculated and {{compared with those of}} plasma using F-test. The agreement was eva-luated using Bland-Altman plot. Results: The imprecision of retinol measurements in dried spots was not significantly {{different from those of the}} control (plasma). A good correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0. 78) was obtained for dried spots’ retinol measurements versus plasma’s retinol analysis (P < 0. 01). Paired t-test showed no significant difference between the DBS and retinol methods on a group level. Imprecision of DBS measurement was acceptable, compared to that of the plasma method. The difference be-tween these two methods was not statistically significant on a group level. Conclusion: Application of DBS standard samples, in which a part of the plasma was replaced with the artificial plasma, was shown to be a reliable calibration mean for retinol measurements in DBS samples. Retinol in dried spots was stable for 90 days. Overall, the DBS method provided a precise measurement of retinol, showing results that were comparable with the measurement of retinol in plasma...|$|R

50|$|The {{reason for}} the {{increased}} infection rate in vitamin A <b>deficient</b> <b>populations</b> {{is due to the}} T-killer cells which require retinoids to proliferate correctly (Athanassiades1981). Retinoic acid binds the promoter region of specific genes and so activates the transcription process and therefore cell replication (Baron 1981). A vitamin A deficient diet will have a very limited surplus of retinol and so cell proliferation and replication will be suppressed, contributing to a reduced number of T-cells and lymphocytes. Suppression of these will result in a lack of immune reaction if pathogens become present in the body and consequently a greater susceptibility to incubation of disease.|$|R

Epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between blood selenium and prostate cancer incidence. However, to our knowledge no study to date has examined selenium absorption by the prostate. Therefore, we determine whether oral selenium supplementation alters selenium levels within the prostate and/or peripheral blood. Materials and Methods: In this prospective trial 51 men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia {{were randomly assigned to}} serve as controls or receive 200 μg selenium daily orally for 1 month. Sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 30 ng/gm in prostate tissue with a power of 80 %. Peripheral blood was obtained at enrollment and subsequently at surgery, when prostate tissue was also sampled. Selenium levels were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results: Baseline erythrocyte selenium was within the standard reference range. Supplementation increased erythrocyte (initial median 173 and final median 209 ng/ml, p = 0. 008) and prostate (supplement median 241 and control median 196 ng/gm, p = 0. 016) levels. Erythrocyte levels at surgery correlated poorly with prostate levels in the control (r = 0. 18) and supplement (r = 0. 07) groups.

Supplementation comprised 120 mg Fe + 500 µg folic acid with (n 94) or without (n 94) 4800 µg retinol in the form of retinyl acetate. Mothers of infants who participated in the national Fe+folic acid supplementation programme, but whose intake of supplements was not supervised, were recruited from four other villages (n 88). The mental and psychomotor development of infants was assessed, either at 6 or 12 months of age, using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID). We found no impact of vitamin A supplementation on mental or psychomotor development of infants. In addition, infants whose mothers had received weekly Fe supplementation had similar mental and psychomotor indices as those whose mothers had participated in the governmental Fe supplementation programme. The study population was moderately Fe and vitamin A deficient. The size of the treatment groups was large enough to detect a mean difference of 10 points on the BSID, which is less than 1 sd (15 points) of the average performance of an infant on the BSID. In conclusion, the present study did not find an impact of weekly supplementation of 4800 RE vitamin A in addition to Fe during gestation on functional development of Indonesian infants.

Intra- and inter-assay imprecision were low and the assay was linear between 7. 4 - 574 U/mL (Slope= 0. 99 - 1. 00; R 2 > 0. 99). 71 % of blood donors had undetectable Typhi Vi IgG antibody concentrations. Of those with antibody concentrations > 7. 4 U/mL, the concentration range was 7. 7 - 167 U/mL. In antibody deficient patients receiving antibody replacement therapy the median Typhi Vi IgG antibody concentrations were < 25 U/mL. In vaccinated normal healthy volunteers, the median concentration post vaccination was 107 U/mL (range 31 - 542 U/mL). 8 / 8 (100 %) had post vaccination concentration increases of at least 3 -fold and 6 / 8 (75 %) of at least 10 -fold.

We have utilized the prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2 radioimmunoassay to quantitate factor Xa activity {{in the blood of}} 22 asymptomatic individuals with this clinical disorder not receiving antithrombotic therapy. The mean level of F 1 + 2 was significantly elevated in these patients as compared to normal controls (3. 91 vs. 1. 97 nM, P less than 0. 001). The metabolic behavior of 131 I-F 1 + 2 was found to be similar in antithrombin-deficient subjects and normal individuals. The hemostatic system hyperactivity as measured by the F 1 + 2 assay could be specifically corrected by raising the plasma antithrombin levels of the above asymptomatic individuals into the normal range. This study provides the first demonstration that the prethrombotic state can be biochemically defined as an imbalance between the production and inhibition of factor Xa enzymatic activity within the human circulation. It is known that antithrombin and alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor (PI) are the major inhibitors of factor Xa in human plasma in the absence of heparin. To further evaluate the mechanism by which antithrombin functions as an inhibitor of factor Xa in humans, we studied five patients who exhibited severe congenital deficiencies of alpha 1 -PI. Our results indicated that the plasma of these subjects showed virtually identical decreases in plasma antifactor Xa activity in the absence of heparin when compared to antithrombin-deficient individuals, but the plasma F 1 + 2 levels in the alpha 1 -PI <b>deficient</b> <b>population</b> were not significantly different than normal.

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of using well-defined water sources containing iodine-saturated silicon matrices for providing adequate iodine supply to an iodine <b>deficient</b> <b>population</b> in Kordofan State, Western Sudan. A system of water iodination using silicon matrices containing 30 % sodium iodide placed in polyethylene baskets was used in four villages using either traditional wells or hand pumps. Before and every 6 months after iodination of water, urine and blood samples were obtained for determination of iodine and thyroid-related hormones, respectively. Goitre assessment on the village populations were performed at the start and 2 years later. Improvements in iodine status were recorded in all the study villages. The water iodine concentrations increased and a higher iodine content was observed in the hand pumps compared to the traditional wells. The median urinary iodine concentrations increased significantly, from 0. 19, 0. 20, 0. 19, 0. 11 to 1. 20, 1. 10, 0. 37, 0. 30 mumol/l in the four villages, respectively. The percentages of subjects with serum TSH above 4 mU/l were decreased from more than 30 % before iodination to less than 15 % at 2 years after iodine supply and the mean serum thyroxine hormone values rose. The rates of goitre decreased from 69 % to less than 25 %.

5000|$|Around the world, {{the most}} common cause of {{congenital}} hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency. Cretinism is therefore most probably due to a diet deficient in iodine.

Iodine is an essential trace element, necessary primarily for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency is {{the most common}} preventable cause of brain damage worldwide. [...] Although iodine is found in many foods, it is not universally present in all soils in adequate amounts. Most iodine, in iodide form, is in the oceans where the iodide ions oxidize to elemental iodine, which then enters the atmosphere and falls to earth as rain, introducing iodine to soils. Earth deficient in iodine is most common inland and in mountainous areas and areas of frequent flooding, but can also occur in coastal regions owing to past glaciation, and leaching by snow, water and heavy rainfall, which removes iodine from the soil. Plants and animals grown in iodine deficient soils are correspondingly <b>deficient.</b> <b>Populations</b> living in those areas without outside food sources are most at risk of iodine deficiency diseases.|$|R

Vitamin B- 12 deficiency is highly prevalent in vegetarians; this can be partially alleviated by taking dairy/egg products in lact-ovo-vegetarians. However, metabolic vitamin B- 12 deficiency is highly prevalent in vegetarians in Australia, Germany, Italy and Austria, and in vegans (80 %) in Hong Kong and India, where vegans rarely take vitamin B- 12 fortified food or vitamin B- 12 supplements.

The final products were digital stories that illustrated the mathematics in the daily operations of a particular community site as well as posing a potential mathematical problem situation. Our findings reveal the mathematics that is evident to the mothers, as well as how they translate the stories told by community members into ‘real ’ mathematical situations that are age-appropriate for their children.

Our rationale was to delay the progression of diabetes by preventing at a prediabetes stage with vitamin D supplementation in <b>deficient</b> <b>population.</b> In New Mexico, there are 106, 310 adults diagnosed with prediabetes which is 7 % of our population. Therefore, it is crucial that a preventive measure is in place to impede the progression of diabetes among a vulnerable population where there is a high rate of diabetes, obesity and vitamin D deficiency. ivWe planned to conduct our research with a cross-sectional study design. To do this we randomly selected 200 subjects from New Mexico Elder Health Survey 1993 - 1995, containing only Medicare recipients of Albuquerque. The participants were 65 years and older, containing non-Hispanic whites (55 %) and Hispanics (45 %) with relatively equal subjects with normal fasting plasma glucose and prediabetes. There were equal numbers of males and females. Also there were equal distributions of normal and deficient vitamin D level among our study subjects. From our statistical analyses, we found there was no association between vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes. However, when we conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis with interaction between Hispanic ethnicity and vitamin D deficiency with prediabetes as outcome, we found that Hispanics with vitamin D deficiency have 2. 4 -fold increased odds for having prediabetes as compared to NHW.

Since iodine readily sublimes at high temperatures, iodate is typically used due to its better resistance to oxidation. The actual availability of iodine from iodated salt at the consumer level can vary widely due to a number of factors, including the variability in the amount of iodine added during production, storage and meal preparation. The stability of iodine in typical salts available in the countrys market were determined under different storage conditions such as in the fridge, cupboard, exposure to direct sunlight for several days to mimic how salts are usually stored. Iodine levels dropped slowly in most iodated salt ranging from less than 10 % to 30 % of the added iodine but dropped rapidly from less than 10 % to 100 % in the raw non iodated salts. The reason was that the latter did not have stabilizers. While there is a wide band of iodine intake levels that are safe to consume, it is important that adequate amounts are delivered to the consumer. Therefore it is critical to have an accurate estimate of the losses in iodine prior to consumption, so that the producers may compensate for the losses...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In studies where {{microsatellite}} markers are employed, it {{is essential}} that the primers designed will reliably and consistently amplify target loci. In populations conforming to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), screening for unreliable markers often relies on the identification of heterozygote deficiencies and subsequent departures from HWE. However, since many populations naturally deviate from HWE, such as many marine invertebrates, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish heterozygote deficiencies resulting from unreliable markers from natural processes. Thus, studies of populations that are suspected to deviate from HWE naturally would benefit from a method to validate genotype data-sets and test the reliability of the designed primers. Levels of heterozygosity are reported for the prosobranch mollusc Hydrobia ulvae (Pennant) together with a method of genotype validation and primer assessment that utilises two primer sets for each locus. Microsatellite loci presented are the first described for the species Hydrobia ulvae; the five loci presented will be of value in further study of populations of H. ulvae. RESULTS: We have developed a novel method of testing primer reliability in naturally heterozygote <b>deficient</b> <b>populations.</b> After the design of an initial primer set, genotyping in 48 Hydrobia ulvae specimens using a single primer set (Primer set_A) revealed heterozygote deficiency in six of the seven loci examined. Redesign of six of the primer pairs (Primer set_B), re-genotyping of the successful individuals from Primer set_A using Primer set_B, and comparison of genotypes between the two primer sets, enabled the identification of two loci (Hulv- 06 & Hulv- 07) that showed a high degree of discrepancy between primer sets A and B (0...|$|R

Main results We included 12 trials at moderate risk of bias, enrolling 25, 465 mother-baby pairs and comparing several postpartum doses (200, 000 - 400, 000 IU) of vitamin A or 7. 8 mg daily beta-carotene, with placebo, iron or no supplement; or higher (400, 000 IU) versus lower dose (200, 000 IU). The majority of infants in all studies were at least partially breastfed for six months. Maternal: we observed no impact of vitamin A on maternal mortality (two trials of 9, 126 women), morbidity (one trial of 50 women) or adverse effects (subset of 786 women in one trial). Vitamin A enhanced serum and breast milk retinol at three months in five trials, but these improvements were generally not sustained. Infant: we observed no significant differences for infant mortality RR 1. 14 95...|$|R
40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} micronutrient for human health. Se deficiency affects {{hundreds of millions of}} people worldwide, particularly in developing countries, and there is increasing awareness that suboptimal supply of Se can also negatively affect human health. Selenium enters the diet primarily through the ingestion of plant and animal products. Although, plants are not dependent on Se they take it up from the soil through the sulphur (S) uptake and assimilation pathways. Therefore, geographic differences in the availability of soil Se and agricultural practices have a profound influence on the Se content of many foods, and there are increasing efforts to biofortify crop plants with Se. Plants from the Brassicales are of particular interest as they accumulate and synthesize Se into forms with additional health benefits, such as methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys). The Brassicaceae are also well-known to produce the glucosinolates; S-containing compounds with demonstrated human health value. Furthermore, the recent discovery of the selenoglucosinolates in the Brassicaceae raises questions regarding their potential bioefficacy. In this review we focus on Se uptake and metabolism in the Brassicaceae in the context of human health, particularly cancer prevention and immunity. We investigate the close relationship between Se and S metabolism in this plant family, with particular emphasis on the selenoglucosinolates, and consider the methodologies available for identifying and quantifying further novel Se-containing compounds in plants. Finally, we summarize the research of multiple groups investigating biofortification of the Brassicaceae and discuss which approaches might be most successful for supplying Se <b>deficient</b> <b>populations</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin D is {{important}} for skeletal muscle health and deficiency is associated with clinical neuromuscular symptoms of poor strength and gait. Supplementation can independently increase muscle strength in chronically <b>deficient</b> <b>populations.</b> However, the regulatory role of vitamin D on neuromuscular remodelling and adaptation subsequent to exercise conditioning or injury has not been systematically reviewed. Objective: to systematically review the available evidence {{of the role of}} vitamin D on neuromuscular remodelling following exercise conditioning, exercise- or experimentally induced injury. We searched Medline (OVID platform), PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including measures of neuromuscular function, injury and/or inflammation; a physiologically stressful intervention involving exercise conditioning, exercise- or experimentally induced injury and; vitamin D supplementation. Nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Significant heterogeneity of methodological approaches and outcomes meant that meta-analysis of data was limited. Qualitative findings indicated that vitamin D may be an effective accelerant of neuromuscular remodelling in animal models (24 – 140 % improved recovery vs. control); the effects in humans are inconclusive and likely influenced by baseline vitamin D and supplementation strategy. Results of the meta-analyses indicated no effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength adaptation following resistance training [standardised mean difference (SMD) : 0. 74, P = 0. 42] or muscle damage (SMD: − 0. 03, P = 0. 92), although inflammatory markers were elevated in the latter (SMD: 0. 56, P = 0. 04). Data from animal models offer promising and plausible mechanisms for vitamin D as an agent for neuromuscular adaptation. Further high-quality research is needed to offer clearer insight into the influential role of vitamin D in human populations...|$|R
40|$|Background : Paroxysmal nocturnal {{hemoglobinuria}} (PNH) results due {{to decrease}} {{or absence of}} glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI) molecules, such as CD 55 and CD 59, {{from the surface of}} the affected cells. PNH-phenotype has been described in various hematological disorders, mainly aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes; recently it has been reported in patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes and multiple myeloma (MM). Materials and Methods : We evaluated the presence of CD 55 negative and/or CD 59 negative red blood cell (RBC) populations in newly diagnosed treatment naive- 54 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 29 MM patients by flow cytometry. Results : PNH-phenotype was not reported in any patient; however, RBC <b>populations</b> <b>deficient</b> in CD 55 were detected in 16. 66 % (9 / 54) CLL and 6. 89 % (2 / 29) MM patients. Clinical presentation or the hematological parameters did not show any relationship with the presence of CD 55 <b>deficient</b> RBC <b>population.</b> Conclusion : Our study showed absence of PNH-phenotype in patients with CLL and MM; however, isolated CD 55 deficient RBC were identified in both CLL and MM. Larger prospective studies by other centers, including simultaneous analysis of granulocytes for the presence of PNH-phenotype, are needed to corroborate these findings and to work out the mechanisms and the significance of the existence of this phenotype in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Why are we {{obsessed with}} micronutrients as magic bullets for all remedies? As {{if they are}} the panacea for one and all ailments. From being remedial, these are now being {{projected}} as the shortcut to prevent our extinction! Zinc, folic acid, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin D–the list is swelling up. And now, Bhutta, et al. (1) put up an un-convincing case for supplementation of vitamin A during the neonatal period for the Asian region as a “core ” intervention to improve infant survival! Bhutta and his 10 co-authors identified three trials of vitamin A supplementation in the neonatal period in Asian population (Indonesia, South India, Bangladesh) (2 - 4) and reported that neonatal vitamin A supplementation {{was associated with a}} 21 % reduction in mortality in babies younger than 6 months (random effects relative risk 0 · 79, 95 % CI 0 · 65 - 0 · 96) (unpublished meta-analysis). The authors on one hand vociferously argued for utilizing only published data, yet used this unpublished meta-analysis to model vital estimates to bend the opinion of policy makers in favor of neonatal vitamin A supplementation(1). Negative data from other relevant trials from Asia(5) and Africa(6, 7) were conveniently ignored. The inconsistency between the Asian and African regions also remains unexplained. Authors themselves agree “the disparate findings concerning the benefits of early newborn dosing from Africa and Asia without current biological explanation do concern us. These would merit further large-scale assessments in vitamin A <b>deficient</b> <b>populations,</b> to investigate the importance of potential effect modifiers such as HIV and malaria”(8); yet they were prompt enough to dole out a recommendation for an annual birth cohort of more than 50 million children, without enough evidence. The authors make a case for neonatal (< 1 month) supplementation in the original review(1); however, in response to an embarrassin...|$|R
40|$|Morbidity and {{mortality}} due to viral infections are major health concerns, particularly when individuals are vitamin A deficient. Vitamin A deficiency significantly impairs mucosal IgA, a {{first line of}} defense against virus at its point of entry. Previous reports have suggested that CD 11 c(Hi) dendritic cells (DCs) of the gastrointestinal tract produce retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH 1 A), which metabolizes vitamin A precursors to retinoic acid to support normal mucosal immunity. Given that the upper respiratory tract (URT) and gastrointestinal tract share numerous characteristics, we asked if the CD 11 c(Hi) DCs of the URT might also express ALDH 1 A. To address this question, we examined both CD 11 c(Hi) test cells and CD 11 c(Lo/neg) control cells from nasal tissue. Surprisingly, the CD 11 c(Lo/neg) cells expressed more ALDH 1 A mRNA per cell than did the CD 11 c(Hi) cells. Further evaluation of CD 11 c(Lo/neg) populations by PCR and staining of respiratory tract sections revealed that epithelial cells were robust producers of both ALDH 1 A mRNA and protein. Moreover, CD 11 c(Lo/neg) cells from nasal tissue (and a homogeneous respiratory tract epithelial cell line) enhanced IgA production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated splenocyte cultures {{in the presence of the}} retinoic acid precursor retinol. Within co-cultures, there was increased expression of MCP- 1, IL- 6, and GM-CSF, the latter two of which were necessary for IgA upregulation. All three cytokines/chemokines were expressed by the LPS-stimulated respiratory tract epithelial cell line in the absence of splenocytes. These data demonstrate the autonomous potential of respiratory tract epithelial cells to support vitamin A-mediated IgA production, and encourage the clinical testing of intranasal vitamin A supplements in vitamin A <b>deficient</b> <b>populations</b> to improve mucosal immune responses toward respiratory tract pathogens and vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional rickets {{resulting}} from calcium insufficiency {{is common in}} Nigeria and high dietary phytate is thought to inhibit calcium and zinc absorption. We compared {{the effects of a}} high-phytate meal and enzymatic dephytinization on calcium and zinc absorption in Nigerian children with and without rickets. Nineteen children with rickets and 15 age-matched control children, aged 2 – 10 y, were given calcium (600 mg/d) and ergocalciferol (1250 μg/wk). After 6 wk, calcium and zinc absorption were measured in both groups with and without maize porridge using stable isotopes. One week later, absorption measurements were repeated to assess the effects of enzymatic dephytinization and fermentation of the maize porridge. The phytate concentration of maize porridge (3. 87 ± 0. 38 g/kg wet weight) was reduced by enzymatic dephytinization (2. 83 ± 0. 41 g/kg; P < 0. 001) but not by fermentation (3. 35 ± 0. 27 g/kg; P = 0. 08). Calcium and zinc absorption were unaffected by the presence of rickets or by fermentation of maize porridge. Calcium absorption was greater with a meal (61. 3 ± 25. 1 %) than without (27. 8 ± 14. 6 %; P < 0. 001). Zinc absorption was lower with a meal (16. 2 ± 8. 0 %) than without (63. 4 ± 23. 9 %; P < 0. 001). Enzymatic dephytinization increased relative zinc absorption from a meal by 101 ± 81 % (P < 0. 001) but did not affect calcium absorption. Rickets was not associated with impaired calcium or zinc absorption. Calcium absorption was enhanced by maize porridge, but zinc absorption was reduced. Enzymatic dephytinization increased zinc absorption. Multiple strategies may be required to optimize calcium and zinc absorption in <b>deficient</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R
