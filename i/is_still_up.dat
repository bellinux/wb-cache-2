The museum is seeking a location near Pearson International Airport, so that it can display some time in 2015, all of its artifacts including a partly restored Avro Lancaster bomber.|$|E
25|$|With a large {{agricultural}} heritage, {{many farmers}} oppose DST because their days {{are controlled by}} the sun, not the clock. Farmers are often dependent on younger workers whose parents want them home by dinner, and {{when the sun is}} up later in the evening, farmers miss out on recreational activities that only happen late. When the sun <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> at 9pm to 9:30pm, the farmer is still in the field, while others have been off work for hours.|$|E
25|$|In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, Cabeza de Vaca, {{observed}} natives in {{the western}} part of modern-day Florida using sign language, and in the mid-16th century Coronado mentioned that communication with the Tonkawa using signs was possible without a translator. Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for debate. There are estimates indicating that as many as 2% of Native Americans are seriously or completely deaf, a rate more than twice the national average.|$|E

25|$|Wetzlar lies on {{the eastern}} edge of the Rhenish Massif. The {{substrate}} consists of geologically young sediments of the Lahn and much older Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the two main geological units of the Massif, the Lahnmulde and the so-called Giessen nappe. The northwestern part of the urban area {{lies on the}} Lahntal silt, sand and gravel, which have only slightly hardened. They were deposited by the River Lahn, at a point where its valley (which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> to one kilometre wide) to the west becomes increasingly narrow and deep. The main part of the city is built on in part intensively folded, faulted and slated layers of shales, sandstone, quartzite and limestone. They were deposited in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods in a sea characterised by island chains, volcanoes and atolls that were pushed together and covered by a layer of rock that had been transported from another location during the period of mountain building known as the Variscan orogeny. The marine sedimentary rocks which resulted from this tectonic action now give the town its character as they were often used for building material.|$|E
500|$|To this day, Catarina is {{the only}} {{hurricane}} strength tropical cyclone ever observed in the South Atlantic Ocean since 1970. Other systems have been observed in this region; however, none have reached hurricane strength, and no eyes were seen on satellite imagery or radar. While Catarina formed in an unusual area, its relation to global warming or {{any other type of}} global climatic change <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for debate. The [...] attributed it to [...] "climatic changes and atmospheric anomalies," [...] while other researchers have indicated that it could be the result of the Southern Annular Mode or other seasonal variations in weather within the Southern Hemisphere, again linked to global changes in climate. However, more research in the area is still needed to make a conclusion.|$|E
500|$|On November 6, 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 (2012) {{was passed}} by initiative, thereby legalizing the {{recreational}} use of cannabis. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper signed two bills on May 28, 2013 that made Colorado the world's first fully regulated recreational cannabis market for adults. Hickenlooper explained to the media: [...] "Certainly, this industry will create jobs. Whether it’s good for the brand of our state <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> in the air. But the voters passed Amendment 64 by a clear majority. That’s why we’re going to implement it as effectively as we possibly can." [...] In its independent analysis, the Colorado Center on Law & Policy found that the state could expect a to see [...] "$60 million in total combined savings and additional revenue for Colorado’s budget with a potential for this number to double after 2017." [...] On September 9, 2013, the Colorado Department of Revenue adopted final regulations for recreational marijuana establishments, implementing the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code (HB 13-1317). On September 16, 2013, the Denver City Council adopted an ordinance for retail marijuana establishments. The first stores officially opened on January 1, 2014. The state prepared for an influx of tourists with extra police officers posted in Denver. Safety fears led to officials seeking to limit use of the drug in popular ski resorts.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to a modular account, an interactive theory of sentence processing, such as a constraint-based lexical approach assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time. Under an interactive account, for example, the semantics of a sentence (such as plausibility) can come into play early on {{in order to help}} determine the structure of a sentence. Hence, in the sentence above, the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that [...] "the evidence" [...] is being examined instead of doing the examining. There are data to support both modular and interactive accounts; which account is the correct one <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for debate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} Miocene, 17 to 15 Ma, the Columbia Plateau and the Oregon Basin and Range of the Pacific Northwest were flooded with lava flows. Both flows {{are similar in}} both {{composition}} and age, and {{have been attributed to}} a common source, the Yellowstone hotspot. [...] The ultimate cause of the volcanism <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for debate, but the most widely accepted idea is that the mantle plume or upwelling (similar to that associated with present-day Hawaii) initiated the widespread and voluminous basaltic volcanism about 17million years ago. As hot mantle plume materials rise and reach lower pressures, the hot materials melt and interact with the materials in the upper mantle, creating magma. Once that magma breaches the surface, it flows as lava and then solidifies into basalt.|$|E

2500|$|Conveying Peter Bradshaw's review, The Guardian said, [...] "Redford's near-mute {{performance}} as a mysterious old man of the sea adrift and utterly alone makes for a bold, gripping thriller." [...] Having spotted a possible metaphor, Bradshaw concludes: [...] "What a strikingly bold and thoughtful film." [...] Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice writes that the film is [...] "a genuine nail-biter, scrupulously made and fully involving, elemental in its simplicity." [...] David Morgan of CBS News gave the film a positive review, stating, [...] "Four decades ago Redford demonstrated a similar capacity for survival skills as the mountain man Jeremiah Johnson. Today, at age 77, without a supporting cast and performing virtually all of his water stunts himself, Redford proves he <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> to the task, shining in what is an extremely physical but also an intellectually demanding role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{consider}} him {{not a part}} of the Battle of the Little Bighorn that <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for debate. Most of Red Shirt's history has been written down. Living family members of his tell of his bravery in battle. Buffalo Bill Cody was impressed with Red Shirt. “Among the prominent chiefs thus engaged was Red Shirt, a redoubtable warrior and second only in influence to Sitting Bull himself. A short while before his engagement with us he had quelled an uprising among his people, instigated by a pretender to the chieftainship of the tribe, by invading the pretender's camp with only two of his followers and shooting the leader dead before the eyes of his affrighted wife. This fearless act had served to elevate him very much in the eyes of his people, who thereafter accepted him as a leader. When, therefore, he decided to join the Wild West show, under the flattering offers I made him, his influence aided us very much in procuring our complement of Indians, not only from his own tribe, but from others as well.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Feminism's {{effect on}} {{polygyny}} in Islam {{is different in}} every Muslim society, depending on the different cultures that are interacting with Islam in each location. [...] For example, in Iran, changes to women's rights occurred {{in the wake of}} the Islamic Revolution in 1979. [...] During this revolution the Family Protection Law, which had given some power to women and imposed minimal restrictions on polygyny, was overturned. [...] Muslim women were encouraged to return to their traditional roles. [...] This loss of rights led to the movement realizing that they could not necessarily rely on the government alone to protect their rights. [...] This spurred the creation of the personal status laws, which covered many issues relating to marriage and divorce including polygyny. Passed in 1986, the law [...] "effectively reinstates the provision of the 1975 Family Protection Law granting a wife the right to obtain a divorce if her husband marries a second woman without the wife's permission of if…a man does not treat his wives fairly and equally." [...] This offers Iranian Muslim women some legal protection against polygyny, but the enforcement of the law <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> to the interpretation of the courts. [...] Muslim women's movement organizations have begun to gain more power in Iran due to the increasing number of Muslim women who are studying the Qur'an analytically. [...] These new scholars are able to argue for interpretations of Islam that empower rather than oppress women. [...] They also lead organizations like the Association of Muslim Women and Zeynab. [...] Many Muslim women also go jalasehs where they can openly discuss religious texts in a safe environment. So even though the revolution attempted to reinstate many patriarchal values, like unlimited polygyny, it ended up inspiring women to push for more rights and become more credible by studying religious texts.|$|E

60|$|That was {{a curious}} state of morals and {{politics}} in Europe; a queer consequence of {{the triumph of the}} monarchical principle. Feudalism was beaten down. The nobility, in its quarrels with the crown, had pretty well succumbed, and the monarch was all in all. He became almost divine: the proudest and most ancient gentry of the land did menial service for him. Who should carry Louis XIV’s candle when he went to bed? What prince of the blood should hold the king’s shirt when his Most Christian Majesty changed that garment?—the French memoirs of the seventeenth century are full of such details and squabbles. The tradition is not yet extinct in Europe. Any of you who were present, as myriads were, at that splendid pageant, the opening of our Crystal Palace in London, must have seen two noble lords, great officers of the household, with ancient pedigrees, with embroidered coats, and stars on their breasts and wands in their hands, walking backwards for near the space of a mile, while the royal procession made its progress. Shall we wonder—shall we be angry—shall we laugh at these old-world ceremonies? View them as you will, according to your mood; and with scorn or with respect, or with anger and sorrow, as your temper leads you. Up goes Gesler’s hat upon the pole. Salute that symbol of sovereignty with heartfelt awe; or with a sulky shrug of acquiescence, or with a grinning obeisance; or with a stout rebellious No—clap your own beaver down on your pate, and refuse to doff it, to that spangled velvet and flaunting feather. I make no comment upon the spectators’ behaviour; all I say is, that Gesler’s cap <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>up</b> in the market-place of Europe, and not a few folks are still kneeling to it.|$|E
