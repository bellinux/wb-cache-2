40|$|International audienceBuildings are {{responsible}} for 40 % of total <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> in Europe. Numerous bottom-up models were recently developed to support local authorities in assessing the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of large building stocks and reduction potentials. However, current models rarely consider uncertainty associated to building usage and characteristics within the stock, resulting in potentially biased results. This study presents a generic model simplification approach using uncertainty propagation and stochastic sensitivity analysis to derive fast simplified (surrogate) models to estimate the current building stock energy use for improved urban planning. The methodology includes an engineering-based energy model as input to global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using the elementary effects (EE) screening and Sobol’ method for key parameters identification and regression analysis to derive simplified models for entire building stocks. The application to the housing stock of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg) showed that the parameters explaining most of the variability in <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> use for heating and domestic hot water are floor area, set-point temperature, external walls U-values, windows and heating system type.

Since 2005, world crude oil price has been rising and had reached a record of 147 $/barrel. Therefore the policy on promotion of biofuel utilization was initiated in 2005 by the Ministry of Energy; however, the economy-wide impacts have been rarely assessed. This paper presents the energy Input-Output Analysis (IO) of the economy-wide impacts on the promotion policy, in particular, the change in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In order to measure the total GHG emission from different economic sectors, the contribution of emissions has to be considered. In this paper, the focus is placed on CO 2 emissions. To calculate the amount of CO 2 emissions, the emission amount of various final consumptions in the economy evaluated by the IO must be applied. The direct CO 2 emissions in <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> in Thailand are evaluated by using conversion factors from Guidelines to Defra's GHG conversion factors, Annexes updated in June 2007.

Heat energy saving arrangements is the main for the refurbishment of prefabricated housing because thermal insulation is paramount to both heat energy savings and to repairing facade damage. The advantages of heat energy saving measures, {{particularly with respect to}} prefabricated housing, are undeniably evident: •Reducing heat <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> by 40 to 50 % is easily attained.

There is therefore significant scope for the reduction of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> through improvements to the energy efficiency of residential buildings.

This paper analyses the embodied and operational energy demands of a case study passive house using a comprehensive hybrid analysis technique to quantify embodied energy. Results show that the embodied energy is much more significant than previously thought. Also, compared to a standard house with the same geometry, structure, finishes and number of people, a passive house can use more energy over 80 years, mainly due to the additional materials required.
