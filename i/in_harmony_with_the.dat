5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} the {{missions}} were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities <b>in</b> <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> paradise where they had encountered the indigenous peoples.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, <b>in</b> <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter}} of the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E
5|$|In 342 BC, two {{significant}} laws were passed. One {{of these two}} laws made it illegal to hold more than one office at any given point in time, and the other law required an interval of ten years to pass before any magistrate could seek reelection to any office. As {{a result of these}} two laws, the military situation quickly became unmanageable. During this time period, Rome was expanding within Italy and beginning to take steps beyond Italy, and thus it became necessary for military commanders to hold office for several years at a time. This problem was resolved with the creation of the pro-magisterial offices, so that when an individual's term in office ended, his command might be prorogued (prorogatio imperii). In effect, when a magistrate's term ended, his imperium was extended, and he usually held the title of either Proconsul or Propraetor. This constitutional device was not <b>in</b> <b>harmony</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> underlying genius of the Roman constitution, and its frequent usage eventually {{paved the way for the}} empire. In addition, during these years, the Plebeian Tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realized the need to use Plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals, and so to win over the Tribunes, the senators gave the Tribunes a great deal of power, and unsurprisingly, the Tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the Tribunes and the senators grew closer, Plebeian senators were often able to secure the Tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the Tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
