5|$|Dysprosium {{is one of}} the {{components}} of Terfenol-D, along with iron and terbium. Terfenol-D has the highest room-temperature magnetostriction of any known material; which is employed in transducers, wide-band mechanical resonators, and high-precision liquid-fuel <b>injectors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC <b>injectors.</b> Once in the <b>injectors,</b> the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the <b>injectors</b> on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second type}} of fuel <b>injector</b> is the air blast <b>injector.</b> This <b>injector</b> [...] "blasts" [...] a sheet of fuel with a stream of air, {{atomizing}} the fuel into homogeneous droplets. This type of fuel <b>injector</b> led to the first smokeless combustors. The air used is just same amount of the primary air (see Air flow paths below) that is diverted through the <b>injector,</b> rather than the swirler. This type of <b>injector</b> also requires lower fuel pressures than the pressure atomizing type.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} common-rail <b>injector</b> behavior towards multiple injection strategies. A numerical model has been developed to simulate the electro-fluid-mechanic behavior of a Bosch mass production <b>injector</b> (standard <b>injector)</b> and validation against experiments has been performed. In {{order to make the}} <b>injector</b> performing multiple injections, a deep investigation has been numerically carried out. The numerical study highlighted different areas where <b>injector</b> may be improved with particular emphasis on electronic driving circuit.

5|$|Lorian, after {{considering}} {{his knowledge of}} events, believes that the wormhole must be avoided altogether. Archer and Lorian then disagree over whether to implement an engine modification to Enterprise, since there is a 22% chance it may cause {{the destruction of the}} ship. Archer then meets with old T'Pol on board old Enterprise, and considers a plan where his ship could pass through it safely, due to alternate modifications suggested by her. A frustrated Lorian then reveals a secret plan: to steal the newer plasma <b>injectors</b> from Enterprise to allow them to confront the Xindi in the place of their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) <b>injectors.</b>|$|E
5|$|T'Pol, {{working out}} in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to {{apologize}} to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma <b>injectors</b> prior to their departure.|$|E

50|$|The two <b>injector</b> {{regions are}} each {{designed}} to efficiently transfer its namesake carriers (electrons or holes) from the semimetallic interface to the active region. They must also double as rectifying barriers for the opposite type of carrier {{in order to}} prevent inter-stage leakage currents. The total <b>injector</b> (electron <b>injector</b> plus hole <b>injector)</b> should also be sufficiently thick overall to prevent the electric fields forming under bias from becoming great enough to induce dielectric breakdown of the material. The electron <b>injector</b> is usually made longer because of the relatively fast inter-well scattering rate of electrons compared to that of holes. This ensures a smaller series resistance contribution from the total <b>injector</b> transport. The hole <b>injector</b> is composed of GaSb/AlSb quantum wells. It is made just thick enough (typically with just one or two wells) to ensure effective suppression of electron tunneling from the active region to the electron <b>injector</b> of the next stage. The electron <b>injector</b> typically consists of a longer series of InAs/AlSb quantum wells. To maximize the InAs/AlSb superlattice miniband width, the InAs layer thicknesses are varied across the <b>injector</b> so that their ground state energies nearly align when the device is biased. The quantum well energy gaps in the <b>injector</b> must be large enough to preclude reabsorption of the photons generated by the active quantum wells.|$|R
40|$|A liquid <b>injector</b> 1 has an <b>injector</b> body 3 {{provided}} with an injection passage 7 which is {{formed by the}} cavity between the inner wall 9 of the <b>injector</b> body and a needle 5 and the cavity in a hole 13 located in the wall 11 of the <b>injector</b> body. The liquid <b>injector</b> 1 further has a spherical, hollow porous element 15 which extends beyond the <b>injector</b> body 3 and is formed by a semi-sphere which is fixed to the <b>injector</b> body and closes off the injection passage 7. The wall thickness of the porous element 15 {{is not the same}} throughout. In the middle the wall is thinner than near the edge, so that during the injection action the fuel vapour 19 has the shape of a semi-ellipse...|$|R
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel <b>injectors</b> {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|The first 25 were {{constructed}} at Nine Elms Locomotive Works between March and November 1897. Thereafter the M7 class {{had a long}} production run with five major sets of design variants. Between 1897 and 1899 the locomotives {{were constructed}} with a short overhang at the front, and sandboxes combined with the front splashers. <b>Injectors</b> and a lever-type reverser were also added, and a conical, as opposed to flat, smokebox door was implemented on numbers 252–256. In 1900 the design was modified to incorporate the sandboxes inside the smokebox; these were later relocated below the running plate.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new <b>injectors</b> and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has been improvements to the fuel and air mixing based on computational modelling.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for an investigation}} intended to provide experimental data that can quantitatively describe {{the way in which}} various coaxial <b>injector</b> designs affect the stability of gaseous propellant rocket motors.

The measured <b>injector</b> response factor data {{are presented}} and discussed. It is shown that there is reasonable agreement between the measured <b>injector</b> response factors and those predicted by the Feiler and Heidmann model (1967), and that the orifice length can be varied to shift the resonant frequency of the <b>injector</b> without any change in the magnitude of the response factor at resonance.

40|$|In {{gasoline}} {{direct injection}} (GDI) engines, carbonaceous deposits are formed on surfaces wetted with gasoline. Of particular concern is the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the <b>injector</b> tip as they lead to <b>injector</b> plugging and particulate emissions from these engines. The drying of the <b>injector</b> tip is an essential parameter in the build-up of deposits. This paper reports the effect of parameters such as system pressure, <b>injector</b> tip temperature and air flow on the drying rate of an isooctane thin film on an <b>injector</b> tip. Depending on the <b>injector</b> tip superheat, the fuel film drying out process can be dominated by either evaporation or boiling. At <b>injector</b> tip superheat up to 10 C, evaporation at the contact line is the dominating mechanism. The drying rate is this regime increases with <b>injector</b> tip temperature and air velocity. Above this temperature, bubbles or funnel-shaped structures were formed in the film. The drying rate due to boiling depends on the system pressure and temperature but shows little dependence on the air velocity. The drying rate increases with the reduction in system pressure. In the Leidenfrost state, the fuel bounces-off the <b>injector</b> tip and this temperature decreases with system pressure...|$|R
