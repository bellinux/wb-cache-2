5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> electricity to protect the welder.|$|E

In 1998, the USDA filed charges against Ringling Bros. for forcing a sick elephant to perform. Ringling paid a $20,000 fine.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} energy {{harvesting}} {{dates back to}} the windmill and the waterwheel. People have searched for ways to store the energy <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> vibrations for many decades. One driving force behind the search for new energy harvesting devices is the desire to power sensor networks and mobile devices without batteries. Energy harvesting is also motivated by a desire {{to address the issue of}} climate change and global warming.|$|E
25|$|In late-June 1936, Humphreys fell {{seriously ill}} and was {{confined}} {{to his home in}} Fair Haven, New Jersey for three weeks. On the morning of July 10, he apparently collapsed <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> was unable to speak coherently. Falling into a coma at around 2:00 pm, he died {{an hour and a half}} later. His son and daughter-in-law, as well as his grand daughter Terry, were at his bedside at the time of his death.|$|E

5000|$|Although, from {{a global}} perspective, harmful indoor air {{pollution}} is caused by cooking <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> with solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves, especially in poorly ventilated rooms, indoor air pollutants may also come <b>from</b> <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling equipment, electronic appliances, cleaning products, air fresheners, insecticides, and construction materials.|$|R
25|$|Humidity {{levels are}} usually {{high in the}} morning {{especially}} during Juneâ€“November which makes it feel warmer. Lowest humidity levels are recorded in the evening during wet season. Discomfort <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> humidity is extreme during May and June, otherwise it is higher compared to {{other places in the}} country. Average sunlight is maximum at 254.25 hours during April and minimum at 113 hours during July, August and September.|$|E
25|$|Both Chippewa and Wesco heavily {{increased}} {{sales of}} engineer boots {{in the late}} 1940s. There was a post-war production boom for the boots, with high demand coming from returning veterans and bikers. The latter adopted engineer boots because the laceless design wouldn't interfere with motorcycle drive belts, the shafts were well insulated <b>from</b> <b>heat,</b> <b>and</b> they provided full lower leg protection {{in case of an}} accident. The footwear's popularity was furthered by its use by celebrities such as Marlon Brando and James Dean in their respective films The Wild One (1953) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955).|$|E
25|$|For example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to {{a school}} {{in the village of}} Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other {{detention}} facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically.|$|E

25|$|Rajasthan {{is known}} for its traditional, {{colourful}} art. The block prints, tie and dye prints, Bagaru prints, Sanganer prints, and Zari embroidery are major export products from Rajasthan. Handicraft items like wooden furniture and crafts, carpets, and blue pottery are commonly found here. Shopping reflects the colourful culture, Rajasthani clothes have a lot of mirror work and embroidery. A Rajasthani traditional dress for females comprises an ankle-length skirt and a short top, also known as a lehenga or a chaniya choli. A piece of cloth is used to cover the head, both for protection <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> maintenance of modesty. Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colours like blue, yellow and orange.|$|E
25|$|Preparation of pu'erh {{involves}} first separating a well-sized {{portion of}} the compressed tea for brewing. This {{can be done by}} flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> hydration. A pu'erh knife, which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid letter opener, is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as tuocha or mushroom pu'erh are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling of the cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.|$|E
25|$|The naval Battle of Cape Orlando {{took place}} on 4 July 1299 at St Marco di Val Demone, {{north-western}} Sicily, when an Aragonese and Angevin galley fleet commanded by Roger of Lauria defeated a Sicilian galley fleet commanded by Conrad d'Oria. King James II of Aragon and Frederick III of Sicily were present with their fleets at the battle. The larger Aragon-Angevin fleet was trapped on a lee shore but was able to win the battle with the intervention of its 6-galley reserve that attacked {{the rear of the}} Sicilian fleet. The Sicilians fled when the flagship, with Frederick aboard, pulled back after the king collapsed <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> exhaustion. Eighteen Sicilian vessels were captured and their crews massacred. The battle allowed for the invasion of Sicily but James, breaking with his Angevin allies withdrew his force to Aragon and Frederick was able to defeat the Angevin army on land and secure the independence of Sicily in the Peace of Caltabellotta.|$|E

500|$|All Saladin's {{best efforts}} could not {{dislocate}} the Crusader column, or halt its {{advance in the}} direction of Arsuf. [...] Richard was determined to hold his army together, forcing the enemy to exhaust themselves in repeated charges, with the intention of holding his knights for a concentrated counter-attack at just the right moment. [...] There were risks in this, because the army was not only marching under severe enemy provocation, but the troops were suffering <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> thirst. [...] Just as serious, the Saracens were killing so many horses that some of Richard's own knights began to wonder if a counter-strike would be possible. Many of the unhorsed knights joined the infantry.|$|E
500|$|Animal rights {{organization}} PETA accused the film's producers of using animals {{that had previously}} been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the movie, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms [...] "They're not wrong. There's a certain amount of hypocrisy whenever you work with animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation...I don't know. I respect their criticism." [...] PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared: [...] "The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, {{but it would have been}} impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is the responsibility that humans have to protect and care for animals." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{problems}} {{are related to}} shade in pasture areas. [...] Although shade provides relief <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> {{reduces the risk of}} heat stress, animals tend to congregate in these areas which leads to nutrient loading, uneven grazing, and potential soil erosion. [...] Taller shade trees move the shade area around as the day progresses minimizing this problem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{damage to}} the train was {{concentrated}} in the rear half. The front locomotive, amenity coach and front rake (including a truck carrying dangerous goods) suffered minor damage <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> smoke: all were re-usable after thorough cleaning and minor repairs. [...] The rear rake suffered major thermal damage: eleven wagons and the rear locomotive were scrapped, as were most of the HGVs being carried.|$|E
2500|$|Because many common welding {{procedures}} involve an open {{electric arc}} or flame, {{the risk of}} burns <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> sparks is significant. [...] To prevent them, welders wear protective clothing {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat, flames, and sparks. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes also pose an explosion and fire risk; some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E
