5000|$|In 1966, at {{the third}} National Conference of State Commissions on the Status of Women, the conference {{organizers}} did not allow resolutions or actions of any kind meant to abolish discrimination against women, so some women who were attending decided to form an advocacy organization of their own. Cornering a large table at the conference luncheon, {{so that they could}} start organizing before they had to rush for planes, each of those women chipped in five dollars, Betty Friedan wrote the acronym NOW on a napkin, and the National Organization for Women was created. Its first meeting was held on June 28, 1966 in Betty Friedan's hotel room, with 28 women attending. At its first conference in October 1966, Friedan was elected NOW's first president, and her fame as the author of the bestselling book The Feminine Mystique helped attract thousands of women to the organization. Friedan <b>drafted</b> NOW's original <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Purpose,</b> which began, [...] "The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men." [...] Furthermore, in 1966, Congresswoman Martha Griffiths admonished the EEOC on the floor of Congress for their failure to enforce the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment.|$|R
40|$|The genre <b>of</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> (SOP) for {{graduate}} school entrance has been scantily researched. While {{there are a}} few studies on the rhetoric of the genre and investigations into what makes certain essays successful, no studies consider the process <b>of</b> writing these <b>statements</b> and how students are socially situated inside and outside of academia. Since graduate school admissions are a method of academic gate keeping, this study looks at how students are able to situate themselves so they are deemed worthy of entrance. In particular for groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the academy, how do students gain the cultural capital necessary to rationalize their placement in the world of graduate studies that have traditionally shunned them? ^ Rather than focus solely on the completed product, as the existing studies do, this study follows students through the process <b>of</b> writing <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> {{for graduate}} school admissions, investigating aspects of the practice from the student 2 ̆ 7 s point of view including: the students understandings and assumptions about the genre, the discoursal and rhetorical choices they make, the negotiation of their multiple identities, and their visions of their past, present, and future selves. Given the traditionally independent nature <b>of</b> <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> writing, this research is unique in that it studies the process a group of senior undergraduate students go through when composing graduate school essays. The findings focus on two case studies of college seniors (who come from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in graduate education) and how they negotiate their discoursal and social identities while (and for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of)</b> writing their SOPs for graduate school admission. Using transcripts of an SOP writing workshop and personal interviews and the <b>drafts</b> and final <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> written by the students, the researcher uses discourse analysis to investigate the ways students balance and represent their multiple identities in the high-stakes genre of admissions essays. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{explores the}} openings of research articles in historical writing in Italian and English. The features of different “academic cultures” {{are not only}} seen in the different role attributed to narrative or expositive/argumentative elements in the opening: they are also reflected in self-reference and lexical choice. The study is based on two comparable corpora of openings and combines corpus and discourse tools of analysis. Focusing on the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> in openings, the study shows that the English corpus is clearly characterized by frequent <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose.</b> Intentionality is mostly expressed through modal "will" and the purpose is often attributed to the text itself, mostly identified by its genre (article, paper, essay). In the Italian corpus, the statement is slighltly more limited (possibly deferred), but above all it is often more indirect and less formulaic. The expression of intention is much more explicitly lexicalised, {{and the presence of}} 1 st person singular is much greater, while self-reference nouns referring to the discourse product are used much more sparingly in <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose,</b> which often tend to present the text through generalized spatial reference rather than through a denomination of its academic genre. All in all, Italian historians, while showing a tendency to dominate openings in their personal relationship to the object of investigation through evaluative comments and personal statements, tend to make use <b>of</b> highly indirect <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose,</b> which offer the reader an idea of the key topics or points often without without explicitly relating them to specific purposes or positions. Writers in English, on the other hand, show greater awareness of the reader’s need for a specific <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose,</b> {{while at the same time}} foregrounding the role of the text itself, on a par with the writer. Use of more or less standardized signals may lead to different emphasis on dialogic and monologic positioning of the writer’s thesis. The general trend can also be closely related to both disciplinary and general academic traditions...|$|R
