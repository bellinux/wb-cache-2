40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{problems}} related {{to the use of}} synthetic fertilizers and to organic waste management have led to increased interest in the use of organic materials as an alternative source of nutrients for crops, but this is also associated with N 2 O emissions. There has been an increasing amount of research into the effects of using different types of fertilization on N 2 O emissions under Mediterranean climatic conditions, but the findings have sometimes been rather contradictory. Available information also suggests that water management could exert a high influence on N 2 O emissions. In this context, we have reviewed the current scientific knowledge, including an analysis of the effect of fertilizer type and water management on direct N 2 O emissions. A meta-analysis of compliant reviewed experiments revealed significantly lower N 2 O emissions for organic as opposed to synthetic fertilizers (23 % reduction). When organic materials were segregated in solid and liquid, only solid organic fertilizer emissions were significantly lower than those of synthetic fertilizers (28 % reduction in cumulative emissions). The EF is similar to the IPCC factor in conventionally irrigated systems (0. 98 % N 2 O-N N applied(- 1)), but one order of magnitude lower in rainfed systems (0. 08 %). Drip irrigation produces <b>intermediate</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> (0. 66 %). Differences are driven by Mediterranean agro-climatic characteristics, which include low soil organic matter (SOM) content and a distinctive rainfall and temperature pattern. Interactions between environmental and management factors and the microbial processes involved in N 2 O emissions are discussed in detail. Indirect emissions have not been fully accounted for, but when organic fertilizers are applied at similar N rates to synthetic fertilizers, they generally make smaller contributions to the leached NO 3 - pool. The most promising practices for reducing N 2 O through organic fertilization include: (i) minimizing water applications; (ii) minimizing bare soil; (iii) improving waste management; and (iv) tightening N cycling through N immobilization. The mitigation potential may be limited by: (i) residual effect; (ii) the long-term effects of fertilizers on SOM; (iii) lower yield-scaled performance; and (iv) total N availability from organic sources. Knowledge gaps identified in the review included: (i) insufficient sampling periods; (ii) high background emissions; (iii) the need to provide N 2 O EF and yield-scaled EF; (iv) the need for more research on specific cropping systems; and (v) the need for full GHG balances. In conclusion, the available information suggests a potential of organic fertilizers and water-saving practices to mitigate N 2 O emissions under Mediterranean climatic conditions, although further research is needed before it can be regarded as fully proven, understood and developed.

40|$|ObjectiveCarboplatin is {{a common}} {{chemotherapy}} agent with potential ototoxic side effects {{that is used to}} treat a variety of pediatric cancers, including retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina that is usually diagnosed in young children. Distortion-product otoacoustic emission tests offer an effective method of monitoring for ototoxicity in young children. This study was designed to compare measurements of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions obtained before and after several courses of carboplatin chemotherapy in order to examine if (a) mean distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly different; and (b) if criterion reductions in distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> were observed in individual children. MethodsA prospective repeated measures study. Ten children with a median age of 7. 6 months (range, 3 – 72 months) diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma were examined. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were acquired from both ears of the children with 65 / 55 dB SPL primary tones (f 2 = 793 – 7996 Hz) and a frequency resolution of 3 points/octave. Distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> in dB SPL were measured before chemotherapy treatment (baseline measurement) and after 3 – 4 courses of chemotherapy (interim measurement). Comparisons were made between baseline and interim distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> (collapsed across ears). Evidence of ototoxicity was based on criterion reductions (≥ 6 dB) in distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels.</b> ResultsSignificant differences between baseline and interim mean distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> were only observed at f 2 = 7996 Hz. Four children exhibited criterion reductions in distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels.</b> ConclusionsMean distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> at most frequencies were not changed following 3 – 4 courses of carboplatin chemotherapy in children with retinoblastoma. However, on an individual basis, children receiving higher doses of carboplatin exhibited criterion reductions in distortion-product otoacoustic <b>emission</b> <b>level</b> at several frequencies. These findings suggest that higher doses of carboplatin affect outer hair cell function, and distortion-product otoacoustic emission tests can provide useful information when monitoring children at risk of developing carboplatin ototoxicity...|$|R

Noise <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> of 50 excavators and 25 compactors with various power levels and ages were obtained from on-site measurements. About 74 % and 48 % of the excavators measured in this study were shown to have noise <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> below the limits specified by the Department of Environment (DOE) Malaysia and European Directive 2005 / 88 /EC respectively, while 52 % of compactors achieved levels below the EC limits. There is also a strong relationship between the mean sound pressure level and the age factor but an insignificant relationship with increases in net installed power. A comparison of measured data with BS 5228 data indicated that statistically only new data in BS 5228 : 2009 have insignificant differences from measured data. With these results new data in BS 5228 : 2009 can be used with confidence by environmental impact assessment (EIA) practitioners during the prediction of noise at the planning stage...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} an update, {{based on the}} scientific literature, of the following critical topics: [...] current (2010 global) emissions of greenhouse gases; [...] projected emissions (to 2020) of greenhouse gases under a business-as-usual (BaU) scenario; [...] projections (to 2020) of greenhouse gas emissions under four different sets of assumptions regarding implementation of national pledges to reduce emissions; [...] {{the extent to which}} parties are positioned to implement their pledges, in light of their current policy portfolios and plausible assumptions regarding macroeconomic trends and offsets. The estimated <b>emission</b> <b>level</b> in 2020 under a business-as-usual scenario is 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO 2 e) higher compared to last year's emissions gap report. While the <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> in 2020 for the strict-rules cases are higher by roughly 1 GtCO 2 e (unconditional) and are comparable to last year's <b>emission</b> <b>level</b> (conditional), the <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> associated with the two lenient-rules cases are lower by roughly 1 GtCO 2 e, as compared to last year's estimates. These changes are mainly due to decisions on surpluses made by countries during the Doha climate negotiations and downward revisions to the assumptions on double counting of offsets. They illustrate that increasing stringency through the climate negotiations can help reduce <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> in 2020 under lenient-rules cases. However, they do not reflect an increase in ambition or action, but represent a move towards stricter accounting rules. To illustrate, in last year's emissions gap report, <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> associated with the strict-rules cases were 3 GtCO 2 e lower than those of the lenient-rules cases, whereas this year they are lower by around 1 GtCO 2 e (unconditional) and 2 GtCO 2 e (conditional).
