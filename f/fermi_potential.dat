40|$|The {{theory of}} {{transitions}} between Rydberg states induced by thermal collisions, {{and of the}} broadening and shift of optical lines involving such states, is reconsidered. It is shown that the <b>Fermi</b> <b>potential</b> can be generalized {{in terms of the}} reaction matrix of the collision between a free electron and the neutral perturber. Adiabatic potential curves of the quasi-molecule are thus obtained in analogy with quantum defect theory. An adiabaticity criterion is proposed to distinguish between inelastic and quasi-elastic collisions. The scattering length approximation and JWKB wave-functions are used to obtain an approximate expression for cross-sections of quasi-elastic collisions (Δn = 0) for intermediate n values (n ∼ 15 - 20).

40|$|Ultracold neutron {{transmission}} through {{guide tubes}} has been investigated. Different polishing processes for straight, circular guide tubes are tested. A new {{effective way to}} enhance the transmission of the ultracold neutrons through guides is demonstrated. This method involves internally coating stainless steel guide tubes with deuterated polystyrene using a spinning method, or with Fomblin oil. Results show that the UCN transmission in one metre is increased from about 37 % for the honed only guide tubes to about 84 % and 88 % when coated internally with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil respectively. The enhancement in the guide tube surface quality due to the electropolishing process resulted in increasing the UCN transmission rate for the honed tube from 37 % to about 81 %. So coating a honed only tube with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil gave better transmission rates than electropolishing the tube and not coating it. The transmission measurements are for neutrons with an average axial velocity of about 9. 2 m s"-" 1. This thesis also contains {{a description of a}} new ultracold neutron detector, designed by others, with some work done here to assess its performance. Although the natural boron film used in the detector is supposed to have <b>Fermi</b> <b>potential</b> of about 1. 92 x 10 "-" 7 eV, it has been found to have either a near zero <b>Fermi</b> <b>potential</b> or a tunneling effect for the low energy ultracold neutrons, the same effect observed, by others, in LiF and " 1 " 0 BN and in lithium glass.

40|$|The Current-Based one-particle Monte Carlo (CBOPMC) {{approach}} is a statistical method for solving the famous Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in condensed matter. The basis for this method is a recent theory of exact moments of the inverse scattering operator (MISOs).

One of many advantages of the CBOPMC is that MC extracted TPs can be selectively replaced by models.
