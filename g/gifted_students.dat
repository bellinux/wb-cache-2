These principles, adapted in the 1970s for <b>gifted</b> <b>students,</b> have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.|$|E

The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted.|$|E
5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for <b>gifted</b> <b>students</b> or those wishing {{to study a}} specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk {{to prepare students for}} a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, {{and by the time he}} left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that <b>gifted</b> <b>students</b> are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child.

This pressure can cause <b>gifted</b> <b>students</b> to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. <b>Gifted</b> <b>students</b> come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} aims at better {{understanding}} {{the factors that}} promote and hinder chemistry teachers in teaching a <b>gifted</b> <b>student</b> in their regular chemistry class. In addition, it provides evidence of ways that teachers perceive a professional development course dealing with a <b>gifted</b> <b>student</b> in a mixed-abilities science classroom. Eighty-four photonarratives were collected from 14 chemistry teachers that participated in the course about teaching a <b>gifted</b> <b>student</b> in a regular classroom (41 promoting, 43 hindering factors). Factors that concern chemistry education specifically as well as general practices were raised by the teachers. The {{teachers were asked to}} “take a picture” (namely, of an external object or person); they considered most of the factors to be internal factors that are dependent on themselves and therefore concluded that they have the power to influence them. The internal factors can be addressed in the PD course; however the external factors should be managed by the school principal and district educational administration...|$|R
