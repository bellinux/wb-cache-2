2500|$|In late 1928, an Iraqi named Abdallah Damluji, who {{had been}} an adviser to Ibn Saud, {{submitted}} {{a report to the}} British on [...] "Bolshevik and Soviet penetration" [...] of the Hijaz. In this report, after highlighting Asad's activities in Arabia, Damluji alleged that Asad had connections with Bolsheviks: [...] "What is the real mission which makes him endure the greatest discomforts and the worst conditions of life? On what basis rests the close intimacy between him and Shaykh Yusuf Yasin (secretary to the King and editor of the official newspaper Umm al-Qura)? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> connection between von Weiss and the Bolshevik consulate in Jidda?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, in the {{standard}} picture of BBN, all of the light element abundances depend {{on the amount of}} ordinary matter (baryons) relative to radiation (photons). Since the universe is presumed to be homogeneous, it has one unique value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. For a long time, this meant that to test BBN theory against observations one had to ask: can all of the light element observations be explained with a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio? Or more precisely, allowing for the finite precision of both the predictions and the observations, one asks: <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> range of baryon-to-photon values which can account for all of the observations? ...|$|E

6000|$|This was {{the last}} blow, and the next night passed like a dream. I {{scarcely}} noticed the slender, sprightly, and entirely new figure which fell into the ranks {{in the place of}} Paley, so many times deceased. What could it mean? Why was the giddy Paley unfaithful among the faithful found? Did these perpetual changes prove the popularity or the unpopularity of being Paley? Was it that no human being could support being Paley for one night and live till morning? Or was it that the gates were crowded with eager throngs of the British public thirsting to be Paley, who could only be let in one at a time? Or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> ancient vendetta against Paley? Does some secret society of Deists still assassinate any one who adopts the name? ...|$|E

[...] He was about to ask his companion, but with a distant hiccough the small man had vanished. Thus deserted, Mr. Lavender was in two minds whether to ask to be readmitted, when the four gentlemen with {{notebooks}} repassed him in single file into the editor's room.|$|E
6000|$|The striving, go-ahead {{character}} of England and the United States {{is only a}} fit subject of disapproving criticism {{on account of the}} very secondary objects on which it commonly expends its strength. In itself it is the foundation of the best hopes for the general improvement of mankind. It has been acutely remarked that whenever any thing goes amiss, the habitual impulse of French people is to say, [...] "Il faut de la patience;" [...] and of English people, [...] "What a shame!" [...] The people who think it a shame when any thing goes wrong--who rush {{to the conclusion that the}} evil could and ought to have been prevented, are those who, in the long run, do most to make the world better. If the desires are low placed, if they extend to little beyond physical comfort, and the show of riches, the immediate results of the energy will not be much more than the continual extension of man's power over material objects; but even this makes room, and prepares the mechanical appliances for the greatest intellectual and social achievements; and while the energy <b>is</b> <b>there,</b> <b>some</b> persons will apply it, and it will be applied more and more, to the perfecting, not of outward circumstances alone, but of man's inward nature. Inactivity, unaspiringness, absence of desire, are a more fatal hindrance to improvement than any misdirection of energy, and is that through which alone, when existing in the mass, any very formidable misdirection by an energetic few becomes possible. It is this, mainly, which retains in a savage or semi-savage state the great majority of the human race.|$|E
