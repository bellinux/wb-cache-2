5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve innervates a {{third of}} the tongue {{including}} the circumvallate papillae. The facial nerve innervates the other two thirds of the tongue and the cheek via the chorda tympani.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{metabolic}} byproducts {{associated with}} increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> and vagus nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers {{about the need for}} increased or decreased blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.|$|E
25|$|Parasympathetic {{innervation}} to the {{salivary glands}} is carried via cranial nerves. The parotid gland receives its parasympathetic {{input from the}} <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion. These nerves release acetylcholine and substance P, which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the sense}} of taste is {{conveyed}} via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The chorda tympani is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior {{two thirds of the}} tongue, the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some taste sensations {{from the back of the}} oral cavity.|$|E
25|$|All sensory {{information}} from the face, both touch-position and pain-temperature, {{is sent to the}} trigeminal nucleus. In classical anatomy most {{sensory information}} from the face is carried by the fifth nerve, but sensation from parts of the mouth, parts of the ear and parts of the meninges is carried by general somatic afferent fibers in cranial nerves VII (the facial nerve), IX (the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve) and X (the vagus nerve).|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} superficial at its start, {{where it is}} contained in the carotid triangle of the neck, and lies behind and medial to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and covered by the deep fascia, the platysma, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle, the occipital artery and the posterior auricular artery. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles, {{the tip of the}} styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the <b>glossopharyngeal,</b> vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (CN IX) sends fibers to {{the upper}} {{epiglottis}} {{that contribute to the}} afferent limb of the gag reflex. (The gag reflex is variable in people from a limited to a hypersensitive response.) The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) sends fibers to the lower epiglottis that contribute to the efferent limb of the cough reflex. This initiates an attempt to try to dislodge the food or liquid from the windpipe.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} sulcus is {{a shallow}} groove that runs forward as a shallow groove in a V shape from the foramen cecum, forwards and outwards to the margins (borders) of the tongue. The terminal sulcus divides the tongue into a posterior pharyngeal part and an anterior oral part. The pharyngeal part is {{supplied by the}} <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve and the oral part is suppled by the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve) for somatosensory perception and by the chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve) for taste perception.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia, {{also known}} as dry mouth syndrome, can {{precipitate}} dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, {{it has been observed}} that the areas responsible for urinary system and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (<b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
500|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (IX) innervates the stylopharyngeus {{muscle and}} {{provides}} sensory innervation to the oropharynx {{and back of}} the tongue. [...] The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve also provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. Unilateral absence of a gag reflex suggests a lesion of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (IX), and perhaps the vagus nerve (X).|$|E
500|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> (IX), vagus (X) and {{accessory}} nerve (XI) all leave the skull via the jugular foramen {{to enter the}} neck. The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve provides innervation to the upper throat {{and the back of}} the tongue, the vagus provides innervation to the muscles in the voicebox, and continues downward to supply parasympathetic innervation to the chest and abdomen. [...] The {{accessory nerve}} controls the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck and shoulder.|$|E
500|$|Superior and {{inferior}} ganglia of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (IX), [...] {{are located}} {{just after the}} nerve passes through the jugular foramen and contain the cell bodies of the sensory fibers of this nerve.|$|E
500|$|Most typically, {{humans are}} {{considered}} to have twelve pairs of cranial nerves (I–XII). They are: the olfactory nerve (I), the optic nerve (II), oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII), vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and hypoglossal nerve (XII). (There may be a thirteenth cranial nerve, the terminal nerve (nerve O or N), which is very small and {{may or may not}} be functional in humans) ...|$|E
500|$|A {{cranial nerve}} exam begins with {{observation}} of the patient because some cranial nerve lesions may affect the symmetry of the eyes or face. [...] The visual fields are tested for nerve lesions or nystagmus via an analysis of specific eye movements. The sensation of the face is tested, and patients are asked to perform different facial movements, such as puffing out of the cheeks. Hearing is checked by voice and tuning forks. The position of the patient's uvula is examined because asymmetry in the position could indicate a lesion of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve. [...] After {{the ability of the}} patient to use their shoulder to assess the accessory nerve (XI), and the patient's tongue function is assessed by observing various tongue movements.|$|E
500|$|The cell {{bodies of}} many of the neurons of most of the cranial nerves are {{contained}} in one or more nuclei in the brainstem. [...] These nuclei are important relative to cranial nerve dysfunction because damage to these nuclei such as from a stroke or trauma can mimic damage to one or more branches of a cranial nerve. [...] In terms of specific cranial nerve nuclei, the midbrain of the brainstem has the nuclei of the oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and the medulla has the nuclei of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII). [...] The fibers of these cranial nerves exit the brainstem from these nuclei.|$|E
500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. [...] As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, <b>glossopharyngeal</b> breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. [...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in {{the rhythm of the}} cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction [...] include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} the holotype, which {{measures}} [...] long, {{is long and}} narrow, with a tapered snout that slopes downwards at an angle of 15°. The eye sockets were roughly {{the same size as}} the temporal openings immediately behind them. A narrow, rounded ridge along the middle of the top surface of the skull extends from near the front of the premaxilla to the back of the eye sockets. The frontal bones form a rectangular bar that separates the eye sockets down the middle. A ridge running across the bar intersects with the forward-extending ridge to produce a dagger-shaped protrusion. The jugal bone, which extends from the bottom of the eye socket back to the level of the temporal openings, is entirely bordered on its bottom by the maxilla. The squamosal bones arch around to form the curved back of the skull, and bear a ridge on top for attachment of neck muscles. There is also a ridge at the point where the two bones fuse. A cast of the braincase shows impressions of the semicircular canals and membranous inner ear, as well as canals of the hypoglossal, accessory, <b>glossopharyngeal,</b> and vagus nerves, which can also be observed on the bony exoccipital-opisthotic of the braincase. On the imperfectly-preserved lower jaw, the coronoid eminence seems to be relatively low, judging by the narrow and slightly curved top edge of the surangular bone. While the teeth have been lost, they were initially described as long, slender, and awl-shaped, with rough ridges on the outer surfaces. Although it has been suggested that Brancasaurus had very reduced tooth sockets in the premaxilla, as in Leptocleidus, this is impossible to verify because of damage to this portion of the skull.|$|E

60|$|Section 129. The ninth (<b>glossopharyngeal)</b> nerve is chiefly sensory; it is {{the special}} nerve of taste, and is {{distributed}} to the tongue. The tenth nerve (vagus) arises {{by a number of}} roots, and passes out of the skull, together with IX and XI, by the foramen lacerum -posterium- [posterius] (f.l.p.). It is a conspicuous white nerve, and runs down the neck {{by the side of the}} common carotid artery. It sends a superior laryngeal branch (Xa) to the larynx. The left vagus passes ventral to the aortic arch, and sends a branch (l.x.b.) under this along the trachea to the larynx-- the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The corresponding nerve on the right (r.x.b.) loops under the subclavian artery. The main vagus, after this branching, passes behind the heart to the oesophagus and along it to the stomach. XI., the spinal accessory, supplies certain of the neck nerves. XII., the hypoglossal, runs out of the skull by the condylar foramen (c.f.), is motor, crosses the roots of XI., X., and IX., passes ventral to the carotid, and breaks up among the muscles of the tongue and neck.|$|E
