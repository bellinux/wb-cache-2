40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court has {{frequently}} grappled with violence against women, with three major cases decided since 2000. Although the law {{can be a}} powerful tool to minimize the risk of violence against women, it can also be an obstacle <b>to</b> <b>interventions.</b> As legislators, prosecutors, and advocates implement legal <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> respond to violence against women, the Supreme Court has increasingly been called on to interpret these laws and assess their constitutionality. This legal note examines recent Supreme Court jurisprudence that addresses <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent violence against women and explain how practitioners can tailor <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> respond to these decisions...|$|R

5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E

Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government <b>intervention,</b> <b>to</b> which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAdolescents {{have special}} sexual and {{reproductive}} health needs (whether {{or not they}} are sexually active or married). This review assesses the impact of <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health (including the <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent female genital mutilation/cutting [FGM/C]) and to prevent intimate violence. Our review findings suggest that sexual and reproductive health education, counseling, and contraceptive provision are effective in increasing sexual knowledge, contraceptive use, and decreasing adolescent pregnancy. Among <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent FGM/C, community mobilization and female empowerment strategies have the potential to raise awareness of the adverse health consequences of FGM/C and reduce its prevalence; however, {{there is a need to}} conduct methodologically rigorous intervention evaluations. There was limited and inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent intimate partner violence. Further studies with rigorous designs, longer term follow-up, and standardized and validated measurement instruments are required to maximize comparability of results. Future efforts should be directed toward scaling-up evidence-based <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health in low- and middle-income countries, sustain the impacts over time, and ensure equitable outcomes...|$|R

5|$|It {{would take}} almost two full years {{until the first}} French Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and it {{required}} another popular <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> make it happen. Louis attempted {{to work within the}} framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won little support, and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive flight to Varennes in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at the guillotine in 1793.|$|E

Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E

5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E
5|$|The castle formed part of {{a network}} of defences around the {{entrance}} to the Solent during the First World War, and was re-armed again during the Second World War. The military decommissioned the fort in 1956 and it passed into the control of the Ministry of Works. In the 21st century, it is run jointly by English Heritage and the Friends of Hurst Castle as a tourist attraction, receiving around 40,000 visitors during 2015. Coastal erosion has become a growing problem despite government <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> protecting the spit. Four lighthouses have been built at Hurst from the 18th century onwards, one of which, a high lighthouse first opened in 1867, remains in active service.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E

5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the rail lines from city to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> quell.|$|E
5|$|From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria {{fought for}} control of the {{southern}} Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East. Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). Some argue that disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.|$|E
