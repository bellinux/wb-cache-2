5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of <b>fresh</b> foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for <b>fresh</b> growth.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising <b>fresh</b> pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by <b>fresh</b> blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} <b>fresh</b> blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
5|$|A {{large amount}} of lakes and rivers {{are found in the}} Eurasian Economic Union. Major lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe. The largest and most {{prominent}} of the union's bodies of <b>fresh</b> water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious <b>fresh</b> water lake. The Baikal lake alone contains over one-fifth of the world's <b>fresh</b> surface water. Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources. Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not only because it is the longest in Europe, but also because of its major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the <b>fresh</b> air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored <b>fresh</b> air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of <b>fresh</b> air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave <b>fresh</b> water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where <b>fresh</b> water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of <b>fresh</b> water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. <b>Fresh</b> water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the <b>fresh</b> water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
