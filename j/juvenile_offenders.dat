5|$|William Calcraft (11 October 1800– 13 December 1879) was a 19th-century English hangman, one of {{the most}} {{prolific}} of British executioners. It is estimated in his 45-year career he carried out 450executions. A cobbler by trade, Calcraft was initially recruited to flog <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> held in Newgate Prison. While selling meat pies on streets around the prison, Calcraft met the City of London's hangman, John Foxton.|$|E
5|$|Calcraft {{was born}} in Baddow, near Chelmsford, in 1800. He was a cobbler by trade, but had also worked as a nightwatchman at Reid's brewery in Clerkenwell, London. While {{attempting}} {{to earn a living}} by selling meat pies on the streets around Newgate Prison he made the acquaintance of John Foxton, who was the City of London's hangman for 40years. That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to flog <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> for which he was paid 10shillings a week.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} attorneys’ and mock jurors’ {{perceptions of}} a <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender’s</b> culpability were investigated. In study one, 30 attorneys from Texas responded to a survey in which they rated how likely 20 factors were to mitigate a <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender’s</b> culpability in jurors’ eyes. In study two, college students, serving as mock jurors, saw {{a photo of a}} <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender</b> and read a trial transcript. This study determined whether a <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender’s</b> appearance (youthful vs. adult-like) and mock jurors’ perceptions of the current crime trend would affect their verdict and sentence recommendations. Attorneys thought a juvenile offenders’ youthful appearance would mitigate his culpability in jurors’ eyes, but that jurors’ perceptions of the crime trend would not mitigate his culpability in jurors’ eyes. However, study two found that mock jurors’ verdicts only differed depending on their perceptions of the current crime trend and were not affected by a <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender’s</b> youthful appearance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{efficacy}} of <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender</b> assessments. Data from 104 <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender</b> assessments were analyzed and followed up with placement, subsequent offending, and outcome data from the juvenile and adult systems. Constructs consistently assessed included intellectual functioning, academic achievement, and personality functioning; however, under-diagnosis of intellectual deficits, learning disabilities, and personality disorders was found. Results indicated the assessment of family functioning, substance use, and social functioning should be included in comprehensive assessments, as they may result in alternative placement and treatment options of benefit to the <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender.</b> A <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender</b> typology proposed by DiCataldo and Grisso (1995) was successfully utilized and proved predictive of recidivism, future harm to others, and outcome...|$|R
5|$|Stevenson also {{advocated}} {{careful study}} of the state's finances to deal with increasing expenditures. He insisted that the state stop covering its short-term indebtedness using bonds. However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit segregation in schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of significant value, the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. State legislators rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau of immigration and statistics to spur interest in and migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E

25|$|MILESTONES program {{objective}} is to facilitate a transformation in the juvenile offender’s behavior from delinquent and addictive to pro-social and healthy. The program staff and treatment team develop individual and community strategies to help eliminate and/or manage undesirable behaviors and reinforce those that are socially acceptable with positive outcomes. The JCC–L program model incorporates mentoring, cognitive restructuring, social learning, and cause and effect reinforcement. JCC-L recognizes that most <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> including those who are lower functioning, still possess a level of reasoning, response, {{and the ability to}} identify simple patterns. These <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> also possess the necessary tools to facilitate self-change. Consistent with cognitive theory, the expressed thoughts and beliefs of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> are tracked over time to establish patterns of thinking. Cognitive interventions target both beliefs and thoughts, identify those with positive and negative ultimate outcomes, and subsequently facilitate a change in behavior. In addition to providing alternative coping skills and competencies, the Milestone program also reduces risk levels. Any idea, belief, or circumstance which causes a juvenile to gravitate to inappropriate/illegal behavior is a risk factor.|$|E

Data were examined on the subjects' age, race/ethnicity, length of time at the facility, level of resocialization, and resiliency score. The resocialization programming contains cognitive and social components that would be instrumental in augmenting <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender</b> resiliency levels. Analysis of the variables did not show a significant increase in <b>juvenile</b> <b>offender</b> resiliency levels. The results did display that students who were at the facility longer and who were in the older age groups had higher levels of resocialization...|$|R

25|$|Until Kennedy v. Louisiana, {{some states}} were testing {{the limit of}} this {{restriction}} by enacting death penalty statutes for repeat child rapists. In terms of the Court's capital punishment jurisprudence, Coker signaled the Court's commitment to employing a robust proportionality test for deciding when the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment. The Court would later use this same proportionality test to evaluate the propriety {{of the death penalty}} for felony murder (except for the actual killer), mentally retarded offenders, <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> and eventually all crimes except murder and crimes against the state.|$|E

25|$|As of May 2009, {{there were}} at least 137 known <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> {{awaiting}} execution in Iran, but the total number could be much higher as many death penalty cases in Iran are believed to go unreported. Of the 43 child offenders recorded as having been executed since 1990, 11 were still under the age of 18 {{at the time of their}} execution while the others were either kept on death row until they had reached 18 or were convicted and sentenced after reaching that age.

25|$|In {{addition}} to a fine or jail term, the Act imposes mandatory corporal punishment of between three and eight strokes of the cane for second or subsequent convictions. Caning is also imposed for first convictions for defacing property using an indelible substance; and stealing, destroying or damaging public property. The Children and Young Persons Act ("CYPA") states that the High Court may impose a caning penalty on <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> as well. In a 1968 case, the High Court held that despite the wording of this provision, a subordinate court may sentence juveniles to caning under the Vandalism Act as that Act takes precedence over the CYPA.|$|E
25|$|In the Kids {{for cash}} scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who {{promoted}} {{a platform of}} zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Walmart. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offences are normalized. The documentary Kids for Cash interviews experts on adolescent behaviour, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offences after the Columbine shooting.|$|E
