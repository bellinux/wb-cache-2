5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused.

5|$|Furthermore, {{the work}} has two large concerto {{movements}} for organ and orchestra, probably from a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche.

5|$|A longer 116-minute copy of {{the film}} has not been {{released}} officially, but has been found as a bootleg.

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E
5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E

5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> water was freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tropical}} depression formed east of Guam on July21. It tracked westward, passing near the island on July23, and later shifted {{more to the}} west-northwest. On July26, a ship reported a low pressure of , <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system was a typhoon. The system later passed between the Philippines and Taiwan as it entered the South China Sea, but no land areas reported strong winds, suggesting the typhoon was either very small or had weakened from its peak. On July29, the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Shantou in southeastern China, quickly dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Current {{knowledge}} on genetic diversity is fragmentary {{and the total}} number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diversity among these organisms remains obscure. The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization.|$|E

Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|Haifa was {{captured}} from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army after overrunning Ottoman positions armed with spears and swords. On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Turks were leaving Haifa. The British made preparations {{to enter the}} city and came under fire in the Balad al-Sheikh district (today Nesher). After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel.|$|E

5|$|However, an {{analysis}} of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that climate change did not {{play a major role in}} its extinction. Its distribution during the Miocene and Pliocene did not correlate with warming and cooling trends; while abundance and distribution declined during the Pliocene, megalodon did show a capacity to inhabit anti-tropical latitudes. It was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from , with a total range of , <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> global extent of suitable habitat should not have been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
