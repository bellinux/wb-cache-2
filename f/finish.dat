25|$|Mass <b>finishing</b> is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously <b>finished.</b> The goal of this type of <b>finishing</b> is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further <b>finishing,</b> or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass <b>finishing</b> are tumble <b>finishing,</b> also known as barrel <b>finishing,</b> and vibratory <b>finishing.</b> Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are <b>finished</b> against each other; however, usually a <b>finishing</b> medium is used. Mass <b>finishing</b> can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic Abrasive <b>Finishing</b> (MAF) is {{relatively}} a new <b>finishing</b> technique that employs the magnetic force for <b>finishing.</b> In the paper, <b>finishing</b> mechanism of MAF is studied and four self-sharpening modes of abrasive particles are put forward. With the cylindrical magnetic abrasive apparatus designed and {{made by the}} author, a series of experiments on <b>finishing</b> the cylindrical surfaces of nonferromagnetic materials and ferromagnetic materials are carried out. The influence of technical parameters (<b>finishing</b> speed, feed speed, <b>finishing</b> time and so on) on <b>finishing</b> performance is analyzed. Choosing the optimized technical parameters,, the surface roughness of ferromagnetic materials changes from Ra 0. 825 µm to Ra 0. 045 µm after the 12 -minute <b>finishing</b> experiment; the surface roughness of nonferromagnetic materials changes from Ra 0. 434 µm to Ra 0. 096 µm after the 20 -minute <b>finishing</b> experiment...|$|R
