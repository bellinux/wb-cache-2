2500|$|In general, blood damage affects valves in {{both the}} mitral and aortic positions. [...] High {{stresses}} during leakage flow in aortal valves result from higher transvalvular pressures, and high stresses occur during forward flow for mitral valves. [...] Valvular thrombosis is most common in mitral prosthetics. [...] The caged-ball model {{is better than the}} other two models in terms of controlling this problem, because it is at a lower risk for thrombosis and it is gradual when <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] The bileaflet is more adaptable to this problem than the tilting-disc model because if one leaflet stops working, the other can still function. [...] However, if the hinge is blocked, both leaflets will stop functioning.|$|E

2500|$|Hina Jilani, one of {{the four}} writers of the [...] "Goldstone Report", noted when asked if the report should {{allegedly}} be changed: [...] "Absolutely not; no process or acceptable procedure would invalidate the UN Report; if <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen,</b> it would be seen as a 'suspect move'." [...] Also another of the four co-writers, Irish international criminal investigations expert Desmond Travers, noted: 'the tenor of the report in its entirety, in my opinion, stands'. Also Goldstone maintained that, although the one correction should be made, he had [...] "no reason to believe any part of the report needs to be reconsidered at this time" [...] and that he didn't plan to pursue nullifying the report.|$|E
2500|$|Fallback and auto-detection: [...] UTF-8 {{provided}} {{backwards compatibility}} for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit extended ASCII encodings designed {{prior to the}} adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. [...] Part of the popularity of UTF-8 {{is due to the fact}} that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. [...] A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an extended ASCII file as input can [...] "fall back" [...] or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode Latin-1 Supplement block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. Though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen,</b> the 8-bit characters in extended ASCII encodings do not usually have the correct form for UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the 8-bit bytes which introduce multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 continuation bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. [...] To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters. In short, extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and not significantly. [...] These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the HTML5 standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are Windows-1252 characters. [...] The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to [...] "auto-detect" [...] that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{corroboration}} test {{used here}} is like inferential statistics. The null {{hypothesis is that}} the historical event assumed by tradition alone didn't happen.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> {{that there}} are very {{singular}} circumstances in this business, to which your Lordships will advert; and you will consider what weight {{they ought to have}} upon your Lordships' minds. The person who is now the solicitor of the Company is a very respectable man in the profession,--Mr. Smith; he was at that time also the Company's solicitor, and he has since appeared in this cause as Mr. Hastings's solicitor. Now there is something particular in a man's being the solicitor to a party who was prosecuting another, and continuing afterwards in his office, and becoming the solicitor to the party prosecuted. It would be nearly as strange as if our solicitor were to be the solicitor of Mr. Hastings in this prosecution and trial before your Lordships. It is true, that we cannot make out, nor do we attempt to prove, that Mr. Smith was at that time actually Mr. Hastings's solicitor: all that we shall attempt to make out is, that the case he produced was just such a case as a solicitor anxious for the preservation of his client, and not anxious for the prosecution, would have made out.|$|E

It is barely possible that the influence of a sensible woman--possessed of such advantages of birth and fortune as may compel respect, even from a savage--might produce its effect on Geoffrey. If he wishes to find his way back into this house, let him find his way back into good society first, and bring me a daughter-in-law to plead his cause for him--whom his mother and I can respect and receive.

60|$|The dogmatic objection, {{the sheer}} instinctive taboo which rules the subject out {{altogether}} as indecent, has no age limit.

When this actually happens (and apparently <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> oftener than would seem possible) a horrible fraud is being practiced on both {{the man and the}} woman. He is led to believe that she knows what she is promising, and that he is in no danger of finding himself bound to a woman to whom he is eugenically antipathetic. She contemplates nothing but such affectionate relations as may exist between her and her nearest kinsmen, and has no knowledge of the condition which, if not foreseen, must come as an amazing revelation and a dangerous shock, ending possibly in the discovery that the marriage has been an irreparable mistake. Nothing can justify such a risk. There may be people incapable of understanding that the right to know all {{there is to know about}} oneself is a natural human right that sweeps away all the pretences of others to tamper with one's consciousness in order to produce what they choose to consider a good character.

60|$|It {{has long}} been a {{conversational}} commonplace among the enlightened that all countries are coming closer and closer to each other. It was a conversational commonplace among the enlightened, somewhere about the year 1913, that all wars were receding farther and farther into a barbaric past. There is something about these sayings that seems simple and familiar and entirely satisfactory when we say them; they are of that consoling sort which we can say without any of the mental pain of thinking what we are saying. But if we turn our attention from the phrases we use to the facts that we talk about, we shall realise at least that there are a good many facts {{on the other side and}} examples pointing the other way. For instance, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> occasionally, from time to time, that people talk about Ireland. He would be a very hilarious humanitarian who should maintain that Ireland and England have been more and more assimilated during the last hundred years. The very name of Sinn Fein is an answer to it, and the very language in which that phrase is spoken. Curran and Sheil would no more have dreamed of uttering the watchword of 'Repeal' in Gaelic than of uttering it in Zulu. Grattan could hardly have brought himself to believe that the real repeal of the Union would actually be signed in London in the strange script as remote as the snaky ornament of the Celtic crosses. It would have seemed like Washington signing the Declaration of Independence in the picture-writing of the Red Indians. Ireland has clearly grown away from England; and her language, literature, and type of patriotism are far less English than they were. On the other hand, no one will pretend that the mass of modern Englishmen are much nearer to talking Gaelic or decorating Celtic crosses. A hundred years ago it was perfectly natural that Byron and Moore should walk down the street arm in arm. Even the sight of Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Mr. W. B. Yeats walking down the street arm in arm would now arouse some remark.|$|E
