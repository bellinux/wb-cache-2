5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile Cuban macaws were green, {{though he did}} not provide any source for this claim. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban macaws or if they were instead feral military macaws (Ara militaris).|$|E
5|$|Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, later {{stated that}} his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an {{explosion}} on 9 March. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the bombing cited by Browne {{was the same as}} the one described by the villagers.|$|E
50|$|In the end, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> any non-attendees (see below) {{were absent}} for {{specifically}} this reason.|$|R

5|$|Currently, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{waves are}} an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves {{have been found}} to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. He observes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> such theft {{is on the}} rise, as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|In his 1995 revision, Nelson {{refers to}} {{putative}} hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper {{in which he}} published putative hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.forrestii. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the reference to A.apiculatus is an error or a fourth putative hybrid.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the {{operations}} were successful, {{due to the}} complexity of their execution, poor weather, and lack of response from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of D-Day as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> {{the story}} of the Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E

5|$|Many major {{web sites}} patched the bug or {{disabled}} the Heartbeat Extension {{within days of}} its announcement, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> potential attackers were aware of it earlier {{and to what extent}} it was exploited.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these have carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Two compounds {{that have been}} identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter {{is responsible for the}} brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.|$|E

50|$|In March 2007 {{there were}} reports of riots in Hassakeh Province between Christians and {{predominantly}} Muslim Kurds. There were reports of three deaths. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> there <b>was</b> any religious basis to the conflict.|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} Persian troops present at Thermopylae is {{therefore}} as uncertain {{as the number}} for the total invasion force. For instance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E
50|$|In late 2012, MTV3 {{announced}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> Idols would return for another season. However, on 26 February 2013, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{announced that}} Idols would return in 2013 {{to celebrate the}} series' tenth anniversary.|$|R

5|$|Constantine I {{completed}} {{the separation of}} military commands from the administrative structure. The vicarii and praefecti praetorio lost their field commands and became purely administrative officials. However, they retained {{a central role in}} military affairs, as they remained responsible for military recruitment, pay and, above all, supply. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> the duces on the border now reported direct to the emperor, or to one of the two magistri of the comitatus.|$|E
5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he thought he could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E

50|$|A June 2014 {{report on}} Royalties for Regions by the Western Australian Auditor General found that, while {{the program had}} {{provided}} substantial infrastructure and service projects to regional Western Australia, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> <b>whether</b> these projects <b>were</b> delivering their intended outcomes.|$|R
