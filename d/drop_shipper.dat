5000|$|A related {{concept is}} drop shipping, a {{commercial}} process used in direct-to-consumer marketing. A drop-shipper {{relies on a}} third party, like an online fashion blog to generate consumer interest and initiate an electronic order that {{is sent to the}} drop shipper's warehouse for fulfillment. The profits are split between the <b>drop</b> <b>shipper</b> and the nominal seller at a pre-arranged rate, usually involving a commission structure. Because only the <b>drop</b> <b>shipper</b> has physical facilities, the notional online [...] "retailer" [...] faces much lower costs. This allows consumers to realize prices closer to the wholesale level, but it disadvantages retailers who lose control over many aspects of customer service, discounting, packaging etc.|$|E

These are members or {{entities}} that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just {{someone who has been}} in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these <b>drop</b> <b>shippers</b> have become more and more commonplace in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Suppliers: Suppliers provide raw {{materials}} that are required to build products. There are 7 different types of Suppliers: Manufacturers, wholesalers, merchants, franchisors, importers and exporters, independent crafts people and <b>drop</b> <b>shippers.</b> Each category of suppliers can bring a different skill and experience to the company.|$|R
50|$|Some {{other large}} {{e-commerce}} sellers use Amazon {{to sell their}} products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.Amazon also employs the use of <b>drop</b> <b>shippers</b> or meta sellers.

40|$|Abstract — At {{the time}} of a {{customer}} order, the e-tailer assigns the order {{to one or more}} of its order fulfillment centers, and/or to <b>drop</b> <b>shippers,</b> so as to minimize procurement and transportation costs, based on the available current information. However this assignment is necessarily myopic as it cannot account for all future events, such as subsequent customer orders or inventory replenishments. We examine the potential benefits from periodically re-evaluating these real-time order-assignment decisions. We construct near-optimal heuristics for the re-assignment for a large set of customer orders with the objective to minimize the total number of shipments. We investigate how best to implement these heuristics for a rolling horizon, and discuss the effect of demand correlation, customer order size, and the number of customer orders {{on the nature of the}} heuristics. Finally, we present potential saving opportunities by testing the heuristics on sets of order data from a major e-tailer. Index Terms — Fulfillment, Assignment, Network Design I...|$|R
