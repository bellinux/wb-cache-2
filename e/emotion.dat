40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Literature on {{relationships}} of <b>emotions</b> to psychological adjustment has mainly focused on unitarily valenced affect (i. e., {{positive or negative}} <b>emotions).</b> Although individuals commonly experience mixed <b>emotions,</b> including both positively- and negatively-valenced <b>emotions,</b> in daily life, {{little is known about}} how normative mixed <b>emotions</b> relate to adjustment. The current study aims to explore the relationship between mixed <b>emotions</b> and internalizing symptoms, with consideration of the duration and intensity of mixed <b>emotions</b> as key variables. Undergraduate students (n= 482) who were recruited from introductory psychology courses completed measures of trait and state affect, emotional awareness, emotional intensity and stability, dichotomous thinking style, and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that the duration of mixed <b>emotions</b> is a critical variable that determines the relationship between mixed <b>emotions</b> and internalizing symptoms. Specifically, higher dispositional mixed <b>emotions</b> were associated with higher depression and anxiety, whereas higher momentary mixed <b>emotions</b> were associated with higher emotional awareness. Also, negative attitude toward mixed <b>emotions</b> was related with preference for dichotomy.

5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize <b>emotion</b> was found. Performances on <b>emotion</b> recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher <b>emotion</b> recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E

However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that reason could defeat <b>emotion.</b> On the contrary, he contended, an <b>emotion</b> can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger <b>emotion.</b> For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not.

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or <b>emotion</b> seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is an <b>emotion</b> that is felt in {{all stages}} of infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying <b>emotion</b> that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key <b>emotion</b> within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective <b>emotion</b> because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

5000|$|Emotion: <b>Emotions</b> are one's {{feelings}} {{in response to}} a certain situation. There are six types of emotion: social <b>emotions,</b> counterfactual <b>emotions,</b> <b>emotions</b> generated by what may happen (often manifested as anxiety), <b>emotions</b> generated by joy and grief (examples found in responses typically seen when a student gets a good grade, and when a person is at a funeral, respectively), thought-triggered <b>emotions</b> (sometimes manifested as flashbacks), and finally <b>emotions</b> of love and disgust. All of these <b>emotions</b> are considered to be unresolved. There are six features that are used to define emotions: intentional objects, valence, cognitive antecedents, physiological arousal, action tendencies, and lastly physiological expressions. These six concepts were identified by Aristotle and are still the topic of several talks.|$|R
30|$|The {{link between}} <b>emotions</b> and {{cognition}} prompted studies investigating {{into the relationship}} between <b>emotions</b> and the learning achievement of students. Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, and Perry (2002) opined that academic <b>emotions</b> (which are linked to academic learning, classroom instruction and achievements) {{with the exception of}} test anxiety are largely neglected by educational psychology research. They embarked on a series of qualitative and quantitative studies to uncover the academic <b>emotions</b> experienced by students and the effects of these <b>emotions</b> on the students’ learning and achievements. Their findings revealed that students experience a wide repertoire of <b>emotions</b> in academic settings and both positive <b>emotions</b> e.g. hope, pride and relief and negative <b>emotions</b> such as anxiety and boredom are prevalent in learning. The positive <b>emotions</b> e.g. enjoyment of learning affect achievement positively by strengthening motivation and enhancing flexible learning whereas the negative <b>emotions</b> e.g. anxiety erodes motivation and draws attention away from the task, resulting in shallow learning. The effects that both positive and negative <b>emotions</b> have on learning were also corroborated by other researchers (Ashcraft & Kirk, 2001; Greene & Noice, 1988; Isen, 2000).|$|R

(2007) further fuel the discussion with a classification of some other basic <b>emotions,</b> that is, pride, lust, ecstasy, rage, revenge, sorrow, shame, grief, enthusiasm, and hate in tandem with the basic <b>emotions</b> categorized by Plutchik and Zammuner. Bindu et al. further claim that these basic <b>emotions</b> may give birth to complex <b>emotions</b> as well which could include remorse, nostalgia, forgiveness, offense, disappointment, jealousy, cheer, hope, etc. However, Ekman’s (2007) arguments are worth mentioning here, whereby he notes the universality of the basic <b>emotions,</b> that is, happiness, sadness, pride, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise.

To control and reduce {{the negative impact of}} <b>emotions,</b> we have built a virtual driving environment in which we can capture and analyse <b>emotions</b> felt by the driver using EEG systems. By simulating specific emotional situations we can provoke these <b>emotions</b> and detect their types and intensity according to the driver. Then, in the environment, we generate corrective actions that are able to reduce the <b>emotions.</b> After a training period, the driver is able to correct the <b>emotions</b> by himself...|$|R
