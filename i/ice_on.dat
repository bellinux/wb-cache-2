5|$|Although Hudson {{anticipated}} that the trip would take less than a month, it took 56 days. Most of the journey was by water, and <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the Niagara River, inclement weather and <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> Lake Erie, and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers' slow progress. Although <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat, the group reached Cleaveland (present-day Cleveland, Ohio) on June 9, 1799. After purchasing more supplies, they set off down the Cuyahoga River. Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats {{as far south as}} required, they only reached present-day Northfield on June 20. When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four boundary markers, finding the southwest marker in late June. Only one of the two groups herding cattle overland reached the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the river {{prevented}} the artillery from finishing the crossing until 3 am on December26. The troops were {{not ready to}} march until 4 am.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> ponds.|$|E
50|$|Award-winning Tony Mercer {{has created}} ice {{shows such as}} The Sleeping Beauty <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> The Nutcracker <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Cinderella <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Barnum <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Phantom of the Opera <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Peter Pan <b>on</b> <b>Ice</b> and Carmen <b>on</b> <b>Ice.</b> With his {{productions}} of The Sleeping Beauty <b>on</b> <b>Ice</b> (2004-06 and 2007-09), Swan Lake <b>on</b> <b>Ice</b> (2006-08) and Cinderella <b>on</b> <b>Ice</b> (2008-2010), performed by The Imperial Ice Stars, {{he has tried to}} broaden the genre of 'Theatre on Ice' and its appeal to a more adult audience.|$|R

5|$|Haumea's moons are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They are thought to be part of its {{extended}} collisional family, which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiʻiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. He lay on the ice {{for a few minutes}} before being able to leave the <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
50|$|That {{same year}} Cundall and fellow {{producer}} Tony Mercer established The Imperial Ice Stars, an international troupe of former Olympic, World, European and National Championship skaters. The troupe have since successfully toured {{the world to}} much acclaim with their productions of The Sleeping Beauty <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Swan Lake <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Cinderella <b>on</b> <b>Ice</b> and The Nutcracker <b>on</b> <b>Ice.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also, he has choreographed {{ensemble}} {{numbers for}} Stars <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> Holiday Festival <b>on</b> <b>Ice,</b> The <b>Ice,</b> and Fantasy <b>on</b> <b>Ice.</b> He worked {{as part of}} the choreography team on the Canadian TV competition show Battle of the Blades, {{and was one of the}} choreographers for Intimissimi <b>on</b> <b>Ice</b> - OPERAPOP 2014.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Cousins formed his own {{ice skating}} {{performance}} company, which toured {{the world with}} the programs Electric Ice and Ice Majesty.

5|$|Internationally, Aulie {{played in}} the 2009 World Junior Championships, where he paired with Tyler Myers on defence and helped Canada capture a gold medal. He {{was traded to the}} Toronto Maple Leafs in trade for Dion Phaneuf, among others, from the Flames during the 2009–10 season. Aulie made his NHL debut with the Maple Leafs in November 2010. Off the ice, Aulie was honoured by the Canadian Red Cross for saving his father after he fell through <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the family farm.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 2013, Bozon {{signed a}} three-year entry level {{contract}} with the Canadiens. He was returned by the Canadiens to the Blazers for a third year with the team {{prior to the start}} of the 2013–14 season. After starting the season with the Blazers, where he was fifth in team scoring with seven points in thirteen games, Bozon was traded to the Kootenay <b>Ice</b> <b>on</b> October 22, 2013. The Blazers, who also sent defenceman Landon Cross, received Colin Shirley, Matt Thomas, and three draft picks in return.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2013, in a {{match against}} the Montreal Canadiens, Glass broke his hand {{blocking}} a shot from P.K. Subban.

5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them {{to the edge of the}} pack <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> 4 February.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to visit Jupiter were Pioneer10 in 1973, and Pioneer11 a year later, taking low-resolution {{images of the}} four Galilean moons. The Voyager1 and Voyager2 probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity onIo {{and the presence of}} water <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the surface of Europa. The Cassini probe to Saturn flew by Jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the Galilean moons with Jupiter's extended atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its satellites' orbital parameters.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of Østgaard of Norway, Jilek of Czechoslovakia and Straumann of Switzerland. Because of <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the in-run, a reduced speed was {{used during the}} first round. Andersen jumped 60.0meters, by far the longest jump. Lengthwise, Ruud and Vuilleumier were in joint second place with 57.5meters, while Burket was in fourth with 57.0meters. Thams, Kleppen and Poland's Bronisław Czech all jumped 56.5meters, but both Kleppen and Czech fell. In terms of points, the three Norwegians Andersen, Ruud and Thams were in the lead, ahead of Burket and Vuilleumier.|$|E

5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued to plow and remove <b>ice.</b> <b>On</b> the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including a shipment of refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E

5|$|In 1926 and 1927, Norwegian Eyvind Tofte circumnavigated and {{surveyed}} the island from Odd I. However, he was also prevented from landing. The Norwegian whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic, in part for research and in part to claim land for Norway. The latter was motivated by the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic, and Christensen hoped {{to be able to}} establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges and so at least the taxes went to his home country. The first expedition to land on the island was the Christensen-financed second Norvegia expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad. They landed on 2 February 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. Larsen attempted to land again in 1931, but was hindered by pack <b>ice.</b> <b>On</b> 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. homes by the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, but by the end of the 20th century there were very few physical reminders of the trade.|$|E
5|$|Mining ceased in Ny-Ålesund in 1929; it {{was taken}} up again in 1941, {{but because of the}} Second World War the town was {{evacuated}} the following year. From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny-Ålesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land if there was no <b>ice</b> <b>on</b> the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of the flights that year was an air ambulance operation. The service also dropped post at the other Norwegian settlements in Svalbard. In 1961, the Catalinas were replaced with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft.|$|E
