50|$|The South American {{pilchard}} (Sardinops sagax) is a sardine of {{the family}} Clupeidae, {{the only member of}} the genus Sardinops. It is found in the Indo-Pacific and East Pacific oceans. Its length is up to 40 cm. It has other names, some of which more appropriately refer to subspecies, including blue pilchard, Australian pilchard (S. s. neopilchardus), blue-bait, Californian pilchard (S. s. caeruleus), Chilean sardine (S. s. sagax), <b>Japanese</b> <b>pilchard</b> (S. s. melanostictus), Pacific sardine, and Southern African pilchard (S. s. ocellatus).|$|E
40|$|Taurine {{content of}} Pacific {{mackerel}} Scomber japonicus, Japanese horse mackerel Trachurus japonicus, <b>Japanese</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardinops melanostictus, and Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonica fished {{in the period}} from 1984 to 1987 near southern Kyushu was studied, as well as distributions of taurine in those fish bodies. Amounts of taurine contained in 100 g of whole body were {{in the range of}} 100 - 200 mg in all the samples analyzed with a few exceptions. Taurine concentrations in dark muscle and internal organs were much higher than that in white muscle. 1984 年から 1987 年の間に南九州海域で漁獲されたマサバS. japonicus,マアジT. japonicus,マイワシS. melanostictus,およびカタクチイワシE. japonicaの各魚体部位のタウリン含量を調べ,次のような結果を得た。 1) 4 魚種とも全魚体 100 g当たりのタウリン含量は 100 ~ 200 mgの範囲にほぼおさまっており,漁獲時期,魚体の大きさ,および性別による大きな差は認められなかった。 2) 血合肉ならびに内臓には普通肉に比べて高濃度のタウリンが含まれていた。特にマサバおよびマイワシの血合肉の含量濃度が高く,普通肉の 10 倍以上になる例も見られた...|$|E
30|$|Because intron size {{cannot be}} {{predicted}} {{and there may}} be considerable variations even between closely related taxa, draft genome sequences of the Pacific bluefin tuna were used to select primer pairs for PCR testing. A total of 12 primer pairs expected to amplify RP gene introns of the Pacific bluefin tuna with lengths of 500 – 1000  bp were selected for ease of sizing, and PCR amplification was attempted using template DNA of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>pilchard</b> (Sardinops melanostictus), the Japanese puffer (Takifugu rubripes), starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus), the Pacific bluefin tuna (T. orientalis), broadbanded thornyhead (Sebastolobus macrochir), and the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), all derived from the tissue collection in our laboratory. These fishes belong to the Orders Clupeiformes, Tetraodontiformes, Pleuronectiformes, Perciformes, Scorpaeniformes, and Anguilliformes, respectively, and used to evaluate universal specificity of the primer pairs selected. PCR amplification was carried out in a 12  µL final volume containing 1  µL of template DNA (10 – 50  ng/µL), 1.2  µL of 10  × reaction buffer (containing 20  mM MgCl 2), 1  mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.4  µM of each primer, and 0.5 U of EX Taq polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan). The same reaction conditions were used for all primer pairs, in which the reaction mixtures were preheated to 94  °C for 4  min, followed by 35 amplification cycles (denaturing at 94  °C for 30  s, annealing at 56  °C for 30  s, and extension at 72  °C for 50  s), with a final extension at 72  °C for 7  min. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5  % agarose gels (UltraPure Agarose; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and stained with ethidium bromide. The gel images visualized on transilluminator were captured by CCD camera.|$|E
