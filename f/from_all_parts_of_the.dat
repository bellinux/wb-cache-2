5|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1805 by Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza carbonaria. Mordecai Cubitt Cooke illustrated the fruitbodies, spores, and asci in his 1879 work Mycographia, seu Icones fungorum. Figures of fungi <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. In 1889, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus Geopyxis, giving the species its current name. Pustularia carbonaria, published by Heinrich Rehm in 1884, is a synonym of G.carbonaria. Louis-Joseph Grélet proposed the variety Geopyxis carbonaria var. sessilis in 1937, referring to forms producing fruitbodies without a stalk, but the taxon {{is not considered}} to have independent taxonomic significance. In 1860 Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Peziza lepida from collections made in Japan {{as part of the}} North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition (1853–1856). This taxon was synonymized with G.carbonaria by Mien Rifai in 1968, a taxonomic opinion corroborated by Donald Pfister about a decade later.|$|E

Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested.

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E
