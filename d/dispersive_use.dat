30|$|Surfactants are {{chemicals}} {{with a high}} {{production volume}} and a wide <b>dispersive</b> <b>use,</b> i.e. surfactants have a high environmental impact. The question of the persistence of a particular substance {{is one of the}} most important aspects for the assessment of the risks associated with chemical substances (EU Technical Guidance Document, 2003). Therefore, strict legal requirements for the aerobic biodegradability of surfactants have been established on national and international level, e.g. the EU Detergent Regulation (EC/ 648 / 2004). The most common fate for surfactants is that they are discharged via waste water. Surfactant containing domestic and industrial waste water is collected and purified in professionally operated waste water treatment plants. Taking into account the strict legal requirements assuring the use of biodegradable surfactants, the vast majority of surfactant molecules entering a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) are readily broken down to CO 2 and H 2 O. Only a very small fraction of the surfactants is not aerobically broken down during the usual hydraulic retention times of modern WWTPs. This fraction, due to the predominantly hydrophobic nature of surfactants, adheres to the sludge. The sludge is usually collected and further treated under anaerobic conditions in digester tanks. Therefore, the knowledge about anaerobic biodegradability under digester tank conditions is important to gain an understanding about the environmental fate of surfactants.

30|$|Nanomaterials {{have a low}} bulk density. This {{comes along}} with a {{typically}} high technical effectiveness caused by a high specific surface area and changes of reactivity, respectively. These characteristics together allow a wide <b>dispersive</b> <b>use</b> by a low mass application of the substance. Therefore {{and because of the}} uncertainties regarding (eco-) toxicology, environmental fate and exposure information requirements should already apply at lower tonnage bands. Following the structure of the REACH regulation for tonnage-based triggers, it would be reasonable to stipulate a simplified registration for nanomaterials starting from 100  kg/a, which requires information about substance identity, characterisation and use. Starting at a tonnage band of 1  t/a, requirements regarding (eco-) toxicology listed in a new nanospecific annex have to be fulfilled. This nanospecific annex covers information requirements for the different tonnage levels. With respect to environment, these nanospecific information requirements subject chronic tests instead of acute tests at lower tonnage levels. Regarding the presumable partitioning of nanomaterials within the environment, appropriate target organisms have to be taken into account. That means information requirements must cover toxicity to sediment and soil organisms at lower tonnages. Furthermore, low water solubility as the exclusive waiving criterion for aquatic testing is not appropriate for nanomaterials, since also insoluble nanomaterials can show effects in the environment. Moreover, a chemical safety report, which considers every nanoform separately, has to be submitted if the sum of all nanoforms of a substance reaches the quantity of 1  t/a. Future adjustments regarding assessment concepts and test guidelines have to be taken into account.|$|E

Offered as a template rather than a prediction, this model projects current production practices and existing abatement frameworks to yield insights into how atmospheric composition and radiative forcing might change with and without additional efforts to constrain HFC- 23 emissions. Assuming that no additional abatement measures are implemented, emissions for year 2035 in this Reference Case would rise to 24 ktonnes yr− 1 , (cf., 8. 6 ktonnes yr− 1 in 2009), the atmospheric abundance of HFC- 23 would rise to 50 ppt, which is a 121 % increase over the 2009 observed abundance, and HFC- 23 {{would be expected to}} contribute a radiative forcing of 9 mW m− 2 (cf., 4 mW m− 2 in 2009).

40|$|One of Sweden’s 16 {{national}} environmental objectives includes a sub-objective that 60 % of phosphorus will be recycled from wastewater to agriculture by 2015. The use of sludge {{as a medium}} in which to return phosphorus to agriculture {{is seen as the}} best solution. There is however a societal and regulatory demand that the sludge be of a certain quality and silver is one toxin of focus. Until recently, many Swedish wastewater treatment plants have seen a rapid decrease in silver concentrations. Why the decrease has halted is unknown but emerging consumer products {{is considered to be a}} potential source. The Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten) oversees the sludge certification system (REVAQ) and is interested in the use of silver and stakeholder positions and activities. This study documents niche markets, current research and regulatory trends and stakeholder positions surrounding this issue. Literature review was conducted, interviews and correspondence with stakeholders were executed and a consumer survey was administered to gather information. Silver-treated (anti-odor) textiles and hygiene products, which have received some attention in Sweden and are of most focus for this study, are shown by research to represent a minor but diffuse portion of total silver pollution. Research regarding degree of risk associated with silver is not conclusive but regulatory action is oncoming with the EU Biocide Directive, for which the Swedish Chemical Agency (KemI) is responsible for silver-related recommendations. Some non-industry stakeholders are concerned about <b>dispersive</b> <b>use</b> of silver, accumulation in soils, and market expansion. Consumers appear to value the anti-odor function to a certain degree and are willing to pay for it, at least when not specifically made aware of potential risks. When aware of potential risks, reception to the function is considerably less favorable. Pro-silver industry stakeholders see silver treatments as the best available technology, as representing a miniscule amount of silver, and as something environmentally beneficial from the life-cycle point of view. Fashion industry stakeholders do not see such treatments as relevant. Other industry stakeholders appear generally cautious and almost all industry stakeholders report looking for improvements and alternatives, of which there are a few.

40|$|CFC (chloro{{fluorocarbons}}) and halons (brominated fluorocarbons or brominated CFCs) {{represent a}} group of stable chemicals exhibiting desirable properties for {{a broad range of}} industrial and consumer applications, including refrigeration, fire suppression and manufacturing of polymeric foams. Unfortunately, most of the applications involve <b>dispersive</b> <b>use</b> of the chemicals, prompting a concerted international action, embodied in the Montreal Protocol, to limit these dispersive applications. When released near the earth surface, halons and CFCs transfer preferentially to the Antarctic troposphere, where they undergo the photochemical activation to release bromine and chlorine radicals. Subsequently, both radicals enter the stratospheric gas phase catalytic cycles responsible for the destruction of large amounts of ozone, with bromine being considerably more potent than chlorine. The damaged ozone layer can no longer function as an efficient filter for harmful ultraviolet radiation. The realisation of the health effects of this phenomenon arose public concern and resulted in phasing out the manufacturing of the ozone depleting chemicals, imposed by the Montreal Protocol, to allow the ozone layer to recover. Several developed countries broadened the scope of Protocol to restrain the use of recycled halons and CFC. Although handful of developing countries maintain a limited production of the ozone depleting chemicals, a complete phasing out of the production is imminent. The legislative action has been associated with the development of new technologies, which have radically transformed the halon and CFC dependent industries. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrocarbons have replaced CFCs as refrigerants and blowing agents, water mist, HFCs, inert gases and foams have substituted halons as fire suppressants. Similar changes have affected other industries. At the same time, the unwanted and banned chemicals are accumulating in national banks, awaiting their final treatment. One approach to dispose the ozone depleting chemicals constitutes their burning in incinerators, cement kilns and specially designed thermal plasma reactors. However, such an approach entails energy inefficiencies, as halons and CFC exhibit high heat capacities and bond energies, and can lead to the formation of other pollutants, including dioxins and furans. An alternative route is to selectively cleave off the C����Cl and C–Br bonds, under well-controlled catalytic conditions, if possible preserving the valuable C–F bonds. This route produces mainly HFCs, which represent desirable chemicals, either in their own right or as precursors for manufacturing other compounds, including fluoroelastomers and CF₃I. Implied in this approach is a key paradigm shift, from considering halons and CFCs as brominated and chlorinated wastes to regarding them as valuable chemical feedstocks. From this perspective, this issue collects a selection of important advances in catalytic conversion of halons and CFCs to HFCs and other chemicals. Featured articles deal with hydrodechlorination of CFC- 12 (CCl₂F₂), CFC- 113 (C₂Cl₃F₃) and CFC- 114 (C₂Cl₂F₄), hydrodehalogenation of Halon 1211 (CBrClF₂), hydrolysis and dehalogenative oligomerisation of CFC- 12 and synthesis of CF₃I, over a very diverse group of catalysts.

40|$|HFC- 23 (also {{known as}} CHF 3 [CHF {{subscript}} 3], fluoroform or trifluoromethane) {{is a potent}} greenhouse gas (GHG), with a global warming potential (GWP) of 14 800 for a 100 -year time horizon. It is an unavoidable by-product of HCFC- 22 (CHClF 2 [CHCIF subscript 2], chlorodifluoromethane) production. HCFC- 22, an ozone depleting substance (ODS), is used extensively in commercial refrigeration and air conditioning, in the extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam industries (dispersive applications) and also as a feedstock in fluoropolymer manufacture (a non-dispersive use). Aside from small markets in specialty uses, HFC- 23 has historically been considered a waste gas that was, and often still is, simply vented to the atmosphere. Efforts {{have been made in}} the past two decades to reduce HFC- 23 emissions, including destruction (incineration) in facilities in developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and by process optimization and/or voluntary incineration by most producers in developed countries. We present observations of lower-tropospheric mole fractions of HFC- 23 measured by "Medusa" GC/MSD instruments from ambient air sampled in situ at the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network of five remote sites (2007 – 2009) and in Cape Grim air archive (CGAA) samples (1978 – 2009) from Tasmania, Australia. These observations are used with the AGAGE 2 -D atmospheric 12 -box model and an inverse method to produce model mole fractions and a "top-down" HFC- 23 emission history. The model 2009 annual mean global lower-tropospheric background abundance is 22. 6 (± 0. 2) pmol mol− 1 [mol superscript - 1]. The derived HFC- 23 emissions show a "plateau" during 1997 – 2003, followed by a rapid ~ 50 % increase to a peak of 15. 0 (+ 1. 3 /− 1. 2) Gg/yr in 2006. Following this peak, emissions of HFC- 23 declined rapidly to 8. 6 (+ 0. 9 /− 1. 0) Gg/yr in 2009, the lowest annual emission of the past 15 years. We derive a 1990 – 2008 "bottom-up" HFC- 23 emission history using data from the United Nations Environment Programme and the UNFCCC. Comparison with the top-down HFC- 23 emission history shows agreement within the stated uncertainties. In the 1990 s, HFC- 23 emissions from developed countries dominated all other sources, then began to decline and eventually became fairly constant during 2003 – 2008. By this point, with developed countries' emissions essentially at a plateau, the major factor controlling the annual dynamics of global HFC- 23 emissions became the historical rise of developing countries' HCFC- 22 <b>dispersive</b> <b>use</b> production, which peaked in 2007. Thereafter in 2007 – 2009, incineration through CDM projects became a larger factor, reducing global HFC- 23 emissions despite rapidly rising HCFC- 22 feedstock production in developing countries.
