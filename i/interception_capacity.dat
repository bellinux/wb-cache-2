5000|$|Interception {{refers to}} {{precipitation}} {{that does not}} reach the soil, but is instead intercepted by the leaves, branches of plants and the forest floor. It occurs in the canopy (i.e. canopy interception), and in the forest floor or litter layer (i.e. forest floor interception [...] ). Because of evaporation, interception of liquid water generally leads to loss of that precipitation for the drainage basin, except for cases such as fog interception, but increase flood protection dramatically, Alila et al., (2009). Intercepted snowfall does not result in any notable amount of evaporation, {{and most of the}} snow falls off the tree by wind or melts. However, intercepted snow can more easily drift with the wind, out of the watershed. Conifers have a greater <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> than hardwoods. Their needles gives them more surface area for droplets to adhere to, and they have foliage in spring and fall, therefore interception also depends on the type of vegetation in a wooded area.|$|E
40|$|The canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> is a {{small but}} {{key part of the}} surface hydrology, which affects the amount of water intercepted by {{vegetation}} and therefore the partitioning of evaporation and transpiration. However, little research with climate models has been done to understand the effects of a range of possible canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> parameter values. This is in part due to the assumption that it does not significantly affect climate. Near global evapotranspiration products now make evaluation of canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> parameterisations possible. We use a range of canopy water <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> values from the literature to investigate the effect on climate within the climate model HadCM 3. We find that the global mean temperature is affected by up to - 0. 64 K globally and - 1. 9 K regionally. These temperature impacts are predominantly due to changes in the evaporative fraction and top of atmosphere albedo. In the tropics, the variations in evapotranspiration affect precipitation, significantly enhancing rainfall. Comparing the model output to measurements, we find that the default canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> parameterisation overestimates canopy interception loss (i. e. canopy evaporation) and underestimates transpiration. Overall, decreasing canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> improves the evapotranspiration partitioning in HadCM 3, though the measurement literature more strongly supports an increase. The high sensitivity of climate to the parameterisation of canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> is partially due to the high number of light rain-days in the climate model that means that interception is overestimated. This work highlights the hitherto underestimated importance of canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> in climate model hydroclimatology and the need to acknowledge the role of precipitation representation limitations in determining parameterisations...|$|E

Maximum water storage <b>capacity</b> and <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> under various rainfall conditions were evaluated for two contrasting litter types: a needle-leaf type, represented by Cryptomeria japonica leaves; and a broad-leaf type, represented by Lithocarpus edulis leaves. An artificial rainfall simulator was applied to measure each litter type’s <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> under various rainfall intensities. Our results indicated that (1) the maximum water storage capacity of each litter layer was proportional to the litter mass (kg/m 2) regardless of layer thickness; (2) the litter <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> increased with rainfall intensity {{in the range of}} realistic rainfall conditions (under 50 mm/h); (3) the broad-leaf litter of L. edulis intercepted more rainwater than the needle-leaf litter of C. japonica; and (4) the rainwater moved laterally in the litter layer of L. edulis whereas it moved directly down in the litter layer of C. japonica. These results show that not only the litter mass but also the rainfall conditions and leaf shapes are important in evaluating the moisture dynamics of litter layers.

Past research has either neglected or underestimated the role of hydrological functions of litter layers, although some studies have considered the impact of various characteristics of rainfall and litter on litter interception. Based on both simulated rainfall and litter conditions in North China, the effect of litter mass, rainfall intensity and litter type on the maximum water storage capacity of litter (S) and litter <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> (C) were investigated under five simulated rainfall intensities and four litter masses for two litter types. The results indicated: 1) the S values increased linearly with litter mass, and the S values of broadleaf litter were on average 2. 65 {{times larger than the}} S values of needle leaf litter; 2) rainfall intensity rather than litter mass determined the maximum <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> (Cmax); Cmax increased linearly with increasing rainfall intensity; by contrast, the minimum <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> (Cmin) showed a linear relationship with litter mass, but a poor correlation with rainfall intensity; 3) litter type impacted Cmax and Cmin; the values of Cmax and Cmin for broadleaf litter were larger than those of needle leaf litter, which indicated that broadleaf litter could intercepte and store more water than needle leaf litter; 4) a gap existed between Cmax and Cmin, indicating that litter played a significant role by allowing rainwater to infiltrate or to produce runoff rather than intercepting it and allowing it to evaporate after the rainfall event; 5) Cmin was always less than S at the same litter mass, which should be considered in future interception predictions.

The impact of canopy aerial architecture on rain-splash dispersal could amplify disease reduction within mixtures. We designed a controlled conditions experiment to study single splash-dispersal events and their consequences for disease. We quantified this impact through the spore <b>interception</b> <b>capacities</b> of the component cultivars of a mixture. Two wheat cultivars, differing in their aerial architecture (mainly leaf area density) and resistance to Septoria tritici blotch, were used to constitute pure stands and mixtures with 75 % of resistant plants that accounted for 80 % of the canopy leaf area. Canopies composed of 3 rows of plants were exposed to standardized spore fluxes produced by splashing calibrated rain drops on a linear source of inoculum. Disease propagation was measured through spore fluxes and several disease indicators. Leaf susceptibility was higher for upper than for lower leaves. Dense canopies intercepted more spores and mainly limited horizontal spore transfer to the first two rows. The presence of the resistant and dense cultivar made the mixed canopy denser than the susceptible pure stand. No disease symptoms were observed on susceptible plants of the second and third rows in the cultivar mixture, suggesting that the number of spores intercepted by these plants was too low to cause disease symptoms. Both lesion area and disease conditional severity were significantly reduced on susceptible plants within mixtures on the first row beside the inoc-ulum source. Those reductions on one single-splash dispersal event, should be amplified after several cycle over the full epidemic season. Control of splash-dispersed diseases within mixtures could therefore be improved by a careful choice of cultivars taking into consideration both resistance and architecture...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study consists in evaluating {{the sensitivity of the}} first part of the die grass-milk with respect to an accidental radioactive discharge. We want to know if a single uniform deposit would involve a homogeneous contamination of the grazing grass on the scale of the whole French territory. The study was based on the ASTRAL model, a computer code developed by the IRSN which makes it possible to evaluate the transfer of the radio nuclides in the terrestrial food chain following an accidental atmospheric emission. The way of transfer of ASTRAL on which the study focused is the transfer of the deposit to milk, via the grazing grass ingestion. The sensitivity of this way of transfer relies on several parameters: <b>interception</b> <b>capacity,</b> yield, cows food rates and dates of setting to grass. Methodology thus consisted in regionalizing these parameters. The software STICS, developed by the INRA (Avignon Centre) was then used to regionalize the values for the retention and the yield.

40|$|Interception {{losses are}} a major {{influence}} in the water yield of vegetated areas. For most storms, interception results in less water reaching the ground. However, fog drip or occult precipitation can result in negative interception because small drops are deposited on all plant surfaces and subsequently {{fall to the ground}} once vegetation storage capacities are exceeded. Fog drip is normally disregarded, but for some plant communities, it could be a mechanism offsetting evaporation losses. Tillandsia recurvata is a cosmopolitan epiphyte adapted to arid habitats where fog may be an important water source. Therefore, the <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> by T. recurvata was measured in controlled conditions through applying simulated rain or fog. The storage capacity was proportional to dry weight mass. Nocturnal stomatic opening in T. recurvata is not only relevant for CO 2 but for water vapor, as suggested by the higher weight change of specimens wetted with fog for 1 h at dark in comparison to those wetted during daylight (543 ± 77 vs. 325 ± 56 mg, p = 0. 048). The coefficients obtained in the laboratory were used together with biomass measurements for T. recurvata in a xeric scrub to calculate the depth of water intercepted. <b>Interception</b> storage <b>capacity</b> (C min) was 0. 19 and 0. 54 mm for rainfall and fog respectively. T. recurvata contributed 20 % to the rain interception of their shrub hosts: Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis laevigata. Meteorological data registered during one year at Cadereyta, México showed that radiative fog formation was possible during the dry season. The results showed the potential role of T. recurvata in capturing fog, which probably is a main source of water during the dry season that supports their reproductive and physiological activity at that time. The storage capacity of T. recurvata leaf surfaces could increase the amount of water available for evaporation, but as this species colonise montane forests, the effect could be negative on water recharge, because in the laboratory experiments it took up to 12 h to reach saturation conditions when fog was applied...|$|R
40|$|Hydrologic {{climate change}} {{modelling}} is hampered by climate-dependent model parameterizations. To reduce this dependency, we extended the regional hydrologic modelling framework SIMGRO {{to host a}} two-way coupling between the soil moisture model MetaSWAP and the crop growth simulation model WOFOST, accounting for ecohydrologic feedbacks in terms of radiation fraction that reaches the soil, crop coefficient, interception fraction of rainfall, <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity,</b> and root zone depth. Except for the last, these feedbacks are dependent on the leaf area index (LAI). The influence of regional groundwater on crop growth is included via a coupling to MODFLOW. Two versions of the MetaSWAP-WOFOST coupling were set up: one with exogenous vegetation parameters, the "static" model, and one with endogenous crop growth simulation, the "dynamic" model. Parameterization of the static and dynamic models ensured that for the current climate the simulated long-term averages of actual evapotranspiration are the same for both models. Simulations were made for two climate scenarios and two crops: grass and potato. In the dynamic model, higher temperatures in a warm year under the current climate resulted in accelerated crop development, {{and in the case}} of potato a shorter growing season, thus partly avoiding the late summer heat. The static model has a higher potential transpiration; depending on the available soil moisture, this translates to a higher actual transpiration. This difference between static and dynamic models is enlarged by climate change in combination with higher CO 2 concentrations. Including the dynamic crop simulation gives for potato (and other annual arable land crops) systematically higher effects on the predicted recharge change due to climate change. Crop yields from soils with poor water retention capacities strongly depend on capillary rise if moisture supply from other sources is limited. Thus, including a crop simulation model in an integrated hydrologic simulation provides a valuable addition for hydrologic modelling as well as for crop modellin...|$|R
40|$|Photoinhibition {{in plants}} {{depends on the}} extent of light energy being absorbed in excess of what can be used in {{photochemistry}} and is expected to increase as environmental constraints limit CO 2 assimilation. Water stress induces the closure of stomata, limiting carbon availability at the carboxylation sites in the chloroplasts and, therefore, resulting in an excessive excitation of the photosynthetic apparatus, particularly photosystem II (PSII). Mechanisms have evolved in plants in order to protect against photoinhibition, such as non-photochemical energy dissipation, chlorophyll concentration changes, chloroplast movements, in-creases in the capacity for scavenging the active oxy-gen species, and leaf movement or paraheliotropism, avoiding direct exposure to sun. In beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), paraheliotropism seems to be an impor-tant feature of the plant to avoid photoinhibition. The extent of the leaf movement is increased as the water potential drops, reducing light interception and main-taining a high proportion of open PSII reaction centres. Photoinhibition in water-stressed beans, measured as the capacity to recover Fv/Fm, is not higher than in well-watered plants and leaf temperature is maintained below the ambient, despite the closure of stomata. Bean leaves restrained from moving, increase leaf temperature and reduce qP, the content of D 1 protein and the capacity to recover Fv/Fm after dark adaptation, the extent of such changes being higher in water-stressed plants. Data are presented suggesting that even though protective under water stress, parahelio-tropism, by reducing light <b>interception,</b> affects the <b>capacity</b> to maintain high CO 2 assimilation rates throughout the day in well-watered plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrology}} {{of ecosystem}} succession {{gives rise to}} new challenges for the analysis and modelling of water balance components. Recent large-scale alterations of forest cover across the globe suggest that {{a significant portion of}} new biophysical environments will influence the long-term dynamics and limits of water fluxes compared to pre-succession conditions. This study assesses the estimation of summer evapotranspiration along three FLUXNET sites at Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada using a data-driven soil water balance model validated by Eddy Covariance measurements. It explores the sensitivity of the model to different forest succession states, a wide range of computational time steps, rooting depths, and canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> values. Uncertainty in the measured EC fluxes resulting in an energy imbalance was consistent with previous studies and does not affect the validation of the model. The agreement between observations and model estimates proves that the usefulness of the method to predict summer AET over mid- and long-term periods is independent of stand age. However, an optimal combination of the parameters rooting depth, time step and <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> threshold is needed to avoid an underestimation of AET as seen in past studies. The study suggests that summer AET could be estimated and monitored in many more places than those equipped with Eddy Covariance or sap-flow measurements to advance the understanding of water balance changes in different successional ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Cacao, {{one of the}} world’s most {{important}} perennial crops, is almost exclusively explored for chocolate manufacturing. Most cacao varieties belong to three groups: Criollo, Forastero and Trinitario that vary according to morphology, genetic and geographical origins. It is cropped {{under the shade of}} forest trees or as a monocrop without shade. Seedlings initially show an orthotropic growth with leaf emission relatively independent of climate. The maturity phase begins with the emission of plagiotropic branches that form the tree crown. At this stage environmental factors exert a large influence on plant development. Growth and development of cacao are highly dependent on temperature, which mainly affects vegetative growth, flowering and fruit development. Soil flooding decreases leaf area, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates in addition to inducing formation of lenticels and adventitious roots. For most genotypes drought resistance is associated with osmotic adjustment. Cacao produces caulescent flowers, which begin dehiscing in late afternoon and are completely open {{at the beginning of the}} following morning releasing pollen to a receptive stigma. Non pollinated flowers abscise 24 - 36 h after anthesis. The percentage of flowers setting pods is in the range 0. 5 - 5 %.

40|$|Climate change impact {{modelling}} of hydrologic responses is {{hampered by}} climate-dependent model parameterizations. Reducing this dependency {{was one of}} the goals of extending the regional hydrologic modelling system SIMGRO with a two-way coupling to the crop growth simulation model WOFOST. The coupling includes feedbacks to the hydrologic model in terms of the root zone depth, soil cover, leaf area index, <b>interception</b> storage <b>capacity,</b> crop height and crop factor. For investigating whether such feedbacks lead to significantly different simulation results, two versions of the model coupling were set up for a test region: one with exogenous vegetation parameters, the "static" model, and one with endogenous simulation of the crop growth, the "dynamic" model WOFOST. The used parameterization methods of the static/dynamic vegetation models ensure that for the current climate the simulated long-term average of the actual evapotranspiration is the same for both models. Simulations were made for two climate scenarios. Owing to the higher temperatures in combination with a higher CO 2 -concentration of the atmosphere, a forward time shift of the crop development is simulated in the dynamic model; the used arable land crop, potatoes, also shows a shortening of the growing season. For this crop, a significant reduction of the potential transpiration is simulated compared to the static model, in the example by 15 % in a warm, dry year. In consequence, the simulated crop water stress (the unit minus the relative transpiration) is lower when the dynamic model is used; also the simulated increase of crop water stress due to climate change is lower; in the example, the simulated increase is 15 percentage points less (of 55) than when a static model is used. The static/dynamic models also simulate different absolute values of the transpiration. The difference is most pronounced for potatoes at locations with ample moisture supply; this supply can either come from storage release of a good soil or from capillary rise. With good supply of moisture, the dynamic model simulates up to 10 % less actual evapotranspiration than the static one in the example. This can lead to cases where the dynamic model predicts a slight increase of the recharge in a climate scenario, where the static model predicts a decrease. The use of a dynamic model also affects the simulated demand for surface water from external sources; especially the timing is affected. The proposed modelling approach uses postulated relationships that require validation with controlled field trials. In the Netherlands there is a lack of experimental facilities for performing such validations...|$|R

30|$|This {{study shows}} that {{groundwater}} recharge varies across different types of LULC. Moreover, groundwater recharge in arid and semi-arid lands {{is influenced by the}} soil texture of the topsoil to 0.3  m depth. Despite high heterogeneity associated with differences in estimation methods, study periods, and locations, our results consistently indicate that the conversion of forest land/native vegetation to managed LULC systems leads to increased groundwater recharge. The influence of LULC on groundwater recharge is mostly driven by the vegetation rooting system, <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> of the canopy, and transpiration rates (Taniguchi 1997, Wang et al. 2004). Lower groundwater recharge rates are recorded for deep-rooted native vegetation types compared with shallow-rooted vegetation such as annual crops or bare lands. In forests, which are characterized by deep roots, rain passes through the forest soil to subsoil layers. As discussed by Burch et al. (1987) and Taniguchi (1997), the soil water flow under natural vegetation is enhanced by macropores created by worms and other soil fauna and by the growth and decay of tree roots. However, forest systems have higher evapotranspiration rates than managed land use types (Scanlon et al. 2005); therefore, any gains in recharge are often offset by evapotranspiration losses (see also Fig.  1).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} the {{vegetation}} cover are introduced into a simplified hydrological model of a slope covered with pyroclastic materials, located in Cervinara, in the Apennines of Campania (southern Italy). The vegetation consists of deciduous chestnut trees (Castanea sativa) with a dense seasonal understory, mainly constituted by ferns (Pteridium aquilinum) and other shrubs. The brushwood grows during late spring and summer, while it is nearly absent {{during the rest of}} the year. Approximately in the same period, from May to September, the chestnut trees have deep foliage, while in October the leaves dry and fall. Such seasonal vegetation cover affects rainfall infiltration, as indicated by soil water potential data collected by a hydrological monitoring station operating since 2010 at the slope. The {{effects of the}} vegetation are introduced in the hydrological model in two ways: interception of the precipitation, and a root water uptake model which distributes the total evapotranspiration flux over the root depth, according to the local value of soil water potential. The presented results show that the introduction of seasonally variable values of leaf area index and <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> ensures good performance of the hydrological model. The results also show that, through rainfall interception and root water uptake, the vegetation cover has positive effects on slope equilibrium, by keeping soil suction high enough to prevent the establishment of the conditions which lead to slope failure...|$|E

These positive effects include increasing the <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> due to increasing vegetation cover, increasing of storage capacity and infiltration of the soil, thus reducing storm water runoff, producing substantial improvements in the urban drainage system, whose infrastructure is very difficult and expensive to be modified. In this paper an indicator based on the runoff coefficient, which allows quantifying the impact on runoff due to increase of GI is presented. In a second step, a way for relating the indicator with the risk of flooding is proposed. The complete methodology was applied on an urban basin located in the north of Rosario city, Argentina. Four scenarios were evaluated: baseline scenario (current scenario), and three hypothetical (future) scenarios, considering a moderate and severe waterproofing situation respectively, and one green scenario with increased GI. The results show that the moderate and severe waterproofing scenarios produce an increased risk of flooding from 1. 9 times to 4 times, respectively. This implies a necessary reinvestment in urban storm water infrastructure {{in order to keep the}} original security levels. The green scenario does keep the runoff coefficient, even considering the major increases in population and urbanization. Improving the GI constitutes a strong strategy to adapt to climate and urban changes, to cope with upcoming increases in precipitation and urbanization...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} were to extend the Tracey model in order to {{quantify}} and to analyse spring wheat's grain storage dynamics of wet-deposited radionuclides. Tracey, a dynamic model of trace element cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, was extended with descriptions of wet-deposition, interception, foliar uptake and radioactive decay. Radionuclide fluxes were set proportional to corresponding water or carbon fluxes, simulated with CoupModel. The extended Tracey was calibrated against experimental data, where 134 Cs and 85 Sr were deposited on spring wheat at six growth stages in 2010 and 2011. Sensitivities of grain storage to wheat's and radionuclide properties were assessed, using the Eikos software, by 1000 Monte Carlo simulations for each of the 48 scenarios (combination of 2 radionuclides, 1 foliar uptake, 2 root uptake approaches, 6 deposition treatments and 2 years). Simulations were accepted if simulated grain storage values were within 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of measurements. We found that 15 % of 134 Cs and 85 Sr simulations for 2011, and 6 % of the 2010 simulations met the CI-criterion. Foliar uptake accounted for 99 % and 90 % of total plant uptake of 134 Cs and 85 Sr, respectively. Mean simulated grain storage at harvest increased with lateness of deposition, as the stored proportion of radionuclide deposited was 0. 02 % when deposition was before flowering, 2 % between flowering and ripening, and 5 % (2010) or 10 % (2011, late harvest) after ripening, respectively. Similarly, the property that governed grain storage depended on the growth stage at time of deposition; stem and leaf fixation rates (deposition before flowering), grain fixation rates (between flowering and ripening) and grains' <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> (after ripening). We conclude that grains' interception capacities can be used to predict grain storage of radionuclides deposited in the riskiest period, i. e. close to harvest...|$|E
40|$|Many forested {{catchments}} {{in northern}} Pakistan have undergone land cover change {{during the last}} few decades. Extreme floods and extended droughts observed in these areas have lead to the question: How do human influences affect the water balance of a montane catchment. The underlying socio-political factors that have lead to the changes in forest cover and catchment hydrology are well documented, but there have been very few efforts to spatially correlate the cover changes with the catchment water balance. A deterministic model based on high resolution spatial and temporal data offers the ability to simulate the hydrological impacts of changes in land cover in a spatial context. In an attempt to assess the impacts of changing forest covers on individual hydrological processes, a GIS-based model Siran_HYDMAPS has been developed for the Siran Basin, Pakistan. This model integrates the spatial databases with the well-known hydrological process algorithms (e. g. Penman-Monteith evpotranspiration and Green-Ampt infiltration models). Spatially distributed static (topographic and soil) parameters for this model are extracted from a regional GIS developed specifically for the project. The dynamic (vegetation-related) parameters are estimated from the land cover maps, derived by digital processing of multi-resolution, multi-temporal Landsat MSS (5. 3. 1979) and TM (10. 7. 1989). Relative relief and shadowing in rugged terrain of the Himalayan foothills, that cause major problems in image processing, have been given particular attention. A rule-based approach was adopted to refine land cover maps with the integration of GIS for mapping the level II forest classes. Mapping of forest cover changes was carried out by post-classification change detection techniques. The Siran_HYDMAPS predicts a decrease in radiation balance and <b>interception</b> <b>capacity,</b> and an increase in evapotranspiration and catchment response of the Siran Basin, as a result of land cover changes. It was concluded that the water imbalances in this catchment, observed during the last two decades, were caused by the integrated effects of land cover changes and climatic factors...|$|E

However, in general it is impossible for one agent to cover the whole inspection area, which means that a team of units needs to be deployed. In this case, these robotic agents need to interact tightly, to act as a collaborative team towards the common of securing the whole area to be patrolled. In the application envisaged in this paper, the main goal for the robot team is to guard the perimeter of a military camp in a hostile environment. The camp is approached (attacked) by multiple enemy forces and the robotic team agents must be capable to detect and neutralize these enemies [...] The position and movement of these enemy forces is a priori unknown and they can only be detected when they are within the sensor range of one of the team members. The proposed multi-robot control methodology is based on a behavior-based control framework. In this behaviorbased context, the robotic team members are controlled using one of 2 mutually exclusive behaviors: patrolling or intercepting. In patrol mode the robot seeks to detect enemy forces as rapidly as possible, by balancing 2 constraints: the intervention time should be minimized and the map coverage should be maximized. In interception mode, the robot tries to advance towards an enemy which was detected by one of the robotic team members. Subsequently, the robot tries to neutralize the threat posed by the enemy before enemy is able to reach the camp. The proposed methodology was tested with good results in a simulation environment with robotic teams with a varying number of members. An added benefit is that by varying the number of robotic team members and by analyzing the resulting intruder <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> of the global team, human decision makers can get an idea of the minimum number of robots required to detect enemy forces and safeguard the camp...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{pathogens}} {{are among}} the most virulent bioagressors of protected crops. For sustainable plant production and to protect the crop against these airborne organisms one must determine their origin, i. e. whether they come from outside the greenhouse or are produced inside it. We considered Botrytis cinerea spore concentration as a particular physical species which is transported by air {{in the same way as}} heat, CO 2, water vapour or any tracer gas. We constructed a mass balance of the viable Botrytis spores on the whole-greenhouse volume to assess the inside production of spores and their exchanges. The different elements in the spore balance are considered and are determined experimentally: • spore transfer into or out of the greenhouse is deduced from the difference between the inside and outside spore concentrations, measured by spore traps, multiplied by the whole-greenhouse ventilation rate; • spore deposition on soil and crop and spore impaction on the plants is deduced from observations made using Petri dishes; • inside spore production is the differential term deduced from the whole-greenhouse volume balance. The first measurements and calculations have shown that the presence of insect-proof nets across the greenhouse openings strongly influences the spore balance, as the nets intercept the B. cinerea spores proportionally to the nets’ solidity. Based on wind tunnel experiments, the <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> of the nets was quantified and the whole model completed in consequence. These results show the diurnal Botrytis spore balance over 3 – 4 -week periods in the autumn and spring season for a young rose plantation. In agreement with visual observations of B. cinerea sporulation within the greenhouse, it is shown that the origin of the inocula is predominantly internal (2 / 3 in quantity). However, due to outside climate and greenhouse opening, it can vary widely from one period to another, with a tendency to become predominantly internal as the crop ages...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the work done}} within the project "Input - outputrelationships for Intensive Monitoring sites", EC contract number SG(99) D/ 10844. The project results are extensively reported in the Technical Report 2000 (De Vries et al., 2001). Input estimates for selected Level II plots are obtained from throughfall measurements corrected for canopy exchange. Output fluxes were obtained using hydrological model output combined with soil concentrations. Leaching fluxes and input estimates provided the balances. Mean yearly interception evaporation ranged from approximately 160 mm for Pine and Oak to approximately 250 mm for Beech and 300 mm for Spruce, reflecting the increasing <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> of those tree species. Median transpiration fluxes were rather constant among the tree species and ranged from 325 mm. yr- 1 for Pine to 385 mm. yr- 1 for Spruce stands. At most plots, the leaching flux of SO 4 is {{higher than that of}} NO 3, despite the generally lower input of S than of N, indicating that SO 4 is still the dominant source of actual soil acidification. The median sulphur budget is close to zero, but at a considerable number of sites, sulphur is released by the soil, indicating that these systems are recovering from previous episodes of high sulphate input. The leaching of N is generally negligible below throughfall inputs of 10 kg. ha- 1. yr- 1. There is a significant relationship between N leaching and N deposition but no significant relationship was found with the soil C/N ratio. Nitrogen budgets show that at most sites (90 %) the N input is higher then the N leaching. Variations in base cations leaching were significantly related to the S input and the pH and base saturation. The median base cation balance is close to zero, implying a net adsorption and a net release of base cations at approximately 50 % of the plots. The Al leaching flux was significantly related to the SO 4 input reflected by the fact that sites with a high Al leaching coincide with sites with a high input of SO 4. The geographic patterns of both elements, however, did not coincide very well since soil base saturation was also significantly related to the Al leaching flux...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Tree canopy snow {{interception}} is {{a significant}} hydrological process, capable of removing up to 60 % of snow from the ground snowpack. Our understanding of canopy interception has been limited by our ability to measure whole canopy interception in an undisturbed forest setting. This study presents a relatively simple and inexpensive technique for directly measuring snow canopy interception using an interceptometer, adapted from Friesen et al. [2008]. Changes in canopy mass due to interception result in a measureable trunk compression, according to Hooke's law of elasticity. The interceptometer is composed of four linear motion position sensors distributed evenly around the tree trunk, which directly measure trunk displacement caused by interception. Through calibration techniques, the amount of canopy snow required to produce the measured displacements can be calculated. We incorporate a trunk laser-mapping installation method for precise sensor placement to reduce signal noise attributed to sensor misalignment. The simple design of the interceptometer allows for installation in relatively remote locations with limited vehicle and power access. Through interceptometer development and installation, we demonstrate instrument performance on a western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) for a snow interception event in late November, 2011. Our study finds a snow interception efficiency of 83 ± 15 % of total accumulated ground snowfall with a maximum <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> of 50 ± 8 mm snow water equivalent (SWE). The observed interception event is compared to simulated interception represented by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The model generally underreported interception magnitude by 33 % using an LAI of 5 and 16 % using an LAI of 10. The interceptometer was also able to capture periods of intrastorm accumulation of up to 3 mm SWE hr- 1 and drip melt rates of 0. 75 mm SWE hr- 1, which the model failed to represent. While further validation is necessary to reduce instrument error, our results indicate that forest interception magnitude may be underestimated in maritime {{areas such as the}} Pacific Northwest. Through further instrument development and deployment, this method may prove to be a valuable tool capable of providing direct canopy snow interception estimates within intact canopy structures at high temporal resolution and sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{microclimate}} in {{facilities for}} studying effects of elevated CO 2 on crops differs from ambient conditions. Open-top chambers (OTCs) increase temperature by 1 – 3 °C. If temperature and CO 2 interact in {{their effect on}} crops, this would limit the value of OTC experiments. Furthermore, interaction of CO 2 and temperature deserves study because increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration are expected to cause global warming. This paper describes two experiments in which a recently developed cooling system for OTCs was used to analyse the effects of temperature on photosynthesis, growth and yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Minaret). Two levels of CO 2 were used (350 and 700 ppm), and two levels of temperature, with cooled OTCs being 1. 6 – 2. 4 °C colder than noncooled OTCs. Photosynthetic rates were increased by elevated CO 2, but no effect of temperature was found. Cross-switching CO 2 concentrations as well as determination of A–Ci curves showed that plant photosynthetic capacity after anthesis acclimated to elevated CO 2. The acclimation {{may be related to}} the effects of CO 2 on tissue composition: elevated CO 2 decreased leaf nitrogen concentrations and increased sugar content. Calculations of the seasonal mean crop light-use efficiency (LUE) were consistent with the photosynthesis data in that CO 2 increased LUE by 20 % on average whereas temperature had no effect. Both elevating CO 2 and cooling increased grain yield, by an average of 11 % and 23 %, respectively. CO 2 and temperature stimulated yield via different mechanisms: CO 2 increased photosynthetic rate, but decreased crop light <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> (LAI), whereas cooling increased grain yield by increasing LAI and extending the growing season with 10 days. The effects of CO 2 and temperature were not additive: the CO 2 effect was about doubled in the noncooled open-top chambers. In most cases, effects on yield were mediated through increased grain density rather than increased individual grain weights. The higher growth response to elevated CO 2 in noncooled vs. cooled OTCs shows that a cooling system may remove a bias towards overestimating crop growth response to CO 2 in open-top chambers...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 This study {{quantified}} {{the magnitude}} and timing of summer streamflow deficits in paired-watershed experiments in the Cascade Range of Oregon where mature and old-growth conifer forests were subjected to clearcutting, patch cutting, and overstory thinning treatments in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Hydrologic effects of clearcutting, small-patch cutting, and overstory thinning in the mixed conifer/brush zone were studied (1 watershed (WS) each) in the Coyote Creek WS of the South Umpqua Experimental Forest at 42 ° 1 ' 15 "N and 122 ° 43 ' 30 "W. Hydrologic effects of clear cutting (3 WS), shelterwood cutting (1 WS), patch cutting (1 WS), and young forest thinning (1 WS) were examined in the Tsuga heterophylla zone at the H. J. Andrews experimental forest at 44 ° 14 ' 0 "N and 122 ° 11 ' 0 " W. Climate of both sites is marine west coast with winter precipitation and dry summers, producing minimum streamflows in August and September. Changes in flow frequency distributions were detected by counting days below streamflow thresholds where the thresholds were established using percentiles from pre-cutting streamflow records. Changes in relative streamflow were established by the station pair method. Summer streamflow deficits were largest and most persistent in 35 to 50 -year-old forest plantations created from clearcutting and shelterwood cutting in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Summer streamflow deficits were smallest and most ephemeral in a stand that experienced 50 % overstory thinning in 1971. Summer streamflow deficits of intermediate size and persistence developed in watersheds in which 25 to 30 % of the area had been patchcut in the 1960 s or 1970 s. A sparse (12 %) precommercial thin of a 27 -year-old stand exhibiting summer streamflow deficits had comparatively little effect on streamflow deficits. Streamflow deficits emerged as early as March or April and persisted into October and November in the warmer, drier site in southern Oregon (Coyote Creek), whereas summer streamflow deficits were restricted to July through September in the cooler, wetter Andrews Forest. These {{findings are consistent with}} previous studies demonstrating (1) increases in water use in certain conifer species relative to others (e. g. Douglas-fir versus pine); (2) higher water use in young (i. e., 10 to 50 -yr-old) compared to old (100 to 250 -yr-old) stands of many tree species; and (3) decreased <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> of young relative to old forest stands associated with loss of canopy epiphytes. Results appear to be robust, despite gaps in data availability, uncertainties associated with changes in stream gauging, streamflow trends over time in control watersheds, and multi-decadal fluctuations in regional climate over the study period. These findings support the notion that variable-intensity logging prescriptions over small areas to approximate natural forest structure may have the least effect on summer streamflows. However, more research, preferably new paired watershed experiments, is needed to quantify {{the magnitude and}} duration of summer streamflow effects from various levels of overstory and understory thinning treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} {{of water for}} irrigated agriculture is a concerning issue in the world especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Irrigators are facing a number of challenges, including reductions in the {{availability of}} water and increased competition with industrial and domestic uses. Irrigated agriculture is the largest water consumer {{all over the world}} as well as in Australia, and there is pressure to increase water use efficiency. Efficient utilization of water can improve the crop production per unit of water applied and can contribute to water conservation. Among the irrigation systems, sprinkler irrigation {{is one of the most}} popular methods for achieving high application efficiencies. However, the irrigators are still less interested to adopt this system due to the lack of accurate information regarding the losses in sprinkler irrigation often citing high evaporation losses along with high cost of operation. Evaporation losses during sprinkler irrigation are still a vital issue to the irrigation community all over the world. Previous experimental results have shown that they may vary from 0 to 45 % of the applied water and that a large proportion of the loss is droplet evaporation in the atmosphere. However, recent theoretical studies reported that the total losses should not be much more than a few percent. They also suggested a negligible (less than 1 %) amount of droplet evaporation compared to the major canopy evaporation component. Due to the limitations of the existing methodology and technique these theoretical results could not be verified by field experiments in real crops. Accurate estimates of the losses are important to determine the strategies for the optimal design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems as well as irrigation scheduling considering the application efficiency of the system. It is also important to provide the accurate information regarding the evaporation losses which can significantly help farmers to choose a suitable irrigation system. The relatively recent development of the eddy covariance (ECV) technique has provided the opportunity to overcome the limitations of the existing methods to measure the evaporation during sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, this work aimed to measure the additional evaporation that occurs during sprinkler irrigation adopting eddy covariance technique and to separate its components in conjunction with additional measurements. In this regard, three research objectives were identified including: (i) use the eddy covariance (ECV) technique to measure the total evapotranspiration (ET) during sprinkler irrigation; (iii) partition the total evaporation into its major components during irrigation and subsequent periods; and (iii) to demonstrate how the ECV-sap flow data can aid in management of sprinkler irrigation. The ECV system is consists of a fast-response three dimensional sonic anemometer coupled with open path infrared gas analyser. Sap flow was measured using six dynagauge sap flow sensors each with a digital interface, a hub and a data logger. Additional measurements include net radiation using a four component net radiometer, soil heat flux (G) using heat flux plates temperature and relative humidity using two temperature and relative humidity probes and the crop canopy temperature using an infrared thermometer. A fixed sprinkler irrigation system was installed in a way to make a circle of 50 m with an area of 0. 2 ha for all trials. Experimental measurements were conducted over a range of surfaces from bare soil to different stages of crop throughout the period 2010 - 11 at the agricultural experimental station at University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia. Preliminary measurements were conducted over the grass and bare soil to evaluate the capability of the ECV technique to measure the total ET during sprinkler irrigation. The preliminary measurements showed that the ECV technique successfully measured the increased ET during irrigation and the decreasing rate of ET during post irrigation drying period. Using the nondimensional (ETecadj/ETref) values of ET, the average additional evaporation over the grass was estimated as 32 %. The decreasing trend of ET over the time post irrigation was an indication of evaporation of the intercepted water from the grass surface. However, in case of bare soil the actual ET pre irrigation was well below the reference ET and increased to equal to the reference ET during the irrigation. In terms of nondimensional ET about 27 % additional evaporation occurred over the bare soil during irrigation due to the increased soil moisture. Similar values of nondimensional ET post and pre irrigation illustrates that there was no intercepted water to evaporate on the surface in the case of bare soil. Accordingly, a series of experimental trials were conducted over cotton at various growth stages, introducing the eddy covariance-sap flow method to measure the total evapotranspiration and sap flow. Nondimensionalisation of these measurements using ETref gave idealized curves of the total evapotranspiration and sap flow for each stage, i. e pre-, during and post-irrigation, which permits calculation of the additional evaporation caused by irrigation and suppression of transpiration. These calculations showed that the greatest effect of overhead sprinkler on water losses was the significant increase of ET as mostly canopy evaporation and reduction in sap flow due to the wetness of the canopy. The amount of additional evaporation varied significantly with crop canopy condition and climatic factors especially advection. The significant increase of total ET from partial canopy to full canopy indicates that canopy evaporation was higher in full canopy due to the greater area of canopy surface in full crop canopy condition and hence greater <b>interception</b> <b>capacity.</b> This result supported the conclusion that canopy evaporation was the dominant component in sprinkler irrigation. Higher rate of ET measured during irrigation in advective conditions, indicates that advective conditions can increase the additional evaporation in sprinkler irrigation substantially on the basis of climatic conditions especially wind speed. The additional evaporation due to irrigation using impact sprinklers varied from 37 % at partial canopy condition to 80 % at full canopy condition. Adevctive conditions increased this additional amount by 12 % to 20 % depending on the climatic conditions. It was shown how the total canopy evaporation can be subdivided into its different components including additional evaporation during irrigation and canopy <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> using idealized nondimensional ET and sap flow. However, the droplet evaporation could not be separated due to the limitations of the instruments used under this study. It was also shown how the ECV-sap flow data can be used to predict the magnitude of additional evaporation for different regions in various operating and climatic conditions. This can aid the irrigators to predict the additional evaporation in sprinkler irrigation at any region for different time, climatic and operating conditions. The results showed that canopy evaporation including droplet evaporation during irrigation is the dominant component (about 80 %) in additional evaporation followed by the canopy interception (about 20 %). The average amount of additional evaporation would be about 6 % of applied water under normal conditions and about 8 % in advective conditions in major cotton growing areas in Australia. It means that irrigators in those places may need to apply 6 - 8 % of additional water. ...|$|E
40|$|Karstaquifers {{represent}} an important groundwater resource {{and they are}} highly vulnerable with respect to contamination due to fast transport through the karst system and due to the limited attenuation of contaminants in karst terraines. In order to understand such a complex system, consisting of the compartments epikarst, vadose zone and the phreatic saturated zone, and to predict the variations in concentrations of point and non-point source contaminants, numerical groundwater modelling techniques are frequently employed. This study considers two main aspects: firstly, the selection of an appropriate modelling tool for the simulation and prediction of groundwater flow and transport in a karst aquifer system, the adaptation of the model to the specific problem, the construction, testing as well as validation of the model. Secondly, the provision of data input, required for the modelling of such a complex flow system. A Double-Continuum Porous Equivalent Model {{was found to be}} the most appropriate for the study area. Each of the two flow systems of the aquifer, the fast flow, i. e. conduit system, and the slow, i. e. fissured system, is simulated with a separate continuum, and both are coupled by an exchange term. The model applies to flow from a catchment, that discharges at a spring, or where the flow into a river via alluvial deposits can be quantified. A large number of borehole logs together with information from water level fluctuations and fluvial history enabled the identification of aquifer base and zones of higher and lower hydraulic conductivities. A soil moisture balance approach together with a water balance for the canopy (accounting for interception loss) produced sufficiently accurate values for groundwater recharge. Important parameters in the recharge calculation are the field capacity the <b>interception</b> <b>capacity</b> and the rapid recharge threshold. Although the rapid recharge component as a total percentage of the annual recharge is of only minor importance, it provides recharge for periods, where otherwise no recharge would have been calculated, although observed in the field. The importance of the influence of the epikarstic zone on the temporal distribution of recharge input and the relative distribution of recharge between fast and slow system needs to be stressed. The analysis of time series of hydraulic and physicochemical parameters yielded storage and recession constants for. the drainage from the subcutaneous zone, which could be devided into a fast and a slow recharge component. The analysis of spring flow, temporal and spatial variation of groundwater levels, borehole hydraulic tests and also the time series of physico-chemical parameters of spring water allowed the quantification of storage and hydraulic conductivity for both, the slow (fissured) and the fast (conduit) system, for flood as well as drought conditions. The importance of the dependance of the above parameters on the measurement scale due to the heterogeneous distribution of fast and slow flow paths was recognized. The relationship between hydraulic conductivity and the sampled volume could be determined by evaluating the parameters at the catchment, several different borehole and laboratory scales. This procedure allowed the allocation of hydraulic conductivity at the modelling scale. The analysis of the various time series provided an insight into the different processes affecting the recharge and groundwater circulation. The chronology of the different parameter variations helped to understand the sequence of events. The dominant hydraulic parameters in the flow simulation are the storage coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity of the fissured system, that control the storage and release of groundwater over time. The transport model is applicable to point-source and non-point source input, which also allows the modelling of complex recharge events, where a number of events of different intensity are superimposed. The determining hydraulic parameters in the transport simulation have been identified as the hydraulic conductivity of the fissured system and the transmissivity of the conduit system. The model has been validated and can be employed for predictive purposes, i. e. without any further corrections and calibration, the model could reproduce time variant fluctuations of delta 180, a nonpoint-source tracer as well as the breakthrough of a point source tracer...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Imaging spectroscopy, imaging spectrometry, remote sensing, reflection, reflectance, grass sward, white clover, recognition, characterisation, ground cover, growth monitoring, stress detection, {{heterogeneity}} quantificationThe {{potential of}} imaging spectroscopy {{as a tool}} for characterisation of grass swards was explored with respect to growth monitoring, detection of nitrogen and drought stress, and assessment of dry matter yield, clover content, nutrient content, feeding value, sward heterogeneity and production capacity. To this end, an experimental imaging spectroscopy system was developed. The system detects reflection in image lines in the wavelength range from 405 - 1659 nm with three different sensors at 1. 3 m above the soil surface. Spectral resolution varies between 5 - 13 nm, and spatial resolution between 0. 28 - 1. 45 mm 2 per pixel at the soil. As a result of system design, reflection intensity is a function of leaf height and leaf angle. The system was tested on mini swards grown in containers. For each mini sward, 42 image lines were recorded in a regular sampling pattern per recording event. Five experiments were conducted with Lolium perenne L. and/or Trifolium repens L. mini swards. In these experiments degree of sward damage, level of nitrogen (N) application (two experiments), water supply and white clover content were varied. In the sward damage experiment and in one N experiment light interception was recorded regularly; at harvest, also crop height and canopy reflectance (with a Cropscan) was measured. Mini swards were harvested at a fixed level and in one of the N experiments in three strata. During the experiments, hyperspectral reflectance was recorded 2 - 4 times per week. Image lines were classified to separate pixels containing soil, dead material and green leaves. These classes were subdivided into reflection intensity classes. Ground cover (GC), reflection intensity, image line texture, spatial heterogeneity and patterns, and spectral characteristics of green leaves were quantified. An index of reflection intensity (IRI) measured the distribution of green pixels over intensity classes and quantified vertical canopy geometry. Horizontal sward heterogeneity was quantified with the spatial standard deviation of GC (GC-SSD) and logarithmically transformed GC (TGC-SSD), and image line texture and spatial patterns with wavelet entropy (WE). Spectral characteristics were quantified with shifts of various spectral edges. Partial least squares (PLS) models combining spectral and spatial information were calibrated and validated on two separate data-sets from the sward damage and one N experiment, in order to predict dry matter (DM) yield, feeding quality and nutrient content. Effects of replicate observations on reduction of prediction error were studied for different fractions of model bias. GC was differently related to light interception under a cloudy sky and under a clear sky (R 2 adj = 0. 87 - 0. 94) and also for dense and open swards. Growth was accurately monitored with evolution of GC and IRI, and GC and IRI at harvest were strongly related to DM yield (R 2 adj = 0. 75 - 0. 82). Seasonal means of GC and IRI were strongly (R 2 adj = 0. 77 - 0. 93) related to annual DM matter yield and light <b>interception</b> <b>capacity.</b> There was a clear (R 2 adj = 0. 69) relation between seasonal mean GC-SSD and tiller density. Seasonal means of GC-SSD differentiated dense from damaged swards. The WE of image line texture robustly differentiated clover from grass swards, while mixtures had intermediate values. Position of spectral edges was strongly related to reflection intensity. This relation differed for grass and clover swards, varied with N supply level and changed after harvesting canopy strata. Leaf angle was identified as the most important factor affecting this relationship. Drought stress was detected in an early stage, when DM content of leaves was still below 20 %, from shifts of edges near water absorption features. A combination of shifts of the green and red edge was strongly related (R 2 = 0. 95) to DM yield reduction due to N shortage. The prediction errors relative to the mean (of validation sets) of the PLS models were 6. 2 - 11. 7 % for N content, 5. 5 - 9. 1 % for DM content, 13. 6 - 18. 7 % for sugar content, 6. 0 - 7. 5 % for ash content, and 3. 5 - 4. 8 % for crude fibre content. Predictions of P, K, S, Mg, Na and Fe were robust in both experiments. Combining GC and IRI with mean sward spectra resulted in a prediction error of 235 - 268 kg DM ha - 1 for yields of less than 1000 up to 4000 kg DM ha - 1. Multiple observations may reduce the mean prediction error for DM yield with 27 to 54 %, depending on model bias and number of observations. The accuracy of DM yield assessment with imaging spectroscopy was better than with the disk plate meter or Cropscan. It is concluded that imaging spectroscopy is a powerful tool in grassland research and may provide valuable information for fine-tuning of grassland management. In this study it provided fast, automatic and non-destructive means for monitoring and quantification of growth, and estimating dry matter yield, spatial heterogeneity and sward damage, nitrogen and water deficiency, clover content, feeding quality and nutrient content of swards. Finally, system requirements for application of imaging spectroscopy in the field are discussed...|$|E
