Boehner later promised to pass the bill. However, some commentators praised Boehner for not passing a bill they saw as full of pork barrel.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the budget legacy passed to his {{successor}} President Obama, CBO forecast in January 2009 that the deficit that year would be $1.2 trillion, assuming the continuation of Bush policies. From a policy perspective, the long-term deficit legacy depended significantly on whether the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire in 2010 as initially legislated. President Obama extended the Bush tax cuts entirely {{through the end of}} 2012 as part of the 2010 Tax Relief Act, then extended them for the bottom 99% of income earners indefinitely thereafter as part of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>cliff</b> resolution, roughly 80% of the dollar value of the cuts.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>cliff</b> {{legislation}} at the start of 2013, Frank stated that he was interested in the interim appointment that Governor Deval Patrick was expected to make to fill John Kerry's U.S. Senate seat once the latter resigned to serve as United States Secretary of State. Frank had initially said he was not interested in the seat, but went on to change his mind, noting that [...] "that [...] deal now means that February, March, and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial history". He said he would not run in the special election that would be held to fill the seat for the remainder of Kerry's term. At the end of January 2013, Governor Patrick named associate Mo Cowan to the seat for the interim term.|$|E
30|$|While <b>fiscal</b> <b>cliffs</b> {{and funding}} {{decisions}} rightly occupy political attention, {{and are often}} held hostage to political ideology, some science policy involves legitimately controversial ethical topics for which a policy pathway across the valley would be welcomed. Below we {{consider the case of}} stem cell research, especially embryonic stem cell research, as an example whose history demonstrates how success in crossing the biomedical science valley may be hampered by an inadequate policy map. Other examples could also illustrate the process, such as gene patenting, use of existing biological samples for research, data sharing according to funding used for research.|$|R
40|$|This article proposes an {{approach}} to improving the psychological realism of economics while maintaining its conventional techniques and goals: formal theoretical and empirical analysis using tractable models, {{with a focus on}} prediction and estimation. These techniques have proven valuable for studying the behavioral and welfare implications of economic phenomena—oil shocks, higher education, job search—and policy changes—extending unemployment insurance, lowering cigarette taxes, <b>fiscal</b> <b>cliffing,</b> or regulating monopoly. Models with greater psychological realism can best improve understanding of the economy and policy when done with the mathematical and statistical rigor required by mainstream economic questions and methods. In this view, we should develop new models of humans—but use the same old model of modeling humans. Any overly structured notion of methodology, such as what I outline in abbreviated form in this article, is necessarily too narrow. Thinking is hard. 1 So any good thinking on useful topics should be appreciated, and smart and creative people tend to do good research in whatever mode they choose. But this should not warrant agnosticism about methods, and I believe that at this moment more of our efforts to improve the psychological realism of economics should be devoted to developing (necessarily imperfect) portable, mathematical models. The claim is not that everybody should do research of this sort. Indeed, this approach is motivated by engagement with other modes of research: translating improved psychological assumptions into portable models is crucial for them to influence prevalent modes of economics, from “applied theory ” to structural econometrics to theoryguided, reduced-form empirical work.

2500|$|President Obama {{inherited}} a highly ambiguous fiscal outlook, with several important tax laws scheduled to expire {{during his first}} term in office, not to mention uncertainty regarding {{the depth of the}} financial crisis and Great Recession. These laws included the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 (scheduled to expire in 2010) and temporary [...] "patches" [...] that prevented the alternative minimum tax from impacting the middle class. This ambiguity resulted in the CBO publishing a second [...] "alternative fiscal scenario" [...] during 2009 to help explain the consequences of making this tax relief permanent over the following decades. This ambiguity culminated in the United States <b>fiscal</b> <b>cliff</b> and was addressed by the latter two laws listed above, such that the CBO returned to publishing just one fiscal scenario by 2016.|$|E
