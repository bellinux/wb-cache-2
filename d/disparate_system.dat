50|$|In the mid-1920s, the <b>disparate</b> <b>system</b> of {{national}} auto trails had grown cumbersome, {{and the federal}} government imposed a numbering system on the nations's highways. Using a system of even numbers for east - west routes and odd numbers for north - south routes, the numbers were imposed on the auto trails. And rather than designate one number for each auto trail, different sections of each trail were given different numerical designations. However the UDC petitioned the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads to designate the Jefferson Davis as a national highway with a single number. The Bureau's reply casts doubt on whether or not the JDMH ever really existed as a transcontinental highway:A careful search has been made in our extensive map file in the Bureau of Public Roads and three maps showing the Jefferson Davis highways have been located, but the routes on these maps are themselves different and neither route is approximately that described by you, so that I am somewhat at a loss as to just what route your constituents are interested in. For instance, there is the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway which extends from Miami, Florida to Los Angeles (but not to San Francisco); and there is another Jefferson Davis Highway shown on the Rand-McNally maps which extends from Fairview, Kentucky the site of the Jefferson Davis monument, by a very circuitous route to New Orleans, but I find no route whatever bearing the name Jefferson Davis extending from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco. addedThis problem may well have been the fault of the UDC themselves. In addition to the planned transcontinental route, they also designated an auxiliary route running from Kentucky to Mississippi, as well as another that ran through Georgia. These ancillary routes were intended to commemorate important venues in Davis' life, but they also contributed to the confusion of the federal government in trying to locate exactly where the Jefferson Davis highway traveled. What is known is that when numbered highways came into existence, the Jefferson Davis National Highway was split among US 1, US 15, US 29, US 61, US 80, US 90, US 99, US 190 and others. But today many of these numbered routes themselves are no longer extant, having been supplanted by the Interstate Highway System.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{emerging}} {{issue in the}} world of context-centric software-based decision-support is the need for potentially <b>disparate</b> <b>systems</b> to interoperate in meaningful and useful ways. Such interoperability must go beyond the elementary communication of data and endeavor to support a more powerful context-oriented inter-system relationship. A key issue in such functionality is the support, moreover the promotion, of meaningful interoperability while still retaining individual system representations, or perspectives. In other words, the meaningful integration of potentially <b>disparate</b> <b>systems</b> in a manner that allows each collaborating system to retain its potentially unique means of representing, or perceiving, the domain over which it operates.

It is determined that the various sources of uncertainty and risk associated with electric propulsion mission design can be summarized into three relatively independent parameters 1) EP Power Margin, 2) Propellant Margin and 3) Duty Cycle Margin. The overall relationship between these parameters and other major sources of uncertainty is presented. A detailed trajectory analysis is conducted to examine the impact that various assumptions related to power, duty cycle, destination, and thruster performance including missed thrust periods have on overall performance.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of concurrent and reactive systems is based {{to a large}} degree on various notions of process equivalence, ranging, on the so-called linear-time/branching-time spectrum, from fine-grained equivalences such as strong bisimilarity to coarse-grained ones such as trace equivalence. The theory of concurrent systems at large has benefited from developments in coalgebra, which has enabled uniform definitions and results that provide a common umbrella for seemingly <b>disparate</b> <b>system</b> types including non-deterministic, weighted, probabilistic, and game-based systems. In particular, there has been some success in identifying a generic coalgebraic theory of bisimulation that matches known definitions in many concrete cases. The situation is currently somewhat less settled regarding trace equivalence. A number of coalgebraic approaches to trace equivalence have been proposed, none of which however cover all cases of interest; notably, all these approaches depend on explicit termination, which is not always imposed in standard systems, e. g. LTS. Here, we discuss a joint generalization of these approaches based on embedding functors modelling various aspects of the system, such as transition and braching, into a global monad; this approach appears to cover all cases considered previously and some additional ones, notably standard LTS and probabilistic labelled transition systems...|$|E
40|$|Recently, Continua Health Alliance {{has brought}} {{together}} a powerhouse team, including Cisco, IBM, Motorola and others, for personal telehealth products and services. This team will provide commodity interoperable healthcare devices and services by introducing new connectivity standards for health management tools. But {{the costs of}} integrating and configuring <b>disparate</b> <b>system</b> services {{have proven to be}} prohibitive in this domain – healthcare processes require extreme agility to assimilate information across traditional boundaries. As a result, these tools must work effectively with dynamic business processes that often elude cost-effective integration themselves. This creates a requirement for software to be fluidly configurable and interoperable in order to best support personalized care with truly integrated solutions. We believe that, without a new technology for the seamless integration of features within healthcare devices, costs associated with attempts to fuse IT with dynamic business processes will continue to be an obstacle in modern patient care. Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) is focused on novel notions of modularity that crosscut traditional abstraction boundaries. AOSD techniques and tools, applied at all stages of the software lifecycle, are changing the way software is developed in a wide spectrum of application domains, ranging from embedded systems to enterprise IT. This paper outlines the ways in which aspects could aid the integration and evolution of software used to support modern healthcare practices across this spectrum, with examples at each stage. We believe the key principle of AOSD – the modularization of crosscutting concerns – to {{be an integral part of}} the solution to the challenges currently facing modern health service infrastructures. ...|$|E

40|$|Revealing the {{adaptive}} responses of ecological, social, and economic systems to a transforming biosphere {{is crucial for}} understanding system resilience and preventing collapse. However, testing the theory that underpins complex adaptive system organization (e. g., panarchy theory) is challenging. We used multivariate time series modeling to identify scale-specific system organization and, by extension, apparent resilience mechanisms. We used a 20 -year time series of invertebrates and phytoplankton from 26 Swedish lakes to test the proposition that a few key-structuring environmental variables at specific scales create discontinuities in community dynamics. Cross-scale structure was manifested in two independent species groups within both communities across lakes. The first species group showed patterns of directional temporal change, which was related to environmental variables that acted at broad spatiotemporal scales (reduced sulfate deposition, North Atlantic Oscillation). The second species group showed fluctuation patterns, which often could not be explained by environmental variables. However, when significant relationships were found, species&# 8211;group trends were predicted by variables (total organic carbon, nutrients) that acted at narrower spatial scales (i. e., catchment and lake). Although the sets of environmental variables that predicted the species groups differed between phytoplankton and invertebrates, the scale-specific imprints of keystone environmental variables for creating cross-scale structure were clear for both communities. Temporal trends of functional groups did not track the observed structural changes, suggesting functional stability despite structural change. Our approach allows for identifying scale-specific patterns and processes, thus providing opportunities for better characterization of complex adaptive systems organization and dynamics. This, in turn, holds potential for more accurate evaluation of resilience in <b>disparate</b> <b>system</b> types (ecological, social, economic) ...|$|E

However, no definitive indoor-outdoor navigation system simultaneously provides high accuracy, high availability and low installation cost. Furthermore, crowded indoor-outdoor navigation systems consisting of multiple techniques will destructively interfere with each other, but an exclusive navigation environment will have difficulty providing stable location services for users.
