5|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, Sihanouk loyalists {{had been}} purged from all of GRUNK's {{ministries}} {{and all of the}} prince's supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a North Vietnamese deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the North Vietnamese soldier revealed the whereabouts of North Vietnamese units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North Vietnamese artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of {{about two or three}} North Vietnamese combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front to fool South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E

With the steel strike deadline approaching, the steel industry was <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> war with the AA. But the Wagner bill, which might have averted a strike by establishing stronger protections for workers, had little chance of passing. Again Roosevelt intervened. He called a conference at the White House on June 12 at which AFL president William Green was one of the attendees. A compromise bill was hammered out which authorized the president to create one or more new labor boards to enforce Section 7(a) by conducting investigations, subpoenaing evidence and witnesses, holding elections and issuing enforcement orders.|$|E
25|$|Hitler's {{pressing}} for a German invasion of Poland in 1939 placed tremendous {{strain on the}} German war machine, which had been gradually <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> total war in 1942 or 1943. Germany's lack of raw materials meant {{that it had to}} seek increased supply from outside. However, a British blockade occurred, leaving it increasingly desperate for materials. The only remaining state capable of supplying Germany with the oil, rubber, manganese, grains, fats and platinum it needed was the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviets' demands for manufactured goods, such as German machines, were increasing while its ability to import those goods from outside decreased when many countries ceased trading relations after the Soviet entry into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.|$|E
25|$|This time, Earnhardt {{was back}} for good, winning six championships {{over the next}} two decades, with crew chiefs Kirk Shelmerdine and Andy Petree, and Goodwrench {{replacing}} Wrangler as the primary sponsor after 1987. In the late 1990s Earnhardt's performance began to slow down, and went through 1997 without a victory. The next year, he won the Daytona 500 after 20 starts, all ending in losses. The year after that one, he was able to score wins at Talladega, as well as cause more controversy, after he spun Terry Labonte out to win a race at Bristol. In 2000, {{he looked like he was}} finally regaining his old form, winning twice and finishing runner-up to Bobby Labonte in points, and his many fans hoped he was <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his record-breaking 8th championship.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of cervical mucus and vulvar sensation are generally described together as {{two ways of}} observing the same sign. Cervical mucus is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal. Fertile cervical mucus promotes sperm life by decreasing the acidity of the vagina, and also it helps guide sperm through the cervix and into the uterus. The production of fertile cervical mucus is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman's body for ovulation. By observing her cervical mucus and {{paying attention to the}} sensation as it passes the vulva, a woman can detect when her body is <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed. When ovulation occurs, estrogen production drops slightly and progesterone starts to rise. The rise in progesterone causes a distinct change in {{the quantity and quality of}} mucus observed at the vulva.|$|E

500|$|The {{off-season}} {{after the}} 2007 Series showed {{a war of}} words between management of both teams. Boston GM Theo Epstein called Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina a [...] "bad apple" [...] for complaining about the Yankees' 2004 trip to Japan as the Red Sox were <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> their own trip there. Epstein claimed that Mussina had {{used it as a}} crutch during the season. Mussina retorted back saying [...] "Yea, we used it as a crutch to win the division!" [...] Later that month, Hank Steinbrenner, who had taken a bigger role with the Yankees operation from his father George, responded in a feisty manner to the popularity of Red Sox Nation in The New York Times supplemental Play Magazine: Red Sox Nation?' What a bunch of (expletive) that is. That was a creation of the Red Sox and ESPN, which is filled with Red Sox fans. Go anywhere in America and you won't see Red Sox hats and jackets, you'll see Yankee hats and jackets. This is a Yankee country. We're going to put the Yankees back on top and restore the universe to order." [...] In response, Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry inducted Hank Steinbrenner into Red Sox Nation. Steinbrenner went on to praise Henry's handling of the Red Sox and said they would always be competitive under him.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the TV play progressed through May and June, and on 15 June mixing for Dave Davies' solo LP was {{completed}} (tapes for this record were eventually delivered to Pye and Reprise Records, although it never saw official release). A press release {{announced that the}} Arthur LP was scheduled for a late July release. As Davies and Mitchell completed their script, the Arthur TV play began to crystallise, and British filmmaker Leslie Woodhead was assigned the role of director. By early September production was scheduled to begin, with a planned broadcast of late September, but these plans were continually delayed. As problems with the TV play got progressively worse—and, consequently, distracted the Kinks from completing the post-production of the album—the release dates for both projects were pushed further and further back. In early October Ray Davies moved from Borehamwood back to his old family home on Fortis Green, in Muswell Hill, and travelled to Los Angeles, where he delivered the tapes to Reprise for Arthurs American release. The album's release date was finally set for 10 October, and the Kinks began <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> an upcoming US tour to support the album, for which they would depart on 17 October. Shooting for the TV play was eventually set for 1 December. Roy Stonehouse {{was hired as a}} designer, and the casting {{was completed}}; however, the show was cancelled at the last minute when the producer was unable to secure financial backing. Davies and Mitchell were frustrated at an entire year's work wasted—Doug Hinman stated that Davies witnessed [...] "his grand artistic visions once again dashed by bureaucracy and internal politics".|$|E
