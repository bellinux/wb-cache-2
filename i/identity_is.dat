40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 A social {{identity}} model of majority influence in negotiations is presented, which considers {{the effects of}} various social identifications on the processes of integrative and distributive bargaining. Two-faction negotiations were examined in a laboratory experiment: negotiation configuration was varied (negotiations were composed of either a majority faction and a minority faction or two equal-sized factions), as <b>was</b> social <b>identity</b> (negotiators <b>were</b> led to either identify with their own individual party or with the group of negotiators as a whole). Negotiators' agreements were less integrative when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient than when individual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient, particularly in negotiations between a majority and a minority Also, the majority faction had a significantly greater profit advantage over the minority faction when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient than when individual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient. However, although the majority's relative advantage was greater when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient, majority members did not earn significantly more in an absolute sense when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient than when individual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient. The {{results of this study}} suggest that although group <b>identity</b> has <b>been</b> found to promote beneficial outcomes in other types of conflicts, its effects in negotiation are potentially negative, leading negotiators to miss opportunities for joint gain, particularly in negotiations between unequal factions...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{experiment}} mirroring an earlier study finding that Asian-American women performed better on a math test when their Asian <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient and worse when their female <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient (Shih et al., 1999; Ambady et al., 2001; and Shih et al., 2002). In this paper, we assessed the performance of Asian-American women on a verbal test, {{a situation in which the}} valence of the stereotypes associated with the same two identities (i. e. Female, Asian) are flipped. Consistent with stereotypes, women performed better on the verbal test when their female <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> made salient than when their Asian <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> made salient. These results, taken together with the previously reported findings, indicate that <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> not universally adaptive or maladaptive, but rather are adaptive or maladaptive in different domains. ...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{identity}} construction challenge conventional {{models of the}} person as a bounded or monadic individual with a fixed or essential identity, assuming instead a fragmented, incomplete social subject. <b>Identities</b> <b>are</b> presumed to be multiple, complex, and situated. All <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> social, including those personal <b>identities</b> which <b>are</b> experienced as unique (“who I am”). The construction of “other” <b>identities</b> <b>is</b> part of the processes through which social divisions and inequalities are established and reinforced. Analyses explore the processes through which <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> constructed, claimed, and performed, and also the intersection of conventional identity categories. Relevant methodological debates include the status of language data, as truth or interpretation, {{and the relationship of}} the researcher to participants and talk data, as observer or insider interpreter...|$|R
40|$|Paul Auster’s City of Glass {{contains}} {{a jumble of}} identities. In fact, the <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> more numerous than the characters, and consequently, characters have several different identities. Some of these <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> obvious constructs, but with others the degree of construction is less evident. Poststructuralist theory, however, puts forward the idea that these seemingly original <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> in fact constructs to {{the same level as}} all others. Thus, this essay argues that there are no original identities; <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> constructed by outer factors. This essay discusses three outer factors contributing to the construction of identities, factors commonly discussed in poststructuralist criticism, these three being language, cultural codes and chance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEarly maladaptive schemas (EMSs) have {{impact on}} the many aspects of {{personality}} and disorders. Obesity {{is one of the}} most problematic issues and there is a high prevalence of obesity in hospital populations. This study was aimed to examine the relationship of EMSs and Aspects of Identity on individuals with obesity. Sixty patients from Weight Loss Clinic of Sina Hospital participated in this study. The participants completed the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF) and Aspects of Identity Questionnaire-IV (AIQ-IV). The results showed that some aspects of identity (Collective, Personal, social and Relational <b>Identities)</b> <b>were</b> positively associated with EMSs, self-sacrificing schema in particular, in obese people. Regression analysis showed that collective <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> mostly predicted by Isolation / Alienation, and Emotional Inhibition schemas while, social <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> mostly predicted by Abandonment / Instability and Unrelenting Standards / Hypercriticalness. Relational <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> predicted by Abandonment / instability and personal <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> predicted by Abandonment / Instability and Unrelenting Standards / Hypercriticalness schemas. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α subunits.

The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|E
