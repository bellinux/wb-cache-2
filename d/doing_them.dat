5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable <b>doing</b> <b>them.</b> After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is <b>doing</b> <b>them</b> for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as <b>doing</b> <b>them</b> a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair as the years went by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E

The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord," [...] that fear him, [...] "shall not want any good thing" [...] (Psa 34:9,10). Not anything that God sees good for them shall those men want that fear the Lord. If health will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if sickness will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if riches will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if poverty will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if life will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, if death will <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good, then they shall not want them, neither shall any of these come nigh them, if they will not <b>do</b> <b>them</b> good. The lions, the wicked people [19] {{of the world that}} fear not God, are not made sharers in this great privilege; all things fall out to them contrary, because they fear not God. In the midst of their sufficiency, they are in want of that good that God puts into the worst things that the man that feareth God doth meet with in the world.|$|R

25|$|He {{enrolled}} in the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935. For a time, {{he worked for the}} Ford Motor Company, using his considerable artistic skills in the design of advertisements. He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, which he found mind-numbingly boring, leading him to dream of <b>doing</b> <b>them</b> by machine.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people <b>doing</b> <b>them.</b> This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E

25|$|After {{illustrating}} a {{new edition}} of Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes by Robert Louis Stevenson, Blampied returned to work for magazines in 1933 with a weekly series of illustrations of British life in ink and sepia wash for The Illustrated London News. Blampied’s few published portraits are known from this time, {{although he did not}} particularly enjoy <b>doing</b> <b>them.</b> From photographs he drew small pencil portraits of authors and actors for a magazine called The Queen and an oil of Queen Mary (Mary of Teck) for the Christmas issue in 1934; he collaborated with his great friend and benefactor John St Helier Lander, a noted portrait artist and fellow-Jerseyman, on a picture of King George V; and he did an etching of the Jersey-born politician, Lord Portsea (Bertram Falle), which was shown at the Royal Academy in 1934. After finishing his work for the Illustrated London News in 1935 he continue to work for magazines until 1939, mainly doing occasional cartoons for The Sketch, often featuring two tramps called Horace and George.|$|E

In an Entertainment Weekly interview before the episode aired, Sapochnik said he was brought on board by Benioff and Weiss after his previous-season success; [...] "Hardhome" [...] won several awards, including Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. About how the episode should be shot, he said: [...] "Every battle on Thrones is unique. I think that's why Benioff and Weiss keep <b>doing</b> <b>them.</b> In the case of 'Battle of the Bastards' – or 'BOB' as we affectionately called it in production – David and Dan {{wanted to do a}} thing of spectacle, a strategic pitchfield battle they hadn't had the resources to do back in season 1 or 2. I was particularly interested in depicting both the horror of war and the role of luck in battle."

500|$|On 5 October 2005, a {{reporter}} for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the BBC in two years. Davies commented, [...] "When they are great stories, you keep on coming back to them and <b>doing</b> <b>them</b> in different ways with different people at different lengths." [...] Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast. The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the Western Mail, calling Austen his [...] "favourite novelist". He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, there was pressure on him to get Sense and Sensibility right. Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about Ang Lee's 1995 film adaptation of the novel.|$|E

Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires".

[...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and <b>doing</b> <b>them</b> more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E
