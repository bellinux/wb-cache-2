VirB 4 was resistant to extraction from membranes of wild-type strain A 348 or a Ti-plasmidless strain expressing virB 4 from an IncP replicon. To evaluate the membrane topology of VirB 4, a nested deletion method was used to generate a high frequency of random fusions between virB 4 and *phoA, which encodes a periplasmically active alkaline phosphatase (AP) deleted of its signal sequence. VirB 4 ::PhoA hybrid proteins exhibiting AP activity in Escherichia coli and A. tumefaciens had <b>junction</b> <b>sites</b> that mapped to two regions, between residues 58 and 84 (region 1) and between residues 450 and 514 (region 2).

40|$|We have {{determined}} the nucleotide sequence of portions of two circular avian sarcoma virus (ASV) DNA molecules cloned in a prokaryotic host [...] vector system. The region whose sequence was determined represents the circle <b>junction</b> <b>site</b> [...] i. e., the site {{at which the}} ends of the unintegrated linear DNA are fused to form circular DNA. The sequence from one cloned molecule, SRA- 2, shows that the circle <b>junction</b> <b>site</b> is the center of a 330 -base-pair (bp) tandem direct repeat, presumably representing the fusion of the long terminal repeat (LTR) units known to be present at {{the ends of the}} linear DNA. The circle <b>junction</b> <b>site</b> is also the center of a 15 -bp imperfect inverted repeat, which thus appears at the boundaries of the LTR. The structure of ASV DNA [...] unique coding region flanked by a direct repeat that is, in turn, terminated with a short inverted repeat [...] is very similar to the structure of certain transposable elements. Several features of the sequence imply that circularization to form the SRA- 2 molecule occurred without loss of information from the linear DNA precursor. Circularization of another cloned viral DNA molecule, SRA- 1, probably occurred by a different mechanism. The circle <b>junction</b> <b>site</b> of the SRA- 1 molecule has a 63 -bp deletion, which may have arisen by a mechanism that is analogous to the integration of viral DNA into the host genome. Flanking one side of the tandem direct repeat is the binding site for tRNATrp, the previously described primer for synthesis of the first strand of viral DNA. The other side of the direct repeat is flanked by a polypurine tract, A-G-G-G-A-G-G-G-G-G-A, which may represent the position of the primer for synthesis of the second strand of viral DNA. An A+T-rich region, upstream from the RNA capping site, and the sequence A-A-T-A-A-A are present within the direct repeat sequence. These sequences may serve as a promoter site and poly(A) addition signal, respectively, as proposed for other eukaryotic transcription units...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{amplification}} of putative oncogenes is {{a common}} finding within the genome of various cancer types. Identification and further targeting of specific <b>junction</b> <b>sites</b> within the sequence of genomic amplicons (amplicon fusion sites, AFS) by PCR (AFS-PCR) is suitable for quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD). This approach has recently been developed and described for MYCN amplified neuroblastomas. To compare AFS-PCR directly to routinely used MRD diagnostic strategies, we mapped the amplified genomic regions (ampGR) of an iAMP 21 -amplicon in high resolution of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Successfully, we established AFS-PCR covering <b>junction</b> <b>sites</b> between ampGR within the iAMP 21 -amplicon. Quantification of MRD by AFS-PCR was directly comparable to IgH/TCR based real time quantitative PCR and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis in consecutive bone marrow (BM) specimens. Our data give an additional proof of concept of AFS-PCR for quantification of MRD. The method could {{be taken into account}} for ALL patients with genomic amplifications as alternative MRD diagnostic, if no or qualitatively poor Ig/TCR-PCRs are available. </p...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that the processing of hepatitis C virus (HCV) E 2 -p 7 -NS 2 precursor mediated by host signal peptidase is relatively inefficient, resulting in the accumulation of E 2 -p 7 -NS 2 and E 2 -p 7 precursors in addition to E 2 in mammalian cells. In this study, we discovered that a significant inhibition of the processing at an E 2 -p 7 <b>junction</b> <b>site</b> is detrimental for HCV pro-duction, whether it {{was caused by the}} mutations in p 7 or by the strategic introduction of a mutation at a terminal residue of E 2 to block the signal peptidase-mediated cleavage of this <b>junction</b> <b>site.</b> However, complete separation of E 2 and p 7 by inserting an encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) between these two proteins also moderately inhibited virus production. These results indicate that optimal processing of the E 2 -p 7 <b>junction</b> <b>site</b> is critical for efficient HCV produc-tion. We further demonstrated that disrupting E 2 -p 7 processing inhibits both NS 2 localization to the putative virus assembly sites near lipid droplets (LD) and NS 2 interaction with NS 3 and E 2. However, the impact, if any, of the p 7 -NS 2 processing effi-ciency on HCV production seems relatively minor. In conclusion, these results imply that effective release of E 2 and p 7 from the precursor E 2 -p 7 promotes HCV production by enhancing NS 2 -associated virus assembly complex formation near LD.

40|$|Abstract Background The human {{homologue}} of the Drosophila Discs-large tumor suppressor protein, hDlg, is a multi-domain {{cytoplasmic protein}} that localizes to the membrane at intercellular <b>junction</b> <b>sites.</b> At both synaptic junctions and epithelia cell-cell junctions, hDlg {{is known to}} recruit several signaling proteins into macromolecular complexes. hDlg is also found at the midbody, a small microtubule-rich structure bridging the two daughter cells during cytokinesis, but its function at this site is not clear. Results Here we describe the interaction of hDlg with the activated form of MEK 2 of the canonical RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, a protein that is found at the midbody during cytokinesis. We show that both proteins localize to a sub-structure of the midbody, the midbody ring, and that {{the interaction between the}} PDZ domains of hDlg and the C-terminal portion of MEK 2 is dependent on the phosphorylation of MEK 2. Finally, we found that E-cadherin also localizes to the midbody and that its expression is required for the isoform-specific recruitment of hDlg, but not activated MEK 2, to that structure. Conclusion Our results suggest that like at other cell-cell <b>junction</b> <b>sites,</b> hDlg is part of a macromolecular complex of structural and signaling proteins at the midbody. </p...|$|R
