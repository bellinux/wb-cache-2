60|$|It {{was finally}} {{decided that the}} echo was property; that the hills were property; {{that the two men}} were {{separate}} and independent owners of the two hills, but tenants in common in the echo; therefore defendant was at full liberty to cut down his hill, since it belonged solely to him, but must give bonds in three million dollars as <b>indemnity</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> which might result to my uncle's half of the echo. This decision also debarred my uncle from using defendant's hill to reflect his part of the echo, without defendant's consent; he must use only his own hill; if his part of the echo would not go, under these circumstances, it was sad, of course, but the court could find no remedy. The court also debarred defendant from using my uncle's hill to reflect his end of the echo, without consent. You see the grand result! Neither man would give consent, and so that astonishing and most noble echo had to cease from its great powers; and since that day that magnificent property is tied up and unsalable.|$|R

They collect 500 taels for each murder of a Catholic. In the Wenchiu country, 680 Catholics were killed, and for this the European Catholics here demand 750,000 strings of cash and 680 heads.In the course of a conversation, Mr. Ament referred to the attitude of the missionaries toward the Chinese. He said: [...] "'I deny emphatically that the missionaries are vindictive, that they generally looted, or that they have done anything since the siege that the circumstances did not demand. I criticise the Americans. The soft hand of the Americans is not as good as the mailed fist of the Germans. If you deal with the Chinese with a soft hand they will take advantage of it.' [...] "The statement that the French Government will return the loot taken by the French soldiers, {{is the source of the}} greatest amusement here. The French soldiers were more systematic looters than the Germans, and it is a fact that to-day Catholic Christians, carrying French flags and armed with modern guns, are looting villages in the Province of Chili." ...|$|R
40|$|An injured seaman sued his {{employer}} in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> injuries suffered on board {{his employer}}’s vessel. The court granted the employer’s motion to implead the United States {{as a third}} party defendant. The employer claimed <b>indemnity</b> <b>for</b> any <b>damages</b> the seaman recovered for injuries aggravated by treatment in a United States hospital. The seaman then moved to amend his complaint to allege an action directly against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The United States objected that venue in the Southern District was improper under the act which provided that “Any civil action on a tort claim against the United States... may be prosecuted only in the judicial district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred. ” The seaman resided in New Jersey, and the alleged aggravation occurred in a hospital in the Eastern District of New York. Held: Motion to amend granted. The proposed amendment was not a “civil action” {{within the meaning of}} the language quoted above. It is true that if the plaintiff need not show proper venue for his suit against the third party defendant, the plaintiff is permitted to sue a person in a district which would have been improper venue for a lawsuit against that person without the impleader. If there is evidence to show that the plaintiff and the original defendant have colluded and used the impleader action to make possible the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s suit against the third party defendant which but for the impleader would have been dismissed for improper venue, then this should be grounds for requiring the plaintiff to meet venue requirements. In the absence of evidence of collusion between the plaintiff and the third party plaintiff, the result of the instant case seems justified...|$|R

Soon after, the U.S. President, Woodrow Wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States {{was on the verge}} of entering the war against Germany following the [...] "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of [...] "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a [...] "free and united Poland". On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement. The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer, because Germany did not state any specific proposals. The Entente powers stated to Wilson that they would not start peace negotiations until the Central powers evacuated all occupied Allied territories and provided <b>indemnities</b> <b>for</b> all <b>damage</b> that had been done.|$|R
