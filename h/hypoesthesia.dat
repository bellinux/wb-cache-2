25|$|Repeated {{infestation}} {{with the}} larva, as occurs in rural and wooded suburban areas where bandicoots are common, rapidly {{leads to the}} development of hypersensitivity. Dramatic local erythema, <b>hypoesthesia</b> and oedema and pruritus may develop within 2–3 hours of attachment of even one larva if a person has been sensitised by a previous bite. In this case attachment of the larvae leads to formation of intra-epidermal blebs and eventually vesicles. These eventually rupture and the larvae detach and are lost. Frequently, a tick embedded over an eyelid will result in gross facial and neck swelling within a few hours. The person can go on to develop very severe signs of tracheopharyngeal compression within 5–6 hours after the first onset of symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hypoesthesia</b> (or hypesthesia) {{refer to}} a reduced sense of touch or sensation, or a partial loss of {{sensitivity}} to sensory stimuli. In everyday speech this is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "numbness".|$|E
50|$|The aim of {{somatosensory}} rehabilitation is {{to increase}} the quality of touch or even normalize the sensation of touch in the case of neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve lesions. Because, when <b>hypoesthesia</b> decreases, neuropathic pain decreases.The assessment of partial hypoaesthesia (axonotmesis) is based on the concept of the largest cutaneous distribution of the nerve branch. The first phase is the mapping which outlines the hypoaesthetic territory - aesthesiography. The second phase is the regular and rigorous assessment of the quality of <b>hypoesthesia</b> in terms of pressure perception threshold. This {{is an important part of}} this rehabilitation.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} finding is oculomotor nerve {{dysfunction}} leading to ophthalmoplegia. This is {{often accompanied by}} ophthalmic nerve dysfunction, leading to <b>hypoesthesia</b> of the upper face. The optic nerve may eventually be involved, with resulting visual impairment.|$|E
5000|$|Neuritis (...) is {{inflammation}} of a nerve or the general {{inflammation of}} the peripheral nervous system.

50|$|Most corneal nerve fibres are sensory {{in origin}} and {{are derived from}} the {{ophthalmic}} branch of the trigeminal nerve6. Congenital or acquired ocular and systemic diseases7 can determine a lesion {{at different levels of}} the trigeminal nerve, which can lead to a reduction (<b>hypoesthesia)</b> or loss (anesthesia) of sensitivity of the cornea8.|$|E
50|$|Dysesthesia {{should not}} be {{confused}} with anesthesia or <b>hypoesthesia,</b> which refer to a loss of sensation, or paresthesia which refers to a distorted sensation. Dysesthesia is distinct in that it can, but not necessarily, refer to spontaneous sensations in the absence of stimuli. In the case of an evoked dysesthetic sensation, such as by the touch of clothing, the sensation is characterized not simply by an exaggeration of the feeling, but rather by a completely inappropriate sensation such as burning.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms: changes in sensation (<b>hypoesthesia),</b> muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty moving; difficulties with coordination and balance; problems in speech (dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, phosphenes or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptomatology (mainly major depression).

50|$|Once ACNES is {{considered}} {{based on the}} patient’s history, the diagnosis can be made via a thorough physical examination: looking for a painful spot, which worsens by tensing the abdominal muscles with lifting the head and straightened legs (Carnett's sign). Almost always, a small area of maximal pain is covered by a larger area of altered skin sensibility with somatosensory disturbances such as <b>hypoesthesia</b> as well as hyperesthesia or hyperalgesia and change of cool perception. Pinching the skin between {{thumb and index finger}} is extremely painful compared to the opposite non-involved side.|$|E

50|$|The main {{presentation}} of the syndrome is significant, acute pain in the chest, along with tenderness and some swelling of the cartilages affected, which is commonly palpable on examination. Perceived pain is often exacerbated with respiration. Although many times it can be extremely painful, {{to the point of}} being debilitating, Tietze's Syndrome is considered to be a benign condition that generally resolves in 12 weeks. However, it can often be a chronic condition.The associated chest pain may present similarly to angina pectoris, normally associated with heart disease, and can cause hyperventilation, anxiety or panic attacks, syncope (passing out), and temporary <b>hypoesthesia</b> (numbness) or paralysis.|$|E
50|$|The Somatosensory Rehabilitation of Neuropathic Pain, is {{a method}} whose aim is to treat {{conditions}} of a reduced sense of touch or sensation (<b>hypoesthesia)</b> in order to decrease neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain, with a prevalency of 6.9% of the general population, represents an important public health problem. e.g. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) concerns 2.7% of the general population.; i.e. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) concerns 26/100,000 person-years of the general population. Patients with chronic pain need every possible therapy to battle the pain. Chronic pain is not a symptom but a syndrome in its own right, and requires therapists {{from a wide range}} of disciplines.So too, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and other physical therapy procedures emerged rapidly, bringing substantial pain relief to large numbers of people.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} <b>hypoesthesia</b> of the lower lip using trigeminal somatosensory-evoked potential following 2 types of sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) and intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO). There were 30 patients with mandibular prognathism, with and without asymmetry, who were divided into three groups: the Obwegeser method (Ob) group, the Obwegeser-Dal Pont method (ODP) group and the intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO) group. The trigeminal somatosensory-evoked potential was recorded in the region of the lower lip and evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. The average recovery periods from lower lip <b>hypoesthesia</b> in the IVRO and the Ob group were significantly shorter than in the ODP group (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Sagittal split {{osteotomy}} {{may result}} in sensory impairment of the inferior alveolar nerve; altered sensation in the lower lip varies from patient to patient. We evaluated individual and intraoperative risk factors of sagittal split osteotomy and correlated these findings with self-reported postoperative changes in lower-lip sensation. Follow-up data for 163 consecutive patients who underwent a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy were assessed for self-reported sensibility disturbances in the lower lip at the last follow-up visit. These self-reports were categorized as normal, <b>hypoesthesia,</b> hyperesthesia, or slightly diminished sensation in the central area of the chin. The overall rate of self-reported changed sensibility was 15. 1 % (49 / 324; 13. 0 % {{on the right side}} and 17. 3 % on the left side). Of 16 patients (9. 9 %) who experienced <b>hypoesthesia</b> on the right side and 25 patients (15. 4 %) who experienced <b>hypoesthesia</b> on the left side, 10 experienced bilateral <b>hypoesthesia</b> (31 patients total, 19. 1 %). Genioplasty and age at surgery were significant predictors of hypoesthesia; a 1 -year increase in age at surgery increased the odds of hyposensitivity by 5 %, and the odds of <b>hypoesthesia</b> in patients with concurrent genioplasty were 4. 5 times higher than in patients without genioplasty.

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{investigate}} {{the development of}} <b>hypoesthesia</b> from soon after the whiplash injury to 6 months postinjury and (2) to determine differences in detection thresholds between those with initial features of poor recovery and those without these signs. Methods: Fifty-two participants with acute whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) (30; sensory hypersensitivity) or "low risk" (n= 35; without these signs). Detection thresholds to electrical, thermal, and vibration stimuli and psychological distress were prospectively measured within 1 month of injury and then 3 and 6 months postinjury. Detection thresholds were also measured in the 38 controls. Results: Both WAD groups showed <b>hypoesthesia</b> (vibration, electrical, and cold) at 1 month postinjury. Vibration and electrocutaneous <b>hypoesthesia</b> persisted to 3 and 6 months only in the high-risk WAD group. Heat detection thresholds were not different between the groups at 1 month postinjury but were elevated in the high-risk group at 3 and 6 months. Both WAD groups were distressed at 1 month but this decreased by 3 months in the low-risk group. The differences in the Impact of Event Scale did not impact {{on any of the}} sensory measures. Discussion: Sensory <b>hypoesthesia</b> is a feature of acute WAD but persists only in those at higher risk of poor recovery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is an {{important}} outcome variable after inguinal hernia repair that is generally not assessed by objective methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to objectively investigate chronic pain and <b>hypoesthesia</b> after inguinal hernia repair using three types of operation: open suture, open mesh, and laparoscopic. METHODS: A total of 96 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 4. 7 years. Open suture repair was performed in 40 patients (group A), open mesh repair in 20 patients (group B), and laparoscopic repair in 36 patients (group C). <b>Hypoesthesia</b> and pain were assessed using von Frey monofilaments. Quality of life was investigated with Short Form 36. RESULTS: Pain occurring at least once a week was found in 7 (17. 5 %) patients of group A, in 5 (25 %) patients of group B, and in 6 (16. 6 %) patients of group C. Area and intensity of hyposensibility were increased significantly after open nonmesh and mesh repair compared to those after laparoscopy (p = 0. 01). Hyposensibility in patients who had laparoscopic hernia repair was significantly associated with postoperative pain (p = 0. 03). Type of postoperative pain was somatic in 19 (61 %), neuropathic in 9 (29 %), and visceral in 3 (10 %) patients without significant differences between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <b>hypoesthesia</b> in patients who had laparoscopic hernia repair is significantly lower than in those who had open hernia repair. <b>Hypoesthesia</b> after laparoscopic but not after open repair is significantly associated with postoperative pain. Von Frey monofilaments are important tools for the assessment of inguinal <b>hypoesthesia</b> and pain in patients who had inguinal hernia repair allowing quantitative and qualitative comparison between various surgical techniques...|$|E
