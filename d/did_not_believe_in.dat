5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable {{fate of the}} prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned {{the theme of the}} crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|As a critic, Willis <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> {{including}} {{discussions of}} personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, {{they should not}} express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when}} many publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5|$|Marshall <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> rule by the masses, {{frequently}} {{expressing his}} {{disdain for the}} common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most {{of the members of}} his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5000|$|The {{followers}} of Tantra were often branded as Nāstika {{by the political}} proponents of the Vedic tradition. The term Nāstika <b>does</b> <b>not</b> denote an atheist since the Veda presents a godless system with no singular almighty being or multiple almighty beings. It is applied {{only to those who}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the Vedas. The s and s <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God, but they <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the Vedas and hence they are not Nāstikas.

5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at the company <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> it and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. In the end they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> winning at any costs; he truly believed {{that the most important}} aspect of college football was the college football player. As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E

During the summer of 1882, she sent Wyatt a letter saying she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he {{had asked her to}} marry him. Wyatt, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Dodd {{took over}} the Georgia Tech {{football}} program in 1945 following Coach Alexander's retirement as head football coach. Dodd's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd's philosophy translated to winning; he set the record for career wins at Tech with 165, including a 31-game unbeaten streak from 1951–1953. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and the 1952 national title, which concluded a perfect 12–0 season and Sugar Bowl conquest of Ole Miss. Under Dodd's leadership, Tech played in 13 major bowl games, winning 9, including six in a row. Bobby Dodd compiled a 165–64–8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Loucks Devers {{was born}} on 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, a small {{industrial}} town in the southeastern corner of the state. His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks Devers, a homemaker. He {{was the first of}} the couple's four children. He had two younger brothers, Frank and Phillip, and a younger sister, Catherine, known as Kitts. The Devers, of Irish and German-Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> smoking or drinking. While providing a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple taught them to value dependability, integrity and industriousness.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees started Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season. He {{was again}} named an All-Star during the 1938 season. Yankees' manager Joe McCarthy, who managed the AL {{team in the}} All-Star Game, chose {{teammate}} Lefty Gomez as the starting pitcher. As McCarthy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> pitching two players from the same team in an All-Star Game, Ruffing did {{not appear in the}} game. He led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season. He also tied for the AL lead in shutouts during with three, while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the league, behind only Grove. Ruffing pitched the opening game of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs. He won two games in the series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs. Ruffing finished fourth in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season.|$|E
