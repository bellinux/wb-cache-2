40|$|A human 70 -kDa {{heat shock}} protein (hsp 70) gene segment has been isolated. The segment {{contains}} 3. 15 kilobase pairs (kbp) of 5 ' nontranscribed sequence, an RNA leader of 119 bp, and a protein-coding region of 741 bp. The human protein sequence shows {{a high degree of}} homology to hsp 70 sequences from other species. Expression experiments in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells indicate that a region that includes only 105 bp of 5 ' nontranscribed sequence contains all elements required for the efficient <b>heat-controlled</b> expression of the human gene. Two adjacent identical sequence elements, which are partly homologous to the Drosophila "heat shock consensus" sequence, are located 57 to 76 bp upstream from the capping site. Interestingly, the capping site itself is flanked by inverted repeat sequences...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Within {{the scope}} of a {{comprehensive}} study and two development and demonstration projects, various technologies in the power range of up to 2 MWel for small-scale biomass-fired CHP plants have been investigated, evaluated and compared considering technical {{as well as economic}} aspects. Such plants should normally be operated on a <b>heat-controlled</b> basis in order to achieve a high overall efficiency and should run for more than 5, 000 annual full load operating hours to ensure economical operation. Two of the technologies examined are very promising and innovative: the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) process and the Stirling engine process. The ORC process represents an economically interesting technology for small-scale biomass-fired combined heat and power plants in a power range between 400 and 1, 500 kWel. A newly developed ORC technology with a nominal electric capacity of 1, 000 kW was implemented in the biomass CHP plant Lienz (A) in the framework of an EU demonstration project. This plant was put in operation in February 2001. Stirling engines are a promising solution for installations with nominal electric capacities between 10 and 150 kW. A biomass CHP pilot plant based on a 35 kWel-Stirling engine was developed and put into operation in the end of summer 2002. Up to the end of June 2003 the plant has run for more than 4, 300 hours with very promising results...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of Drosophila melanogaster hsp 23 -Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase hybrid genes containing different {{segments of the}} 5 ' non-transcribed sequence of the hsp 23 gene has been examined at the RNA and protein levels in Xenopus oocytes. Transcription of the hybrid genes is initiated correctly. Mutant genes with hsp 23 gene promoter segments of at least 140 bp in length are strongly heat-activated while genes with shorter promoter segments are expressed constitutively and at low levels. This maps an element required for the <b>heat-controlled</b> {{expression of}} the D. melanogaster hsp 23 gene to a region, approximately 140 bp upstream {{from the start of}} the transcription site, which contains a sequence (CGAGAAGTT-TCGTGT) that is closely related to the one responsible for the heat regulation of the hsp 70 gene. These findings demonstrate the importance of this regulatory sequence for a second hsp gene and support the notion that hsp genes are heat-regulated by a common mechanism. The functional element in the hsp 23 gene promoter is located greater than 80 bp further upstream from the TATA box than the relevant element in the hsp 70 gene promoter. Even though other related sequences are present further upstream and downstream from the functional element, they play at most an auxiliary role in the regulation of hsp 23 gene expression...|$|E
