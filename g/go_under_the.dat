25|$|Lowering ones elbow {{below the}} knee during a 'pull' - known as 'Locking' - is a foul, as is {{touching}} the ground for extended periods of time. The rope must <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> arms; actions such as pulling the rope over the shoulders may be considered a foul. These rules apply in highly organized competitions such as the World Championships. However, in small or informal entertainment competitions, the rules are often arbitrarily interpreted and followed.|$|E
25|$|As Singaporean gynaecological {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skillful, {{leaders in the}} field like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female (SRS) at Kandang Kerbau Hospital. The first such operation in Asia took place in Singapore in July 1971. However, before patients could <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> knife, they first had to subject themselves to an exhaustive battery of tests and be given a clean psychological bill of health by chief academic psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo.|$|E

During {{the planning stages}} several proposals were considered for how this crossing would be made, some of which included a 3km tunnel to <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> entire valley and a surface freeway requiring {{the destruction of the}} natural environment. The state government decided on a compromise and two 1.5-km tunnels were subsequently built under the creek and valley. The eastbound tunnel was named after the creek, the other being named after Dame Nellie Melba.|$|E
25|$|Sydney was {{the first}} of four frigates {{selected}} to <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> A$1 billion FFG Upgrade, with HMA Ships Darwin, Melbourne and Newcastle following. The upgrade features an 8-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) for 32 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), upgrades to fire control and air warning radars, and replacement of the hull-mounted sonar and diesel generators. This refit commenced in 2002, but problems with integrating the frigates' anti-missile and anti-torpedo detection and defence systems meant that when Sydney was finished in 2007, she was initially not accepted back into service. By November 2008, the problems with the upgrade had been solved.|$|E

25|$|As Singaporean {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skilful, some like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform male-to-female sex-reassignment surgery at Kandang Kerbau Hospital from 1971 onwards. However, before hopeful transsexuals-to-be could <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> knife, they {{first had to}} subject themselves to a battery of psychological tests by psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo. Later, the more technically demanding female-to-male variety was also offered there and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the National University Hospital two decades later. In fact, for thirty years, Singapore {{was one of the}} world leaders in gender-reassignment surgery. Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of genders from transvestites to iatrogenic intersex individuals to fully transformed women. Local hospitals and clinics also attracted transgender clients from other countries in the region, especially Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
500|$|The station's {{upper and}} lower levels are about [...] and [...] deep respectively, making the station among the system's deepest. This depth is because it has to <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> IRT Lexington Avenue Line and other {{existing}} infrastructure, {{in addition to the}} IND tunnels having to <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> East River a short distance to the east. At the original (1989) mezzanine at Lexington Avenue, there are a total of eight escalators, four staircases and two elevators from the fare mezzanine to platform level. There is an in-building entrance with two escalators and a staircase, and another, stand-alone entrance with a staircase, from the street to the Lexington Avenue fare mezzanine. Two additional staircases between the platform levels are at the eastern end of platforms, past the elevator. A third staircase between the platform levels has been constructed.|$|E

The opponent would often unmask Haas mid-match, returning him to his normal demeanor. During this persona, Haas usually competed in dark matches before the live broadcast of Raw or on Heat.|$|E

Her sail was found to be too high to <b>go</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> scaffolding, so the top [...] was cut away and re-attached later.|$|E

[...] Belknap created a commission to either destroy and rebuild the bridge to allow steamers to go under, or to build a canal around the bridge for steamers to pass. [...] Eads, who was friends with Grant, visited Washington D.C. in November 1873 before Belknap submitted the report to Congress, and asked that Grant rescue the bridge from destruction. [...] Belknap stated he had the authority to keep the rivers from being obstructed according to federal law.|$|E
