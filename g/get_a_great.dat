500|$|Members of {{the crew}} praised the work of Robert Picardo on this episode, with Taylor {{saying that he was}} [...] "wonderful" [...] in [...] "Heroes and Demons", while Piller saw the {{character}} as a [...] "fish out of water" [...] and added that [...] "Picardo is a wonderful actor." [...] Kenneth Biller, executive story editor, felt that the episode gave Picardo a [...] "chance to shine", and that the episode was [...] "a lot of fun". Picardo himself was pleased with the episode, later describing it as his favourite of the first season. Garrett Wang also added that he was happy with the episode, as being an Asian-American actor he didn't otherwise <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of chances to appear in period work, and he enjoyed the wardrobe he wore.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation was undecided {{about whether the}} main point of the episode where Captain Archer is expected to lead the Vulcans back to their main path of logic was a [...] "wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive Trek in which humans have all the answers". She thought that the change in Soval's opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that {{the other members of}} the main cast didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal to do in the episode. However, whilst she thought that [...] "Awakening" [...] was a visual improvement over [...] "The Forge", she was reserving judgement until she had seen the third part of the trilogy. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that certain elements of the plot didn't follow logical paths, such as how Archer found the Kir'shara in a few minutes when apparently the Syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though [...] "it sits in a chamber behind a door that practically announces, 'IMPORTANT RELIC INSIDE'?" [...] However, he called the episode entertaining and gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the group stages of the Champions League in the 2005–06 season, finishing first in a group containing Ajax, Sparta Prague and Thun. The club faced Real Madrid in the last 16; a solo goal by Henry at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in the first leg inflicted the home team's first defeat in 18 Champions League matches. Arsenal produced a disciplined display at home a fortnight after to reach the quarter-finals and become the sole English representative left in the competition. At home to Juventus, Arsenal won 2–0, and a goalless draw at the Stadio delle Alpi meant the club progressed into the semi-finals against Villarreal. In the club's final European match at Higbhury, Kolo Touré scored a first-half winner to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. A late penalty save by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the second leg sent Arsenal into the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, staged at the Stade de France, Paris. The result, another goalless draw, was Arsenal's tenth clean sheet in a row – a new competition record.
