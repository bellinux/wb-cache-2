The group travels far and through dangerous territory. Bigwig and Silver, both former Owsla and the strongest rabbits among them, do well to keep the others protected, along with Hazel's keen observations and good judgement.|$|E

The most {{successful}} sport for Slovenia at the Summer Olympics is judo with five medals (two gold) while {{the most successful}} sport at the Winter Olympics is alpine skiing with seven medals (two gold). In team sports, the national teams have participated three times in handball and once in ice hockey, and the ice hockey team has already qualified for the tournament at the 2018 Winter Olympics. With a population of 2 million, Slovenia often <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> among countries with the highest medal-per-capita rankings.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, <b>finds</b> <b>itself,</b> like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E

5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
25|$|When {{consciousness}} {{reaches the}} fourth plane, it <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> {{in a very}} particular state. It is fully conscious of the infinite potential of energy and can make full use of it and it also becomes aware of the mental world. This new contact creates very strong desires {{to make use of}} this huge potential. At this point consciousness <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> in the biggest danger of its long development. Not being able to control its feelings or thoughts, the soul is strongly tempted to handle infinite energy. If the infinite potential of this plane is misused, consciousness gets completely disintegrated and the soul <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> back to the stone-form consciousness and has to start again the long course of evolution from there. If it abstains from using this energy it enters the lower mental plane and if it makes a completely selfless use of it, {{for the benefit of the}} spiritual development of others in illusion, it even moves directly to the higher mental plane.|$|E

25|$|Embodied mind {{theories}} {{hold that}} mathematical thought {{is a natural}} outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> in our physical universe.

It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} in churches {{directly}} influenced by Anglican ethos and theology, the ACC tends to reflect the dominant social and cultural strains of the nation in which it <b>finds</b> <b>itself.</b> For most of its history, the ACC embodied the conservative, colonial outlook of its mostly British-descended parishioners and of English Canada as a whole. In the post-World War II period, as the character of Canada changed, so too did the attitudes of people in the pews, and by extension, the church.|$|E
25|$|As the {{practice}} {{continues to grow}} within China, tensions emerge between Falun Gong and Chinese authorities. In 1996, Falun Gong withdraws from the China Qigong Scientific Research Society, and thereafter <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> the subject of growing scrutiny and criticism in the state-run press. The practice becomes a subject of high-level debates within the government and Communist Party, with some ministries and government authorities expressing continued support for {{the practice}}, and others becoming increasingly wary of the group. This tension also {{played out in the}} media, as some outlets continued to laud the effects of Falun Gong, while others criticized it as pseudoscience.|$|E

25|$|These form an {{organizing}} principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robotic-based fiction, appearing in his Robot series, the stories linked to it, and his Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws {{are incorporated into}} {{almost all of the}} positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it <b>finds</b> <b>itself.</b> Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E
25|$|While the {{telecoms}} sector {{remains the}} big earner, with Dh33 billion ($4.3 billion), the IT and off shore industries should generate Dh21 billion ($2.7 billion) each by 2012. In addition, {{the number of}} employees should increase from 40,000 to 125,000. The government hopes that adding more local content to the internet will increase usage. There have also been efforts to add more computers to schools and universities. E-commerce is likely to take off in the next few years, especially as the use of credit cards is gaining more ground in Morocco. Although computer and internet use have made a great leap forward in the past five years, the IT market still <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> in infancy and offers great potential for further development.|$|E
25|$|Medicare <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> in the odd {{position}} of having assumed control of graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, {{as well as for}} physician reimbursement rates. This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physicians' assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.|$|E

25|$|The power {{problems}} were further exacerbated by Mbeki's government policy of attracting energy-intensive industry (such as Aluminium smelters) through the carrot of cheap electricity. This meant that, as Eskom's excess capacity {{ran out and}} became a deficit, the South African government <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> contractually bound to provide power to energy-intensive industries. Despite this meaning {{the rest of the}} country experienced traffic problems and business disruption due to the blackouts. For South Africa to remain a desirable foreign investment destination the country must be seen to honour its contractual obligations. To shut down the smelters is not a simple process, said one analyst. Government would be paying the cost of effects all through the relevant parties aluminium value chain – its aluminium refineries and bauxite ore mines in other countries.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February 2009, Strauss-Kahn stated 'This {{commitment}} is the single-largest supplemental financing contribution by an IMF member country ever, and it clearly demonstrates Japan's leadership and continuing {{commitment to a}} multilateral approach to global economic and financial challenges.' Strauss-Kahn said he hoped other countries would join Japan in providing support to the 185-nation institution. Prime Minister Taro Aso told Japan was ready to lend up to $100 billion from our foreign reserves to the IMF if it <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> with insufficient funds to help emergency economies. Nikkei Business Daily reported that selling U.S. government bonds held by Japan to provide cash to the IMF would affect U.S. bond yields so Tokyo may consider lending U.S. government bonds to the IMF as collateral for it to raise funds.|$|E
25|$|Although the Chilean rodeo was {{declared}} a national sport, it <b>finds</b> <b>itself</b> in a precarious position {{in terms of}} finances, political support and promotion. Part {{of the reason for}} this is that the federation does not receive any of the revenue of Chiledeportes like the rest of sports federations in Chile. This is because only sports that represent Chile overseas receive funds. The Chilean Rodeo Federation has been critical of the government for the lack of funds towards the sport, arguing that because in many parts of the country, due to the distance from population centers, sporting events do not arrive, the local population turn to the rodeo as their primary pass time throughout the Chilean rural territory. Nevertheless, thanks to the commitment and support of its many fans, the rodeo has maintained its popularity, especially in the rural areas, and its status as the second most popular sport in Chile.|$|E
