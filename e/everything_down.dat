500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{gave the}} film a mixed review. He wrote, [...] " [...] is an instant guilty pleasure, a gorgeously shot, {{visually}} complex film whose badness is what's so good about it. You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing, mind-numbing rigors of ballet, but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible." [...] Honeycutt commended Millepied's [...] "sumptuous" [...] choreography and Libatique's [...] "darting, weaving" [...] camera work. The critic {{said of the}} thematic mashup, [...] "Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements {{to the world of}} ballet ... White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work, but the horror-movie nonsense drags <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> the rabbit hole of preposterousness." [...] Similarly, in a piece for The Huffington Post, Rob Kirkpatrick praised Portman's performance but compared the film's story to that of Showgirls (1995) and Burlesque (2010) while concluding Black Swan is [...] "simply higher-priced cheese, Aronofsky's camembert to [...] Antin's cheddar.|$|E

[...] Jones further commented that [...] "finger clicks, bongos and mellow guitars are {{a welcome change}} from the squealing synths and pounding beats favoured by Bieber and his peers," [...] and that the album {{had the ability to}} connect with audiences beyond his demographic. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B-" [...] rating, stating [...] that the album doesn't change Bieber's beloved [...] "kiddie-soul vocals" [...] calling it [...] "perfunctory", but said that acoustic renditions such as [...] "Baby", [...] "One Time" [...] and new song [...] "Pray" [...] deliver their [...] "saccharine payload." [...] Thomas Conneron of Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "calming down several of the pop tunes with slower tempos and patient singing" [...] was not bad and that slowing <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> made listeners hear how the singer's voice had matured.|$|E

I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

Lazzara later called the solo [...] "funny and great." [...] According to Mascherino, the group wanted the song [...] "to sound as much like the Cure as possible, so it’s all clean guitars." [...] He said that the drums on [...] "I'll Let You Live" [...] were recorded at a faster tempo, sounding [...] "totally deeper" [...] when played back. [...] "Sleep" [...] was the band's attempt at a Motown-inspired bass sound. [...] "Brooklyn (If You See Something, Say Something)" [...] contains a [...] "real floaty, airy pre-chorus and then it’s upbeat but dark," [...] according to Lazzara. He did not regret dropping [...] "Sleep" [...] and [...] "Brooklyn" [...] from the final track listing [...] "because when you listen to <b>everything</b> <b>down,</b> they just didn’t really feel like they fit." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ripken {{finally reached}} the major leagues when the Orioles named him their bullpen coach. Halfway through 1977, he became the third base coach for the Orioles when Billy Hunter was hired to be {{the manager of the}} Texas Rangers. Ripken served in this role through the 1986 season. During this time, and even later when he became a manager, he would pitch batting {{practice}} and hit fungoes before games. He {{would be one of the}} last members of the team to leave after games. Ripken could be tough on the players he coached, enjoying using the term [...] "lunkhead" [...] when talking to them, but he would always make time to answer any questions they had about the game. Doug DeCinces, who played under him through the 1981 season, recalled, [...] "He was the dictator of that regimen, instructing us on <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> to how to wear our socks. He said, `Take pride in your appearance and you'll take pride in your game.'" [...] The Orioles experienced great success during this time, reaching the World Series in 1979, which they lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Four years later, Ripken earned a World Series ring as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series in five games over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E

500|$|Jean-Clement Sorret was {{the digital}} colorist for the film, this {{being one of}} the few {{instances}} in which a colorist received a spot in the opening credits. The film contains many coloring effects and [...] "density shifts" [...] of lighting to reflect the moods of the characters. For example, when Hayley gets angry, the colors would be edited to be of lower frequency. One effect used which, as far as the director is aware, had not been done in cinema before, was to brighten the lighting in filming and correct <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> in post-production. This allowed for facial details to be visible even while having a darkened atmosphere. According to the DVD extras, the process required a custom-built digital intermediate to be made and proved to be extremely difficult, with corrections having to be made frame-by-frame in some instances. This technique, known as ETTR, is a standard procedure in digital photography and cinematography to minimize the amount of noise in shadows and midtones. Early working titles of the script were Vendetta and Snip Snip. The producer wanted a title with a [...] "sugar and spice combination and a mixture of harsh roughness, innocence, and vulnerability", and settled on the title Hard Candy.|$|E
500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> on paper. But we get to play around a little bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

The beginning of the recovery looks similar to pulling the hand out of the back pocket of a pair of pants, with the small finger upwards. Further into the recovery phase, the hand movement has been compared to pulling up a center zip on a wetsuit. [...] The recovering hand moves forward, with the fingers trailing downward, just above the surface of the water.

Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust was favorable to his performance, writing that, [...] "To be fair, [...] {{if there was}} one pop star in music right now who was born to deliver an on-stage karate dance performance, it was probably Breezy, and he acquits himself admirably in the mock-combat. And at least with this performance, he saves the super-physical stuff for the end, leaving him free to, y’know, actually sing during his proper performance–something of a novelty for Brown at award-show performances of late." [...] He also performed the song during a medley at the 2013 BET Awards on June 30, 2013, alongside [...] "Don't Think They Know". The performance started with Brown wearing a black skeleton outfit and flanked by dancers marked with bright yellow [...] "X"s on their otherwise black and white ensembles, while performing [...] "Fine China".

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 January 1933, when the {{conservative}} Junker Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin told Papen that his plan to have Hitler as Chancellor while retaining power for himself was an absurd scheme that could only end very badly for everybody, Papen replied: [...] "What do you want? I have the confidence of Hindenburg. In two months we'll have pushed Hitler so far into the corner that he'll squeal." [...] In the end, the President, who had previously vowed never to allow Hitler (whom he derisively {{referred to as a}} 'Bohemian corporal'), to become Chancellor, appointed Hitler to the post on 30 January 1933, with Papen as Vice-Chancellor. The British historian Edgar Feuchtwanger wrote that Schleicher's rapid rise and fall from power was due to the system of presidential government he had created in 1930, as the system of presidential government reduced almost <b>everything</b> <b>down</b> to the whims of President Hindenburg, and gave enormous power to those like Papen who happened to enjoy Hindenburg's trust and favor. [...] The system of presidential government created very personalized politics where those who had the approval of Hindenburg and his Kamarilla enjoyed power {{and those who did not}} were excluded from power, regardless of what the voters felt. On institutional grounds, Papen should had been in a weak position as he was a very unpopular former Chancellor without a seat in the Reichstag or even a political party, whose influence was based entirely on his friendship with Hindenburg. Feuchwanger wrote that Papen was a vain, irresponsible intriguer who was only powerful in January 1933 because he was Hindenburg's favorite politician and the president wanted his favorite back into office again.|$|E
