5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of shapes—he used the deduction of {{the sizes of}} angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of {{orbital mechanics}} {{would make the}} arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E

25|$|Although their lordships {{were divided}} 3–2 {{as to the}} result of the appeal and adopted {{slightly}} different formulations of the applicable principles, there was broad agreement that, in confidentiality cases involving issues of privacy, the focus shifted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the relationship between claimant and defendant to (a) an examination {{of the nature of the}} information itself and (b) a balancing exercise between the claimant's rights under Article 8 and the defendant's competing rights (for example, under Article 10, to free speech).|$|E
25|$|A {{team led}} by Fargione <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> Conservancy found that {{clearing}} natural lands for use as agricultural land to produce biofuel feedstock creates a carbon debt.

The study examined six scenarios of wilderness conversion, Brazilian Amazon to soybean biodiesel, Brazilian Cerrado to soybean biodiesel, Brazilian Cerrado to sugarcane ethanol, Indonesian or Malaysian lowland tropical rainforest to palm biodiesel, Indonesian or Malaysian peatland tropical rainforest to oil palm forest, and U.S. Central grassland to corn ethanol.|$|E

Teams of European astronomers will conduct the surveys; some will cover {{most of the}} southern sky, while others will focus on smaller areas. VISTA and the VST are expected to produce large amounts of data; a single picture taken by VISTA has 67megapixels, and images from OmegaCam (on the VST) will have 268megapixels. The two survey telescopes will collect more data every night {{than all the other}} instruments on the VLT combined. The VST and VISTA will produce more than 100 terabytes of data per year.|$|E

Scientists, engineers, and economists <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> Conservancy and Dow are working together at three pilot sites (North America, Latin America, and TBD) to implement and refine models that support corporate decision-making related to the value and resources nature provides. Those ecosystem services include water, land, air, oceans {{and a variety of}} plant and animal life. These sites will serve as a “living laboratories”, to validate and test methods and models so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at Dow and hopefully influence the decision-making and business practices of other companies.|$|E

25|$|The {{heights in}} rear of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe, are {{somewhat}} lower than those on the opposite or Fleurus side of the valley; and, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the ground, troops, particularly artillery, were more exposed on the former than on the latter, where the undulations afford better cover. The descent from either side into the villages of Wagnelée, Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and Saint-Amand, was gentle: between the latter point and Mont-Potriaux {{the sides of the}} valley descend more rapidly: and below that village they become steep, particularly about Tongrinne, Boignée, and Balâtre: while the ground above commanded alternately from side to side. Above Mont-Potriaux, the bed of the valley was soft, and occasionally swampy: below that Mont-Potriaux the ground was still softer. The buildings in the villages were generally of stone, with thatched roofs, and comprised several farm houses with courtyards, presenting great capabilities for defence. Saint-Amand and Boignée were the most salient points of the position, the central portion of which retired considerably, particularly near Mont-Potriaux.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Family Radio {{began running}} the Open Forum, a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011. Listeners {{were invited to}} call in, {{primarily}} with questions {{about the meaning of}} certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of sin and salvation, to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education. The Open Forum continued running until Camping's partial retirement in July 2011, and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The Open Forum was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via shortwave station WYFR, a network of AM and FM radio stations, a cable television station and the Internet. In October 2012, over a year after the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio began airing repeats of his broadcasts.|$|E

In the interpretation of an expression of intent, the real intention of the parties must be sought rather than the literal meaning of the words.
