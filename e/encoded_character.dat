50|$|In ISO/IEC 646 (commonly {{known as}} ASCII) and related {{standards}} including ISO 8859 and Unicode, a graphic character is any character {{intended to be}} written, printed, or otherwise displayed {{in a form that}} can be read by humans. In other words, it is any <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> that is associated with one or more glyphs.|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} between systems and display devices has historically required <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> strings which, though successful, {{can lead to}} complexity in creation and debugging. DisplayML is easy to understand, since XML is a human readable format. The protocol is applicable to numerous display devices using various technologies such as LED, LCD, Bi-stable Magnetic, flip-disc display, VGA etc.|$|E
50|$|Not {{addressed}} by the current specification is {{what to do with}} <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> data. For example, in computers, character data manifests in encoded form, at some level, and thus could be treated as either binary or character data when being mapped to URI characters. Presumably, {{it is up to the}} URI scheme specifications to account for this possibility and require one or the other, but in practice, few, if any, actually do.|$|E

50|$|Some {{encodings}} (the {{original version}} of BinHex and the recommended encoding for CipherSaber) use four bits instead of six, mapping all possible sequences of 4 bits onto the 16 standard hexadecimal digits.Using 4 bits per <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> {{leads to a}} 50% longer output than base64, but simplifies encoding and decodingâ€”expanding each byte in the source independently to two encoded bytes is simpler than base64's expanding 3 source bytes to 4 encoded bytes.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the term}} {{character}} {{has been widely}} used by industry professionals to refer to an <b>encoded</b> <b>character,</b> often {{as defined by the}} programming language or API. Likewise, character set has been widely used to refer to a specific repertoire of characters that have been mapped to specific bit sequences or numerical codes. The term glyph is used to describe a particular visual appearance of a character. Many computer fonts consist of glyphs that are indexed by the numerical code of the corresponding character.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, BCI {{published}} a reference guide [...] containing 2300 vocabulary items and detailed {{rules for the}} graphic design of additional characters, so they settled a first set of approved Bliss-words for general use.The Standards Council of Canada then sponsored, on January 21, 1993, the registration of an <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> set for use in ISO/IEC 2022, in the ISO-IR international registry of coded character sets.After many years of requests, the Blissymbolic language was finally approved as an encoded language, with code zbl, into the ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 standards.|$|E

5000|$|During this period, {{a number}} of {{companies}} were developing the first teletext systems, notably the BBC's Ceefax system. Ceefax <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> data into the lines in the vertical blanking interval of normal television signals where they could not be seen on-screen, and then used a buffer and decoder in the user's television to convert these into [...] "pages" [...] of text on the display. The Independent Broadcasting Authority quickly introduced their own ORACLE system, and the two organizations subsequently agreed to use a single standard, the [...] "Broadcast Teletext Specification".|$|E
5000|$|Without padding, after normal {{decoding}} of four {{characters to}} three bytes {{over and over}} again, less than four encoded characters may remain. In this situation {{only two or three}} characters shall remain. A single remaining <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> is not possible (because a single base 64 character only contains 6 bits, and 8 bits are required to create a byte, so a minimum of 2 base 64 characters are required : the first character contributes 6 bits, and the second character contributes its first 2 bits) [...] For example: ...|$|E
50|$|Another encoding, UCS-4, uses {{a single}} code value between 0 and (theoretically) {{hexadecimal}} 7FFFFFFF for each character (although the UCS stops at 10FFFF and ISO/IEC 10646 {{has stated that}} all future assignments of characters will also take place in that range). UCS-4 allows representation of each value as exactly four bytes (one 32-bit word). UCS-4 thereby permits a binary representation of every code point in the UCS, including those outside the BMP. As in UCS-2, every <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> has a fixed length in bytes, which makes it simple to manipulate, {{but of course it}} requires twice as much storage as UCS-2.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{group of}} sixty output {{characters}} (corresponding to 45 input bytes) is output {{as a separate}} line preceded by an <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> giving the number of encoded bytes on that line. For all lines except the last, {{this will be the}} character 'h' (the character mapping to the value 45). If the input is not evenly divisible by 45, the last line will contain the remaining N output characters, preceded by the number of remaining input bytes encoded as above. Finally, a line containing just a single space (or plus character) is output, followed by one line containing the string [...] "end".|$|E
50|$|Each part of ISO/IEC 8859 is {{designed}} to support languages that often borrow from each other, so the characters needed by each language are usually accommodated by a single part. However, there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions. Efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible. For example, German has all of its seven special characters at the same positions in all Latin variants (1-4, 9, 10, 13-16), and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets. In particular, variants 1-4 were designed jointly, and have the property that every <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> appears either at a given position or not at all.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} ISO 10646 standard {{defines a}} 32-bit encoding form called UCS-4, {{in which each}} <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> in the Universal Character Set (UCS) is represented by a 31-bit value between 0 and 0x7FFFFFFF (the sign bit was unused and zero). In November 2003, Unicode was restricted by RFC 3629 to match {{the constraints of the}} UTF-16 character encoding: explicitly prohibiting code points greater than U+10FFFF (and also the high and low surrogates U+D800 through U+DFFF). Although the ISO standard had (as of 1998 in Unicode 2.1) [...] "reserved for private use" [...] 0xE00000 to 0xFFFFFF, and 0x60000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF these areas were removed in later versions. Because the Principles and Procedures document of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 Working Group 2 states that all future assignments of characters will be constrained to the Unicode range, UTF-32 will be able to represent all UCS characters and UTF-32 and UCS-4 are identical.|$|E

40|$|Fine-grained {{sentiment}} analysis is receiving increasing attention in recent years. Extracting opinion target expressions (OTE) in reviews {{is often an}} important step in fine-grained, aspect-based {{sentiment analysis}}. Retrieving this information from user-generated text, however, can be difficult. Customer reviews, for instance, are prone to contain misspelled words and are difficult to process due to their domain-specific language. In this work, we investigate whether character-level models can improve the performance for the identification of opinion target expressions. We integrate information about the character structure of a word into a sequence labeling system using character-level word embeddings and show their positive impact on the system's performance. Specifically, we obtain an increase by 3. 3 points F 1 -score with respect to our baseline model. In further experiments, we reveal <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> patterns of the learned embeddings and give a nuanced view of the performance differences of both models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The idea of {{this paper}} is to invent a new {{strategy}} in steganography to get the minimum effect on the images which is used to hide data into it. This is by dividing the original image into a number of segments, these segments is achieved according to the number of characters included into the message which is going to be hided into the original image. In this approach the message will be coded by using the coding table. After the massage has been coded, it will be hidden into the image. The new technique is starting to search segments in the image that corresponded to the coded characters, in this stage the technique is mark out the positions of each <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> included in the original message. At last we tried to test the new technique we found that the positions of the character in image doesn't been affected, beside that the new technique is also hard to been beaked by uninterested users...|$|E
40|$|Dictionary {{is used by}} many {{compression}} methods. Some of {{them put}} the dictionary into the compressed message. In such cases the improvements in dictionary compression can improve {{the performance of the}} compression methods. We have focused on compression of dictionaries of words or syllables. The dictionary compression is often based on trie representation of the dictionary. We suppose that proper encoding of the trie can save a lot of space. We have therefore focused on minimizing the stored information corresponding to a trie node. We store only the number of children encoded by Elias gamma code [1], the difference of <b>encoded</b> <b>character</b> from the left sibling encoded by Elias delta code, and the information whether given node represents a dictionary item stored in a single bit. The distance from left brother is skipped for the root and the information whether the node represents a dictionary item is skipped by the leaves. The difference in characters represented by siblings can be further reduced by proper reordering (or, in some cases, even by reduction) of the used alphabet. Smaller differences can be then represented by shorter codes. If the dictionary is logicall...|$|E

40|$|The "subscript solidus " was {{proposed}} before (N 2788 = L 2 / 04 - 191 of 2004 - 06 - 07) by Deborah Anderson and Michael Everson, {{based on its}} use by Indo-Europeanists (see fig. 1). It was the only character contained in that proposal which was not accepted by UTC # 99 (without documenting {{the reason for that}} decision in the minutes L 2 / 04 - 156 R 2). The character is reproposed here, as additional evidence was found for its use in plain text (see fig. 2 and 3), from an area complete different from linguistics. There is a German standard DIN EN 13501 for the classification of fire protecting doors which specifies how doors are to be identified regarding to fire and smoke protection requirements, to get the European CE conformance mark. There, fire protection is to be marked as "I 1 / 2 " (or more specific as "I 1 " or "I 2 " to denote one of the two specific method of proof of the fire protection property referenced there). Likewise, smoke protection is to be marked by "Sa/m " (or more specific as "Sa " or "Sm " to denote one of the two specific ways of smoke protection referenced there). Such use of the subscripted " 1 / 2 " and "a/m " is definitely plain text. Therefore (while the subscripted " 1 ", " 2 ", "a", "m " are already encoded), the "subscript solidus" is needed here as an <b>encoded</b> <b>character...</b>|$|E
