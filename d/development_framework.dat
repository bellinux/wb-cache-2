25|$|Difficult to unit test: Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC {{framework}} and stores {{all of its}} configurations in database and as a result, unit testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven <b>development</b> <b>framework</b> such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in {{making it easier for}} developers to write unit-testable code.|$|E
25|$|Tyne Dock to East Boldon along a {{dismantled}} railway alignment through Whiteleas {{could easily}} be added, because two Metro lines are separated by only a short distance (1.61 miles). This would provide a service from South Shields to Sunderland via the Whiteleas area of South Shields. It was originally suggested by the South Tyneside Local <b>Development</b> <b>Framework</b> and reported by a local newspaper, the Shields Gazette, in January 2008. This {{would probably be the}} most likely of extensions, because Nexus is also interested in building stabling facilities for Metro trains at South Shields station as part of the reinvigoration programme.|$|E
500|$|The town saw a major {{expansion}} in the 1970s as {{the construction of a}} bypass in 1969, and its conversion into part of the M5 in 1974, made it a popular commuter town, and it continued to expand during the closing years of the 20th century and {{the first few years of}} the 21st century. The Mid Devon Local <b>Development</b> <b>Framework</b> Proposals include plans to erect 95 new dwellings a year, and to build [...] of new employment floorspace a year between the start of the plan and 2026. The first Cullompton town website was set up in 1998 and a new website was created in 2011. CCTV was installed in the main street in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his tenure}} in office, the South African economy grew {{at an average}} rate of 4.5% per year, {{creating}} employment in the middle sectors of the economy. The black middle class was significantly expanded {{with the implementation of}} Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). This growth exacerbated the demand for trained professionals strained by emigration due to violent crime, but failed to address unemployment amongst the unskilled bulk of the population. He attracted the bulk of Africa's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and made South Africa the focal point of African growth. He was the architect of NEPAD whose aim is to develop an integrated socio-economic <b>development</b> <b>framework</b> for Africa. He also oversaw the successful building of economic bridges to BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) nations with the eventual formation of the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum to [...] "further political consultation and co-ordination as well as strengthening sectoral co-operation, and economic relations".|$|E

2500|$|... 2005 – Med Jones of the International Institute of Management {{introduced}} the first GNH Index and Global GNH Index Survey. The GNH Index, {{also known as}} Gross National Well-being (GNW) Index framework served as the first integrated objective (economic) and subjective (happiness) socioeconomic <b>development</b> <b>framework.</b> Prior the GNH Index, there were few development indices that improved upon {{the gross domestic product}} (GDP), but did not measure happiness. For example, the Genuine Progress Indicator was focused on the environmental cost of economic development, then later (in 2006) it was updated to include similar measures to the GNH Index. Another development index is the Human Development Index (HDI) that originally focused on literacy and education but also did not measure happiness. The HDI now measures three basic dimensions of human development, health (as measured by life expectancy at birth), overall knowledge level (as measured by the literacy rate), and standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita for a given year). Among the criticisms of the HDI is the complaint that it [...] is a mixture of stock measures (life expectancy at birth and literacy rate) and a flow measure (GDP per capita for a given year). [...] To overcome this criticism, Hou, Walsh, and Zhang (2015) proposed a new index called HDIF (Human Development Index Flow), in which they replaced life expectancy at birth by the under-five mortality rate (for a given year), and they also replaced the literacy rate by the gross primary school enrollment ratio for a given year). [...] They calculated both the HDI and the HDIF for many countries and found that [...] "the HDIF and the HDI tend to converge for wealthy countries and diverge for poor countries, especially those with low HDI rankings". The development performance of poor countries improved using the HDIF while the performance of the wealthy countries declined.|$|E
