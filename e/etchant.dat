Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E

At 75 degrees C and 9 wt. per cent AHW, a maximum etch rate for (100) silicon of approximately 30 mym/h has been determined. (111) :(100) etch rate ratios show values around 4 per cent. AHW <b>etchants</b> exibit an excellent selectivity to SiO sub 2, Si sub 3 N sub 4 and highly boron-doped silicon.

25|$|Undercuts from etching are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} undercuts explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. Undercuts from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the <b>etchant</b> was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic <b>etchant,</b> which means the <b>etchant</b> etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an anisotropic <b>etchant</b> is used.|$|E

25|$|Chemical etching {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an <b>etchant</b> such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale. Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} surface treatment for changing the surface roughness. The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with nanotopographies. Silicon wafers were etched using HF, and it was demonstrated that cell adhesion was enhanced only in a specified range of roughness (20–50nm).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} six phosphoric acid-etching agents on dentin, the independent variables being two acid concentrations (10 % and 32 %- 37 %) and three thickener conditions (no thickener, silica, and polymer). The tested hypothesis was {{that the use of}} different <b>etchants</b> with similar concentrations of phosphoric acid would result in similar depths of dentin demineralization. METHODS: Thirty dentin disks were obtained from extracted human teeth by microtome sectioning. The dentin surfaces were etched with one of the etching agents, fixed, dehydrated and dried. The specimens were observed using a FE-SEM. The mean deepest demineralization of intertubular dentin was measured from fracture surfaces of the disks. These values were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan's Test. The morphological appearance of the dentin surfaces was compared using the following observation criteria: 1) Presence of a cuff of peritubular dentin; 2) Relative thickness of the layer containing residual collagen or smear layer particles; and 3) Formation of a submicron hiatus {{at the bottom of the}} exposed collagen network. The pH of each of the etching agents was measured. A correlation analysis was made of the pH vs. the depth of dentin demineralization. RESULTS: Silica-thickened <b>etchants</b> did not demineralize dentin as deeply as did polymer-thickened <b>etchants</b> and unthickened <b>etchants.</b> High magnifications revealed three distinct zones within the demineralized dentin layer; an upper porous zone of residual smear layer or denatured collagen and residual silica particles (in groups etched with silica-thickened <b>etchants),</b> an intermediate area with randomly oriented collagen fibers, and a lower zone with submicron hiatus, few collagen fibers, and scattered hydroxyapatite inclusions. This hiatus was observable in all the specimens etched with the polymer-thickened <b>etchants,</b> in 90 % of the specimens etched with the unthickened phosphoric acid liquids, and in 60 % of the specimens etched with the silica-thickened gels. SIGNIFICANCE: The results obtained suggest that similar concentrations of phosphoric acid <b>etchants</b> containing distinct thickeners result in different demineralization depths as well as different morphology of etched dentin. status: publishe...|$|R

Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the <b>etchant</b> solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps. Adjustment of the nozzle pattern, flow rate, temperature, and <b>etchant</b> composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates.|$|E

2500|$|The hole walls for boards {{with two}} or more layers can be made {{conductive}} and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes. [...] These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through.
