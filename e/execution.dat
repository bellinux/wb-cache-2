5|$|When players deal enough {{damage to}} an enemy, they can {{activate}} an <b>execution</b> sequence. Once the <b>execution</b> sequence has been initiated, enemies {{involved in the}} <b>execution</b> are highlighted automatically with colors by the game, and players can perform a series of quick time events by pressing the appropriate buttons. These <b>execution</b> sequences serve to grant additional resources to players, depending on how well the <b>execution</b> is performed. At any time prior to initiating an <b>execution,</b> the player can select one of four categories of executions to perform upon weakened enemies; the selected type of <b>execution</b> determines the type of resource that will be granted when an enemy is executed. Upon completing a successful <b>execution</b> sequence, players are granted the type of <b>execution</b> that was selected. There are four perks available for players. One boosts the player's damage {{for a short period}} after the execution; one refills the player's Focus bar; one allows players to regain lost health, and the last significantly boosts the amount of experience points received from the kill. These experience points can be used to purchase upgrades for various attributes, such as health, damage, or Focus bar capacity, and to unlock additional <b>execution</b> moves. The game still automatically completes and finishes these <b>execution</b> sequences when players fail to press the highlighted buttons, but provides a much smaller reward. Lining up two or more weakened enemies in close proximity allows the player to perform a double <b>execution</b> sequence, which greatly increases the reward granted.|$|E

5|$|Later scholars, however, {{have argued}} that Sycorax was saved from <b>execution</b> because she was {{pregnant}}. This was not uncommon, as many female criminals in Shakespeare's day got pregnant to avoid <b>execution.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the {{reinstatement}} of {{the death}} penalty in 1976 there have been 1077 <b>executions</b> in the United States (as of May 23, 2007). There were 53 <b>executions</b> in 2006. Texas overwhelmingly leads the United States in <b>executions,</b> with 379 <b>executions</b> from 1976 to 2006; the second-highest ranking state is Virginia, with 98 <b>executions.</b>|$|R
50|$|These numbers reflect only <b>executions</b> of civilians, and do {{not include}} {{a large number of}} summary <b>executions</b> by punitive army {{detachments}} and <b>executions</b> of military mutinees.|$|R
5|$|<b>Executions</b> in England were public until 1868. That {{year the}} law changed, mandating <b>executions</b> {{would take place}} privately and inside the prison. In 1868 Calcraft carried out the last public and first private <b>executions.</b> Among his <b>executions</b> were Marie and Frederick Manning, the first husband and wife to be hanged {{together}} since 1700.|$|R
5|$|One thread will {{successfully}} lock variable V, {{while the}} other thread will be locked out—unable to proceed until V is unlocked again. This guarantees correct <b>execution</b> of the program. Locks, while necessary to ensure correct program <b>execution,</b> can greatly slow a program.|$|E
5|$|The <b>execution</b> of Gardner at Utah State Prison {{became the}} focus of media {{attention}} in June 2010, {{because it was the first}} to be carried out by firing squad in the United States in 14years. Gardner stated that he sought this method of <b>execution</b> because of his Mormon background. On the day before his <b>execution,</b> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement clarifying its position on the issue of blood atonement of individuals. The case also attracted debate over capital punishment and whether Gardner had been destined for a life of violence since his difficult childhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{first in}} a series of <b>execution</b> videos was {{released}} on 11 May by AQI, of its leader al-Zarqawi executing American citizen Nick Berg.

50|$|<b>Executions</b> in Utah are {{currently}} {{performed at the}} Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. Because the ethics standards of the American Medical Association forbid physician involvement in <b>executions,</b> other healthcare professionals including paramedics and nurses perform <b>executions</b> in Utah. Paramedics and nurses, however, are also forbidden from participation in <b>executions</b> by their own professional organizations' ethics codes. The prison protects the anonymity of professionals involved in <b>executions,</b> {{making it impossible for}} professional organizations to impose sanctions.|$|R
50|$|Published by HRNK in 2012, The Hidden Gulag Second Edition: Political Prison Camps {{describes}} {{public and}} secret <b>executions</b> in the kwan-li-so and kyo-hwa-so prisons. Former prisoners report {{being forced to}} throw rocks at and hit corpses following <b>executions.</b> Most <b>executions</b> were punishments for attempted escape, but “crimes” such as eating chestnuts off the ground without permission were also punished by death. One prisoner witnessed an estimated 50-60 <b>executions</b> per year, including group <b>executions</b> of up to 20 people.|$|R
5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the <b>execution</b> would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the <b>execution</b> to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the <b>execution</b> (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the <b>execution</b> of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The <b>execution</b> was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's <b>execution</b> was the first federal <b>execution</b> in 38years.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial and}} <b>execution</b> of Riel caused a bitter and {{prolonged}} reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the <b>execution</b> as the punishment for Riel's treason and his <b>execution</b> of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange {{turned their attention}} to other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} report, an outraged Hermann Göring demanded 'at the highest level' the {{transfer}} of the airmen to Luftwaffe control. Unknown to all airmen except Lamason, their <b>execution</b> had been scheduled for 26 October, if they remained at Buchenwald. News of the airmen's scheduled <b>execution</b> had been conveyed to Lamason by a German political prisoner, Eugen Kogon, who had a reliable contact within the camp administrative area. Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo-Thomas, Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little that could be done to avert the mass <b>execution.</b> Lamason decided not to inform the airmen, but to keep this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time. On the night of 19 October, seven days before their scheduled <b>execution,</b> 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
25|$|While Taiwan {{maintains}} {{the death penalty}} for a variety of offenses, the number of <b>executions</b> dropped significantly since 2002, with only three <b>executions</b> in 2005 and none between 2006 and 2009. <b>Executions</b> resumed again in 2010.|$|R
25|$|From 1976 to January 1, 2017, {{there were}} 1,442 <b>executions,</b> of which 1,267 were by lethal injection, 158 by electrocution, 11 by gas inhalation, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad. <b>Executions</b> rose at a near-continuous pace until 1999, when it peaked at 98. After 1999, {{the number of}} <b>executions</b> lowered nearly every year, and the 20 <b>executions</b> in 2016 were the fewest since 1991.|$|R
50|$|The law passed, and {{the rate}} of <b>executions</b> {{promptly}} rose. In Paris alone, compared to an average of 5 <b>executions</b> that was the norm two months earlier (Germinal), 17 <b>executions</b> would take place daily during Prairial, with 26 occurring daily during the following month of Messidor. Between the passing of the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) and the end of July 1794, 1,515 <b>executions</b> took place at the Place de la Revolution, {{more than half of the}} final total of 2,639 <b>executions</b> that occurred between March 1793 and August 1794.|$|R

5|$|Before his <b>execution</b> {{a convicted}} felon was usually {{detained}} in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and <b>execution,</b> for the official records.|$|E
25|$|Belarus, {{the only}} European country to {{maintain}} {{the death penalty in}} practice, resumed <b>executions</b> after there had been no <b>executions</b> there the year before. 2015 and 2009 were the only two years in recorded history when Europe was completely free of <b>executions.</b>|$|R
50|$|General Smith passed Waller's {{report of}} the <b>executions</b> to his superior, General Adna R. Chaffee. Chaffee decided to {{investigate}} these <b>executions,</b> despite General J.

5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's <b>execution</b> was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before being burned at the stake.

With {{the exception of the}} first four <b>executions</b> (carried out for offences of horse theft and highway robbery), all <b>executions</b> were carried out for offences of murder. All of those executed were male, with the exception of Sarah Smith in 1832 and there have been two triple <b>executions,</b> in 1829 and 1877, and two double <b>executions,</b> in 1903 and 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Extrajudicial summary <b>executions</b> were harshly criticised {{after the}} war. Circles close to Pétainism {{advanced}} {{the figures of}} 100,000 such <b>executions,</b> denouncing it as [...] "Red Terror", [...] "anarchy" [...] or [...] "blind vengeance. In 1960, journalist Robert Aron estimated the number of summary <b>executions</b> of 40,000, surprising deGaulle. The figure admitted today by mainstream historians is 10,000. Approximately 9,000 of these 10,000 refer to summary <b>executions,</b> {{in the whole of}} the country, including during battle. In absolute numbers, there were fewer legal <b>executions</b> in France than in neighbouring, and much smaller, Belgium, and fewer internments than in Norway or Netherlands.|$|R
5|$|In 1737, Murray {{acted as}} Counsel for the City of Edinburgh in the {{aftermath}} of the death of Captain John Porteous. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the <b>execution.</b> Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely. Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, and because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility of an attempt to free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's <b>execution.</b> When a man attempted to cut Wilson's body down after the <b>execution,</b> Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed. Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder, and when the <b>execution</b> was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and lynched him.|$|E
