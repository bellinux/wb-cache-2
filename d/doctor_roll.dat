2500|$|With 10:45 left in {{the first}} half, Dante Love, who entered the game leading the nation at 144.3yards per game, caught a short pass and started to turn upfield when Indiana cornerback Chris Adkins jarred the ball loose with a big hit that led to an Indiana touchdown. Love stayed on the ground for several minutes before <b>doctors</b> <b>rolled</b> him onto a {{backboard}} and carted him off the field. School officials later issued a statement saying Love felt numbness and tingling while on the field. He was taken to Bloomington Hospital before being transferred to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis for further evaluation. Love underwent a five-hour surgery for a cervical spine fracture and a spinal cord injury and had movement in his arms and legs after the procedure. On September 22, head coach Brady Hoke told reporters, [...] "Due to the injury Dante sustained, his football career is expected to be over. He should have normal and healthy functions {{for the rest of his}} life. He touched a lot of lives, and he will continue to do so." ...|$|R

50|$|McGregor's {{forehead}} became badly swollen {{around a}} mosquito bite in Kazakhstan (Claudio and Ewan joked {{that it could}} be a black widow spider bite), which required treatment. McGregor also showed his badly bitten rear and revealed that his penis had become swollen and painful during the trip, again due to mosquito bites. Russ Malkin and Vassili the <b>doctor</b> <b>rolled</b> their off-roader in Mongolia, but escaped with minor injuries. Boorman badly strained his left shoulder in Siberia, and was unable to ride for several days (mostly while they were riding on local trucks or with their support crew). McGregor was rear-ended by a very young driver outside Calgary and was lucky that his panniers took the brunt of {{what could have been a}} very serious incident. The following day Boorman was bumped while stationary by a Calgarian who reversed into him at slow speed but without causing injury or major damage. Cameraman Claudio von Planta had an opportunist thief steal his tent and personal effects whilst left unattended in Siberia. Boorman also had his wallet stolen from his jeans at some natural hot springs in Canada, losing $500 and €400 along with his credit cards.|$|R

40|$|The {{assignment}} is designed as information material pertaining to controlled substances; addiction and a <b>doctor</b> s <b>roll</b> in situations involving substance abuse. The target group is medical students and doctors. In part 1 of the assignment we discuss different controlled substances, along {{with alcohol and}} potentially addictive medications. We include history, up-to-date statistics, types and routes of administration, pharmacology, short-term and long-term effects for each substance. Part 1 closes with a table describing symptoms of acute substance abuse. In part 2 we present an updated description of addition, while part 3 discusses a number of situations where one, as a doctor, must confront controlled substance abuse. There is focus on the doctor s role in prevention, role as a prescription drawer and the important support role in substitutions programs. Since alcohol is the most commonly abused psychoactive substance, the <b>doctor</b> s <b>roll</b> in alcohol abuse is discussed in sub-section in part 3. By reviewing The Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association (Tidskrift for den Norske Lægeforening), books and brochure material we have created {{a picture of what}} information is available and, more importantly, which information should have greater focus, especially concerning the Norwegian situation. As sources we have used a number of topic-summaries composed by well-known organisations such as; NIDA, Rusmiddeldirektoratet og Statens Rettstoksikologiske institutt. In discussions of various substances, if there was references to more specific information, in these cases we used a number of original sources...|$|R
50|$|Once {{dropping}} Dorothée off at her apartment, Cléo has {{the taxi}} driver take her to a park. By a bridge on a river, Cléo meets Antoine, a soldier on leave from the Algerian War. Antoine helps Cléo realize her selfishness, and asks that she accompany him to the station {{to return to the}} war if he accompanies her to the hospital to get her test results back. Before leaving, Antoine confides in Cléo about his thoughts on the war, and that in Algeria, they die for nothing, and that scares him. He also tells Cléo that girls always seem to be afraid to give themselves completely to someone and that they're afraid of losing something close to them, so they love by halves. Cléo realizes that that describes her perfectly. Antoine and Cléo go to the hospital by a bus, and the doctor who tested Cléo for her possible cancer isn't in, {{despite the fact that he}} told her he'd be present at 7 pm that day. Cléo and Antoine sit on a bench outside, as Cléo is still determined that the doctor will be there. While Cléo has come to terms with her illness and is able to face the test results with courage thanks to Antoine's help, the <b>doctor</b> <b>rolls</b> by in his car and tells her that Cléo will be fine and completely cured with two months of treatment. Cléo is relieved to hear this, and tells Antoine that they have plenty of time together before he leaves to go back to Algeria as a soldier. For the first time in at least two hours, Cléo is finally happy.|$|R

The album was mostly a collection of cover versions that George had been working on as a side project for several years and, in his biography, Rock And <b>Roll</b> <b>Doctor,</b> Mark Brend states that George had hinted he only signed the solo contract in order to obtain funds to finance Little Feat (and Bill Flanagan states in Written in My Soul that George [...] "didn't want his audience to assume a collection of other people's material marked the direction of Lowell George's solo career").|$|R

5000|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon its release, with Phil Alexander writing in 1998, [...] "While today hardcore Sabs fans defend {{some of the}} bold steps taken on Technical Ecstasy, it was a confused offering which still hit Number 13 in the UK but limped into the US charts at 52." [...] In 2001, Guitar World magazine was less kind in its appraisal, calling it perhaps the [...] "least-loved effort of the original lineup" [...] with the band [...] "trying to stretch its sound in several different directions, none of them exceptionally successful." [...] It deemed [...] "Rock N Roll Doctor" [...] "a bad Kiss imitation" [...] while eschewing [...] "Its Alright" [...] as [...] "a sub-par Paul McCartney-style pop ballad." [...] In 2013 Mojo magazine opined, [...] "Technical Ecstasy {{is the sound of}} Sabbath trying to make a grown-up, radio-friendly rock record and, in some parts, it works ... Mostly, however, it doesnt with tracks like Back Street Kids, Rock N <b>Roll</b> <b>Doctor</b> and Dirty Women resorting to clichéd and ill-fitting rock moves." [...] Greg Prato of AllMusic agrees that [...] "it was not on par with Sabbaths exceptional first five releases," [...] but praises [...] "Dirty Women", the [...] "funky" [...] "All Moving Parts (Stand Still)" [...] and the [...] "raging opener" [...] "Back Street Kids".|$|R

50|$|When {{the lid of}} this coffin was removed, a white form {{appeared}} - of uncertain shape, {{seeming to}} float as in a dream. The white satin padding from the coffin lid had become detached and was covering the body like a shroud. <b>Doctor</b> Guillard delicately <b>rolled</b> it back, from the feet to the head, to reveal the body. Napoleon's green uniform with red facings, that of a colonel of chasseurs, was perfectly preserved. The chest was still crossed by the red ribbon of the Légion d’honneur, although the decorations and buttons on the uniform were slightly tarnished. The body remained in a comfortable position, the head resting on a cushion and the left forearm and hand on the thigh. The facial expression was serene, the eyes were fully closed (with some eyelashes showing) and only {{the sides of the}} nose had changed. A slightly receding gum allowed to shine, as at the moment of death, three very white incisors. The chin was stippled with the beginnings of a blueish beard which had emerged due to the dryness of the skin. The hands were perfectly preserved, with long and very white fingernails still attached. Only the seams of the boots had cracked, showing the four smaller toes on each foot. Napoleon's small hat was placed sideways across his thighs.All the spectators were in a state of shock. Gourgaud, Las Cases, Philippe de Rohan, Marchand and all the servants wept; Bertrand seemed to be overcome with emotion. After two minutes' examination, Guillard proposed that he continue examining the body and open the jars containing the heart and the stomach. Gourgaud, however, suppressing his tears, became angry and ordered that the coffin be closed at once. The doctor complied and replaced the satin padding, spraying it with a little creosote before putting back on the tin lid (though without re-soldering it) and the mahogany lid. Then the lead coffin was re-soldered and finally the combination lock on the ebony coffin that had been brought from France was closed.|$|R
