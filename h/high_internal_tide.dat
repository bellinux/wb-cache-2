40|$|The {{stationarity}} of the <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> {{generated in}} a global eddy‐resolving ocean circulation model forced by realistic atmospheric fluxes and the luni‐solar gravitational potential is explored. The root mean square (RMS) variability in the M 2 internal tidal amplitude is approximately 2 mm or less {{over most of the}} ocean and exceeds 2 mm in regions with larger internal tidal amplitude. The M 2 RMS variability approaches the mean amplitude in weaker tidal areas such as the tropical Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean, but is smaller than the mean amplitude near generation regions. Approximately 60 % {{of the variance in the}} complex M 2 tidal amplitude is due to amplitude‐weighted phase variations. Using the RMS tidal amplitude variations normalized by the mean tidal amplitude (normalized RMS variability (NRMS)) as a metric for stationarity, low‐mode M 2 <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> with NRMS[*]<[*] 0. 5 are stationary over 25 % of the deep ocean, particularly near the generation regions. The M 2 RMS variability tends to increase with increasing mean amplitude. However, the M 2 NRMS variability tends to decrease with increasing mean amplitude, and regions with strong low‐mode <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> are more stationary. The <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> beams radiating away from generation regions become less stationary with distance. Similar results are obtained for other tidal constituents with the overall stationarity of the constituent decreasing as the energy in the constituent decreases. Seasonal variations dominate the RMS variability in the Arabian Sea and near‐equatorial oceans.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Internal</b> <b>tides</b> {{have been}} implicated {{as a major}} source of {{mechanical}} energy for mixing in the ocean interior. Indeed, microstructure and tracer measurements have indicated that enhanced turbulence levels occur near topography where <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> are generated. However, the details of the energy budget and the mechanisms by which energy is transferred from the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> to turbulence have been uncertain. It now seems that the energy levels associated with locally enhanced mixing near topography may constitute {{only a small fraction of}} the available <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy flux. In this study, the generation, radiation, and energy dissipation of deep ocean <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> are examined. Properties of the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hawaiian Ridge are considered. It is found that most <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy is generated as low modes. The Richardson number of the generated <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> typically exceeds unity for these motions, so direct shear instability of the generated waves is not the dominant energy transfer mechanism. It also seems that wave-wave interactions are ineffective at transferring energy from the large wavelengths that dominate the energy flux. Instead, it seems that much of the generated energy radiates away from the generation site in low mode waves. These low modes must dissipate somewhere in the ocean, though this likely occurs over O(1000 km) distances as the waves propagate. Additionally, a small fraction of energy flux is generated as high mode waves. These have slower group speeds, higher shear, and faster wave-wave interaction rates than the low modes, and so are likely to dissipate as turbulence close to the topography of the generation site. Preliminary estimates suggest that turbulent dissipation near sites of generation accounts for 30 % or less of the total generated energy flux. Based on these estimates, a parameterization of the mixing sustained by <b>high</b> mode <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation is proposed. 1...|$|R

Most of the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy entering the canyon is generated to the south, on Sur Slope and at the head of Carmel Canyon. The <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> is topographically steered around the large canyon meanders. Depth-integrated baroclinic energy fluxes are up canyon and largest near the canyon axis, up to 1. 5 kW m- 1 at the mouth of the upper canyon and increasing to over 4 kW m- 1 around Monterey and San Gregorio Meanders. The up-canyon energy flux is bottom intensified, suggesting that topographic focusing occurs. Net along-canyon energy flux decreases almost monotonically from 9 MW at the canyon mouth to 1 MW at Gooseneck Meander, implying that <b>high</b> levels of <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> dissipation occur. The depth-integrated energy flux across the 200 -m isobath is order 10 W m- 1 along the majority of the canyon rim but increases by over an order of magnitude near the canyon head, where <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy escapes onto the shelf. Reducing the size of the model domain to exclude remote areas of high barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion decreases the depth-integrated energy flux in the upper canyon by 20 %.

However, the majority of well-studied submarine canyons are simple linear incisions or have meandering morphology; <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energetics in branching (dendritic) canyons has not previously been investigated. Here we present a high-resolution (500 -m) numerical modelling study of the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> within Whittard Canyon, a large, dendritic submarine canyon system that incises the Celtic Sea continental slope. A {{modified version of the}} Princeton Ocean Model is used to simulate the M 2 (semidiurnal) <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> in the Whittard Canyon region, verified against a hydrographic dataset collected by an autonomous ocean glider. Much of the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy entering Whittard Canyon originates to the southeast, along the Celtic Sea shelf break. <b>Internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation also occurs within the canyon itself, but is in part compensated by areas of negative energy conversion. Depth-integrated <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy fluxes exceed 8 kW m− 1 in the eastern limb of the canyon. The <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> is topographically steered through the major limbs and along-canyon energy flux is bottom intensified, suggesting topographic focusing. The down canyon extent of bottom intensification closely corresponds to the point that along-canyon slope becomes near-critical to the semidiurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tide.</b> Energetically, the multiple limbs of Whittard Canyon behave differently, some are net sources of <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy whilst others are net sinks. <b>Internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy dissipation also varies between the canyon limbs; bulk dissipation rates are 2. 1 - 7. 7 × 10 − 8 W kg− 1. In addition, the effect of bathymetric resolution on <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation and propagation is investigated by progressively smoothing the model domain. Decreasing the bathymetric resolution reduces <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation and energy dissipation in both Whittard Canyon and the model domain as a whole, however, <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy flux into the canyon is not consistently changed.

40|$|Packets of {{nonlinear}} internal waves (NLIWs) in a {{small area}} of the Mid-Atlantic Bight were 10 times more energetic during a local neap tide than during the preceding spring tide. This counterintuitive result cannot be explained if the waves are generated near the shelf break by the local barotropic tide since changes in shelfbreak stratification explain {{only a small fraction}} of the variability in barotropic to baroclinic conversion. Instead, this study suggests that the occurrence of strong NLIWs was caused by the shoaling of distantly generated <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> with amplitudes that are uncorrelated with the local spring-neap cycle. An extensive set of moored observations show that NLIWs are correlated with the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> but uncorrelated with barotropic tide.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relevance}} of finescale parameterizations of dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is addressed using finescale and microstructure measurements {{collected in the}} Lucky Strike segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). There, <b>high</b> amplitude <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> and a strongly sheared mean flow sustain {{a high level of}} dissipation rate and turbulent mixing. Two sets of parameterizations are considered: the first ones (Gregg, 1989; Kunze et al, 2006) were derived to estimate dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy induced by internal wave breaking, while the second one aimed to estimate dissipation induced by shear instability of a strongly sheared mean flow and {{is a function of the}} Richardson number (Kunze et al, 1990; Polzin 1996). The latter parameterization has low skill in reproducing the observed dissi-pation rate when shear unstable events are resolved presumably because there is no scale separation between the duration of unstable events and the inverse growth rate of unstable billows. Instead GM based parameterizations were found to be relevant although slight biases were observed. Part of these biases result from the small value of the upper vertical wavenumber integration limit in the computation of shear variance in Kunze et al (2006) parameterization that does not take into account internal wave signal of high vertical wavenumbers. We showed that significant improvement is obtained when the upper integration limit is set using a signal to noise ratio criterion and that the spatial structure of dissipation rates is reproduced with this parameterization...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{generation}} and propagation of large-amplitude nonlinear internal waves {{observed in the}} South China Sea. <b>Internal</b> <b>tides</b> generated in Luzon Strait are transformed into high-frequency nonlinear internal waves due to nonlinear steepening and non-hydrostatic dispersion. The observations are acquired from modified high-frequency inverted echo sounders. The performance of these instruments is examined {{in order to understand}} the measurements. ^ Their generation is first investigated with KdV-type weakly nonlinear theories, next with a composite 2 -layer model which includes linear <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation and nonlinear internal wave evolution, and finally with a regional ocean model, the MITgcm. Comparisons of these model calculations with our observations confirm the role of rotation. The relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation and the subsequent nonlinear evolution is established. <b>Internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation in Luzon Strait appears to be reasonably well approximated by a linear hydrostatic model. In the central part of Luzon Strait, the eastern ridge dominates <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation with the western ridge intensifying semidiurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation due to the ridge separation approximately matching the semidiurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> wavelength. This double-ridge topography contributes semidiurnal harmonics to the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation, and rotation disperses the diurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> component. As a result of these effects, the semidiurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> is dominant in the middle of the basin, whereas diurnal barotropic forcing is dominant in Luzon Strait. Nonlinear internal waves are seldom observed by satellite imagery in winter. This appears to be due to suppression of <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation in the South China Sea resulting from westward intrusion of the Kuroshio. In addition, nonlinear internal waves are rarely observed east of Luzon Strait in the Pacific Ocean. This intriguing phenomenon results from the joint effect of topography, rotation and the Kuroshio: the deeper thermocline in the Pacific Ocean associated with geostrophic balance of the Kuroshio which reduces the nonlinearity, diminishing its role relative to rotational dispersion, and the double-ridge topography does not intensify the <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> east of the strait. ...|$|R

This study uses a {{modeling}} {{approach to}} examine the interactions between the principal semidiurnal (M 2) <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> and the atmospherically-forced eddying ocean circulation in the Philippine Sea, a region of energetic <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> and dynamic mesoscale circulation. Remotely generated <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> are {{found to have a}} significant effect on local generation at the two generation sites bounding the region, the Luzon Strait and the Mariana Island Arc, by altering the amplitude and phase of bottom pressure. <b>Internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation at the Luzon Strait is found to vary due to background circulation changes over the generation site and the changing influence of remotely generated <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> from the Mariana Arc. The varying effect of remotely generated waves results from both changing generation energy levels at the Mariana Arc and variability in the propagation of the <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> across the Philippine Sea. The interactions with the subtidal ocean circulation result in significant spatial and temporal variability in <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> propagation and dissipation, and hence the energy available for mixing. Close to the generation site, mixing is dominated by high-mode <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> dissipation, while in far-field the influence of the mesoscale energy on <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> dissipation is significant. The results provide insight into the mechanisms of variability of the baroclinic tides and highlight the importance of considering both the remotely generated <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> and the subtidal dynamics to estimate <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energetics.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{submerged}} seamount/ridge is a source for the generation of <b>internal</b> <b>tides.</b> In this paper, a three-dimensional two-layer model is set up to study the generation of <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> by tidal flows over a submerged seamount/ridge in the channel. Several numerical experiments with different topographic features, upper layer depths, tidal flows and background currents are carried out to study the variations of the induced <b>internal</b> <b>tides.</b> It is shown that, for the specific stratification, the seamount feature, the slope, the initial upper layer depth and the imposing driven force determine the Froude number near the seamount peak. Once when the Froude number is supercritical, the associated maximum amplitude of the induced <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> is so large that the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> begins to disintegrate, which brings about severe variations of the current velocity and the water elevation fields, and the associated induced baroclinic tidal energy around the seamount peak is {{much larger than the}} barotropic one. The Richardson number greater than 1 / 4 is a criterion for stability of shear flow. Since the maximum tidal velocity changes within 0 similar to 360 degrees with time in a period around the seamount peak, the induced <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> does not stride the seamount peak before it disintegrates, which is different from the two-dimensional modeled results. The asymmetrical slope of the submerged seamount is a mechanism for the asymmetrical <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation...|$|R

Comparisons are made with observations in the region and with a published solution using a finite difference model. The calculations show that provided that the finite element grid is refined in the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation area and the adjacent region through which the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> propagates, then a numerically accurate solution is obtained.

The wavelength of <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> can be as much as 250 km in the open ocean, but as the generation of these tides depends on the angle between the depth-averaged current and the topography, there can be considerable local spatial variability. This range of scales makes it difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved from observations alone.

These experiments demonstrate the emergence of <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> incoherence as the eddy turbulence is strengthened. In strongly turbulent situations, the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> signature on sea level forms complex interference patterns with large amplifications of the initial internal wave. These patterns evolve more rapidly than the signature of the turbulent eddy field on sea level. The implications of such idealized numerical simulations for wide-swath altimetry are discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{regional}} {{baroclinic model}} forced with several tidal constituents at different frequencies {{is used to}} investigate the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> of the Bay of Biscay. The regional ocean model is free surface, sigma-coordinate and it is implemented in order to accurately {{take into account the}} barotropic forcing, the strong bathymetry gradients and the temperature and salinity stratifications. In a previous paper, the barotropic component of the tides was studied in details and the boundary conditions of the three-dimensional model were extracted from the atlases. In the present paper, we focus on the baroclinic component of the tides and the simulations are validated against observations from the MINT 94 experiment. The observed currents and stratification are accurately reproduced by the model. The <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> pattern is consistent with the descriptions found in the literature. Combining wavelet and principal component analysis we extract the patterns of generation and propagation of the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> at the semi-diurnal and quarter-diurnal frequencies. Secondary internal wave generation areas are identified over the plain. The vertical displacements of isopycnal surfaces for the M 4 <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> are found to be locally half those induced by the semi-diurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tide.</b> A sensitivity study shows the impact of using a three-dimensional initial stratification over the direction of propagation and wavelengths of the <b>internal</b> <b>tides...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{autonomous}} ocean glider {{is used to}} {{make the}} first direct measurements of <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> within Whittard Canyon, a large, dendritic submarine canyon system that incises the Celtic Sea continental slope and a site of high benthic biodiversity. This is the first time a glider has been used for targeted observations of <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> in a submarine canyon. Vertical isopycnal displacement observations at different stations fit a one-dimensional model of partly standing semidiurnal <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> – comprised of a major, incident wave propagating up the canyon limbs and a minor wave reflected back down-canyon by steep, supercritical bathymetry near the canyon heads. The up-canyon <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> energy flux in the primary study limb decreases from 9. 2 to 2. 0 kW m− 1 over 28 km (a dissipation rate of 1 − 2. 5 × 10 − 7 Wkg− 1), comparable to elevated energy fluxes and <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> driven mixing measured in other canyon systems. Within Whittard Canyon, enhanced mixing is inferred from collapsed temperature-salinity curves and weakened dissolved oxygen concentration gradients near the canyon heads. It has previously been hypothesised that <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> impact benthic fauna through elevated near-bottom current velocities and particle resuspension. In support of this, we infer order 20 cm s− 1 near-bottom current velocities in the canyon and observe high concentrations of suspended particulate matter. The glider observations are also used to estimate a 1 °C temperature range and 12 μmol kg− 1 dissolved oxygen concentration range, experienced twice a day by organisms on the canyon walls, due to the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>tides.</b> This study highlights how a well-designed glider mission, incorporating a series of tide-resolving stations at key locations, can be used to understand <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> dynamics in a region of complex topography, a sampling strategy that is applicable to continental shelves and slopes worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The {{scattering}} of low-mode <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> by ocean-floor topography is extensively studied through analytical models and field observations at the Line Islands Ridge (LIR). An existing Green function method is utilized {{to examine the}} generation of <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> by idealized topographic shapes as well as realistic transects of the LIR. The method is also applied to examine the {{scattering of}} a mode- 1 <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> at these topographies to determine the relative high mode energy flux due to generated and scattered <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> at the realistic transects. A method of determining the modal content of an internal wave field is advanced to account for arbitrary stratification and rotation. It is then adjusted to allow for image loss as is common to oceanographic studies. Its performance is compared to the existing regression method widely used by oceanographers to determine the modal content of <b>internal</b> <b>tides.</b> The results from this comparison are used to inform {{the analysis of the}} field observations. This thesis concludes by examining the modal content of the LIR as determined from measurements taken during the 150 -day EXperiment on <b>Internal</b> <b>Tide</b> Scattering (EXITS) NSF field study. Motivated by satellite altimetry data and three-dimensional numerical model studies, the EXITS cruise sought to observe the <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> scattering process in the ocean for the first time. The data from three moorings equipped with moored profilers, spanning total depths of 3000 - 5000 m is analyzed to determine the modal content of the southward propagating <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> before and after it encounters the ridge for evidence of topographic scattering. by Maha Niametullah Haji.

40|$|A hydrostatic, coupled-mode, shallow-water model (CSW) is {{described}} {{and used to}} diagnose and simulate tidal dynamics in the greater Mid-Atlantic Bight region. The reduced-physics model incorporates realistic stratification and topography, <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> forcing from a priori estimates of the surface tide, and advection terms that describe first-order interactions of <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> with slowly varying mean flow and mean buoyancy fields and their respective shear. The model is validated via comparisons with semianalytic models and nonlinear primitive equation models in several idealized and realistic simulations that include <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> interactions with topography and mean flows. Then, 24 simulations of <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> generation and propagation in the greater Mid-Atlantic Bight region are used to diagnose significant <b>internal</b> <b>tide</b> interactions with the Gulf Stream. The simulations indicate that locally generated mode-one <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> refract and/or reflect at the Gulf Stream. The redirected <b>internal</b> <b>tides</b> often reappear at the shelf break, where their onshore energy fluxes are intermittent (i. e., noncoherent with surface tide) because meanders in the Gulf Stream alter their precise location, phase, and amplitude. These results provide an explanation for anomalous onshore energy fluxes that were previously observed at the New Jersey shelf break and linked to the irregular generation of nonlinear internal waves.
