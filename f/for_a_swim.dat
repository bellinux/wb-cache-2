5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} his bar was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins to recall {{the events of that}} day. He remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim,</b> and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Edwards found himself unemployed, before gaining a job with a horse racing stable in Fremantle. His {{position}} entailed him taking the horses to the beach each morning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim,</b> grooming them, and attending the twice weekly race meetings; a lifelong interest in horse racing consequently emerged at this time. After later working for a brief period in a factory, he enlisted in the Australian Army in March 1934 and was posted to the 6th Heavy Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, with the rank of private. During this period, Edwards was an active sportsman, excelling in Australian rules football—where he played six matches with leading Western Australian Football League (WAFL) club South Fremantle—and cricket with the Fremantle garrison team.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E

500|$|On 10October two {{replacement}} tyres {{were flown}} to Cocos Island to repair A84-202. The aircraft departed on the 12th {{of the month}} and flew to Christchurch via Laverton; its total flying time was 22hours and 23.5minutes. Cuming later told journalists that A84-202's crew had drunk beer and gone <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> while waiting for their aircraft to be repaired. Both Canberras later flew demonstration flights over Harewood Airport and RNZAF Base Whenuapai and returned to Laverton on 19October. The aircraft were transferred to No.1 Aircraft Depot on 2November {{to be returned to}} standard configuration, and No. 1 Long Range Flight's overseas detachments had all returned to Australia by 6November.

500|$|In {{the heart}} of social, {{cultural}} and recreational life at the University of Toronto lies Hart House, the sprawling neo-Gothic student activity centre that was conceived by alumnus-benefactor Vincent Massey and named for his grandfather Hart. Opened in 1919, the complex established a communitarian spirit in the university and its students, {{who at the time}} kept largely within their own colleges under the decentralized collegiate system. At Hart House, a student can read in the library, dine casually or formally, have a haircut, [...] visit the art gallery, watch a play in the theatre, listen to a concert, observe or join in debates, play billiards, or go <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> and find a place to study, all under the same roof and within the span of a day. The confluence of assorted functions {{is the result of a}} deliberate effort to create a holistic educational experience, a goal summarized in the Founders' Prayer. The Hart House model was influential in the planning of student centres at other universities, notably Cornell University's Willard Straight Hall.|$|E

500|$|For {{most of his}} life, Bizet had {{suffered}} from a recurrent throat complaint. A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day. In 1868, he informed Galabert {{that he had been}} very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: [...] "I suffered like a dog". In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing Carmen, he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as [...] "throat angina", and suffered a further attack in late March 1875. At that time, depressed by the evident failure of Carmen, Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May. At the end of the month, he went to his holiday home at Bougival and, feeling a little better, went <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> in the Seine. On the next day, 1 June, he was afflicted by high fever and pain, which was followed by an apparent heart attack. He seemed temporarily to recover, but {{in the early hours of}} 3 June, his wedding anniversary, he suffered a fatal second attack. He was 36 years old.|$|E

At {{one of the smaller}} islands, Lisca Bianca, the party comes ashore. Anna and Sandro go off alone and talk about their relationship. Anna is unhappy with his long business trips. Sandro dismisses her complaints and takes a nap on the rocks.|$|E
2500|$|Holt {{loved the}} ocean, {{particularly}} spearfishing, and had holiday homes at Portsea, Victoria, and Bingil Bay, Queensland. On 17 December 1967, while Holt was spending the weekend at Portsea, he and four companions decided {{to drive to}} Point Nepean to watch sailor Alec Rose pass through The Rip on his solo circumnavigation attempt. On {{their way back to}} Portsea, Holt convinced the group to stop at remote Cheviot Beach <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> before lunch – he had spearfished there on many previous occasions, and claimed to [...] "know this beach like the back of my hand". Because of the rough conditions, only one other person, Alan Stewart, joined Holt in the water. Stewart kept close to shore, but Holt swam out into deeper water and was seemingly caught up in a rip current, eventually disappearing from view. One of the witnesses, Marjorie Gillespie, described it as [...] "like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the drive}} back to Portsea, Holt {{suggested}} that the group stop at Cheviot Beach <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> – it was about 12:15 p.m., {{and he wanted to}} cool down and work up an appetite before lunch. He knew the area well and had swum there many times before, in 1960 even salvaging a porthole from the SS Cheviot, the shipwreck that had given the beach its name. Holt did not hesitate in entering the water, despite a large swell and visible currents and eddies. Alan Stewart was the only other swimmer, as the others considered it unsafe. Stewart stayed close to shore, and even in the shallows felt a strong undertow. However, Holt swam into deeper water and was dragged out to sea. The others called out to him, but he did not raise his arms or cry for help. He soon slipped under the waves and out of sight, in a manner which Marjorie Gillespie described as [...] "like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final".|$|E
2500|$|In June 1847 Captain John Bush, of the Kirkcaldy and London Shipping Company, married Margaret Greig, {{daughter}} of a shipmaster, at the pier. In 1849 a lifebuoy and rope were provided at the pier head for swimmers who got into difficulty. A ladder leading into the sea was provided for swimmers, {{in addition to the}} stairs which were for use by steamboat passengers. By the 1850s the pier was falling into disrepair, but it was still popular with bathers, and early-morning trains were advertised allowing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> before work. There was a gymnasium {{at the head of the}} pier, and the Forth Swimming Club was based there from its inception in 1850. They organised swimming competitions, including [...] "fast swimming" [...] and [...] "long diving" [...] which were, respectively, a [...] race and an underwater endurance contest. [...] "Deep diving" [...] involved retrieving objects from the bottom in [...] of water then surfacing through a floating lifebuoy. A longer race was from Newhaven harbour to the Chain Pier, a distance of [...] In 1864 the winning time was 11 minutes and 35 seconds. Two floating platforms were moored east of the pier; the closer one was about [...] out. In July 1858 an attempt was made to restart ferry services from the pier; this caused annoyance to swimmers.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the German Spring Offensive petered out in July 1918, they had reached the closest point to Paris of the entire war and had come close to {{breaking}} the Allied armies and winning the conflict. 850,000 British and French soldiers had been wounded killed or captured in just four months. Although the Hundred Days Offensive which would eventually defeat the German army began two weeks later, the damage to Edgar Cox was done. During the months of the Spring Offensive he had worked feverishly to discover the locations and details of the next attacks and had deteriorated both mentally and physically in the process. Cox was knocked out by the influenza pandemic for much of June and {{did not return to}} duty until mid-August. He had become a heavy smoker and [...] by August was no longer eating or sleeping, suffering severely from nervous exhaustion. On 26 August 1918 he announced that he would go <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> and was driven down to Berck Plage near GHQ at Étaples. He entered the water alone and his body was recovered from the sea some time later. He was buried in Étaples Military Cemetery with full military honours. Following his death, the Royal Geographic Society reported that the British nation in the First World War had [...] "suffered no more grievous loss than in the death of General Cox", and that [...] "He was one of those men, of whom there are very few, of whom nothing but praise was ever heard." ...|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "tank top", {{recorded}} in English since 1968, derives from its resemblance to a tank suit, {{a style of}} one-piece women's swimsuit with shoulder straps, so called since the 1920s, because it was worn in a [...] "swimming tank", <b>an</b> obsolete term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>swimming</b> pool.
