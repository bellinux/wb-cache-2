40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{operation}} and scheduling of <b>electric</b> <b>loads</b> in micro-grid, a highly automated and distributed cyber-physical energy system (CPES). We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for <b>electric</b> <b>loads</b> and battery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and constraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time scheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid, named Significant Moments Analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments when electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a dynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of <b>electric</b> <b>loads.</b> Using SMA, we can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can generate enough power to support the execution of <b>electric</b> <b>loads.</b> In the case where the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide accurate information {{about the amount of}} insufficient power and the time when the insufficiency happens.

2500|$|Demand for {{electricity}} from the world's various grids varies {{over the course}} of the day and from season to season. For the most part, variation in electric demand is met by varying the amount of electrical energy supplied from primary sources. Increasingly, however, operators are storing lower-cost energy produced at night, then releasing it to the grid during the peak periods of the day when it is more valuable. In areas where hydroelectric dams exist, release can be delayed until demand is greater; this form of storage is common and can make use of existing reservoirs. This is not storing [...] "surplus" [...] energy produced elsewhere, but the net effect is the same – although without the efficiency losses. [...] Renewable supplies with variable production, like wind and solar power, tend to increase the net variation in <b>electric</b> <b>load,</b> increasing the opportunity for grid energy storage.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} {{to solve the}} on/off scheduling of (non-linear) dynamic <b>electric</b> <b>loads</b> based on predictions of the power delivery of a (standalone) solar power source. Knowledge of variations in the solar power output is used to optimally select the timing and the combinations {{of a set of}} given <b>electric</b> <b>loads,</b> where each load has a desired dynamic power profile. The optimization exploits the desired power profiles of the <b>electric</b> <b>loads</b> in terms of dynamic power ramp up/down and minimum time on/off of each load to track a finite number of load switching combinations over a moving finite prediction horizon. Subsequently, a user-specified optimization function with possible power constraints is evaluated over the finite number of combinations to allow for real-time computation of the optimal timing and switching of loads.
