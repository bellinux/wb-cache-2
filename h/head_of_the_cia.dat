25|$|Gates was {{nominated}} {{to become the}} Director of Central Intelligence (<b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA)</b> in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy {{about his role in}} the Iran-Contra affair.|$|E
25|$|The United States had {{maintained}} numerous military bases and a substantial garrison throughout the Canal Zone {{to protect the}} American-owned Panama Canal and to maintain American control of this strategically important area. On 7 September 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the de facto leader of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, signed Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which set in motion the process of handing over the Panama Canal to Panamanian control by the year 2000. Although the canal was destined for Panamanian administration, the military bases remained and one condition of the transfer was that the canal would remain open for American shipping. The U.S. had long-standing relations with General Noriega, {{who served as a}} U.S. intelligence asset and paid informant of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1967, including the period when Bush was <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> (1976–77).|$|E
25|$|During Turner's term as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> {{he became}} outraged when former agent Frank Snepp {{published}} a book called Decent Interval which exposed incompetence among senior U.S. government personnel during the fall of Saigon. Turner accused Snepp of breaking the secrecy agreement required of all CIA agents, and then later was forced to admit under cross-examination {{that he had never}} read the agreement signed by Snepp. Regardless, the CIA ultimately won its case against Snepp at the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court forced Snepp to turn over all his profits from Decent Interval and to seek preclearance of any future writings about intelligence work {{for the rest of his}} life. The ultimate irony was that the CIA would later rely on the Snepp legal precedent in forcing Turner to seek preclearance of his own memoirs, which were highly critical of President Ronald Reagan's policies.|$|E

500|$|On 26 July 1986, Hezbollah {{freed the}} American hostage Father Lawrence Jenco, {{former head of}} Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon. Following this, William Casey, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> {{requested}} that the United States authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces {{as a way of}} expressing gratitude. Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed, and hostages might be killed. Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur. North used this release to persuade Reagan to switch over to a [...] "sequential" [...] policy of freeing the hostages one by one, instead of the [...] "all or nothing" [...] policy that the Americans had pursued until then. By this point, the Americans had grown tired of Ghobanifar who had proven himself a dishonest intermediary who played off both sides to his own commercial advantage. In August 1986, the Americans had established a new contact in the Iranian government, Ali Hashemi Bahramani, the nephew of Rafsanjani and an officer in the Revolutionary Guard. The fact that the Revolutionary Guard was deeply involved in international terrorism seemed only to attract the Americans more to Bahramani, who was seen as someone with the influence to change Iran's policies. Richard Secord, an American arms dealer who was being used as a contract with Iran wrote to North: [...] "My judgement is that we have opened up a new and probably better channel into Iran". North was so impressed with Bahramani that he arranged for him to secretly visit Washington D.C and gave him a guided tour at midnight of the White House.|$|E

2500|$|Retinger {{approached}} Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands {{who agreed}} to promote the idea, together with former Belgian prime minister Paul van Zeeland, and the then head of Unilever, Dutchman Paul Rijkens. Bernhard in turn contacted Walter Bedell Smith, then <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> who asked Eisenhower adviser Charles Douglas Jackson {{to deal with the}} suggestion. The guest list was to be drawn up by inviting two attendees from each nation, one of each to represent [...] "conservative" [...] and [...] "liberal" [...] points of view. Fifty delegates from 11 countries in Western Europe attended the first conference, along with 11 Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkpatrick, {{a member}} of the National Security Council, did not get along with either Secretary of State Haig or his successor, George Shultz. She {{disagreed}} with Shultz, most notably on the Iran-Contra affair in which she supported skimming money off arms sales to fund the Nicaraguan Contras while Shultz told Kirkpatrick that it would be an [...] "impeachable offense" [...] to do so because of the massacres perpetrated by that group. Shultz threatened to resign if Kirkpatrick was appointed National Security Adviser. Kirkpatrick was more closely allied with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> William J. Casey on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky's {{approach}} to academic freedom has {{led him to}} give support to MIT academics whose actions he deplores. In 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted {{to return to work}} at MIT, Chomsky threatened [...] "to protest publicly" [...] if Rostow was [...] "denied a position at MIT". Then, in 1989, when Pentagon adviser, John Deutch, wanted to be the President of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> the New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, [...] "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met ....

2500|$|On June 18, 1948, the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2 {{calling for}} covert {{action against the}} USSR, and {{granting}} the authority to carry out covert operations against [...] "hostile foreign states or groups" [...] that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government. To this end, the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was created inside the new CIA. The OPC was quite unique; Frank Wisner, {{the head of the}} OPC, answered not to the CIA Director, but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC, and the OPC's actions were a secret even from the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> Most CIA stations had two station chiefs, one working for the OSO, and one working for the OPC.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky's {{particular}} {{interpretation of}} academic freedom led him to give support to some of MIT's more militaristic academics, even though he disagreed with their actions. For example, in 1969, when he heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted {{to return to work}} at the university, Chomsky threatened [...] "to protest publicly" [...] if Rostow was [...] "denied a position at MIT." [...] In 1989, Chomsky then gave support to a long-standing Pentagon adviser, John Deutch, by backing his candidacy for President of MIT. Deutch was an influential advocate of both chemical and nuclear weapons and later became <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, [...] "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met in academic life, or any other life. ... If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} surge in Congressional oversight activity may be sourced in the American people's loss {{of confidence in the}} USG due to the Watergate scandal. Also, the apparent distortions and dishonesty concerning the reported progress of the war in Vietnam gravely eroded the public's previous tendency to put its trust in the word of USG officials. Evidence published in 1971 had demonstrated [...] "systemized abuse of power" [...] by J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director. The September 1973 overthrow of a democratically elected government in Chile ultimately revealed earlier CIA involvement there. Other factors contributed to the political unease, e.g., the prevalence of conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination, and the emergence of whistleblowers. Accordingly, the Central Intelligence Agency, which was tangentially involved in Watergate, and which had been directly engaged in the Vietnam conflict from the beginning, became a subject of Congressional inquiry and media interest. Helms, of course, had served as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> 1965–73. Eventually the process of scrutiny opened a secret pandora's box of questionable CIA activities.|$|E
50|$|He is {{best known}} for his work as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Soviet Division, where he made {{significant}} changes in espionage strategy. Specifically, Soviets who came forward to offer intelligence information to <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> would no longer be greeted with harsh treatment and categorically subjected to an enduring suspicion. His transformative changes led to <b>the</b> departure <b>of</b> James Angleton, <b>the</b> counterintelligence chief who had long enjoyed a dominant role in <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Cline {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Directorate <b>of</b> Intelligence, <b>the</b> agency's {{analytical}} branch.

5000|$|Golitsyn {{was flown}} to the US and interviewed by David Murphy, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Soviet Russia Division. After some time, Golitsyn began making {{increasing}} demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US and complaining about his treatment. Considering {{him to be}} unreliable, Murphy passed him on to James Jesus Angleton, <b>the</b> director <b>of</b> counter-intelligence. Golitsyn's description of a turncoat within <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> known only as [...] "Sasha", led Angleton {{to embark on a}} multi-year manhunt and accuse many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> spy.

2500|$|In 1952 Bradlee {{joined the}} staff of the Office of U.S. Information and Educational Exchange (USIE), the embassy's {{propaganda}} unit. USIE produced films, magazines, research, speeches, and news items for use by the CIA throughout Europe. USIE (later known as USIA) also controlled the Voice of America, a means of disseminating pro-American [...] "cultural information" [...] worldwide. While at the USIE, according to a Justice Department memo from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Rosenberg Trial, Bradlee was helping the CIA manage European propaganda regarding the spying conviction and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on , 1953. The memo, addressed to U.S. Attorney Myles Lane and dated December 13, 1952, states that [...] " [...] further advised that he was sent here by Robert Thayer, who is the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in Paris...he stated that he {{was supposed to have been}} met by a representative of the CIA at the airport but missed connections" [...] and that [...] "he has been trying to get in touch with [...] Allen Dulles." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 18, 1948, the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2 [...] " [...] for covert {{operations}} {{to attack the}} soviets around the world," [...] and giving the CIA the authority to carry out {{covert operations}} [...] "against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and conducted that any U.S. government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them." [...] To this end, the Office of Policy Coordination was created inside the new CIA. [...] It is important to note, though, that the OPC was quite unique. [...] Frank Wisner, {{the head of the}} OPC answered not to the DI, but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC, and the OPC's actions were a secret even from the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> [...] Most CIA stations had two station chiefs, one working for the OSO, and one working for the OPC.

2500|$|During Khatami's presidency, Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi {{claimed that}} an unnamed former CIA chief had visited Iran with a {{suitcase}} stuffed with dollars to pay opinion-formers. [...] "What is dangerous is that {{agents of the}} enemy, the CIA, have infiltrated {{the government and the}} cultural services," [...] he was quoted as saying. On top of its official budget for Iran, the CIA had given [...] "hundreds {{of millions of dollars to}} our cultural officials and journalists," [...] he added. [...] "The former <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> recently came here as a tourist with a suitcase full of dollars for our cultural centres and certain newspapers. He made contact with various newspaper chiefs and gave them dollars." [...] Nasser Pourpirar for instance believes that a significant portion of Iranian history are baseless fabrications by Jewish orientalists and Zionists. The whole existence of Pre-Islamic Iran is no more than a Jewish conspiracy and the most important key for analyzing today’s world events is the analysis of ancient [...] "Jewish genocide of Purim." [...] Another neoconservative theorist, Mohammad Ali Ramin believes that contemporary western history (e.g. Holocaust) are all fabrications by Jews. He also claimed that Adolf Hitler was a Jew himself. M.A. Ramin, Hassan Abbasi, Abbas Salimi Namin and others have been giving speeches about Jewish conspiracy theory, Iranian and western history intensively all over the country since the establishment of Ahmadinejad government in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Langdon met Trent Anderson, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Office <b>of</b> Security.
