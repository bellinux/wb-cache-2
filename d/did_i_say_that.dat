Before the performance she said; [...] "I believe 30 years ago you fought for your freedom, am I correct? It's called People Power Freedom , <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> right? Up with democracy and freedom! That is the revolution of love. And that's what a rebel heart fights for. So on this very special occasion, I want to sing this song".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to October 2012, Deep Purple {{had never}} been {{nominated}} for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, [...] "they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? ...And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ...the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions." [...] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; [...] "The {{list of people who}} haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling.. big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm {{not going to get into}} the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are not in it [...] It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there." ...|$|E

Ajatashatru asked, 'What difficult things?' The mother said,'When you were young, your finger was wounded. You could not sleep for nights because of the pain. Your father held you on his lap and sucked on your finger. Your father had a soft body, so you could sleep well. Because of the warmth of his mouth, your wound's pus broke out. Your father thought that if he spat out the pus, it would increase your pain, so he swallowed the pus. Your father did such difficult thing for you. Please release him.' ...|$|R

5000|$|From {{the onset}} of the 1888 Minneapolis Conference, Ellen White {{perceived}} that a battle over truth was erupting within the denomination. At first, Ellen White rejoiced that the spirit of God was at the meeting and commented that the leaders [...] "heard as it were God speaking to them through his Son. They saw, they felt the divine influence of the Spirit of God and all witnessed to the gracious words that proceeded from His mouth White, Manuscript 24, 1888.." [...] Ellen White soon discovered, however, that other forces were deliberately at work planning to disrupt and confuse the mission and message of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Ellen White was convinced that God had [...] "raised up" [...] for this moment these two young ministers, E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones, to give a message to the delegates at the conference."I believe without a doubt that God has given precious truth at the right time to Brother Jones and Brother Waggoner. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> place them as infallible? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they will not make a statement or have an idea that cannot be questioned or that cannot be error? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> so?

There was {{something}} even dreamier about it now, and a sort of new element in the way Jeff fell out of his monotone into lapses of thought that I, for one, misunderstood. I thought that perhaps getting so much money,--well, you know the way it acts on people in the larger cities. It seemed to spoil one's idea of Jeff that copper and asbestos and banana lands should form the goal of his thought when, if he knew it, the little shop and the sunlight of Mariposa was so much better.|$|E

Thou hast no promise from God's mouth for that, nor is grace or strength ministered to mankind by the covenant that thou art under. So that still thou standest bound to thy good behaviour, and in the day that thou dost give the first, though never so little a trip, or stumble in thy obedience, thou forfeitest thine interest in paradise, and in justice, as to any benefit there.|$|E

I will add, yea, and also of {{disposing}} of heaven and life eternal. And then, I pray you, what is left unto God, and what can he call his own? Not mercy, for that by thy good deeds thou hast purchased: not heaven, for that by thy good deeds thou hast purchased: not eternal life, for that by thy good deeds thou hast purchased. Thus, Pharisee (O thou self-righteous man), hast thou set up thyself above grace, mercy, heaven, glory; yea, above even God himself, for the purchaser should in reason be esteemed above the purchase.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> hearty, fervent, and {{constant}} prayer flowed from this fear of God? I will add, {{that if the}} whole duty, and the continuation of it, be not managed with this fear of God, it profiteth nothing at all. It is said of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, [...] "He was heard in that he feared." [...] He prayed, then, because he feared, because he feared God, and therefore was his prayer accepted of him, even because he feared--"He was heard in that he feared" [...] (Heb 5:7). This godly fear is so essential to right prayer, and right prayer is such an inseparable effect and fruit of this fear, that you must have both or none; he that prayeth not feareth not God, yea, he that prayeth not fervently and frequently feareth him not; and so he that feareth him not cannot pray; for if prayer be {{the effect of this}} fear of God, then without this fear, prayer, fervent prayer, ceaseth. How can they pray or make conscience of the duty that fear not God? O prayerless man, thou fearest not God! Thou wouldest not live so like a swine or a dog in the world as thou dost, if thou fearest the Lord.|$|E

60|$|Not {{therefore}} rashly and unfeelingly, {{but from}} the dictates of thoughtful humanity, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was the business of our Generals to fight, and to persevere in fighting; and {{that they did not}} bear this duty sufficiently in mind; this, almost the sole duty which professional soldiers, till our time, (happily for mankind) used to think of. But the victories of the French have been attended every where by the subversion of Governments; and their generals have accordingly united political with military functions: and with what success this has been done by them, the present state of Europe affords melancholy proof. But have they, on this account, ever neglected to calculate upon the advantages which might fairly be anticipated from future warfare? Or, in a treaty of to-day, have they ever forgotten a victory of yesterday? Eager to grasp at the double honour of captain and negociator, have they ever sacrificed the one to the other; or, in the blind effort, lost both? Above all, in their readiness to flourish with the pen, have they ever overlooked the sword, the symbol of their power, and the appropriate instrument of their success and glory? I notice this assumption of a double character {{on the part of the}} French, not to lament over it and its consequences, but to render somewhat more intelligible the conduct of our own Generals; and to explain how far men, whom we have no reason to believe other than brave, have, through the influence of such example, lost sight of their primary duties, apeing instead of imitating, and following only to be misled.|$|E

[41] I {{am sorry}} to lose time by answering, however curtly, the [...] equivocations of the writers who sought to obscure the [...] {{instances}} given of regulated labour {{in the first of}} these [...] papers, by confusing kinds, ranks, and quantities of labour [...] with its qualities.
