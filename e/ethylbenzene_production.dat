40|$|Alkylation of benzene with {{ethylene}} to ethylbenzene {{is widely}} used in the petrochemical industry. Ethylbenzene is an important raw material in the petrochemical industry. It is used as feedstock {{for the production of}} styrene, an important material for plastic and rubber production. The conventional catalyst for this alkylation process is AlCl₃, which accounted for 24 % of the worldwide <b>ethylbenzene</b> <b>production</b> in 2009. As utilization of this catalyst involves problems with separation, handling, safety and corrosion, immense efforts have been devoted to the development of new catalysts for <b>ethylbenzene</b> <b>production.</b> Compared with AlCl₃, zeolites possess advantages in easy separation, low corrosion, high surface area as well as uniform microporous structure coupled to shape selectivity, and thus they are better acidic catalysts when applied in petrochemical industry. In this thesis, zeolite catalysts based on Y, ZSM- 5 and HBeta were prepared and characterized by several techniques (XRD, MAS NMR, BET and SEM). The catalytic performance of these zeolite catalysts has been studied in the benzene/ethylene alkylation reaction in the gas phase using a fixed bed reactor at reaction temperature of 250 ºC and a 5 bar pressure with a 0. 5 h - 1 ethylene space velocity (WHSV) and different benzene to ethylene feed ratios. The products were identified by GC/MS and quantified by gas chromatography. These studies highlight the importance of ion-exchange with rare earth cations as a powerful method to control the local structural and catalytic properties of zeolites, and also to enhance the acid properties upon rare earth exchange. Most notable is the significant enhancement in product selectivity – viz. ethylbenzene selectivity- for La and Ce ion-exchanged HZSM- 5 zeolite catalysts, showing a 30 % + increase in selectivity for the alkylation reaction after rare-earth ion exchange.

40|$|Economics of a {{chemical}} plant depend on multiple factors: grade of a feed, types of catalyst, operating temperature and pressure, cost of equipment, and many other factors could have influences on economics of the plant. In a previous study about an ethylbenzene facility, our team scrutinize two proposed changes. An optimization plan is recommended by our team {{in order to maximize}} the net present value (NPV) of the plant. This report focuses on demonstrating rationales of setting certain operating conditions, showcasing the details of optimization, and elucidating the reasons behind applying these modifications. The team used simulating software PRO/-II to investigate various changes applied, and used CAPCOST for economic estimation. Even though any plant in the real world cannot be perfect, our result is a good starting point for more comprehensive and precise design. After the investigation, we conclude that reaction section, cooling section, recycle, and separating section can be optimized {{in order to keep the}} plant working in a highly efficient and effective manner. By manipulating operating conditions and equipment sizing, the entire plant is simplified and the <b>ethylbenzene</b> <b>production</b> process becomes more efficient than the original process. Furthermore, the net present value of the plant is increased dramatically, post-optimization...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chromium}} on the catalytic properties of MCM- 41 was evaluated {{in order to}} develop new catalysts for the trimethylbenzene transalkylation with benzene to produce ethylbenzene, a high-value aromatic in the industry. It was found that chromium decreases the specific surface area but increases the acidity, turning MCM- 41 into an active and selective catalyst for <b>ethylbenzene</b> and toluene <b>production.</b> The coke produced on the catalyst is hydrogenated and mainly located outside the pores and thus can be easily removed. The catalyst is more active and selective than mordenite, a commercial catalyst, and thus more promising for commercial applications...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{optimization}} in {{a chemical}} process or system involves improving an existing design {{or a combination}} of devices. In the case of an established process such as the <b>ethylbenzene</b> <b>production</b> process investigated here, the optimization involves improving an established process and choosing the best available case within a set of constraints that also considers maximizing the economic bottom line. An objective function must be selected for an optimization problem which defines the achievable goal. The objective function of the optimization process presented here is to minimize the estimated annual operating cost (EAOC). An EAOC takes in to account all the necessary variables that add up to the yearly operating costs of a chemical process such as utility and raw material costs. The secondary objective function presented here is maximizing the net present value (NPV) which is directly related to minimizing the EAOC. The NPV takes in to account the recurring costs of plant operation over a plant’s expected lifetime. Both objective functions are assessed and considered. By defining a number of constraints and decision variables related to the objective function, an optimization problem becomes a dynamic and creative exercise. The report included contains an evaluation of defined constraints, decision variables, and proposed changes and an optimized design utilizing the engineering resources available. The optimized design focuses on making a catalyst change to maximize the efficiency of the reactor section and also on changing the raw material feed to directly reduce the raw material cost of operation. Safety of the plant’s operation follows a full economic analysis and detailed process description of the optimized design...|$|E
