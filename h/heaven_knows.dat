500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– <b>heaven</b> <b>knows</b> why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{critical}} letter, Mrs Beeton's sister Mrs Henrietta Mary Pourtois English advised her that [...] "Cookery is a Science {{that is only}} learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had.

[...] The recipes were largely copied from the most successful cookery books of the day, the copying in some cases acknowledged in the text. The [...] "variety" [...] included Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families and her The English Bread–Book, Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier royal parisien, Louis Eustache Ude's The French Cook, Alexis Soyer's The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère and The Pantropheon, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli.|$|E

500|$|Wilkinson felt a deep bond {{of sympathy}} {{with the people of}} Jarrow and the loss of the {{shipyard}} which was the life-source of the town. [...] Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency. She records {{that at the end of}} the meeting MacDonald said to her: [...] "Ellen, why don't you go out and preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?" [...] This [...] "priceless remark", she says, brought home the [...] "reality and sham... of that warm but so easy sympathy". She became Jarrow's MP [...] in the general election of November 1935, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360. In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: [...] "These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships... The years go on and nothing is done... this is a desperately urgent matter and [...] something should be done to get work to these areas which, <b>Heaven</b> <b>knows,</b> want work." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{coping with}} the loss of her child, Isabella {{continued}} to work at The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. Although she was not a regular cook, she and Samuel obtained recipes from other sources. A request to receive the readers' own recipes led to over 2,000 being sent in, which were selected and edited by the Beetons. Published works were also copied, largely unattributed to any of the sources. These included Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families, Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier royal parisien, Louis Eustache Ude's The French Cook, Alexis Soyer's The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère and The Pantropheon, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli. Suzanne Daly and Ross G. Forman, in their examination of Victorian cooking culture, consider that the plagiarism makes it [...] "an important index of mid-Victorian and middle-class society" [...] because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time. In copying the recipes of others, Isabella was following the recommendation given to her by Henrietta English, a family friend, who wrote that [...] "Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and <b>Heaven</b> <b>knows</b> there is a great variety for you to choose from." ...|$|E

Garrison reported, [...] "its seven-foot propeller missed me by a foot, but chopped most of Melmoth into scraps". He went on to take note of the damage, [...] "everything that I built {{was destroyed}}. Everything that I bought off somebody's shelf—the engine, the avionics, the instruments—survived...I kept the remains for a year, and then, after salvaging what I could, sold the empty hulk to a metal dealer to be shipped to Taiwan and converted into <b>heaven</b> <b>knows</b> what.

Lowry feels the [...] "book marks Carter's further disgraceful descent from ineffectual president and international do-gooder to apologist for the worst Arab tendencies", citing a passage from the book. Mona Charen writes in the National Review that [...] "awkward phrasing is found throughout this slapdash work."Charen presents examples of what she regards as [...] "simplistic, naïve, or tendentious" [...] ideas in the book about the Six-Day War, Hezbollah, and Oslo Accords.|$|E
2500|$|The Princess {{began her}} work with AIDS victims in the 1980s. In 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London. She was not averse to making {{physical}} contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way. Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient {{in one of her}} early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition. Diana noted: [...] "HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. <b>Heaven</b> <b>knows</b> they need it. What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys." [...] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in [...] "something more pleasant". In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C. She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust. In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK. As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992. She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research.|$|E
