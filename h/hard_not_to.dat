25|$|Trademark erosion, or genericization, is {{a special}} case of antonomasia related to {{trademark}}s. It happens when a trademark becomes so common that it starts {{being used as a}} common name and the original company has failed to prevent such use. Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let their trademark become too common, a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition.|$|E

Fitzmaurice wrote in conclusion, [...] "Along with this purely visceral pleasure, it's <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> marvel at how awesome those growling-lion samples sound." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times said that he liked the song and viewed it as a [...] "syrupy instrumental" [...] that foreshadows [...] "the convergence of hip-hop, dance and rock".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show. Since nothing ends up coming of it from a plot standpoint , it's <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think of it as one of those comics where two [...] have a big fight scene {{that turns out to be}} mistaken identity." ...|$|E

But his heart won't let him move on." [...] After the couple began dating it attracted a bigger mixed response from viewers, many felt it was still too soon after Bridget. Sorensen then spoke out once more defending his character stating: The storyline then carried on progressing and viewers saw the two characters grow closer until they started a relationship, despite the mixed response received from fans of Declan and Bridget.|$|E
500|$|Colin Liddell of AlternativeRight.com {{has criticized}} Anglin's beliefs and tone. Liddell, who {{believes}} that stopping migration and encouraging higher birthrates is more important for preserving the white race, condemned Anglin for writing {{that it was impossible}} for the race to survive without adopting his views on Jews, Hitler and the Holocaust. Liddell considered that Anglin was attracting poor whites with his provocative online persona {{in the same manner as}} monster trucks and professional wrestling, writing that [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> conclude that Anglin is a paid shill and agent provocateur, whose purpose is simply to infest and discredit White nationalism". Jared Taylor of American Renaissance criticized The Daily Stormer [...] "extremely harsh, dismissive and insulting tone toward blacks", which he called unhelpful.|$|E

[...] MTV ranked the episode the 32nd best of the series. Writing for Zap2it in 2008, Ryan McGee said he particularly enjoyed the episode and deemed it {{one of his top}} ten favorite episodes that had aired up to that point. McGee explained that [...] "Solitary" [...] contains [...] "a lot of enclosed encounters between two people, set against a gorgeously shot B story that warms the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Bramesco of The A.V. Club {{recommended}} the film, writing that [...] "The film is patently absurd, but the filmmakers are fully committed to that absurdity.

Charles Webb of MTV.com called the performances [...] "a little rough", and wrote [...] "If Killer Klowns isn't especially scary, it's {{only kind of}} funny but still gets by on the execution of extremely inventive visuals based on the clown/circus motif". Dread Central gave the film three {{out of a possible}} five stars. JoBlo.com gave the film a rating of 8/10, stating that the film [...] "is the KING of 80's B-movies and it delivers the tacky goods by the truckloads".

500|$|Sean Dooley of About.com labeled [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] {{as one of}} the [...] "best {{songs on}} Fearless", while Johnny Davis of The Observer {{believed}} some parts of the song [...] "may needle British ears", although he felt that it was better than single releases by pop singer Hilary Duff. Lucy Davies of the BBC was not impressed by the song's theme being similar to those of other songs on Fearless or on her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. She opined that [...] "You Belong with Me"'s [...] "lyrical palette has few colours [...] and it's repetitive". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine said, [...] "'You Belong with Me' isn't her best-written song by a long shot, but it's hard to fault its construction."

500|$|The {{character}} has been positively received for his development in Mortal Kombat: Deception, while several gaming media outlets have rated him {{among the top}} characters of the Mortal Kombat series. GamesRadar commented in 2014: [...] "This red-clad ninja {{might not be as}} iconic as Sub-Zero or Scorpion, but it's <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> love Ermac for his ... supernatural, Sith-like powers of telekinesis." [...] While Ermac and Mortal Kombat's other male ninjas ranked third on GamePro's 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer wrote in 2010 {{that he did not want}} these characters, aside from Scorpion and Sub-Zero, in future series installments, while Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot felt the unlocking of Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was [...] "a hassle". Evan Narcisse of Time described Ermac's costume update in the 2011 reboot as differentiating from that of Sub-Zero.|$|E

Sacramone herself took responsibility for the results, saying, [...] "It's kinda <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> blame myself." [...] However, analysts in the gymnastics community, including University of Georgia head coach Suzanne Yoculan, former Olympian John Roethlisberger and International Gymnast editor Paul Ziert, noted that the American team started the competition at a difficult point deficit to the Chinese and that mathematically, Sacramone could not have been personally or exclusively responsible for the U.S. team's results. Teammate Bridget Sloan also said in an interview, [...] "We've all made mistakes. It's just really hard to see her go and leave these Olympics knowing that she thinks it's her fault. It is definitely not, and we've all been encouraging her very much." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} seven (1995) episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI", Homer was {{computer}} animated into a three-dimensional character {{for the first}} time for the [...] "Homer3" [...] segment of the episode.

In the final minute of the segment, the 3D Homer ends up in a real world, live-action Los Angeles. The scene was directed by David Mirkin and was the first time a Simpsons character had been in the real world in the series. Because [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] (season six, 1995) is set fifteen years in the future, Homer's design was altered to make him older in the episode. He is heavier; one of the hairs on top of his head was removed; and an extra line was placed under the eye. A similar design has been used in subsequent flashforwards.|$|E
