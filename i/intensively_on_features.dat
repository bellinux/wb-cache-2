30|$|The {{other three}} {{activities}} are {{negatively associated with}} working split shifts. Female split-shifters spend 12  min less than comparable straight-shifters on housework on working days. Among males, the figure is 11  min less. As shown in Table B. 10, the main contributor to these reductions is time spent shopping for consumer goods and services. Shopping less <b>intensively</b> <b>on</b> working days could be made up for by shopping more <b>intensively</b> <b>on</b> days off. To investigate this possibility, I estimated regressions for shopping time in the full sample of diaries, including among the regressors a binary variable equal to one if the diary pertained to a day off, and an interaction term between this dummy and the dummy for working split shifts. The main results are in Table B. 11. By adding the estimate in the interaction term to the estimate on working split shifts, {{we can see that}} split-shifters do not shop more <b>intensively</b> than straight-shifters <b>on</b> days off. This result and those in Aguiar and Hurst (2007) suggest that split-shifters might be paying more for the same basket of goods.|$|R
