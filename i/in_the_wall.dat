5|$|A few of {{the people}} who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written {{accounts}} of their experiences. Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, Crack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the Walled City. In his 2004 autobiography Gweilo, Martin Booth describes his exploration of the Walled City as a child in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|A large alcove {{close by}} in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre that {{contained}} an effigy representing Truth crushing a mask, again probably the work of Roubiliac. It drew the visitor's attention towards two life-sized pictures by Francis Hayman, depicting a Christian and an Unbeliever as they died, set into compartments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

40|$|Occurrence of {{supernumerary}} bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> orbit especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medial <b>wall</b> and <b>the</b> roof has beendescribed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature. Studies of {{the prevalence}} of supernumerary bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bony <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> orbit are scarce in theliterature. Present study was undertaken to find {{the prevalence of}} supernumerary bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> orbit <b>in</b> acollection of adult Indian skulls. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study three hundred and twenty six orbital walls from one hundred and sixty three skulls wereexamined {{for the presence of}} the sutural bones. Their location with reference to <b>the</b> sutures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> orbit andtheir size was noted. The supernumerary bones were found in 25 skulls (15. 34 %) mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lateral <b>wall</b> (11. 04 %) and theroof of the orbit (4. 29 %). Prevalence of such supernumerary bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> bony orbit is of anthropologicalinterest. Many of the bony ossicles were of sufficiently large size, enough to be visualized on lateral skull X-ray and couldeasily be mistaken for fracture of <b>the</b> bony <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> orbit...|$|R

5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah Rasul Allah tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E

5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E
5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> at the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remain unknown but they have been {{investigated}} in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{reporter}} Joshua Prager {{wrote an}} article <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> Street Journal profiling the long-term toll that Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance had on his family. His mother Maj and his stepfather Fredrik von Dardel {{spent the rest of}} their lives searching for their son. They both committed suicide by overdosing on pills two days apart in 1979. Their daughter Nina Lagergren, Raoul's half-sister, attributed their suicide to their despair about never finding their son. Lagergren and Raoul's half-brother Guy von Dardel established organizations and worked to find their brother or confirmation of his death. At the request of their parents, they were to assume he was alive until the year 2000.|$|E
