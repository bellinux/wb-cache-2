To make room for the <b>extra</b> <b>course</b> load students must complete a summer semester their freshman year. It consists of either a Physics 2 class if the students has taken Calculus 1 and 2 over the academic year or a Physics 1 and 2 sequence with a Calculus 2 semester. The latter is for students who started off with Pre-Calculus in the fall and since Calculus 1 is a pre-requisite for Physics 1, the three classes must be done in the summer. The program offers MET versions of regular class the university offers, the main difference is that the typical class size is less than 20 students per class. The personal attention to the student is a very big factor to students' success in the program; each student has access to all the university's facilities and the very helpful faculty of SEP.

Paper presents two case studies using the same measure of cognitive abilities (Vienna matrix test) and tacit knowledge (participation in <b>extra</b> <b>course</b> activities), but at two different courses using different final exam tests. The results show only weak correlations between cognitive abilities and final evaluation in the given courses.
