5|$|Two {{nights before}} the game, Virginia Tech running back David Wilson and safety Antone Exum missed a 1am curfew. As punishment, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer {{suspended}} the two players for the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{dominated}} in the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Virginia Tech {{received the}} opening kickoff, {{but failed to}} capitalize on its opening drive thanks to a personal foul penalty that forced the Hokies to punt. On its first possession, Georgia moved into scoring position courtesy of a 26-yard run by Kregg Lumpkin. Failing to advance the ball further, Georgia sent in kicker Brandon Coutu who kicked a 39-yard field goal to give Georgia the early lead, 3–0.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen {{by as much}} as 18 points. In {{the second}} quarter the teams {{combined}} to score 63 points, setting records for most points scored in a quarter and a half. The Midshipmen rallied around a strong rushing offense to take the lead {{at the beginning of the}} third quarter, and the Mean Green's offensive momentum sputtered during the second half. Navy held the lead for the remainder of the game.|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a BART rider {{created a}} website, bartcrimes.com, to {{disseminate}} information he thought BART makes {{very difficult to}} find on their website, intentionally making it inconvenient to access crime logs, which are public information. BART officials say crime rates remain low.

5|$|Kiprusoff {{began the}} 2003–04 season {{competing}} with Vesa Toskala for the backup spot behind Nabokov, leading to speculation of a trade. Ultimately relegated to third-string status, Kiprusoff grew increasingly frustrated, {{as he did}} not play in any games through the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. He was then finally traded to the Calgary Flames {{in exchange for a}} second-round draft pick on November 16, 2003, after Calgary starter Roman Turek suffered an injury.|$|E
5|$|Mannerism is {{the name}} {{sometimes}} given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early Baroque, in Poland {{the last quarter of}} the 16th century and the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, and increasingly by the art of the Netherlands. As a fusion of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the Baroque.|$|E

5|$|This type of shallow {{drinking}} {{vessel was}} quite {{common in the}} Middle Ages, but the only other mazers in Oxford are three dating from the 15th century, and one standing mazer from 1529–30, all belonging to All Souls.

5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) {{became an}} important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings {{can be seen as}} a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E
5|$|From {{the later}} twelfth- to the mid thirteenth century, the dynasty {{suffered}} from bitter factionalism and vicious kin-strife. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's father, Óláfr, was a younger son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1187). According to the chronicle, {{before his death}} in 1187, Guðrøðr Óláfsson instructed that Óláfr should succeed to the kingship. The latter was only a child at the time, however, and the Islesmen instead inaugurated Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson (died 1229), Guðrøðr Óláfsson's eldest albeit illegitimate son. As the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thirteenth century began to wane, contentions between the half-brothers broke out into outright war. By the turn of the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, Óláfr managed to put aside the wife that Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson had assigned him; and afterwards married Cairistíona, thereby gaining her father's military assistance. As time wore on, Óláfr gained the upper-hand in the struggle, and at one point had Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's son, Guðrøðr Rögnvaldsson (died 1231), blinded and castrated. The bitter conflict between the half-brothers ended with Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's treacherous death in 1229. For a brief period in 1230/1231, Óláfr co-ruled the kingdom with Guðrøðr Rögnvaldsson. When the latter was slain in 1231, Óláfr ruled the entire kingdom without any internal opposition until his own death in 1237.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, more {{information}} about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest. The sport noticeably began to spread throughout England as the century went on. By 1725, significant patrons such as Edwin Stead, Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage were forming teams of county strength in Kent and Sussex. The earliest known great players, including William Bedle and Thomas Waymark, were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous crowds and the matches were social occasions at which gambling and alcoholic drinks were additional attractions.|$|E
5|$|Mills and workers' {{settlements}} {{were established}} at Belper, Darley Abbey, and Milford by Arkwright's competitors. Arkwright-type mills were {{so successful that}} sometimes they were copied without paying royalties to Richard Arkwright. The cotton industry in the Derwent Valley went into decline in the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better position in relation to markets and raw materials. The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments. Some of the mills now contain museums and {{are open to the}} public.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the ground game, seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even more impressive {{when one considers that}} he had been suspended for the entire <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} first {{scheduled}} to begin in February, having been booked a year in advance. Nevertheless, {{not only was the}} album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), released later than expected, but many tours were already scheduled in the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. This led to the tour being delayed until summertime in North America. According to Marx, this chain of events, along with the previous mentioned unusual announcements, were some of the factors that contributed {{to the success of the}} Moonshine Jungle Tour. Notwithstanding, Marx has run successful tours with several artists during the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|A {{manuscript}} of the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (Codex Palatinus), known as P, and its {{direct and indirect}} copies. P was written at Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in this manuscript has several lacunae marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion {{in the order of}} the biographies between Verus and Alexander, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in Carus. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.|$|E
5|$|After 616, Rædwald, {{who ruled}} East Anglia during the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh century, {{was the most}} {{powerful}} of the southern Anglo-Saxon kings. In the following decades, from the reign of Sigeberht onwards, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by Mercia. Raedwald's son Eorpwald was murdered by a pagan noble soon after he was baptised in around 627, after which East Anglia reverted into paganism for three years. In the void left by the death of Rædwald, the first overlord who originated north of the Thames, the pagan Penda of Mercia, emerged to challenge the pre-eminence of the new overlord (or bretwalda), Edwin of Northumbria. The reversion of East Anglia to rule by Eorpwald's successor, the pagan Ricberht, possibly due to Mercian influence, temporarily overthrew an important pillar of Edwin's authority.|$|E

5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a normal {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton {{industry}} in the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire {{in relation to the}} raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology {{at the start of the}} 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech would run away with an overwhelming victory. Tech received the ball to begin the game, and on the game's second play, Virginia Tech's Ken Edwards ran 58 yards on a trick play for the game's first touchdown. Mississippi fumbled the ball on its first offensive play and Virginia Tech recovered the turnover. Three plays later, Tech scored another touchdown on a seven-yard run by Terry Smoot. After stopping the Rebels with their defense, Tech appeared to have another chance to score when the Hokies' Ron Davidson returned an Ole Miss punt to the Rebels' 42-yard line. Despite the excellent field position, Tech was unable to score after Hokie quarterback Al Kinkaid was sacked for a 19-yard loss. Despite the setback, Tech {{was able to keep}} Ole Miss from scoring in the first quarter and tacked on a 29-yard field goal by kicker Jack Simcsak before time came to an end in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, Tech led 170.|$|E
