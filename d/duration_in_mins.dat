40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between chronic training loads, number of exposures to maximal velocity, the distance covered at maximal velocity, percentage of maximal velocity in training and match-play and subsequent injury risk in elite Gaelic footballers. DESIGN: Prospective cohort design. METHODS: Thirty-seven elite Gaelic footballers from one elite squad were involved in a one-season study. Training and game loads (session-RPE multiplied by <b>duration</b> <b>in</b> <b>min)</b> were recorded <b>in</b> conjunction with external match and training loads (using global positioning system technology) to measure the distance covered at maximal velocity, relative maximal velocity and the number of player exposures to maximal velocity across weekly periods during the season. Lower limb injuries were also recorded. Training load and GPS data were modelled against injury data using logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated based on chronic training load status, relative maximal velocity and number of exposures to maximal velocity with these reported against the lowest reference group for these variables. RESULTS: Players who produced over 95 % maximal velocity on at least one occasion within training environments had lower risk of injury compared to the reference group of 85 % maximal velocity on at least one occasion (OR: 0. 12, p= 0. 001). Higher chronic training loads (≥ 4750 AU) allowed players to tolerate increased distances (between 90 to 120 m) and exposures to maximal velocity (between 10 to 15 exposures), with these exposures having a protective effect compared to lower exposures (OR: 0. 22 p= 0. 026) and distance (OR= 0. 23, p= 0. 055). CONCLUSIONS: Players who had higher chronic training loads (≥ 4750 AU) tolerated increased distances and exposures to maximal velocity when compared to players exposed to low chronic training loads (≤ 4750 AU). Under- and over-exposure of players to maximal velocity events (represented by a U-shaped curve) increased the risk of injury...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{regarding}} both {{acute and}} repeated cold-water immersions are limited. Most importantly, {{there is a}} paucity of information pertaining {{to the impact of}} such exposures on whole-body fluid distribution and plasma constituents. Furthermore, previous studies have not differentiated between the hydrostatic and thermal effects of water immersion. males participated in a warm-water stress test (WWST), and a 15 -d cold water acclimation programme, with cold-water stress tests (CWST) on days 1, 8 and 15, and 90 -min cold-water immersions at rest on intervening days.

The WWST and first CWST comparison allowed the hydrostatic and thermal differentiation, while repeated influences were determined from the CWST comparisons. Measurements during the stress tests included body-fluid volumes (radionuclides and Evan 2 ̆ 7 s blue dye), plasma constituents (haematocrit, haemoglobin, electrolytes, osmolality, protein, hormones), core and skin temperatures, cardiac frequency, oxygen consumption, and skin blood flow. the rest phase of the WWST, plasma volume (PV) underwent an hydrostatically-induced elevation (12...|$|R

40|$|Investigated in {{this work}} were changes in the {{concentration}} of charge carriers ne and their mobilities u, which occur {{under the influence of}} thermoannealing of n - Si and n - Ge crystals grown by the Czochralski method. Thermoannealing of n - Si samples was carried out both at 450 °C and 650 °C. The results of the influence of twostage (combined) thermoannealing have been presented. In the first series of experiments, the annealing was performed at 450 °C with varied duration (from 5 to 45 h) at the beginning, and then it was carried out for 40 hours at 650 °C. The second series of experiments was as follows: the annealing at 450 °C for 45 -hour duration, then the annealing at 650 °C, which was carried out for various periods of time (5, 10, 20, 45, 66 hours).

40|$|Abstract—The taste {{responsiveness}} of six adult squirrel monkeys to five food-associated acids {{was assessed}} in two-bottle preference tests of brief <b>duration</b> (5 <b>min).</b> <b>In</b> experiment 1 the monkeys {{were given the}} choice between tap water and defined concentrations of citric acid, ascorbic acid, malic acid, acetic acid, or tannic acid dissolved in tap water. In experiment 2 the animals were given the choice between a 50 mM sucrose solution and defined concentrations of the same acids dissolved in a 50 mM sucrose solution. With both procedures Saimiri sciureus significantly discriminated concentrations as low as 10 mM ascorbic acid and acetic acid, 5 mM citric acid and malic acid, and 0. 2 mM tannic acid from the alternative stimulus. The results showed: (1) that squirrel monkeys respond to the same range of acid concentrations as other nonhuman primate species tested so far, (2) that Saimiri sciureus detects food-associated acids at concentrations well below those present in most fruits, and (3) that the responsiveness of this New World primate to acidic tastants was largely unaffected {{by the addition of}} a sweet-tasting substance. The results support the assumption that squirrel monkeys may use sourness and/or astringency of food-associated acids as a criterion for food selection.
