5000|$|The {{amount of}} points each player was stuck with is tallied on the scorepad. In addition, each player counts {{the number of}} cards <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> and puts a penny into the money bowl for each card <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} rule about melding is that {{a player}} cannot meld {{in such a way}} so that the cards left <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> would put them over 75 points. For example, a player starts the hand with 63 points. They can only meld if they will have 12 or fewer points left <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand.</b> Moreover, whenever they draw/discard they must ensure <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> stays under 12 points.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{formation}} in 1921, the KJRM obtained four former Austro-Hungarian s that had been converted into minesweepers. Three were discarded soon after, but one served as a training vessel until the April 1941 invasion, at which time she was captured by the Italians. The Germans captured her in September 1943 and she was lost <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> some time later.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the end of}} Melissenos's revolt, it left a {{profound}} legacy: although Melissenos himself submitted to Alexios Komnenos, the towns he had occupied and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers in Ionia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Bithynia remained <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> Thus, by becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts to hold down various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and western Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|In 1449 Alexander, Lord of the Isles granted part of {{the island}} to Torquil MacNeill of Taynish, the {{remainder}} being owned by the monks of Paisley. In 1493 the whole island came under MacNeill control and it remained <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> with various brief interludes, until the 19th century. This prize was by no means without its hazards. In 1530 the notorious pirate Ailean nan Sop murdered MacNeill of Taynish and numerous island residents. A dozen years later the title deeds were lost when eleven gentlemen of Gigha were slain by raiders.|$|E

5|$|The voivodes had power {{concentrated}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> impelling the monarchs {{to replace}} them frequently: forty-three voivodes ruled between 1199 and 1288. Monarchs usually refrained from appointing as voivode noblemen who owned Transylvanian estates. Michael of the Kacsics clan was the first voivode to receive a land grant in the province, around 1210. However, these originally uninhabited lands along the upper courses of the river Mureș (Maros) were confiscated in 1228.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E

50|$|Snout! is a {{variation}} on the classic dice game Pass the Pigs. Unlike the original, players earn points by discarding cards <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand</b> matching what was rolled and getting rid of all cards <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hand,</b> rather than matching what they rolled to a point chart.

5|$|Cornwallis {{pulled back}} from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier's redoubt {{on the west side}} of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.|$|E

Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, and in July 1567, was forced to abdicate in favour of her 13-month-old son James VI. Mary eventually escaped and attempted to regain the throne by force. After her defeat at the Battle of Langside by forces loyal to the regents led by James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray in 1568, she took refuge in England, leaving her son <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> In Scotland the regents fought a civil war {{on behalf of the}} king against his mother's supporters. In England, Mary became a focal point for Catholic conspirators and was eventually tried for treason and executed on the orders of her kinswoman Elizabeth I.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{his tenure}} is {{associated}} with a major success of long-term significance, the capture of Malta. Of all the islands around Sicily, this was the last to remain in Byzantine hands, and in 869 a fleet under Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Ubaydallah ibn al-Aghlab al-Habashi attacked it. The Byzantines, having received timely reinforcements, resisted successfully at first, but in 870 Muhammad sent a fleet from Sicily to the island, and the capital Melite fell on 29 August 870. The local governor was captured, the town was plundered—Ahmad al-Habashi reportedly took along the local cathedral's marble columns to decorate his palace—and its fortifications razed. The fall of Malta had important ramifications for the defence of what remained of Byzantine Sicily: with Reggio in Calabria and now Malta <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> the Muslims completed their encirclement of the island, and could easily interdict any aid sent from the east.|$|E

Among the females, the most common trait in Malays and Chinese are the hand pattern A <b>in</b> both <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> Indian females, however, showed dominance in <b>hand</b> pattern C <b>in</b> <b>their</b> right <b>hands</b> (60 %), and hand pattern B (2 D[*]=[*] 4 D) dominated <b>in</b> <b>their</b> left <b>hands</b> (44 %). Results of the statistical analysis revealed that there was a highly significant difference in the hand patterns of both the hands when compared to gender.|$|R
5|$|Starting {{from the}} end of the 10th century Skopje {{experienced}} a period of wars and political troubles. Bulgarian capital from 972 to 992, Samuil ruled it from 976 until 1004 when its governor Roman surrendered it to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Bulgar Slayer in 1004 in exchange of the titles of patrician and strategos. Later, Skopje was briefly seized twice by Slavic insurgents who wanted to restore a Bulgarian state. At first in 1040 under Peter Delyan's command, and in 1072 under the orders of Georgi Voyteh. In 1081, Skopje was captured by Norman troops led by Robert Guiscard and the city remained <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> until 1088. Skopje was subsequently conquered by the Serbian Grand Prince Vukan in 1093, and again by the Normans four years later. However, because of epidemics and food shortage, Normans quickly surrendered to the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{refused to}} allow his slaves to be sold without their permission. This policy was {{economically}} inefficient, resulting in an unnecessarily large work force. In his will, he provided that his slaves should be freed {{after the death of}} his wife. However, Martha chose to free them at the end of 1800, fearing that her life was not safe <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> because her death would make them free. Most of the former slaves were unable to find suitable work after being freed and lived in poverty. Part of this was due to Virginia passing laws against educating blacks and restricting the rights of free blacks.|$|E

In 1427, the Byzantines, led by emperor John VIII in person, attacked the Tocco {{lands in the}} Peloponnese. After the Byzantine fleet defeated his navy, Carlo was forced to submit, and in 1428, Glarentza was handed over {{as part of the}} dowry of his niece, Maddalena, who was married to the Despot Constantine Palaiologos (the future last Byzantine emperor). When Constantine besieged Patras in 1429, a Catalan fleet that came to the city's aid captured Glarentza, forcing Constantine to ransom it back. He then destroyed its fortifications, so that it could no longer be seized and used by a western power.|$|E

After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village.

While Musashi searches for the Fire Scroll, Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and makes his way to the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is still <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind Scroll, and defeats its crest guardian in an ants' nest.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, the Malinska {{class were}} {{classified}} as minelayers. At {{the start of the}} German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, the five Malinska-class ships were assigned to the Coast Defence Command and spread over three sectors; Malinska in Selce (North Sector), Mosor and Marjan in Šibenik (Central Sector), and Mljet and Meljine in Kotor (South Sector). All five were soon captured by Italian forces, including Malinska which had been scuttled by its crew, but was raised by the Italians and commissioned as Arbe, along with Ugliano (ex-Marjan), Solta (ex-Meljine), Meleda (ex-Mljet) and Pasman (ex-Mosor). In Italian service they were known as the Arbe class, and could carry 30 mines. Following the Italian Armistice, Ugliano was taken over by German forces and probably lost <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> Pasman was also captured by the Germans, who handed it over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia. This ship was stranded on the Island of Ist on 31 December 1944, but was not scrapped until 1954.|$|E
