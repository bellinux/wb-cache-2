The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} ratio of different <b>rubber</b> <b>threads</b> on the elastic, tensile, air permeability, andfar-infrared emissivity properties ofelastic warp-knitted fabric. Polyester filaments and <b>rubber</b> <b>threads</b> were applied as warp yarns while bamboo charcoal(BC) /Nylon(NY) filament was used as weft yarn to fabricate elastic knitted fabric (EKF) by using Velcro Crochet Machine. The four different ratios of <b>rubber</b> <b>threads</b> in warp direction were 0 %, 25 %, 50 % and 100 %.

50|$|The first {{metal hose}} was {{technically}} a stripwound hose. It {{was invented in}} 1885 by the jewellery manufacturer Heinrich Witzenmann (1829-1906) of Pforzheim, Germany, together with the French engineer Eugène Levavassèur. The hose was modelled after the goose throat necklace, a piece of jewellery that consisted of interlacing metal strips. The original design of the hose {{was based on a}} helically coiled metal strip with an S-shaped profile. The profile interlocked along the windings of the helical coil. Due to a cavity between the interlocking profiles, this did not create a tight fit. The cavity was sealed by means of a <b>rubber</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The next {{breakthrough}} in golf ball development came in 1898. Coburn Haskell of Cleveland, Ohio had driven to nearby Akron, Ohio for a golf date with Bertram Work, {{the superintendent of}} the B.F. Goodrich Company. While he waited in the plant for Work, Haskell picked up some <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> and wound it into a ball. When he bounced the ball, it flew almost to the ceiling. Work suggested Haskell put a cover on the creation, {{and that was the}} birth of the 20th century wound golf ball that would soon replace the guttie bramble ball. The new design became known as the rubber Haskell golf ball. For decades, the wound rubber ball consisted of a liquid-filled or solid round core that was wound with a layer of <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> into a larger round inner core and then covered with a thin outer shell made of balata sap. The balata is a tree native to Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree is tapped and the soft, viscous fluid released is a rubber-like material similar to gutta-percha, which was found to make an ideal cover for a golf ball. Balata, however, is relatively soft. If the leading edge of a highly lofted short iron contacts a balata-covered ball in a location other than the bottom of the ball a cut or [...] "smile" [...] will often be the result, rendering the ball unfit for play in most instances.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cotton fiber {{is a type}} {{of natural}} fibers. Using natural fibers to {{fabricate}} textile can not only decrease the consumption of synthetic fibers, but also reduce the environmental pollution. This study aims to fabricate elastic knitted fabrics and evaluate their properties. Polyester (PET) filaments and <b>rubber</b> <b>threads</b> serve as the warp while cotton yarn serves as the weft for warp knitting. A crochet machine makes the warp and weft into warp knits with desirable stretchability, during which the amount (single/double) and the ply number (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -ply) of the weft are further varied. The resulting warp knits are evaluated for water absorption, air permeability, and mechanical properties. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the warp knits with single 1 -ply weft (S 1) yield an optimal air permeability of 224. 6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s and stiffness along the warp direction of 4. 74 cm.

The high BOD and COD ratio of the wastewater (0. 78 to 0. 90) indicates that the rubber wastewater is biodegradable and can be treated effectively by an anaerobic digestion process commonly employed in this industry. However, because the wastewater contained high concentrations of zinc, 250 to 310 mg/L, which could inhibit the digestion process, it was pretreated by chemical precipitation/flocculation. A treatment process using a combination of sodium sulfide and polyelectrolyte LT 27 at concentrations of 800 and 5 mg/L, respectively, is the most cost-effective system for zinc removal from the wastewater Zinc removal by sodium sulfide is not affected by pH.

50|$|Indonesian rubber {{industry}} take its root in colonial Dutch East Indies; {{in the early}} 20th century the rubber plantation in the colony was booming, largely owed to the advent of natural rubber tire industry to supply the growing automotive industry in the United States and Europe. Currently, Indonesia's rubber production is the world's second-largest after Thailand. Natural rubber is an important export commodity that earn foreign exchange, with increasing production trend. In fact, ASEAN nations are among the largest natural rubber producers; the combined rubber yield of three ASEAN members — Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia — accounts for nearly 66 percent of global total rubber production. However, compared to neighbouring countries, Indonesia's productivity level is lower (1,080 kg/ha), compared to Thailand (1,800 kg/ha), Vietnam (1,720 kg/ha) and Malaysia (1,510 kg/ha). Smallholder farmers in Indonesia retain for about 85 percent of total rubber estates, which suggests the minor role of government and large private estates in Indonesian {{rubber industry}}. Another problem {{is the lack of}} rubber processing facilities and manufacturing industry.

40|$|A {{numerical}} two-phase approach, {{based on}} experimental curometer charts and aimed at predicting the optimal production line parameters (exposition time and cure temperature) for <b>extruded</b> thick <b>rubber</b> items cured with accelerated sulphur is presented. In the first phase, a simple kinetic model {{based on the}} actual reticulation reactions occurring during sulphur curing is utilized to fit experimental curometer data. The model is able to predict the degree of crosslinking at successive curing times and at different controlled temperatures and it requires the calibration of only three kinetic constants. The variation of such parameters with temperature is then evaluated by means of three experimental cure curves performed at three different temperatures. Both the case of indefinite increase of the torque and reversion can be handled. In the second phase, considering the same rubber compound of step one, kinetic reaction parameters are implemented in a Finite Element (FE) software, specifically developed to perform thermal analyses on complex 2 D geometries. As an example, an extruded cylindrical thick EPDM item is considered and meshed through four-noded isoparametric plane elements. Several FE simulations are repeated by changing exposition time tc and external cure temperature Tn, to evaluate for each (tc,Tn) couple the corresponding mechanical properties of the item {{at the end of}} the thermal treatment.

40|$|Various {{characteristics}} of wheat gluten proteins, such as availability, unique intrinsic properties and biodegradability, make them attractive candidates for designing sustainable materials. The unique functionality of wheat gluten stems from its very high molar mass {{and the presence}} of cysteine amino acid residues, which upon heating provide the polymeric system with intermolecular disulfide crosslinks. Here, we demonstrate that with the use of proper additives one can obtain gluten based materials with properties that range from stiff to rubbery. A stiff material was produced by compression molding gluten with low levels of plasticizer. Routes for improving the ductility of the stiff material by manipulating the native protein structure were explored. In contrast, a rubbery thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) material was produced by <b>extruding</b> a gluten <b>rubber</b> precursor with a thermoplastic polymer, and subsequently injection molding to give a final product. Adhesion between the two phases was optimized by reactive compatibilization. The mechanical performance of stiff gluten materials was significantly improved by processing the proteins in denaturing conditions prior to molding. Molecular entanglements and polymer secondary interactions appeared to be increased and the material exhibited strain hardening under compressive loads. The TPV material had a finely dispersed particle morphology and showed excellent elongation in tensile tests as well as good mechanical recovery. Proteins are complex macromolecules with inherent folded structures, a diverse mix of functional monomers and a vulnerability towards degradation at high temperatures. With this in mind, polymer processing approaches need to be adapted and tailored in order to realize the potential of protein based materials. We have shown that high modulus materials approaching engineering polystyrene, as well as elastomers for the ‘soft touch’ industry, can be produced from a common protein feedstock.
