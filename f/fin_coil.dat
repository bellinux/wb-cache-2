40|$|ABSTRACT The {{need for}} more {{efficient}} air conditioning systems requires an in depth understanding about the performance of its components. One of the key components in the air conditioning plant is the fin-and-tube cooling coil, which is investigated here. The main focus {{of the work is}} concerned with the analysis of fin-and-tube cooling coils having two classes of passive enhancement techniques known as corrugated and turbulated fins with particular reference of developing flow region. Initially, two-dimensional modelling was done to establish the scope of later three-dimensional modelling in terms of dominant variables, meshing strategies and convergence criteria. The results gave key insights into required modelling strategies needed for the more complex three-dimensional problem of the composite fin-and-tube cooling coil. Three-dimensional CFD modelling of fin-and-tube cooling coils having turbulated, corrugated and flat-fin geometries have been investigated with particular reference to the dry-hot arid climate. Five modelling approaches have been considered based on an isothermal fin-and-tube, periodic boundaries, conjugate heat transfer, tube-row temperature gradient and the effect of manufacturing defects. The last three approaches are novel contributions to this field of research. The influences of the key design parameters of fin pitch, fin material, and fin thickness have also been investigated parametrically for all fin types. To provide confidence in these models, experimental studies on these cooling coils were carried out to acquire data for comparison between the predicted and measured values of heat transfer and friction, and to investigate the effect of range of design conditions on the cooling coils performance. The detailed results of this work can be used to optimise the air-conditioning coil designs. The turbulated <b>fin</b> <b>coil</b> was found to give the highest values of Nusselt number at given friction factor followed by the corrugated <b>fin</b> <b>coil.</b> At a given pressure drop (dP = 52 N/m 2 corresponding to 14, = 2. 3 m/s), the heat transfer coefficient of the corrugated and turbulated fin coils was higher than that of flat fin by 16 % and 36 % respectively. For typical operating conditions, the corrugated and turbulated fin coils required core volumes of 19 % and 40 % less than that of flat <b>fin</b> <b>coil</b> respectively for the same performance. The cooling coils employing corrugated and turbulated fin geometries contribute significantly to the energy conservation and volume reduction of the air conditioning plant...|$|E
40|$|Demands {{for higher}} energy {{efficiencies}} in both {{residential and commercial}} refrigeration and air conditioning systems {{have resulted in a}} trend toward heat exchanger designs that are more compact with higher capacities for heat transfer. Traditional copper tube/aluminum <b>fin</b> <b>coil</b> manufacturing technology remains prevalent throughout the industry and, when modified for smaller diameter copper tubes of 5 mm or less, significant improvements in heat transfer can be achieved. When coupled with internal enhancements to the copper tubes such as microgrooves, coil designs can be smaller, more efficient and less costly. Using a commercially available heat exchanger design and simulation software and CFD modeling, this paper compares optimized 3 -ton air conditioning condenser coils manufactured with small-diameter internally enhanced copper tubes against condensers with aluminum microchannel tubes. Simulated operating conditions are held constant, including refrigerant inlet pressure and temperature, as well as air flow rate and inlet temperature. Comparisons of material consumption, refrigerant charge, volume, and heat transfer performance are demonstrated. It was found that using internally enhanced copper tubes with a diameter of 5 mm, condenser coils can be designed to operate with less refrigerant charge and have the potential to be lighter and more compact than commercially available, optimized aluminum coil designs with microchannel tubes...|$|E

Both scopes are pursued through the analysis of a case study, a system with nominal cooling capacity of about 74 kW at 35 ◦C dry-bulb outdoor air temperature and a nominal heating capacity of about 70 kW at 2 ◦C dry-bulb and 1 ◦C wet-bulb ambient temperature. The performance of the two refrigerants inside a “real” machine is simulated by means of an advanced numerical model of a packaged reversible refrigeration unit. The system consists of a single refrigerating circuit with two identical scroll compressors. The compressor was characterized by its experimental performance curve according to Standard EN 12900 (EN 2013 a) for both R 410 A and R 32. Off-the-shelf copper tubes and louvered aluminum fins were considered for the condenser and typical brazed-plate heat exchanger for the evaporator of the chiller configuration. The <b>finned</b> <b>coil</b> heat exchanger was first thermodynamically optimized for R 410 A and R 32 for both condenser and evaporator operation with regard to the number of internal circuits according to the total temperature penalization performance evaluation criteria (Cavallini et al. 2010; Brown et al. 2013), without changing the overall heat exchanger dimensions. The effect of <b>finned</b> <b>coil</b> circuit length on the performance of the investigated reversible unit with the two refrigerants was then analyzed at nominal design conditions and under a seasonal perspective.

A quantitative membrane filter method {{was used to assess}} desiccation resistance over a 24 h period. The method proved to be a reliable and inexpensive means of quantitatively assessing desiccation resistance in bacterial isolates. Five pink-pigmented budding rod (PPBR) isolates, related to Methylobacterium, were resistant to desiccation over the test period (47 - 100 % of original viable cfu were recoverable on R 3 A agar after 24 h desiccation). Methylobacterium-like PPBRs represented the dominant culturable members of the <b>coil</b> <b>fin</b> biofilm community. An unidentified Gram-negative filamentous rod was also somewhat desiccation-resistant (45 % of original viable cfu were recoverable or, R 3 A agar after 24 h desiccation).

40|$|A {{multi-port}} extruded (MPE) aluminium flat tube {{air heat}} exchanger was compared to a round tube <b>finned</b> <b>coil</b> (FC). The MPE heat exchanger has parallel flow vertical tube configuration with headers in horizontal position and conventional folded louvred fins. The two heat exchangers were mounted on a 10 kW cooling capacity R 410 A packaged air heat pump. They were sized to approximately obtain the same cooling and heating capacities in chiller and heating mode, respectively. Climatic room steady state tests without frosting phenomena occurring during heat pump operation, demonstrated that the round tube and the flat tube heat exchanger performance are comparable. The MPE heat exchanger was tested with different refrigerant inlet distributor/outlet tubes configurations to investigate the effect of liquid refrigerant distribution. Cycling frosting/defrosting operations were tested with two equivalent machines placed in parallel outdoor and working at full load condition, one of the units was equipped with the MPE heat exchanger while the other mounted a standard <b>finned</b> <b>coil.</b> Penalization factors were analytically introduced to evaluate frosting associated heating energy and energy efficiency degradation. Test results indicate that both the heat pumps are penalized by frost formation but both the penalization factors are higher for the MPE-unit than the FC-unit one in the - 6 to 4 °C air dry bulb temperature range. For the two units, a roughly linear dependence of the heating energy penalization factor and of the energy efficiency factor from the difference between outdoor air and saturated air at the evaporation temperature humidity ratio can be pointed out...|$|R

Off-the-shelf copper tubes and louvered aluminium fins were considered for the condenser and typical brazed plate configurations for the evaporator. The <b>finned</b> <b>coil</b> condenser and the brazed plate heat exchanger evaporator were modelled by an elementary finite volumes technique, previously validated in other papers; for each volume the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop were calculated using semi-empirical correlations chosen among the most accurate ones available in the open literature.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{increasing}} global {{pressure to}} phase out CFC‘s and HFC‘s has resulted in research focusing again {{on the use of}} natural refrigerants. CO 2 is one alternative that has very good thermal-fluid characteristics. However, a low critical point of 31. 1 and 73. 2 summons some challenges in the use of CO 2 in vapour compression heat pump cycles. This necessitates the implementation of a trans-critical cycle, generating much higher pressures than conventional heat pumps. The development of these trans-critical CO 2 heat pumps requires research and technical improvements in their components. One such component is the <b>finned</b> <b>coil</b> evaporator used to transfer energy from air to the refrigerant. To aid in the design and development of this component, simulation models are required. However, the accuracy of these models depends strongly on the empirical correlations implemented, and therefore the use of accurate heat transfer and pressure drop correlations are important. Since CO 2 has some unique thermal-fluid characteristics, heat transfer and pressure drop correlations are still a prime research specific. Thus, the present study aimed to develop a simulation model that incorporates current and accurate refrigerant-, and moist air-, heat transfer and pressure drop correlations. Using the NIST software package, EVAP-COND, verification of the simulation model were achieved, where the largest difference in the prediction of heat transfer rate was 1. 7 % with EVAP-COND as reference. The discrepancies are attributed to the updated correlations used in the present study. The developed model predicted 92. 6 % of the EVAP-COND predictions, to within ± 20 %. The installation of a fully instrumented <b>finned</b> <b>coil</b> heat exchanger was done to upgrade an existing test bench. This enabled the generation of experimental data for a number of operating conditions and the validation of the simulation model with a maximum difference in heat transfer rate of 8. 7 %. However, the amount of lubricant in the system had significant detrimental effects on the heat transfer coefficient. A first order attempt at the implementation of a degradation factor in a modified simulation model had some success. In addition, large measurement uncertainties resulted in the experimental latent heat transfer rate data being disregarded. The simulation of five extra RH conditions in EVAP-COND and the developed simulation served as an addition to the experimental conditions, which showed that the simulation agrees with the trend of an increase in inlet relative humidity as reported from literature. The simulation model was able to predict 82 % of the experimental data to within ± 20 %. The developed simulation identified dehumidification to occur under the same conditions as EVAP-COND. Also, the developed simulation calculates the saturation point in the same vicinity as found in both EVAP-COND and the experimental data.

Also, the tighter fin spacing is less tolerant to frost growth that can block air flow over time.

On the other hand, electronic expansion valves (EEVs) are commonly used in heat pump/refrigeration systems, including ASHP units, as throttle regulators of refrigerant flow. This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the performance of a reverse cycle defrost operation for a 6. 5. kW experimental heating capacity residential ASHP whose outdoor coil had four-parallel refrigerant circuits, and with an EEV as the refrigerant flow throttle regulator. The detailed descriptions of the experimental ASHP unit and the experimental procedures of ASHP are firstly presented. This is followed by reporting the comparative experiments of two control strategies for the EEV to investigate their effects on defrosting performance: the EEV being fully open and the EEV being regulated by a degree of refrigerant superheat (DS) controller. Experimental results revealed that when the EEV was regulated by the DS controller during defrosting, a higher defrosting efficiency and less heat wastage would be resulted in.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit {{operates}} in heating mode, frost can be accumulated {{on the surface}} of its <b>finned</b> outdoor <b>coil</b> which normally has multiple parallel circuits on its refrigerant side for minimized refrigerant pressure loss and enhanced heat transfer efficiency. On its airside, however, there is usually no segmentation corresponding to the number of refrigerant circuit. Frosting deteriorates the operation and energy efficiency of the ASHP unit and periodic defrosting becomes necessary. Currently the most widely used standard defrosting method for ASHPs is reverse cycle defrost. This paper, the first part of a two-part series, reports on the experimental part of a study of the reverse cycle defrosting performance on a multi-circuit outdoor coil unit in an experimental 6. 5. kW heating capacity residential ASHP unit. Firstly the experimental ASHP unit is described and experimental procedures detailed. Secondly, the experimental results are reported. This is followed by the discussion on the effects of downwards flowing of the melted frost along a multi-circuit outdoor coil surface on defrosting performance. Finally, the evaluation of the defrosting efficiency for the experimental ASHP unit is provided. In {{the second part of the}} series, a modeling analysis on the effects of downwards flowing of the melted frost along the multi-circuit outdoor coil surface on defrosting performance of the experimental ASHP unit will be presented.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a miniature Joule-Thomson cryocooler depends {{on the effectiveness of}} the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger used in such cryocooler is Hampson-type recuperative heat exchanger. The design of the efficient heat exchanger is crucial for the optimum {{performance of}} the cryocooler. In the present work, the heat exchanger is numerically simulated for the steady state conditions and the results are validated against the experimental data available from the literature. The area correction factor is identified for the calculation of effective heat transfer area which takes into account the effect of helical geometry. In order to get an optimum performance of the cryocoolers, operating parameters like mass flow rate, pressure and design parameters like heat exchanger length, helical diameter of <b>coil,</b> <b>fin</b> dimensions, fin density have to be identified. The present work systematically addresses this aspect of design for miniature J-T cryocooler. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} the role of filtration in maintaining clean heat exchanger coils and overall performance. Combinations of 6 different levels of filtration (MERV 14, 11, 8, 6, 4, and no filter) and 4 different coils (an eight-row lanced-fin coil, HX 8 L), (an eight-row wavy-fin coil, HX 8 W), (a four-row lanced-fin coil, HX 4 L) and (a two-row lanced-fin coil, HX 2 L) were tested at 4 different air velocities (1. 52, 2. 03, 2. 54, 3. 05 m/s (300, 400, 500, 600 ft/min)). The fouled conditions were obtained after injection of 600 grams of ASHRAE standard dust upstream of the filter/coil combination. This magnitude of dust is representative of a year of normal operation for an air conditioning system. The air-side pressure drops of the coils and filters and air-side heat transfer coefficients of the coils were determined from the measurements under the clean and fouled conditions. Depending upon the filter and coil test, the coil pressure drops increased in the range of 6 %- 30 % for an air velocity at 2. 54 m/s (500 ft/min). The impact was significantly greater for tests performed without a filter. The largest relative effect of fouling on pressure drop occurs for coils with fewer rows and having lanced <b>fins.</b> <b>Coils</b> with a greater number of rows can hold more dust so that a fixed amount of dust has a relatively smaller impact. The impact of fouling on air-side heat transfer coefficients was found to be relatively small. In some cases, heat transfer was actually enhanced due to additional turbulence caused by the presence of dust. The experimental results for pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients were correlated and the correlations were implemented within computer models of prototypical rooftop air conditioners and used to evaluate the impact of fouling on cooling capacity and EER. The equipment cooling capacity is reduced with fouling primarily because of a decrease in air flow due to the increase pressure drop rather than due to changes in h eat transfer coefficient. In most cases, the EER was reduced with fouling primarily due to increased fan power. However, the changes in EER were relatively small, in the range of 1 %- 9 % (10 %). For most cases, equipment having low efficiency filters had higher EER after fouling than equipment with high efficiency filters, because the high efficiency filter caused significantly higher pressure drops than the low efficiency filters. The extra filter pressure drop outweighed the reduced coil pressure drop after fouling. The impact of fan efficiency curves was also investigated in the study. The energy penalty associated with high efficiency filters was reduced considerably with higher efficiency fans. There is an energy penalty associated with the use of high efficiency filtration. However, the primary reason for selecting high efficiency filters for a particular application would be improved air quality. For HX 8 L, the quantity of dust passing through the coil with a MERV 4 filter was approximately 30 times the dust passing the coil with a MERV 14 filter. Without an upstream filter, the quantity of dust passing through the coil was approximately 60 times the value for a MERV 14 filter...|$|R
