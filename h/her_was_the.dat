5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

25|$|After {{a winter}} of {{relative}} inactivity, the Romanian Navy took some defensive measures {{as well as}} performing warship upgrades, the monitors being fitted to fire French 120 mm rounds, which gave their main guns a range of up to 11 km. In July 1917, the Romanian monitors took part in an intense bombardment of Bulgarian-occupied Tulcea. The bombardment caused significant losses, and the monitors fired until all enemy artillery batteries {{in and around the}} city were silenced, suffering light damage themselves. The bombardment lasted several days, and on the last day, 26 July, Mihail Kogălniceanu was struck and damaged by a howitzer shell. She had no casualties, but this for <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> baptism of fire.|$|E
25|$|At Jekyll's {{first meeting}} with Lutyens in 1889 she invited him to Munstead Wood, and their {{collaboration}} began. They explored the local vernacular architecture, gathering ideas {{for the construction of}} Jekyll's house. His first building for <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Hut, a cottage built in the grounds of Munstead Wood in 1895. Jekyll used this as a workshop, and lived in it until Lutyens completed the main house in 1897. While the house was still being built, Lutyens obtained another, larger commission in Surrey, Orchards, {{as a result of his}} future clients being impressed with Munstead Wood when they happened to walk past the construction site. Jekyll lived at Munstead Wood until her death in 1932.|$|E

500|$|Born {{in about}} 1565, Robert Keyes {{was the son}} of the Protestant Rector of Staveley in North Derbyshire.

[...] Keyes' first cousin Elizabeth Tyrrwhitt was married to another member of the plot, Ambrose Rookwood. [...] By 1604, Robert had converted to Catholicism. [...] His wife Christina, a widow when he married <b>her,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> governess for the children of Henry Mordaunt, 4th Baron Mordaunt, at Drayton in Northamptonshire, and for this Keyes gained the use of horses and other amenities.|$|E
500|$|As a {{very private}} man, Longfellow did not often add autobiographical {{elements}} to his poetry. Two notable exceptions are dedicated {{to the death of}} members of his family. [...] "Resignation" [...] was written {{as a response to the}} death of his daughter Fanny in 1848; it does not use first-person pronouns and is instead a generalized poem of mourning. The death of his second wife Frances, as biographer Charles Calhoun wrote, deeply affected Longfellow personally but [...] "seemed not to touch his poetry, at least directly". His memorial poem to <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sonnet [...] "The Cross of Snow" [...] and was not published in his lifetime.|$|E

Atchison liked Palmer's acting, but the major factor in {{choosing}} <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fact that at only age ten Palmer already had a profound interpretation of the script. He chose her as he did not want a kid whom he would command but instead someone with whom he could have a collaboration: someone who would understand the role and [...] "would make this character her own." [...] He just assisted her to fully ensure that she would understand the character's feelings and would make [...] "the right emotional choices." ...|$|E

Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for [...] "collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years". Having played her part in the deaths of her mother, brother, and sister, Jennet Device may eventually have found herself accused of witchcraft. A woman with that name was listed in a group of 20 tried at Lancaster Assizes on 24 March 1634, although it cannot be certain that it was the same Jennet Device. The charge against <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> murder of Isabel Nutter, William Nutter's wife. In that series of trials the chief prosecution witness was a ten-year-old boy, Edmund Robinson. All but one of the accused were found guilty, but the judges refused to pass death sentences, deciding instead to refer the case to the king, Charles I. Under cross-examination in London, Robinson admitted that he had fabricated his evidence, but even though four of the accused were eventually pardoned, they all remained incarcerated in Lancaster Gaol, where it is likely that they died. An official record dated 22 August 1636 lists Jennet Device as one of those still held in the prison. These later Lancashire witchcraft trials were the subject of a contemporary play written by Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome, The Late Lancashire Witches.|$|E
