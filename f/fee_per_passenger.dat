50|$|Shared buses or vans are {{available}} in many more developed countries connecting frequent destinations, charging a fixed <b>fee</b> <b>per</b> <b>passenger.</b> The most common case is a connection between an airport and central city locations. These services are often known as shuttles. Such services usually use smaller vehicles than normal buses, and often operate on demand. An air traveller can contact the shuttle company by telephone or Internet, not necessarily in advance; the company will ensure that a shuttle is provided without unreasonable delay. The shuttle will typically connect one airport with several large hotels, or addresses in a specified area of the city. The shuttle offers much of the convenience of a taxi, although taking longer, at a price which is significantly lower {{for one or two}} passengers. Scheduled services between an airport and a hotel, usually operated by the hotel, are also called shuttles.|$|E
50|$|The {{runway and}} taxiway {{resurfacing}} and improvement projects were funded with FAA Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants covering 95% of project costs. In 2010 the FAA contribution towards airport projects was $27,267,000. The 5% local match came from BLI Passenger Facility Charge accounts. FAA AIP grants also {{have contributed to}} the acquisition of additional Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment, Aircraft de-ice equipment and other surface projects. The BLI PFC <b>fee</b> <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> is currently at the FAA mandated maximum of $4.50 per enplaned passenger. The Terminal and ramp expansion projects are not AIP eligible as they are revenue generating facilities for the airport. The Port of Bellingham issues Revenue Bonds for $31,719,550 to pay for the terminal expansion. The debt service for the bonds also comes from BLI PFC accounts. In this way, the users of the airport facilities are the ones actually paying for the facility.|$|E
500|$|The flying service {{charged a}} <b>fee</b> of $36 <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> {{for the flight}} on the 1947 single-engined, V-tailed Beechcraft 35 Bonanza (registration [...] ), which could seat three {{passengers}} plus the pilot. A popular misconception, originating from Don McLean's eponymous song about the crash, was that the plane was called American Pie. In fact, no record exists of any name ever having been given to N3794N.|$|R
50|$|SD 240 {{begins in}} Wall at exit 110 of Interstate 90 (I-90). From this point, it travels south to Badlands National Park, where it turns southeast. At the Badlands Headquarters at Cedar Pass, the highway turns northeast, ending at exit 131 of I-90 near Cactus Flat. The total length of SD 240 is {{approximately}} 40 mi. Because the route enters a national park, {{there is an}} entrance fee charged along the highway at either entrance to the park. The <b>fee</b> is $15 <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> vehicle, good for 7 days.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the interaction between}} airports and airline companies {{taking into account the}} evolution of air transport in the last decades and an approach to integrated quality of service. Traditionally airport management, just like all transport infrastructure management, use to look at airlines as their primary customers, due to their legally binding agreements and because airlines pay for several charges, such as landing and parking <b>fees,</b> charges <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> or tonne of freight handled, etc. Airlines, in turn, have legally binding agreements with passengers and look at passengers as their primary clients. In their unconscious business models airports used to see themselves as providers of an high technological demanding infrastructure, of national strategic interest, for very sophisticated operations where safety played both a very distinguished and distinct role. This paper challenges this traditional airport model and discusses a renewed business model for airports. This renewed model maintains the key functions of an airport but is built in the concept of quality of service as an interactive process that encompasses all agents engaged in the provision of the service...|$|R
25|$|Until it was {{required}} to sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports, Heathrow Airport Holdings held a dominant position in the London aviation market, and has been heavily regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) {{as to how much}} it can charge airlines to land. The annual increase in landing charge <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> was capped at inflation minus 3% until 1 April 2003. From 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5% per year, taking the <b>fee</b> to £9.28 <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> in 2007. In March 2008, the CAA announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5% to £12.80 from 1 April 2008 and by inflation plus 7.5% for each of the following four years. In April 2013, the CAA announced a proposal for Heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3%, continuing until 2019. Whilst the cost of landing at Heathrow is determined by the CAA and Heathrow Airport Holdings, the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL).|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Horry County {{sued the}} {{operator}} of SunCruz Aquasino for breach of contract, alleging that SunCruz {{had failed to}} make payments to Horry County for passenger fees received during the months of August and September 2011. Horry County was supposed to receive a <b>fee</b> of $7 <b>per</b> <b>passenger</b> instead, of collecting taxes based on the boat's revenue. The suit asked for $165,000 in back payments plus legal costs. [...] Aquasino asserted they had stopped making payments due to the county not enforcing a ban on illegal gambling, which was {{also part of the}} agreement. The company's position was that it had protested the boarding fees from the beginning of their relationship with the county, stating they were onerous. Even so, they had continued to pay those fees in good faith. However, when the county {{did not seem to be}} doing enough regarding the illegal gambling, they suspended payments, entering into negotiations with the county to reach a compromise. It was during these negotiations when the county filed its lawsuit.|$|R

50|$|At {{that time}} Anderson was {{fighting}} {{one of her}} many fare wars, this one with the Canadian steamboat Otter.
