Thus, Invisalign offers less pain compared to the traditional edgewise treatment; however, problems such as tray deformation must be carefully checked in the use of Invisalign.|$|R
40|$|Background: Cost and {{environmental}} pollution are two prime concerns with general anesthesia. We hypothesized that target-controlled (TC) anesthesia {{drug delivery system}} also called as end-tidal (ET) control is an effective and safe system that would reduce the cost and also environmental pollution. Materials and Methods: We studied 200 patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgeries and randomly distributed those in 2 groups of 100 each, TC and manual-controlled (MC) group. We reviewed the two groups in term of consumption of gases, time required to achieve the ET concentration of sevoflurane of 1. 5 %, maximum inspired concentration of sevoflurane achieved, and number of adjustments required to maintain the depth of anesthesia. Results: We found that the consumption of nitrous oxide and sevoflurane was significantly less in TC group than MC group (P < 0. 05), oxygen consumption was also less in TC group but not statistically significant. The time required to achieve the desired levels, maximum inspired sevoflurane concentration achieved, {{and the number of}} drug <b>delivery</b> <b>adjustments</b> required were statistically significant in TC group (P < 0. 05). As the consumption reduced in TC group, the cost of the inhalational anesthesia reduced by approximately Rs. 64 /h ($ 1. 12) and thus the environmental pollution. Conclusion: We concluded from our study that ET control is a good system for conserving the consumption of gases and thus is efficient as it reduces both the cost and the environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{children}} {{around the world are}} being born by surgical delivery, or cesarean section. Concerns over rising rates of cesareans have focused on the risk of death and medical complications associated with surgical delivery but have largely neglected psychosocial and behavioral factors that affect and are affected by cesarean delivery. We summarize research which indicates that women who deliver by cesarean section have more negative perceptions of their birth experience, their selves, and their infants, exhibit poorer parenting behaviors, and may be at higher risk for postpartum mood disturbance compared to women delivering infants vaginally. We also review evidence that suggests that cesareans adversely influence women's moods and perceptions by restricting the control that they can exercise over birth and by violating expectations about childbirth. Based on these findings, we recommend ways to reduce the aversiveness of cesareans, offer recommendations for future research, and discuss implications of escalating rates of cesareans, including medically non-indicated cesareans by request.

The aim of this study was to determine maternal nutritional status during second trimester of pregnancy and its association with preterm delivery (< 34 weeks gestation) in Iranian women. In a large scale longitudinal study, 1033 pregnant women were recruited from prenatal clinics since December 2012 to June 2013. Dietary intake was assessed by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in pregnant women of 14 to 20 weeks gestational age. The participants were followed up until delivery. Dietary intake of women with preterm delivery was compared with women who had term delivery. The results show that 61. 2 % of women were primiparous and that the incidence of preterm delivery was 7 %.

40|$|The Hydraulic {{performance}} of structures provided for regulation in irrigation canals {{is influenced by}} many parameters such as type of flow control, type and frequency of adjustments, and topographical features of sub-systems that they are installed. The irrigation systems in Sri Lanka mostly designed for up-stream discharge control operation, with manually/mechanically adjusted gated structures, under steady state flow conditions. Further, topographical features of many gravity irrigation systems are varying at sub-system level due to presence of single and double bank reaches, inclusion of in-lined storage tanks. However, irrigation systems are operated under varying flow regime due to scheduled or unscheduled flows in water <b>delivery.</b> The <b>adjustments</b> of gates in structures in such situations are done by manually/mechanically by operators at different frequencies. Therefore these situations are analyzed by hydraulic simulations using SIC hydraulic model for three different topographical sub-systems under different frequency of adjustments.

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} in smart healthcare are only possible if a multidisciplinary approach {{is taken to}} the design, implementation, and application of technology in their respective social context. Pregnant women living with type 1 diabetes (PWT 1 D) face a series of challenges including ongoing management of diet and physical activity, continued <b>delivery</b> and <b>adjustment</b> of insulin doses. These women often feel socially and geographically isolated, due to the rarity of their condition, the paucity of accurate personal healthcare information, {{and the demands of}} a high-risk pregnancy. ITenabled smartpumps which allow information to be shared between women with type 1 diabetes and their healthcare team, are one possible solution to this problem. This paper highlights the adoption and application of IT-enabled smartpumps by PWT 1 D.

The objective was to study the maternal sociodemographics and foetal characteristics associated with premature delivery. There were 387 cases selected universally and 387 controls selected by using systematic random sampling involving every 13 cases. The patients were women who had delivered their babies before 37 completed weeks, while the control were women who had term deliveries during the same period. Data were collected using structured questionnaire through secondary data. Results showed that having multiple pregnancies (OR= 8. 33, 95 CI: 2. 91, 23. 84), congenital abnormality (OR= 4. 6, 95 CI: 0. 98, 21. 84) and intrauterine growth retardation (OR= 15. 59, 95 CI: 3. 69, 65. 82) were the risk factors of premature delivery.

40|$|Background: Emergency {{referral}} services (ERS) {{are being}} strengthened in India to improve access for institutional delivery. We evaluated a publicly financed and privately delivered model of ERS in Punjab state, India, to assess its extent and pattern of utilization, impact on institutional delivery, quality and unit cost. Methods: Data for almost 0. 4 million calls received from April 2012 to March 2013 was analysed {{to assess the}} extent and pattern of utilization. Segmented linear regression was used to analyse month-wise data on number of institutional deliveries in public sector health facilities from 2008 to 2013. We inspected ambulances in 2 districts against the Basic Life Support (BLS) standards. Timeliness of ERS was assessed for determining quality. Finally, we computed economic cost of implementing ERS from a health system perspective. Results: On an average, an ambulance transported 3 – 4 patients per day. Poor and those {{farther away from the}} health facility had a higher likelihood of using the ambulance. Although the ERS had an abrupt positive effect on increasing the institutional deliveries in the unadjusted model, there was no effect on institutional <b>delivery</b> after <b>adjustment</b> for autocorrelation.

40|$|New {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) have been introduced in the government sector throughout the world in the past 10 - 20 years in an attempt to achieve greater operational efficiency and effectiveness. The benefits of ICTs include faster, streamlined administrative processing; lower transaction costs; better use of information resources; greater public access to government {{information and}} services; and more opportunities for public participation in democratic processes. These changes are often heralded by e-government commentators as "transformative'. This implies that technical innovation will deliver business benefits and produce radical change in the way that government agencies are organised to service parliament and the public. That is, a change in state sector governance arrangements. This thesis examines the concept of 'transformation' in the New Zealand state sector context with a view to determining the form and nature of governance changes that may occur as a consequence of e-government implementation. Two streams of empirical data gathering have been completed. These provide data on how e-government initiatives are currently being implemented in New Zealand, and the impact senior public officials and public management experts consider e-government will have in the future. A Weberian analytical framework is used to identify the nature of changes that occur as a consequence of e-government initiatives, and where changes may occur in the current public sector governance model. The empirical evidence suggests that e-government will have two transformational effects in New Zealand: instrumental and systemic. These effects will occur as public officials use ICTs to increase operational efficiency and effectiveness; develop broad-based collaboration and co-production working arrangements; and expand the resources available to government to address policy issues and <b>delivery</b> services. <b>Adjustments</b> to current governance arrangements are required to position public officials to use communication technologies effectively in the future.

40|$|Both {{increasing}} women’s {{autonomy and}} increasing husbands’ involvement in maternal health care are promising strategies to enhance maternal health care utilization. However, these two {{may be at}} odds with each other insofar as autonomouswomenmay not seek their husband’s involvement, and involved husbands may limit women’s autonomy. This study assessed the relationship between women’s autonomy and husbands’ involvement in maternal health care. Field work for this study was carried out during SeptembereNovember 2011 in the Kailali district of Nepal. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used to investigate the extent of husbands’ involvement in maternal health care. A survey was carried out among 341 randomly selectedwomenwho delivered a live baby within one year prior to the survey. The results showthat husbandswere involved in giving advice, supporting to reduce the householdwork burden, and makingfinancial and transportation arrangements for the <b>delivery.</b> After <b>adjustment</b> for other covariates, economic autonomy was associated with lower likelihood of discussion with husband during pregnancy, while domestic decision-making autonomy was associated with both lower likelihood of discussion with husband during pregnancy and the husband’s presence at antenatal care (ANC) visits. Movement autonomy was associated with lower likelihood of the husband’s presence at ANC visits. Intra-spousal communication was associated with higher likelihood of discussing health with the husband during pregnancy, birth preparedness, and the husbands’ presence at the health facility delivery. The magnitude and direction of association varied per autonomy dimension. These findings suggest that programs to improve the women’s autonomy and at the sametimeincrease the husband’s involvement should be carefully planned. Despite the traditional cultural beliefs that go against the involvement of husbands, Nepalese husbands are increasingly entering into the area of maternal health which was traditionally considered ‘women’s business’...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether women's sociodemographic characteristics are independently associated with cesarean delivery. METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of hospital discharge data for singleton first births in California in 1991. RESULTS. After insurance and personal, community, medical, and hospital characteristics had been controlled, Blacks were 24 % more likely to undergo cesarean delivery than Whites; only among low-birthweight and county hospital births were Blacks not at a significantly elevated risk. Among women who resided in substantially non-English-speaking communities, who delivered high-birthweight babies, or who gave birth at for-profit hospitals, cesarean delivery appeared to be more likely among non-Whites and was over 40 % more likely among Blacks than among Whites. CONCLUSIONS. The findings cannot establish causation, but the significant racial/ethnic disparities in <b>delivery</b> mode, despite <b>adjustment</b> for social, economic, medical, and hospital factors, suggest inappropriate influences on clinical decision making that would not be addressed by changes in reimbursement. If practice variations among providers are involved, de facto racial differences in access to optimal care may be indicated.

We examined whether allelic variants of the innate immune receptors toli-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD 2), that impair the inflammatory response to endotexin are related to preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Methods and Finding: We determined five common mutations in TLR 4 (D 299 G and T 399 I and NOD 2 (R 70 W, G 908 R and L 1007 fs) in 340 primiparous women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia, of whom 177 women developed HELLP syndrome and in 113 women with a history of only uneventful pregnancies as controls. In addition, we assessed plasma levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6 soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor in a subset of 214 women included at least six months after <b>delivery.</b> After <b>adjustment</b> for maternal age and chronic hypertension, attenuating allelic variants of TLR 4 were more common in women with a history of early onset preeclampsia than in controls (OR 2. 9 [95 % CI 1. 2 - 6. 7]). Highest frequencies for TLR 4 variants were observed in women who developed HELLP syndrome (adjusted OR 4. 1 [9. 5 % CI 1. 7 - 9. 8]). In addition, high levels of interleukin- 6 and fibrinogen were associated with a history of early-onset preeclampsia. Combined positivity for any of the TLR 4 and NOD 2 allelic variants and high levels of interleukin- 6 was 6. 9 -fold more common in women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia (95 % CI 2. 1 - 23. 2) compared to controls.

40|$|Objective Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} if babies breastfed at 6 months of age were more likely to wake at night and less likely to sleep alone than formula-fed babies. Patients and Methods Data were drawn from the first wave of The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, an ongoing, nationally representative study of the growth and development of Australia's children. The 4507 participants met the criteria for this study. The measures examined infant sleep problems as the outcome and breastfeeding at 6 months of age as the exposure in addition to the demographic data, maternal mental health, infant birthweight and gestational age at <b>delivery.</b> Results After <b>adjustment</b> for covariates, reports by mothers of infants that breastfed at 6 months of age suggested infants were 66 % more likely to wake during the night and 72 % more likely to report difficulty sleeping alone. However, breastfeeding had a strongly protective effect on wheezing, coughing, snoring and breathing problems, and it was not associated with restless sleep or problems getting to sleep for the infant. Conclusions Breastfeeding was found to be associated with increased night waking and this is consistent with other studies. There are biological reasons why this might be required to ensure breastfeeding continues to 6 months and beyond. The current low rates of sustained breastfeeding in many Western countries needs to be reconsidered in relation to parental and public health practices promoting prolonged nocturnal infant sleep patterns...|$|R
40|$|Brushite cements {{differ from}} apatite-forming {{compositions}} by consuming {{a lot of}} water in their setting reaction whereas apatite-forming cements consume little or no water at all. Only such cement systems that consume water during setting can theoretically produce near-zero porosity ceramics. This study aimed to produce such a brushite ceramic and investigated whether near elimination of porosity would prevent a burst release profile of incorporated antibiotics that is common to prior calcium phosphate cement <b>delivery</b> matrices. Through <b>adjustment</b> of the powder technological properties of the powder reactants, that is particle size and particle size distribution, and by adjusting citric acid concentration of the liquid phase to 800 mM, a relative porosity of as low as 11 % of the brushite cement matrix could be achieved (a 60 % reduction compared to previous studies), resulting in a wet unprecompacted compressive strength of 52 MPa (representing a more than 100 % increase to previously reported results) with a workable setting time of 4. 5 min of the cement paste. Up to 2 wt. % of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin could be incorporated into the cement system without loss of wet compressive strength. It was found that drug release rates could be controlled by the adjustable relative porosity of the cement system and burst release could be minimized and an almost linear release achieved, but the solubility of the antibiotic (vancomycin > ciprofloxacin) appeared also to be a crucial factor...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} childbirth on the sexual health of primiparous women and identify factors associated with dyspareunia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using obstetric records, and postal survey six months after delivery. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, St George's Hospital, London. POPULATION: All primiparous women (n = 796) delivered of a live birth in a six month period. METHODS: Quantitative analysis of obstetric and survey data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self reported sexual behaviour and sexual problems (e. g. vaginal dryness, painful penetration, pain during sexual intercourse, pain on orgasm, vaginal tightness, vaginal looseness, bleeding/irritation after sex, and loss of sexual desire); consultation for postnatal sexual problems. RESULTS: Of the 484 respondents (61 % response rate), 89 % had resumed sexual activity within {{six months of the}} birth. Sexual morbidity increased significantly after the birth: {{in the first three months}} after delivery 83 % of women experienced sexual problems, declining to 64 % at six months, although not reaching pre-pregnancy levels of 38 %. Dyspareunia in the first three months after <b>delivery</b> was, after <b>adjustment,</b> significantly associated with vaginal deliveries (P = 0 x 01) and previous experience of dyspareunia (P = 0 x 03). At six months the association with type of delivery was not significant (P = 0 x 4); only experience of dyspareunia before pregnancy (P < 0 x 0001) and current breastfeeding were significant (P = 0 x 0006). Only 15 % of women who had a postnatal sexual problem reported discussing it with a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual health problems were very common after childbirth, suggesting potentially high levels of unmet need...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Beam {{range control}} {{is the essence}} of {{radiotherapy}} with heavy charged particles. In conventional broad-beam <b>delivery,</b> fine range <b>adjustment</b> is achieved by insertion of range shifting and compensating materials. In dosimetry, solid phantoms are often used for convenience. These materials should ideally be equivalent to water. In this study, we evaluated dosimetric water equivalence of four common plastics, HDPE, PMMA, PET, and POM. Methods: Using the Bethe formula for energy loss, the Gottschalk formula for multiple scattering, and the Sihver formula for nuclear interactions, we calculated the effective densities of the plastics for these interactions. We experimentally measured variation of the Bragg peak of carbon-ion beams by insertion of HDPE, PMMA, and POM, which were compared with analytical model calculations. Results: The theoretical calculation resulted in slightly reduced multiple scattering and severely increased nuclear interactions for HDPE, compared to water and the other plastics. The increase in attenuation of carbon ions for 20 -cm range shift was experimentally measured to be 8. 9 % for HDPE, 2. 5 % for PMMA, and 0. 0 % for POM while PET was theoretically estimated to be in between PMMA and POM. The agreement between the measurements and the calculations was about 1 % or better. Conclusions: For carbon-ion beams, POM was dosimetrically indistinguishable from water and the best of the plastics examined in this study. The poorest was HDPE, which would reduce the Bragg peak by 0. 45 % per 1 -cm range shift, although with marginal superiority for reduced multiple scattering. Between the two clear plastics, PET would be superior to PMMA in dosimetric water equivalence...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prenatal {{multiple}} micronutrient (MMN) or balanced {{energy and}} protein supplementation has a limited effect on birth {{size of the}} offspring. Objective: The objective {{was to determine whether}} a prenatal MMN-fortified food supplement (FFS) improves anthropometric measures at birth compared with supplementation with an MMN pill alone. Design: We conducted a nonblinded, individually randomized controlled trial in 1296 pregnant women in 2 villages in rural Burkina Faso. Supplements were provided on a daily basis, and compliance was closely verified by using a community-based network of home visitors. Results: Anthropometric measures at birth were available for analysis for 87 % of the 1175 live singleton <b>deliveries</b> enrolled. After <b>adjustment</b> for gestational age at birth, the FFS group had a significantly higher birth length (+ 4. 6 mm; P = 0. 001). FFS supplementation resulted in a modestly higher birth weight (+ 31 g; P = 0. 197). Subgroup analyses showed clinically important treatment effects on birth length (+ 12. 0 mm; P = 0. 005) and on birth weight (+ 111 g; P = 0. 133) for underweight [body mass index (in kg/m 2) < 18. 5] pregnant women. Women with early pregnancy anemia who received FFS gave birth to longer newborns (+ 7. 3 mm; P = 0. 002) than did those who received MMN supplementation. Conclusions: The provision of FFS to pregnant women resulted in higher birth length than did MMN supplementation. For women with a suboptimal prepregnancy nutritional status, MMN supplementation should be complemented with a balanced energy and protein supplement to produce a clinical effect on birth size.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} maternal pregnancy intention and professional antenatal and delivery care utilization. Our data were derived from the 2011 nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey. We included antenatal and delivery care utilization data {{of the most recent}} live births for women for the previous three years (n = 4672). We used multilevel logistic regression models to assess the relationship between pregnancy intention and use of professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> care, with <b>adjustment</b> for potential confounding variables. Approximately 13 % and 16 % of children were reported by their mothers as unwanted and mistimed at the time of conception, respectively. Among the women, 55 % received at least one professional antenatal care service; 21 % received four or more professional antenatal services, while 32 % were attended by professionals during deliveries. Mothers of children whose pregnancies had been unwanted had a greater risk for not seeking professional antenatal and professional delivery care than those whose pregnancies had been wanted [1 ≥ ANC from professionals: AOR: 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 93; 4 ≥ ANC from professionals: AOR: 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 37 - 0. 84; and delivery care from professionals: AOR: 0. 70; 95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 97]. Women who were married after age 18, had secondary or higher level of education, and were from the wealthiest households were more likely to utilize antenatal and delivery care. Unwanted pregnancy is significantly associated with lower utilization of professional antenatal and delivery care services in Bangladesh. Reducing unwanted births and promoting access to professional antenatal and delivery care are crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 in Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} the Prime Minister’s Initiative for International Education, the University of Huddersfield Business School has seen a {{significant}} increase in overseas recruitment; this is a common phenomenon across the HE sector world-wide. Traditionally academic writing support has been provided by centralised units. One of the criticisms of this separate, broad-based provision is its divorce from the subject curriculum, engendering perceptions of deficiency rather than academic development (Ivanič and Lea, 2006). Where students do not see a direct connection between academic skills teaching and their assessment they find it difficult to perceive its benefit. Indeed such provision has received criticism as students find it difficult to see the relevance to their learning (Wingate, 2006). At the University of Huddersfield we have developed a model which places academic writing support at the centre of the business curriculum area. This innovation encompassed a conference style short course which evolved into a flexible and adaptable on-line module. Research design and methods of data collection and analysis or method inquiry: Taking an action research, mix – methods approach the Bridging Course was informed by primary research, carried out amongst Business School international student cohort. A questionnaire was administered on-line followed by a focus group. There were just over 100 responses to the questionnaire. Students were asked to consider prior learning cultures and that of British HE in terms of teaching, learning, assessment and technology. The quantitative data gives an overview and the qualitative data was analysed through NVivo to give a rich picture. This has fed into the curriculum design and delivery. We see here that course assessment and <b>delivery</b> necessitates swift <b>adjustment</b> to British HE cultural norms. Therefore the curriculum response was to develop a bridging course in order to support this adjustment period and to facilitate reflective practice and academic skills development...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the associations between meal frequency and glycemic properties of maternal diet in relation to preterm delivery. Methods This prospective cohort study included 66, 000 women from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Meal frequency and food intake data were obtained from a validated food frequency questionnaire during mid-pregnancy. Principal component factor analysis was used with a data-driven approach, and three meal frequency patterns were identified: “snack meal”, “main meal”, and “evening meal”. Pattern scores were ranked in quartiles. Glycemic index and glycemic load were estimated from table values. Intakes of carbohydrates, added sugar, and fiber were reported in grams per day and divided into quartiles. Gestational age was obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Preterm delivery was defined as birth at < 37 gestational weeks. A Cox regression model was used to assess associations with preterm <b>delivery.</b> Results After <b>adjustments,</b> the “main meal” pattern was associated with a reduced risk of preterm delivery, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0. 89 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 80, 0. 98) and 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 81, 0. 99) for the third and fourth quartiles, respectively, and p for trend of 0. 028. This was mainly attributed to the group of women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2, with HRs of 0. 87 (95 % CI: 0. 79, 0. 96) and 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 80, 0. 98) for the third and fourth quartiles, respectively, and p for trend of 0. 010. There was no association between glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrates, added sugar, fiber, or the remaining meal frequency patterns and preterm delivery. Conclusion Regular consumption of main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) was associated with a lower risk of preterm delivery. Diet should be further studied as potential contributing factors for preterm delivery.

40|$|Background Prevention of {{hypothermia}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} tenets of effective neonatal care. Concerns about cold stress and its link to increased morbidity and mortality in neonates were first documented in 1907 (Budin 1907), {{but it was not until}} 1958 that Silverman et al. (1958) demonstrated the association between more effective temperature regulation and decreased mortality. Cold stress, or hypothermia, is known to result in complications such as an increased need for oxygen, difficult resuscitation, an increased incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), post <b>delivery</b> acidosis, delayed <b>adjustment</b> from foetal to newborn circulation, worsening respiratory distress syndrome, and increase morbidity from infection (Soll, 2008; Knobel, 2007). Unfortunately, hypothermia (temperature < 36. 5 °C) remains a common finding in premature neonates following delivery, resuscitation, stabilisation and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). During this period, body temperature is highly dependent on the environmental temperature and its surroundings. Predisposing factors for hypothermia, especially in the premature infant, include a large surface area to body mass ratio, wet at birth, skin immaturity, and prematurity. Evaporation, convection, conduction and radiation all participate in the frequently rapid fall in body temperature. Heat loss is the greatest in the first few minutes of life as infants are born wet into a relatively cool environment when compared to the uterus (Cramer et al., 2005; Soll, 2008). Given that the Townsville Hospital neonatal unit is set in a regional, tropical area that includes a high proportion of Indigenous Australians prone to preterm birth, and as preterm and low birth weight are more likely in rural and regional areas than in urban environments (AIHW, 2010), the need for an intervention to help improve admission temperature to the NICU and decrease heat loss at birth was considered important. The measurement of temperature is also an important part of the care of the neonate admitted to the NICU. Accurate temperature assessment enables early intervention and/or treatment as a change in body temperature can indicate the presence of infection or disorders of the thermoregulatory system. The necessity for regular observations such as temperature measurement does however require prolonged handling and disturbance. Finding ways to reduce the need to disturb the preterm neonate are essential. Study 1 : In an attempt to decrease hypothermia at birth and on admission to the NICU the use of the plastic wrap in infants less than 30 weeks gestation was trialled. A randomised controlled trial was conducted. The study enrolled 92 infants < 30 weeks gestation. Randomisation concealment was by the use of sealed opaque envelopes. The infants' temperatures were assessed for two hours following admission to the NICU. Study 2 : In order to try to reduce handling time in the neonatal population a study was conducted to assess the concordance of two alternative thermometers to the BD Digital thermometer, currently the thermometer of choice at The Townsville Hospital. Results study 1 : The results of the study indicate an increase in admission temperature between intervention and control group (36. 26 °C versus 35. 79 °C), confirming that the application of the plastic wrap at birth increases admission temperature in infants born less than 30 weeks gestation. Results study 2 : This study found that the BD digital and the SureTemp®Plus model 692 measurements showed moderately good agreement. The results confirm that the SureTemp®Plus model 692 thermometers can be used safely instead of the BD digital thermometer in term and preterm neonates. Non-thesis components of degree During the course of the degree a number of coursework requirements were completed. These subjects included literature review and research statistics subjects. In addition, a number of teaching and learning modules were developed on areas of neonatal specialist content. The four distance learning modules, currently in use at James Cook University and The College of Nursing, were written as part of the Doctoral Specialisation subjects (1 & 2) (see Appendix VIII and VIIII for an overview of the subjects). These subjects will be used to enhance the knowledge and skills of neonatal nurses, especially when hypothermia and hyperthermia are evident. Education opportunities for nurses working in specialised areas, such as the NICU, is important to ensure evidence based care is delivered in the area. Other work that contributes towards this portfolio is also included. During the course of the professional doctorate I gave five conference presentations and three local seminars, and presented four conference posters related to the neonatal specialty area.
