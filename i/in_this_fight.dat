5|$|Carpenter, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>fight</b> {{with others}} of his small {{regiment}} at Fairfield, stood against {{two of the}} crack brigades of Stuart's cavalry. The 6th Cavalry's stand {{was considered one of}} the most gallant in its history and helped influence the outcome the battles being fought around Gettysburg. While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut to pieces, it fought so well that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops. The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force. Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand, the two brigades of Virginians could have caused serious problems to the Union rear areas.|$|E

5|$|This {{iteration}} of Razer {{competed in}} the second series of Robot Wars, successfully passing the Gauntlet and Trials stages of its heat before being defeated in battle by a robot called Inquisitor. The cause of Razer's immobilisation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>fight</b> was the shearing of nylon cush drives—cushioning blocks designed to prevent stress fractures—in the machine's drive wheels; these were replaced with more robust metal ones for future competitions. As the Robot Wars television series evolved and grew, Razer's design was revised and refined to counter weaknesses {{and take advantage of}} rule changes; by series four, Lewis estimated that Razer had taken 1,500 hours to build, at a cost of £1,600.|$|E
5|$|Kayibanda {{presided over}} a Hutu {{republic}} for the next decade, ruling in a top down manner similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. In 1973, Hutu army officer Juvénal Habyarimana toppled Kayibanda in a coup. Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana, but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence. A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to foreign aid receipts. The family of first lady Agathe Habyarimana, known as the akazu, were the principal winners <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>fight.</b> The family had a more respected lineage {{than that of the}} president, having ruled one of the independent states near Gisenyi in the nineteenth century. Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west. The akazu exploited this to their advantage, with Habyarimana increasingly unable to rule without them. The economic crisis forced Habyarimana to heavily reduce the national budget; to quell civil unrest, he declared a commitment to multi-party politics, but did not take any action to bring this about. Student protests followed, and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans now {{attempted}} a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, {{they were unable}} to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>fight,</b> which raged until 11:00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5-inch and old 2.36-inch rocket launchers against the North Korean infantry. The fire of the 18 bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the North Koreans, who desperately tried to clear the way for a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with North Korean dead and destroyed equipment.|$|E
