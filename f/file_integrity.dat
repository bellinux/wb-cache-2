2500|$|CHKDSK (short for [...] "check disk") is {{a system}} tool in DOS, OS/2 and Windows. It verifies the <b>file</b> system <b>integrity</b> of a volume and fixes logical file system errors. It {{is similar to the}} fsck command in Unix.|$|R
40|$|A {{basic method}} in {{computer}} security is to perform integrity checks on the file system {{to detect the}} installation of malicious programs, or the modification of sensitive <b>files.</b> <b>Integrity</b> tools to date rely on the operating system to function correctly, so once the operating system is compromised even a novice attacker can easily defeat these tools. A novel way to overcome this problem {{is the use of}} an independent auditor, which uses an out-of-band verification process that does not depend on the underlying operating system. In this paper we present a definition of independent auditors and a specific implementation of an independent auditor using an embedded system attached to the PCI bus...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is a {{new paradigm}} of computing and {{is considered to be}} the next generation of information technology infrastructure for an enterprise. The distributed architecture of cloud data storage facilitates the customer to get benefits from the greater quality of storage and minimized the operating cost. This technology also brought numerous possible threats including data confidentiality, integrity and availability. A homomorphic based model of storage is proposed, which enable the customer and a third party auditor to perform the authentication of data stored on the cloud storage. This model performs the verification of huge <b>file’s</b> <b>integrity</b> and availability with less consumption of computation, storage and communication resources. The proposed model also supports public verifiability and dynamic data recovery...|$|R

50|$|Typical SIEM {{capabilities}} such as: (1) Security Event Management (SEM), (2) <b>File</b> <b>Integrity</b> Monitoring (FIM), (3) Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and (4) Availability and Performance Monitoring (APM) {{are part}} of this layer.However, unlike your typical SIEM, the LAPIS layer provides for automatic countermeasure generation, repair and recovery, as well as manual mode where forensics and countermeasure issuance is based on a probabilistic model with tunable Φ1 and Φ2 parameters.|$|E
50|$|<b>File</b> <b>integrity</b> {{monitoring}} (FIM) is {{an internal}} control or process that performs {{the act of}} validating the integrity of operating system and application software files using a verification method between the current file state and a known, good baseline. This comparison method often involves calculating a known cryptographic checksum of the file's original baseline and comparing with the calculated checksum of {{the current state of}} the file. Other file attributes can also be used to monitor integrity.|$|E
50|$|F2FS {{uses the}} {{checkpoint}} scheme to maintain <b>file</b> system <b>integrity.</b> At mount time, F2FS first {{tries to find}} the last valid checkpoint data by scanning the CP area. In {{order to reduce the}} scanning time, F2FS uses only two copies of the CP. One of them always indicates the last valid data, which is called a shadow copy mechanism. In addition to the CP, the NAT and SIT also use the shadow copy mechanism. For file system consistency, each CP points to which NAT and SIT copies are valid.|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the impact of electronic file sharing system on production and profit of mining and mineral processing industries. Dangote cement industry was chosen {{as a case study}} due to the company recent adoption of electronic file sharing system in the delivery of the company services. The primary data for the study were obtained through questionnaires and supported with participant observation which gave the researcher an opportunity to explore, watch and study the effects of electronic file sharing in daily activities of each of the sections/departments of the company. The result showed that electronic file sharing system has positive impacts on more than 75 % of the staff of the company which enhance better delivery of company activities to their customers. The company uses customized applications in their distributed file sharing system which made the system more effective. Power failure, inadequate training, slow connectivity (local and internet), obsolete equipment and virus are the identified factors militating against the efficiency of files sharing system in service delivery of the company activities to their customers. The study concluded that the adoption of electronic file sharing system in Dangote cement industry has ensured good services delivery to their customers, <b>files</b> <b>integrity</b> and security.
