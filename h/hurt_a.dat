5|$|Typhoon Ken, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Tering, was the fourth typhoon to strike Japan during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season. Forming along {{the western end of}} the monsoon trough in the Philippine Sea, the system had {{organized}} into a tropical depression on September16, and by that night a tropical storm. As a compact system, rapid intensification continued, with Ken becoming a typhoon on the evening of September17 and a major typhoon on September18. The cyclone up to this point had a history of progressing slowly west-northwest, but Ken eventually stalled on September20 and became a larger cyclone. As a mid-latitude trough to its north deepened, Ken took off to the northeast towards Okinawa. Ken made landfall upon Shikoku early on September25, and moved onward into the Sea of Japan where it evolved into an extratropical cyclone. Five people were killed while 18others were <b>hurt.</b> <b>A</b> total of 114mudslides were reported, resulted in over 2,000homes flooded. Additionally, 12homes were damaged or destroyed. Seventy-four flights were cancelled as well.|$|E

25|$|On another instance, {{a meeting}} with sharp lances was {{arranged}} to take place near Nantes, {{under the auspices of}} the Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir Tristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted three courses, without <b>hurt.</b> <b>A</b> duel followed between Edward Beauchamp, son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The bastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat with swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties was hurt.|$|E

500|$|A durian {{falling on}} a person's head can cause serious {{injuries}} {{because it is}} heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a hardhat is recommended when collecting the fruit. Alfred Russel Wallace writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious effusion of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place. A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be <b>hurt.</b> <b>A</b> saying in Indonesian, ketiban durian runtuh, which translates to [...] "getting a durian avalanche", {{is the equivalent of}} the English phrase [...] "windfall gain". Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia. Strong nylon or woven rope nettings are often strung between durian trees in orchards, serving a threefold purpose: the nets aid {{in the collection of the}} mature fruits, deter ground-level scavengers, and most importantly, prevent the durians from falling onto people.|$|E

A reporter from The Examiner commented: [...] "The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions. The whole five acres can be cut in six hours, as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower." [...] When the ground was harrowed, glass and other debris would surface; a contemporary observer, John Orchard, later remembered: [...] "they'd line up a whole group of people, perhaps thirty or forty players, and we'd go along with a container alongside each other and we'd pick up everything that was likely to <b>hurt</b> <b>a</b> player." ...|$|E

500|$|Viewers saw {{the slow}} {{build-up}} to Pauline's climactic exit throughout {{the latter part}} of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: [...] "she cannot forgive. For anyone to <b>hurt</b> <b>a</b> member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia {{is more than just a}} thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story." ...|$|E
500|$|In early March 2010, U.S. Army bomb {{disposal}} expert Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against The Hurt Locker. [...] Sarver's lawsuit claimed he used the term [...] "hurt locker" [...] and the phrase [...] "war is a drug" [...] around Boal, that his likeness was used to create the character William James, and that the portrayal of William James defames Sarver. Sarver said he felt [...] "just a little bit <b>hurt,</b> <b>a</b> little bit felt left out" [...] and cheated out of [...] "financial participation" [...] in the film. Sarver claimed he originated {{the title of the}} film; however, the title is a decades-old colloquialism for being injured, as in [...] "they sent him to the hurt locker." [...] It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning [...] "in trouble or at a disadvantage; in bad shape." [...] Boal defended himself to the press, saying [...] "the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people's stories." [...] He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research. Jody Simon, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, noted that [...] "soldiers don't have privacy", and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit. Summit Entertainment, the producers of the film, said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit. In the December 8, 2011, issue of The Hollywood Reporter, it was announced that Master Sergeant Sarver's lawsuit was thrown out by the court, and a federal judge ordered him to pay more than $180,000 in attorney fees.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Mirkin wrote a pilot with Julie Brown {{entitled}} The Julie Show, starring Brown, but NBC did {{not produce}} it. Several people at the network enjoyed it and commissioned The Edge, a sketch comedy show also written by Mirkin and Brown, with Mirkin directing. NBC opted against production, but Fox ran it from 1992 to 1993. Mirkin had long wished to produce a sketch show, and designed The Edge to be [...] "fast-paced" [...] and [...] "some skits overlap, end abruptly or are broken into segments", {{in order to maintain}} attention. The Edge was a ratings success and was supported by the network. Mirkin considered it [...] "the first time I experienced the feeling of having a hit that I created. It just kept building and growing." [...] The show's material often inflamed its targets, particularly producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling objected to a sketch mocking his series Beverly Hills, 90210, another Fox show, and its lead actress Tori Spelling, who is his daughter. He demanded a public apology and that no further episodes contain the parody, threatening to sue. The show's production company TriStar Television refused, while Mirkin responded: [...] "The thing about these parodies is they don't <b>hurt</b> <b>a</b> show. It's only cross-promotion. The viewers who like the show always come back the next week. What's upsetting to me is it shows absolutely that Mr. Spelling has no sense of humor." [...] Mirkin left his role as executive producer of The Edge during its run. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Mirkin had been [...] "forced off the show", due to the negative reaction of Spelling and others, though in 2012, Mirkin stated that he left the series after refusing to accept a substantially reduced budget. The show's producers Sony failed to persuade him to stay but he returned to the series to produce its final [...] "Best Of" [...] compilation.|$|E
