Effective {{micro-organisms}} (EM) {{increase the}} natural resistance {{of soil and}} plants, and it considerably improves the quality and fertility of soil {{as well as the}} growth and quality of crops. In this study, we prepared two types of porous ceramics with high and low porosity, and observed the attaching behavior <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> to the surface of ceramics. In the case of highly porous ceramics with large pore (80 % in porosity), many <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> were observed in the pores of interior {{as well as on the}} ceramic surfaces. However, most <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> attached on the surface of the low porous ceramics with small pore (45 % porosity), and only a few micro-organisms observed in pore inside...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} for the characterisation <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> is rapidly evolving, after the recent advent of new ionisation methods in mass spectrometry (MS) : electrospray (ES) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI).

This review provides a brief introduction to ES and MALDI MS and a discussion <b>of</b> <b>micro-organism</b> characterisation capabilities.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{characterization}} <b>of</b> airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> {{in a given}} location involves (1) large-volume filtration of air onto glass-fiber filters; (2) accelerated extraction of membrane lipids <b>of</b> the collected <b>micro-organisms</b> by use <b>of</b> pressurized hot liquid; and (3) identification and quantitation of the lipids by use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method is suitable for use in both outdoor and indoor environments; for example, {{it can be used}} to measure airborne microbial contamination in buildings ("sick-building syndrome"). The classical approach to analysis <b>of</b> airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> is based on the growth <b>of</b> cultureable <b>micro-organisms</b> and does not provide an account of viable but noncultureable micro-organisms, which typically amount to more than 90 percent <b>of</b> the <b>micro-organisms</b> present. In contrast, the present method provides an account <b>of</b> all <b>micro-organisms,</b> including cultureable, noncultureable, aerobic, and anaerobic ones. The analysis of lipids according to this method makes it possible to estimate the number <b>of</b> viable airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> present in the sampled air and to obtain a quantitative profile of the general types <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> present along with some information about their physiological statuses...|$|R

To overcome these problems soil amendments based on specific strains <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> or based on organic material are proposed. In pot experiments under controlled conditions 14 microbial strains and six organic soil amendments were tested on their ability to suppress soil borne diseases and to improve plant stand establishment. In a subsequent field experiment with the best treatments, soil amendments with compost showed the best effect while products based on single strains <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> failed to improve plant stand establishment.
