25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no one else is willing to do so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E
25|$|Any {{candidate}} {{theory of}} quantum gravity {{must be able}} to reproduce Einstein's theory of general relativity as a classical limit of a quantum theory. This is not guaranteed because of a feature of quantum field theories which is that they have different sectors, these are analogous to the different phases that come about in the thermodynamical limit of statistical systems. Just as different phases are physically different, so are different sectors of a quantum field theory. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> that LQG belongs to an unphysical sector – one in which one does not recover general relativity in the semiclassical limit (in fact there might not be any physical sector at all).|$|E
500|$|The {{opinion of}} the move 6.a3 has {{gradually}} shifted from being the main continuation to being a possible continuation, then down to its present status of being considered a mistake. The threat to push b2–b4 must be taken seriously by Black, who typically answers 6...a5. But in the 1980s {{it was discovered that}} the push a7–a5 was actually a very useful one for Black, as it allows the Ra8 to be developed along the sixth rank. Meanwhile, the push a2–a3 is less useful for White, as he {{will not be able to}} easily push b2–b4. As Tseitlin puts it, [...] "the point is that 6...a5 fits into the plan of attacking White's kingside, whereas 6.a3 does little in the way of defending it". Thus if White does not find a clear way to make good use of his move a2–a3, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be a critical waste of tempo.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, nodes {{have one}} k-bucket. When the k-bucket becomes full, {{it can be}} split. The split occurs if the range of nodes in the k-bucket spans the node's own id (values {{to the left and}} right in a binary tree). Kademlia relaxes even this rule for the one [...] "closest nodes" [...] k-bucket, because {{typically}} one single bucket will correspond to the distance where all the nodes that are the closest to this node are, they may be more than k, and we want it to know them all. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> that a highly unbalanced binary sub-tree exists near the node. If k is 20, and there are 21+ nodes with a prefix [...] "xxx0011....." [...] and the new node is [...] "xxx000011001", the new node can contain multiple k-buckets for the other 21+ nodes. This is to guarantee that the network knows about all nodes in the closest region.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{paleontologist}} David Evans {{was flying}} to the U.S. Badlands {{when he discovered}} reference to a Barosaurus skeleton (ROM 3670) {{in the collection of}} the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, where he had recently become a curator. Earl Douglass had excavated this specimen at the Carnegie Quarry in the early 20th century; the ROM acquired it in a 1962 trade with the Carnegie Museum. The specimen was never exhibited and remained in storage until its rediscovery by David Evans 45 years later. He returned to Toronto and searched the storage areas and found many fragments, large and small, of the skeleton. It is now a centrepiece of the ROM's dinosaur exhibit, in the James and Louise Temerty Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs. At almost 27.5 metres (90 feet) long, the specimen is the largest dinosaur ever to be mounted in Canada. The specimen is about 40% complete. As a skull of Barosaurus has never been found, the ROM specimen wears the head of a Diplodocus. Each bone is mounted on a separate armature so that it can be removed from the skeleton for study and then replaced without disturbing the rest of the skeleton. (See video [...] "Dino Workshop" [...] at reference.) In the rush to put the dinosaur on exhibit within ten weeks of its delivery to Research Casting International in 2500 pieces, not all of the skeletal fragments were mounted. In addition, more bones labeled ROM 3670 are still being found in storage. In future, more may be added to the specimen and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be the most complete known.' (See video [...] "Dino Assembly" [...] at reference.) The ROM specimen is nicknamed [...] "Gordo." [...] John McIntosh believes that the ROM's skeleton is the same individual represented by four neck vertebrae labelled [...] "CM 1198" [...] {{in the collection of the}} Carnegie Museum.|$|E
