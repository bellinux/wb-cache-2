5|$|During 1976, {{construction}} of a new shopping center <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the Galleria Edina, an upscale shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring shopping centers. In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain of stores, which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the courthouse building, the public square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain.

5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from the London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Shipbuilding {{was one of}} the two big {{businesses}} at Medford in {{the mid-19th}} century. Thatcher Magoun's shipyard, where Curtis did his apprenticeship, was the oldest (established 1802) and largest of the 10 yards, and remained so even after Thatcher's retirement in 1836. In 1845 one-quarter of all shipwrights in Massachusetts were employed in the Medford shipyards. The yards clustered along 1 mile of the Mystic River riverfront, and Curtis's yard was between South, Winthrop and Curtis Streets. He launched his ships <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Street</b> roadway. <b>The</b> yards drew upon the ready supply of local timber until the local woods were depleted. Ships were then built from timber cut down and floated south from the hardwood forests of New Hampshire. Each ship was built from fifteen or more species of wood carefully pieced together where the special properties of each would do the most good.|$|R
5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by show runner and {{executive}} producer Shonda Rhimes, while filmmaker Daniel Minahan directed it. Sara Ramirez began receiving star billing in the season premiere, after numerous appearances during the last episodes of the second season. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily filmed in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{increases}} {{of the school}} population in the early 1950s required the use of additional annexes, including, <b>directly</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> road, Barony <b>Street</b> (<b>the</b> former Martyrs' Public School, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), Kennedy Street Primary School (built in 1875) which was shared with the City Public School, and Rigby Street in Carntyne which in 1954 housed two [...] "prep" [...] (preparatory) classes and two first year and two second year classes, under the local headship of Mr. Sweeney. Brother Clare (the historian James E. Handley) was the overall headmaster of the Academy at this time. <b>The</b> Rigby <b>Street</b> annexe was later used by St. Gregory's Secondary Cranhill.|$|R
5000|$|June 24, 2004: Insurgents {{establish}} {{a series of}} blocking positions and strong points along the major routes of travel through the city prior to 0500 local time. An American Mechanized Infantry Platoon consisting of four Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFV) and its complement of dismounted Infantry conducting a routine patrol just before sunrise comes under direct fire while passing the first identified enemy position located in {{the northwest corner of}} the city. The platoon pushes through the fire and continues south, reaches a second enemy strong point identified vicinity the civic center adjacent to the Mufrak traffic circle where it is fired on again. The platoon continued east towards the bridge spanning the Diyala river located roughly {{in the center of the}} city. Upon reaching the eastern side of the city, the platoon comes under fire again from a third enemy strong point located vicinity the stadium and university campus located on the far eastern side of the city. The patrol, after passing through this position, reaches American operated Forward Operating Base (FOB) Gabe. Shortly thereafter, a second patrol launched from FOB Warhorse (located a few kilometres to the northwest of Baqubah) is launched to assess the viability of the enemy positions. This unit (4th platoon / A Company / TF 2-2 / 3 BDE / 1 ID) led by 1LT Gregory followed the same route as the first patrol that passed through the city and was attacked at the same locations. In response to the operating in semi-permanent defensive positions, the city was effectively divided into two sectors with the Diyala river serving as the dividing point. TF 2-63 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID was given responsibility to clear enemy personnel on the western side of the city and TF 1-6 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID was given responsibility to clear the eastern side of the city. Each of the respective battalions launched a company-sized element into their respective sectors. TF 1-6 FA, primarily operating with HMMWVs, received attachments from TF 2-2 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID and TF 2-63 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID in the form of a BFV platoon and a Tank Platoon. Prior to 0800 local time two 500 pound bombs were dropped on readily identified enemy positions by the airforce. One bomb was dropped on the stadium located in the eastern side of the city and a second bomb was dropped <b>directly</b> south <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> on an enemy position that was identified in vicinity of a university campus located there. It is believed that a third bomb may have been dropped vicinity of the civic center located on the eastern side of the Mufrak traffic circle. Fighting peaked at about 0900-1000 local time and all skirmishes were over before sunset that evening. A large amount of drug paraphernalia and enemy weapons was recovered at the enemy strong points.|$|R
