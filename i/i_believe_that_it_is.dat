25|$|One of the {{greatest}} tragedies of the Cold War was the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of {{what was then the}} Soviet Union on 1 September 1983... The KAL-007 tragedy {{was one of the most}} tense incidences of the entire Cold War. However, now that relations between our two nations have improved substantially, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time to resolve the mysteries surrounding this event. Clearing the air on this issue could help further to improve relations.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{one of my}} strong collaborations. It {{already has}} me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, {{as far as the}} match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E

At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to}} me that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E

2500|$|.....However, as {{unlikely}} {{as it may}} seem, {{this does}} not mean for one moment that Judaism’s view rejects wholesale the veracity of Darwin’s theory.

60|$|Our {{friend and}} host was Mr. Baillie Paton. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to his {{suggestion}} {{in a public}} meeting, that we owe the invitation which brought us to Scotland.|$|E

6000|$|... "Never mind, old fellow," [...] said Foy consolingly. [...] "It {{all went}} wrong, thanks to you, {{and thanks to}} you <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will all come right again. So we will cry quits and forget the rest." ...|$|R

60|$|What may we suppose is {{the reason}} of this great stillness and soberness of the gospels? <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be {{explained}} thus. The men who wrote them were too much awed by our Lord, to make more words about him than they absolutely needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know very}} little about it myself," [...] Virginia answered. [...] "The doctor had only just been when I came away.
