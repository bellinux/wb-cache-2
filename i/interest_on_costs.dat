40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the need and demand for {{sedation}} or general anesthesia (GA) for dentistry in the Canadian adult population. A national telephone survey of 1101 Canadians found that 9. 8 % were somewhat afraid of dental treatment, with another 5. 5 % having a high level of fear. Fear or anxiety was the reason why 7. 6 % had ever missed, cancelled, or avoided a dental appointment. Of those with high fear, 49. 2 % had avoided a dental appointment at some point because of fear or anxiety as opposed to only 5. 2 % from the no or low fear group. Regarding demand, 12. 4 % were definitely interested in sedation or GA for their dentistry and 42. 3 % were <b>interested</b> depending <b>on</b> <b>cost.</b> Of those with high fear, 31. 1 % were definitely interested, with 54. 1 % <b>interested</b> depending <b>on</b> <b>cost.</b> In a hypothetical situation where endodontics was required because of a severe toothache, 12. 7 % reported high fear. This decreased to 5. 4 % if sedation or GA were available. For this procedure, 20. 4 % were definitely interested in sedation or GA, and another 46. 1 % were <b>interested</b> depending <b>on</b> <b>cost.</b> The prevalence of, and preference for, sedation or GA was assessed for specific dental procedures. The proportion of the population with a preference for sedation or GA was 7. 2 % for cleaning, 18 % for fillings or crowns, 54. 7 % for endodontics, 68. 2 % for periodontal surgery, and 46. 5 % for extraction. For each procedure, the proportion expressing a preference for sedation or GA was significantly greater than the proportion having received treatment with sedation or GA (P < 0. 001).

System cost directly impacts the capital equipment component of cost of electricity (COE) and is a major contributor to the O and M component. The replacement costs for equipment (also heavily influenced by stack life) is generally a major contributor to O and M costs. In this project, they worked with the SECA industrial teams to estimate the impact of general manufacturing issues of <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> stack <b>cost</b> using an activities-based cost model for anode-supported planar SOFC stacks with metallic interconnects. An earlier model developed for NETL for anode supported planar SOFCs was enhanced by a linkage to a performance/thermal/mechanical model, by addition of Quality Control steps to the process flow with specific characterization methods, and by assessment of economies of scale. The 3 -dimensional adiabatic performance model was used to calculate the average power density for the assumed geometry and operating conditions (i. e., inlet and exhaust temperatures, utilization, and fuel composition) based on publicly available polarizations curves. The SECA team provided guidance on what manufacturing and design issues should be assessed in this Phase I demonstration of cost modeling capabilities. They considered the impact of the following parameters on yield and cost: layer thickness (i. e., anode, electrolyte, and cathode) <b>on</b> <b>cost</b> and stress levels, statistical nature of ceramic material failure on yield, and Quality Control steps and strategies. In this demonstration of the capabilities of the linked model, only the active stack (i. e., anode, electrolyte, and cathode) and interconnect materials were included in the analysis.

40|$|Italy {{registers}} a fast {{increase of}} low income population. Academics {{and policy makers}} consider income inequalities as a key determinant for low or inadequate healthy food consumption. Thus {{the objective is to}} understand how to overcome the agrofood chain barriers towards healthy food production, commercialisation and consumption for population at risk of poverty (ROP) in Italy. The study adopts a market oriented food chain approach, focusing the research ambit on ROP consumers, processing industries and retailers. The empirical investigation adopts a qualitative methodology with an explorative approach. The actors are investigated through 4 focus groups for consumers and carrying out 27 face to face semi-structured interviews for industries and retailers’ representatives. The results achieved provide the perceptions of each actor integrated into an overall chain approach. The analysis shows that all agrofood actors lack of an adequate level of knowledge towards healthy food definition. Food industries and retailers also show poor awareness about ROP consumers’ segment. In addition they perceive that the high costs for producing healthy food conflict with the low economic performances expected from ROP consumers’ segment. These aspects induce a scarce <b>interest</b> in investing <b>on</b> commercialisation strategies for healthy food for ROP consumers. Further ROP consumers show other notable barriers to adopt healthy diets caused, among others, by a personal strong negative attitude and lack of motivation. The personal barriers are also negatively influenced by several external socio-economic factors. The solutions to overcome the barriers shall rely on the improvement of the agrofood chain internal relations to identify successful strategies for increasing <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> low <b>cost</b> healthy food. In particular the focus should be on improved collaboration on innovation adoption and marketing strategies, considering ROP consumers’ preferences and needs. An external political intervention is instead necessary to fill the knowledge and regulations’ gaps on healthy food issues. ...|$|R

To analyze the effect of potential energy on reactor facility safety/hazard, a diagram of reactor facility hazard has been proposed.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a real model of financial crisis, and {{uses it to}} elucidate the controversy between Joe Stiglitz and the IMF concerning the Asian financial crisis. Borrowers of foreign capital are bound by lending contracts to pay the world {{rate of return on}} their borrowing, following an adverse shock; by assumption, they do not default. This is onerous, since the shock makes the marginal product of capital fall to less than the world rate of return, and creates a debt overhang <b>on</b> which <b>interest</b> must be paid. The country faces a choice. It could choose to pay these extra <b>interest</b> obligations <b>on</b> its debt overhang [...] a transfer [...] in every period, raise taxes in order to meet these obligations, and thereby gradually reduce capital to its new lower level, at which point there would no longer be a debt overhang. We describe this as the `IMF strategy'.

But the fiscal cost of doing this would be finite and the fiscal costs would be equally spread across time. The short run tax burden would thus be smaller.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} a quadratic programming model to the bond and note participation decision of a Cooperative Farm Credit Bank. The model generates an efficient frontier of bond and note portfolios from which a bank can choose. The composition of these portfolios depends upon the expected cost and variance-covariance of cost for the bond and note activities, debt needs, and the debt policy constraints of a bank. The results indicate that the interest rate risk of various bond and note issues should be considered when making debt participation decisions. The Cooperative Farm Credit System has become a major supplier of credit to agricul-ture. On January 1, 1980, the 37 banks of the System collectively extended in excess of $ 48 billion to agriculture. This entailed 36 per-cent of all farm real estate debt and 25 per-cent of all farm nonreal estate debt. The System obtains funds for loans from the na-tional money market by issuing system-wide consolidated bonds and discount notes. The <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> <b>on</b> bonds and notes depends upon market interest rates which have been very volatile in recent years and are not controllable by the System [Bildersee].
