You just smoke little Kendah 'bacco and {{see many}} things, {{if you have}} gift, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>got,</b> and as I almost sure that lady got," [...] and he pointed to Miss Holmes.

6000|$|... "That's right, Wingfield," [...] {{the lawyer}} said. [...] "You see we have settled the {{business}} satisfactorily, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> a fairly cheap bargain. Just {{wait a minute}} and we will complete the transaction." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the director's commentary, Bruce Evans {{said that}} the film {{was to be the}} first of a trilogy, but as with any {{franchise}} it depended on the film's profits. Despite its commercial success, there are no plans to make further films. Speaking in April 2009, Panabaker said, [...] "Everybody wanted to make a trilogy. I saw Kevin Costner last summer and we still would love to. The idea of my character and Kevin's character, it'd be so much fun. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to see how manipulative they both are with each other. I {{would have loved to have}} done three." ...|$|E

And I'm sure I congratulate you {{with all my}} heart; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> the very best girl in all the world. Of course I'm her mother; but I declare, if I was to talk of her for a week, I could not say {{anything}} of her but good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder you}} stop at trapping, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>you</b> to favor Fulkerson's scheme and then sprung New York on you. I don't suppose you do, though. But I guess we won't {{talk about it}} any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> really have <b>got</b> {{to look at}} your children's future from a larger point of view. You don't surely want them to fly out against things before they've {{had a chance to see}} life for themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{glad to see}} you again, Captain Spike," [...] cried Wallace, {{after the}} {{greetings}} were passed, [...] "if it be only to ask where you flew to, the day we left you in the Mona Passage? We looked out for you with all our eyes, expecting you would be down between San Domingo and Jamaica, but <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> by us in the night. Our master <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> must have dove, and gone past loon-fashion. Do you ever perform that manoeuvre?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{us all to}} start, {{and walked}} along with the lady {{superior}} {{as if you were}} a friend of hers. Macwitty had not time to tell me that. I was so frightened and bewildered with the dreadful noise and the strangeness of it all that I could not ask him many questions." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the track}} [...] "Axl Rose", Argos {{has said that}} [...] "I think GnR are a great band. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> into an {{argument}} with someone, you’d want Axl in your corner. He’s a good guy to have on your side. You know, you don’t want Rivers Cuomo defending you. Axl Rose {{is the guy who}} will stand up for you. It’s funny, I was recording the song with Frank Black, and he's going, “you know, if there’s one thing you can say about Axl, it’s that he tells people to fuck off!” It was pretty amazing having a conversation with Black Francis about Axl Rose" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Mr. Dutton, 'but {{you will}} learn others. Look here, Nuttie. You used to be always craving for grand and noble tasks, the more {{difficult}} the better. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> one now, more severe than ever could have been thought of--and very noble. What are those lines about the task [...] "bequeathed from bleeding sire to son"? Isn't it like that? You are bound {{to go on with}} her work, and the more helpless you feel, and the more you throw yourself on God, the more God will help you. He takes the will for the deed, if only you have will enough; and, Nuttie, you can pray that {{you may be able to}} love and honour him.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Winston Churchill {{claimed in}} a {{telegram}} to Jan Smuts on October 9 that [...] "As regards Arnhem, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> the position {{a little out}} of focus. The battle was a decided victory, but the leading division, asking, quite rightly, for more, was given a chop. I have not been afflicted with any feeling of disappointment over this and am glad our commanders are capable of running this kind of risk." [...] He said that the risks [...] ".... were justified by the great prize so nearly in our grasp" [...] but acknowledged that [...] "Clearing the Scheldt estuary and opening the port of Antwerp had been delayed {{for the sake of the}} Arnhem thrust. Thereafter it was given first priority." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{she rose}} {{to take her}} leave, after her call was ended, she asked Mary Erskine {{to come to the}} village and see her as soon as she could. [...] "I meant to have called upon you long before this," [...] said she, [...] "but I have been so busy, and we have had so much company. But I want to see you very much indeed. We have a {{beautiful}} house, and I have a great desire to show it to <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> a beautiful place here for a farm, one of these days; but you ought to make your husband build you a better house.

6000|$|... “It proves my point. I {{know the}} kind of place: a ‘Sleepy Hollow,’ where nothing happens that hasn’t {{happened}} {{in the same way}} before, left as it was when the tide of American life poured West across the plains. One can imagine your mother’s people being bound by old traditions and clinging to the customs of more serious days. That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> your gracious calm, your depth of character, and a sweetness I’ve found in no one else.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is tough," [...] Rupert said; [...] "he is like whip-cord all over; he is {{a capital}} fellow, {{not a bit}} changed. Easton has turned out first-rate; he was awfully good to me after you went away, and took no end of pains to cheer me up, had me down to {{his place in the}} holidays, and was a real friend. He is a big fellow now, and in another two or three years will make a splendid man. They will be delighted when we both turn up again. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> either of them thought, when they said good-bye to me, that I should ever get back. They thought the {{language}} would floor me, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> have <b>got</b> on wonderfully that way. I thought I had picked it up pretty quickly, but you jaw away as if you had been years at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Ay!” cried Richard, who {{happened}} to overhear the last of this speech between the notes of the wood-chopper’s song, which he was endeavoring to breathe aloud; “that was the starving-time,* Cousin Bess. I grew as lank as a weasel that fall, and my face was as pale as one of your fever-and-ague visages. Monsieur Le Quoi, there, fell away like a pumpkin in drying; nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> fairly over it yet, monsieur. Benjamin, I thought, bore it with a worse grace {{than any of the}} family; for he swore it was harder to endure than a short allowance in the calm latitudes. Benjamin is a sad fellow to swear if you starve him ever so little. I had half a mind to quit you then, ‘Duke, and to go into Pennsylvania to fatten; but, damn it, <b>thinks</b> <b>I,</b> we are sisters’ children, and I will live or die with him, after all.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I don't {{know what}} there is to explain. <b>I</b> suppose <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him drunk; I know what you thought that night. But he was pretty well loaded when he struck my champagne. It wasn't a {{question}} of {{what he was going to}} do any longer, but how he was going to do it. I kept an eye on him, and at the right time I helped the caterer's man to get him up into that room where he wouldn't make any trouble. I expected to go back and look after him, but I forgot him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, sir, you are {{lighter and}} more active than I am, and I was {{thinking}} that {{if you could get}} {{up to the top of}} this tree you would have a view down over the village. The leaves are pretty thick, and as the niggers are busy there is not much chance of their looking about for a man up a tree. You see the village ain’t above a hundred and fifty yards away, and the ground ain’t more than twenty feet above the river. I should say that this tree was seventy or eighty feet high, so that from the top you can get a view pretty well over the place; if there is one of our chaps there he may be lying tied up somewhere. Of course he might be in a hut, but it is much more likely that they would have just chucked him down until they wanted him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> on my shoulder you would be able to get hold of that lowest branch where it bends down, and climb along it to the trunk; after that the branches come pretty thick together.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The next day, Princess Fiona rises {{early and}} sings with a bluebird and dances with a deer (before making the bird explode and {{throwing}} the deer off a cliff). She assists the Pied Piper in his rat-charming duties ("Morning Person"). Shrek brings down her mood {{by attempting to}} give subtle hints about her groom-to-be ("Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply", [...] "He's very good at small talk", etc.) and mocking her tragic childhood circumstances. The two begin a contest of trying to one-up each other to outdo the others' backstory, but end up revealing their respective pasts ("I <b>Think</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>You</b> Beat"). Both admit to being thrown out by their parents; this connection, as well as bonding over a love of disgusting bodily noises, kindles friendship.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is there}} for us if we keep on and go away?" [...] she went on. [...] "All the big {{interests}} in our lives will vanish--everything. We shall become specialised people--people overshadowed by a situation. We shall be an elopement, a romance--all our breadth and meaning gone! People will always think of it first when they think of us; all our work and aims will be warped by it and subordinated to it. Is it good enough, dear? Just to specialise.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you.</b> We've <b>got</b> a case, a passionate case, the best of cases, but {{do we want to}} spend all our lives defending it and justifying it? And there's that other life. I know now you care for Margaret--you care more than <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> do. You have said fine things of her. I've watched you about her. Little things have dropped from you. She's given her life for you; she's nothing without you. You feel that to your marrow all the time you are thinking about these things. Oh, I'm not jealous, dear. I love you for loving her. I love you in relation to her. But there it is, an added weight against us, another thing worth saving." ...|$|R
6000|$|Finkelstein {{asserted}} that five dollars {{was not too}} great a sum, not for a really high-class lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided with connections {{of the very best}} quality. [...] "I always say--and believe me, I base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experience--the best is the cheapest in the long run. Of course if a fellow wants to be a Jew about it, he can get cheap junk, but in the long RUN, the cheapest thing is--the best you can get! Now you take here just th' other day: I got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I paid out a hundred and twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows would say that was too much--Lord, if the Old Folks--they live in one of these hick towns up-state and they simply can't get onto the way a city fellow's mind works, and then, of course, they're Jews, and they'd lie right down and die if they knew Sid had anted up a hundred and twenty-six bones. But I don't figure I was stuck, George, not a bit. Machine looks brand new now--not that it's so darned old, of course; had it less 'n three years, but I give it hard service; never drive less 'n a hundred miles on Sunday and, uh--Oh, <b>I</b> don't really <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> stuck, George. In the LONG run, the best is, you might say, it's unquestionably the cheapest." ...|$|R
