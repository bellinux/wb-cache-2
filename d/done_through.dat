5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be <b>done</b> <b>through</b> an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is <b>done</b> <b>through</b> a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is <b>done</b> <b>through</b> another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E

5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, and none of them were <b>done</b> <b>through</b> the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was <b>done</b> <b>through</b> the granting of citizenship.|$|E

Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have <b>done</b> <b>through</b> normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies <b>done</b> <b>through</b> the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C.

5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be <b>done</b> <b>through</b> various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most}} common types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E

The two initial tiers also include sub levels, and professors are promoted between them for merit. Monthly starting salary for a full-time assistant professorship is around R$ 10 thousand, and for a tenured position around R$15 thousand. Uniquely among public universities in Brazil, Unicamp has a career focused on full-time research. Currently there are approximately 100 full-time researchers at the university.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them.

Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E

In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the old building went through renovations.

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be <b>done</b> <b>through</b> an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be <b>done</b> <b>through</b> violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
