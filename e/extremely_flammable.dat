5|$|Tudor {{investigated}} various ice {{houses in}} 1805 {{and came to}} conclude they could be constructed above ground as well. His early ice houses in Cuba had inner and outer timber walls, insulated with peat and sawdust, with some form of a ventilation system, and these formed the basic design for ice houses {{during the rest of}} the century. By 1819, however, Tudor was also building ice houses from brick, able to hold more than 200 tons (200,000kg) of ice, using charcoal within the walls for insulation. By the 1840s, warehouses by the Pond were up to 36,000 square feet (3,300 square metres) in size, being built of brick to avoid the risk of fire from the new railroad line. The ice houses remained <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable,</b> however, and many caught fire, including Sydney's first ice house which was completely destroyed in 1862.|$|E
25|$|As a {{toxic gas}} that leaves no residue on items it contacts, {{ethylene}} oxide is a surface disinfectant that {{is widely used}} in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. It is so <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> and explosive that it {{is used as a}} main component of thermobaric weapons; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.|$|E
25|$|Methane is nontoxic, {{yet it is}} <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> and may form {{explosive}} mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant {{is much higher than}} the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E

40|$|The {{most devastating}} {{aircraft}} fuel related fires occur {{when there is}} a catastrophic failure of an aircraft wing or jet fuel tank {{as a result of a}} ground crash. The cause of these intense fires is the rapid atomization of fuel that produces a highly <b>flammable,</b> <b>extremely</b> explosive fuel-air mixture in the presence of an ignition source, and it is these intense fires that greatly reduce post crash survivability. In our efforts to develop fire safe fuels, a series of additives to jet fuel has been chosen that rely significantly on their chemical structure and composition to reduce fuel flammability by increasing droplet size during a wing tank failure. This presentation will discuss the methods utilized to evaluate the effect that specific chemical additives have on reducing the mist flammability characteristics of jet fuel and the influence of additive concentration on fuel drop size and fuel stability...|$|R
50|$|Many early motion {{pictures}} are lost because the nitrate film used {{in that era}} was <b>extremely</b> unstable and <b>flammable.</b> Additionally, many films were deliberately destroyed because they had little value in the era before home video. It has often been claimed that around 75% of silent films have been lost, though these estimates may be inaccurate {{due to a lack}} of numerical data. Major silent films presumed lost include Saved from the Titanic (1912), which featured survivors of the disaster; The Life of General Villa, starring Pancho Villa himself; The Apostle, the first animated feature film (1917); Cleopatra (1917); Gold Diggers (1923); Kiss Me Again (1925); Arirang (1926); The Great Gatsby (1926); London After Midnight (1927); and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1928). Though most lost silent films will never be recovered, some have been discovered in film archives or private collections. Discovered and preserved versions may be editions made for the home rental market of the 1920s and 1930s that are discovered in estate sales, etc.|$|R
25|$|Before he had {{a chance}} to start with the band, however, he nearly lost his life when the caravan he and his wife lived in caught fire when he knocked over a candle on his way to bed. His wife made {{artificial}} flowers from <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> celluloid. They caught fire, engulfing the wagon in flames almost immediately. Reinhardt dragged himself and his wife through the fire to safety, but suffered extensive burns on his left hand and other areas. He received first- and second-degree burns over half his body. His right leg was paralyzed, and the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand were badly burned. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again, and they intended to amputate one of his legs. Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{nanoparticles}} synthesis through {{biological processes}} is evolving {{a new era}} of research interests in nanotechnology. In usual methods silver nanoparticles are synthesized through chemical methods, having <b>extremely</b> toxic and <b>flammable</b> natures. Objectives: The aim {{of the present study was}} to synthesize silver nanoparticles, through the green method of utilizing Sesamum indicum (S. indicum) extract and to determine the potential antibacterial effects of the product against multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli). Materials and Methods: The formation and characterization of AgNPs (silver nanoparticles) were confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). All 30 strains of E. coli were isolated from urine cultures of hospitalized patients (Amir Al-Momenin Hospital, Zabol, South-Eastern Iran) with urinary tract infection, 2011 - 2012. The minimum inhibitory (MIC) concentrations were investigated by microdilution method. Results: The results showed that isolated E. coli were resistant to four different antimicrobial agents including ceftazidime (26. 6 %), cefixime (40 %), tetracycline (63. 3 %) and erythromycin (56. 6 %). The highest MIC value for produced nano silver in S. indicum seed extract, was 200 ppm, against five isolates of E. coli. Conclusions: Considering the sufficient antimicrobial activities of nanoparticles tested in this study, they are suggested for enterobacterial infection treatment, especially in hospital environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a colorless, <b>flammable,</b> <b>extremely</b> {{hazardous}} gas with a “rotten egg ” smell. The {{human body}} produces {{small amounts of}} H 2 S and uses it as a signaling molecule. The cocktail method {{was used to evaluate}} the influence of H 2 S on the activities of CYP 450 in rats, which were reflected by the changes of pharmacokinetic parameters of five specific probe drugs: bupropion, metroprolol, midazolam, omeprazole and tolbutamide, respectively. The rats were randomly divided into two groups, control group and H 2 S group. The H 2 S group rats were given 5 mg/kg NaHS by oral administration once a day for seven days. The mixture of five probes was given to rats through oral administration and the blood samples were obtained at a series of time-points through the caudal vein. The concentrations of probe drugs in rat plasma were measured by LC-MS. In comparing the H 2 S group with the control group, there was a statistically pharmacokinetics difference for midazolam and tolbutamide; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was decreased for midazolam (p < 0. 05) and increased for tolbutamide (p < 0. 05); while there was no statistical pharmacokinetics difference for bupropion, metroprolol and omeprazole.

2500|$|On May 11, 1984, eight teenage {{visitors}} {{were trapped in}} the Haunted Castle attraction, and died when it was destroyed by fire. [...] Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company Six Flags were subsequently indicted for aggravated manslaughter, accused of recklessly causing the deaths by taking inadequate precautions against a fire. [...] In the subsequent trial, the prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke alarms had been ignored. [...] The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was arson and that no precautions would have saved lives. [...] The trial jury found the defendants not guilty. A light bulb had burned out {{in one of the}} rooms of the attraction, and a 14-year-old boy lit a cigarette lighter to find his way through the darkness. The flame ignited some foam rubber padding which was used to protect people from bumping into a wall. A fire resulted, which quickly spread throughout the 17-trailer structure with the help of <b>extremely</b> <b>flammable</b> building materials.
