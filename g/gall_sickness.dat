40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the perceptions and knowledge of farmers of heat stress and tick resistance in cattle. A cross-sectional survey was conducted and 110 farmers in four villages in the sour and sweet velds of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa were interviewed. The associations among area (municipality), gender, age, level of education, employment and religion were computed using Chi-square tests. The majority of the respondents had on average 4 bulls, 4 cows, 4 heifers, 4 calves, and 4 oxen. Milk was considered as the major (28. 3 %) reason for keeping cattle. Most farmers owned non-descript (72. 6 %), and Nguni (45. 3 %) cattle because of their heat tolerance (54. 7 %), tick resistance (54. 7 %), and milking ability (28. 2 %) traits. Excessive panting (56. 6 %) and disease transmission (76 %) were regarded as the major effects of heat stress and tick infestation in cattle, respectively. About 50 % of the respondents agreed that hair length influences tick resistance and 47. 17 % considered coat colour when acquiring cattle. In the sampled areas, ticks were prevalent in the summer season (93 %), and 77. 36 % of the respondents use acaricides every fortnight. <b>Gall</b> <b>sickness</b> was reported to be a major problem in the cattle herds by 36. 79 % of the respondents. Our results showed that farmers in the two municipalities had knowledge of cattle adaptation to heat stress and tick resistance...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Different {{parts of}} Podocarpus henkelii {{have been used}} in many {{cultures}} around the world to treat ailments such as cholera, stomach diseases, rheumatism, cancer, canine distemper in dogs and <b>gall</b> <b>sickness</b> in cattle. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the biological activity and toxicity of isolated compounds from Podocarpus henkelii after an earlier study indicated a promising activity in crude extracts against viral pathogens of veterinary importance. METHODS: The antibacterial and antifungal activity of two biflavonoids 7, 4 ’, 7 ”, 4 ”’-tetramethoxy amentoflavone (TMA), isoginkgetin (IGG) and podocarpus flavone–A (PFA) isolated from the leaves of Podocarpus henkelii were determined using a serial microplate dilution method with tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. The cytotoxicity of compounds TMA and IGG were determined on different cell types using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric cellular assay (MTT). The Ames test was used to determine their mutagenic activities. RESULTS: TMA had reasonable antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus (MIC = 30 μg/ml). IGG had a wide spectrum of activity against four bacterial and two fungal pathogens with much higher selectivity index values obtained for A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans (SI > 30). PFA had a broad spectrum of activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (SI > 15) and less activity against the two fungal pathogens. In both the cytotoxicity assays and Ames mutagenicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100, TMA and IGG had no deleterious effect on the different cell types and did not induce mutations in the Ames test. CONCLUSION: Although the antimicrobial activities of the isolated compounds were not that exciting, the compounds had no cytotoxic activity at the highest concentration (1000 μg/ml) tested against all three cell lines. IGG was the most active against E. coli, S. aureus, A. fumigatus and C. neoformans, exhibiting both antibacterial and antifungal activity with good selectivity index values. PFA had a broad spectrum of activity against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. The two compounds isolated had low toxicity and no genotoxic activity in the Ames test.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine sheep production practices, constraints, flock dynamics, body condition and weight variation in two ecologically different resource-poor communal farming systems of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Mean sheep flock sizes per household were not significantly different between the two ecologically different areas (villages); Gaga (19. 0 ± 3. 10) and Sompondo (18. 3 ± 3. 10). Shortage of feed, disease and parasite were reported the most important constraints across the two villages. In both villages, sheep housing was poorly constructed using acacia brushwoods. Fewer farmers owned rams: the rams to ewes ratio for the two villages were 1 : 20, 1 : 19 for Gaga and Sompondo, respectively. The low ram: ewe ratios reported suggest that inbreeding might have been reducing productivity of their flocks. There was also uncontrolled breeding due to undefined and mating seasons. <b>Gall</b> <b>sickness,</b> heart water and footrot caused most of the sheep mortalities. Dohne Merinos were the common genotypes in the two villages. Total entrances for each flock were higher (p < 0. 05) in hot-dry season and hot-wet season than in other seasons. Most of the entrances were lambs and were born in hot-dry season (September) and cool-dry season (June) for larger flocks (10. 90 ± 3. 02) and for small flocks (3. 65 ± 3. 02). High lamb mortalities were experienced in the post-rainy (April) and hot-wet (December) season. There was a significant interaction between season and flock size. Most of the sales occurred in the hot-wet season. Ecological area had significant effect on sheep production potential (p < 0. 05) in both flock classes. The average sheep production efficiency (SPE) value for Gaga and Sompondo were 0. 50 ± 0. 116 and 0. 50 ± 0. 096 respectively. The SPE for large flock was higher (p < 0. 05) by season and flock size. Large flocks had a higher (p < 0. 05) SPE values and the SPE ranged from 1. 11 ± 0. 193 in April, a post-rainy season month to 1. 55 ± 0. 193 in December, a hot-wet season month. Lamb mortalities constituted the greater part of outflows. High lamb mortalities occurred in hot-wet (December), hot-dry (September) and post-rainy (April) seasons. There was a significant interaction between season and age of sheep on body weight of sheep. Highest (p < 0. 05) body weights were recorded in the post-rainy and autumn season in both lambs and ewes. It is therefore very important to come up with affordable interventions which take into play ecological differences of the areas for improved nutritional status of sheep in communal areas which will lead to improved sheep productivity and the poor-resourced farmer human nutritional and livelihood...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} tick-borne diseases (TBDs) occurring in Zambia that affect domestic animals, particularly cattle and small ruminants, are theileriosis (East Coast fever and Corridor disease), anaplasmosis (<b>gall</b> <b>sickness),</b> babesiosis (red water), and heartwater (cowdriosis). Of these, theileriosis is the {{most important}}, causing significantly more deaths than the other tick-borne diseases combined. Despite their importance, {{little is known about}} the occurrence and prevalence of haemoparasites in cattle in the communal areas of Zambia. Clinical signs and post mortem lesions are pathognomonic of mixed tick-borne infections especially babesiosis, anaplasmosis and East Coast fever (ECF). The main objective of this study was, therefore, to screen selected communal herds of cattle for tick-borne haemoparasites and identify the tick vectors associated with the high cattle mortalities due to suspected TBDs in the local breeds of cattle grazing along the banks of the Chambeshi River in Mungwi, Zambia. East Coast fever is endemic to the district of Mungwi, Northern Province, Zambia and vector control using acaricides has proved to be very costly for the small scale farmers. Also, Mungwi experiences increased cattle mortalities between December to March and May to July. All age groups of cattle are affected. A total of 299 cattle blood samples were collected from July to September 2010 from Kapamba (n= 50), Chifulo (n= 102), Chisanga (n= 38), Kowa (n= 95) and Mungwi central (n= 14) in the Mungwi District, Northern Province, Zambia. Ticks were also collected from the sampled cattle from April to July 2011. DNA was extracted and the parasite hypervariable region of the small subunit rRNA gene was amplified and subjected to the reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay. The results of the RLB assay revealed the presence of tick-borne haemoparasites in 259 samples occurring either as single or mixed infections. The most prevalent species present were the benign Theileria mutans (54. 5 %) and T. velifera (51. 5 %). Anaplasma marginale (25. 7 %), Babesia bovis (7. 7 %) and B. bigemina (3. 3 %) were also detected in the samples. Nine percent of the samples tested negative for the presence of haemoparasites. In a number of samples (4 %) the PCR products failed to hybridize with any species-specific probes but hybridized only with the genus-specific probes which could suggest the presence of a novel species or variant of a species. Of the four Theileria species known to occur in Zambia (T. parva, T. mutans, T. velifera and T. taurotragi), T. parva {{is the most}} economically important, causing Corridor disease in the Southern, Central, Lusaka and the Copper-belt provinces, while causing ECF in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Zambia. In our study, only one sample (from Kapamba) tested positive for the presence of T. parva. This was an unexpected finding; also because the tick vector, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, was identified on animals from Kowa (14 %), Chisanga (8. 5 %), Chifulo (6 %) and Kapamba (1. 4 %). We can only speculate that the RLB hybridization assay may not have been able to detect the parasite in the animals sampled due to a too low parasitaemia. The samples should also be subjected to the T. parva specific real-time PCR assay to determine a more accurate T. parva prevalence in cattle in the Mungwi district, Northern Province. In Zambia, Babesia bovis and B. bigemina are recognized as being of economic importance in cattle. In our study, B. bovis was present in 7. 7 % of the sampled animals and B. bigemina in 3. 3 % of the animals. We detected B. bovis in all of the five sampled areas with the highest detection in Mungwi central (14. 3 %) and Kowa (10. 5 %). As expected, the tick vector Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus was identified from animals from all of these areas. Babesia bigemina was only reported from Kowa (10. 5 %). The most abundant ticks identified from the sampled animals from Kowa were Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus (36. 3 %) and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (8. 8 %). These tick vectors have been implicated in the transmission of B. bigemina. Our findings are in concordance with results obtained by other authors who have speculated that an increase in the detection of B. bovis may indicate that B. bovis is becoming endemic in this part of the country. This could be due to uncontrolled movement of cattle that frequently occurs within Zambia. Heartwater (cowdriosis) is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium, a rickettsial disease that affects domestic and wild ruminants. In Zambia, heartwater is mainly a disease of cattle, although outbreaks in sheep and goats have been reported and recorded. In our study, only one sample (from Kapamba) tested positive for the presence of E. ruminantium even though Amblyomma variegatum ticks were identified from 52. 9 % of the sampled animals from all study areas. The cattle sampled in our study are not regularly dipped and no game has been spotted in cattle grazing areas. It is possible that these cattle may have attained a state of endemic stability to heartwater. It is also possible that the RLB hybridization assay may not have been sensitive enough to detect E. ruminantium infections if the parasitaemia was very low. Samples should also be subjected to the E. ruminantium-specific pCS 20 real-time PCR assay to determine more accurately the E. ruminantium prevalence in cattle in the Mungwi district, Northern Province. Anaplasma marginale (the causative agent of bovine anaplasmosis) has previously been shown to be present in all the provinces of Zambia and is the only Anaplasma species of importance to cattle in Zambia. In our study, 25. 7 % of the sampled cattle tested positive for A. marginale; it was detected in all areas except Chisanga. Amblyomma variegatum was identified from 52. 9 % of the sampled cattle, and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus from 12. 1 % of the cattle. Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus has been incriminated as being a vector of A. marginale. Furthermore, three samples (from Kowa) tested positive for the presence of Anaplasma centrale. To our knowledge, no vaccination regime using A. centrale is being conducted in the Mungwi district of Zambia. The presence of A. centrale is, therefore, an interesting finding. The results of our study suggest that the cause of cattle mortalities in Mungwi during the winter outbreaks is mainly due to A. marginale, B. bovis and B. bigemina infections. This was confirmed by the results of the RLB hybridization assay, clinical manifestation of the disease in the affected cattle (own observation) and the tick species identified on the animals. It appears that in Mungwi, babesiosis due to B. bovis mostly infects cattle above one year of age. Calves appear to be less affected by B. bovis infection. There is need for further epidemiological surveys in Mungwi district, Northern Province, Zambia to get a better understanding of the epidemiology of these tick-borne haemoparasites affecting cattle. We conclude that integrated control policies should be developed to take account of multi-species pathogen communities that are commonly associated with clinical and sub-clinical TBD infections in Zambia.
