40|$|According to {{the motor}} vehicle {{directive}} of the European Community, as of January 2017 new cars {{will only be}} allowed to use air conditioning systems with refrigerants of GWP below 150. A moratorium to significantly extend this deadline {{is not to be}} expected considering the recently negotiated F-Gas-Regulation. One option will be flammable refrigerants of the ASHRAE classification A 3 or a future classification A 2 L. However they are subject to safety reservations when used in systems with direct evaporation. R 744 requires for a wide use and a complete realization with development, industrialization and validation probably more time than the remaining available time horizon. Therefore an option shall be discussed, which is based on a hybrid solution with R 744 and a flammable refrigerant and which may allow a sufficiently rapid implementation. The utilization of R 744 refrigerant mixtures shall not be considered. Instead a small and compact refrigerant loop will be operated with A 3 or A 2 L refrigerants. Compactness, leak tightness and significant reduced charge amounts already contribute to the enhanced safety. R 744 will be used as a secondary refrigerant. For the distribution in branched systems, new approaches have to be discussed. Additional safety aspects arising from the use of R 744 as secondary refrigerant {{and at the same time}} in the function as fire <b>extinguishing</b> medium. <b>Efficiency,</b> safety, time-to-market and scenarios for the possible full transition to R 744 as a refrigerant will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of biomass}} burn-produced trace gases were {{obtained}} using a helicopter at low altitudes above burning Florida wetlands on November 9, 1987, and from both helicopter and light-aircraft samplings on November 7, 1988. Carbon dioxide normalized emission ratios for carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, total nonmethane hydrocarbons, and nitrous oxide were obtained over burning graminoid wetlands consisting primarily of Spartina bakeri and Juncus roemerianus. Some interspersed scrub oak and saw palmetto were also burned. No {{significant differences were}} observed in the emission ratios determined for these gases from samples collected over flaming, mixed, and smoldering phases of combustion during the 1987 fire. Combustion-categorized differences in emission ratios were small for the 1988 fire. Combustion efficiency was relatively good (low emission ratios for reduced gases) for both fires. It is believed that the consistently low emission ratios were a unique result of graminoid wetlands fires, in which the grasses and rushes burned rapidly down to standing water and were quickly <b>extinguished.</b> Consequently, the <b>efficiency</b> of the combustion was good and the amount and duration of smoldering combustion was greatly deminished...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe State Key Laboratory of Fire Science {{has been}} {{investigating}} bromofluoroalkenes as Halon replacements for several years. One of the leading candidate agents of bromofluoroalkenes is monobromotrifluoropropene, (CF 3 CBrCH 2, CAS Code 1514 - 82 - 5) for its high fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> and short atmospheric lifetime. In this paper, a synthesize method for CF 3 CBrCH 2 is studied and the purity of synthesized production is measured by Gas Chromatograph-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer above all. And then, the conformer, bond length and bond angle of CF 3 CBrCH 2 are calculated by ab initio method. According to calculation results, possible decomposed products in high temperature and chemical fire-extinguishing mechanisms in flame are discussed. Finally, {{in order to make}} CF 3 CBrCH 2 release fire protection area easily, nitrogen is mixed with it to form binary fire extinguishing agent. The fire suppression ability of binary fire- extinguishing agent of nitrogen and CF 3 CBrCH 2 is measured in a confined room. From experimental results, it is concluded that the binary fire extinguishing agent of nitrogen and CF 3 CBrCH 2 owns higher fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> and its spray characteristics are perfect, so {{it is a kind of}} potential Halon alternatives...|$|E

In this paper, a numerical simulation method is introduced to investigate the effect of water mist size, velocity and flow rateon the fire suppressionefficiencyin microgravity. The fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> is better for the finer water mist in microgravity due to better heat transfer and more rapid vaporization. The evaporation cooling is the dominant mechanism of fire suppression in microgravity. As for the water mist velocity, the performance of fire suppression is affected slightly in microgravity.

Therefore, in this paper, extinguishing experiments of kerosene fire was carried out with water mist which was charged by a corona discharge in a small-scale and confined space. Water mists with different charge-to-mass ratios was obtained by changing the voltage. The effects on extinguishing time, flame temperature and flame image changes were analyzed. The experiments show that the charged water mist can effectively reduce the extinguishing time, flame temperature and inhibit flame compared with the ordinary water mist.

To intellectualize them and improve the water usability and <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{it is necessary to}} realize the closed-loop control of the landing position of the water jet out from the monitors in order to let the water jet reach the fire point as fast as possible. According to the characteristics of the adjusting mechanism of fire monitors, combing with the new theoretical model for their water jet track, the closed-loop control procedure is simulated. The results show that the water jet can reach the ignition point after only several adjustments. The effective control procedure simulation paves a sound basis for the closed-loop control of the landing position of the water jet out from water fire monitors...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the water}} is the most famous, non-ozone {{depleting}} and effective agent in fire fighting, a water mist is noticed as favorable one of halon alternatives. There are many studies on a fire extinguishing system of the water mist. However, further studies are required on a fire extinguishing effect of the mist for its better application. Except hydrodynamic properties of the mist in extinguishing fire, {{it is important to}} know fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of water vapor that has been assumed to have only thermal effect as a fire suppressant. There is not enough data about such fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the vapor. In the study, reducing effect of the vapor for flammable regions of methane and propane was measured at 80 °C. The authors used a tubular burner system to measure the limits under well-defined conditions of flame stretch and temperature. The effect was compared with a reducing effect of carbon dioxide at 80 °C and 25 °C. Experimental results showed that fire extinguishing effect of the vapor is the same as carbon dioxide for both methane and propane. Since calculated flame temperatures of the mixtures with the vapor are apparently higher than the temperatures of mixtures with carbon dioxide at extinction conditions, the chemical suppression efficiency of the vapor is superior to that of carbon dioxide. This result is attributed to the larger third body effect of water vapor than carbon dioxide in the reaction H + O 2 + M = HO 2 + M. From the result and thermal properties of water, we can estimate required mass per unit volume of water vapor to extinguish n-heptanes flame. The required mass per unit volume is 162 g/m 3, and it is about 0. 6 times of required mass per unit volume of halon 1301. The facts show that water mist is a high-performance agent, since the water mist has large latent heat...|$|E

By {{way of the}} especially designed spraying device in the 3 rd generation fire truck, the extinguishing agents mixed with compressed gas uniformly, are spraying to fire fields in microdots with high speed and high flux. The extinguishing agents’ microdots with high kinematic energy can penetrate into the flame and affront the flame with more interface areas. The <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> is improved significantly consequently. In a fire fighting by the 3 rd generation fire truck, fire can be extinguished more quickly, larger field of fire can be controlled, water damage and environmental pollution is decreased too.

40|$|As a {{suitable}} {{candidate for the}} next halon alternative gaseous fire-extinguishing agent, it is very meaningful to investigate how to improve the fire-extinguishing capacity of hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents for local fires. When fire breaks out, the actual fire location is unpredictable, and the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of hot aerosol extinguishing agent will be observably affected by the fire locations due to different flame patterns and intensities at different fire locations. In this work, {{the use of the}} hot aerosol extinguishing agent in suppressing oil fires at different locations, including open, partially open, and fully closed locations, has been investigated in order to obtain the regularity of the effectiveness of the hot aerosol extinguishing agent in suppressing a local fire. The results have shown that the hot aerosol extinguishing agent is more effective in suppressing an oil fire in a fully closed system than in an open system or partially open system. The shortest fire-extinguishing time was for the fire in the corner, followed by the one in the middle, and the fire against the wall took the longest time to extinguish for fire locations in a partially open system and a fully closed system, respectively. In addition, the fire extinguishing process involves varying degrees of flame enhancements. Sredstva za gašenje požara vrućim aerosolom moguća su zamjena za halone.
