40|$|The {{comparison}} of groups in regression models for binary outcomes {{is complicated by}} an identification problem inherent in these models. Traditional tests of the <b>equality</b> of <b>coefficients</b> across groups confound {{the magnitude of the}} regression coefficients with residual variation. If the amount of residual variation differs between groups, the test can lead to incorrect conclusions (Allison 1999). Allison proposes a test for the <b>equality</b> of regression <b>coefficients</b> that removes the effect of group differences in residual variation by adding the assumption that the regression coefficients for some variables are identical across groups. In practice, a researcher is unlikely to have either empirical or theoretical justification for this assumption, in which case the Allison’s test can also lead to incorrect conclusions. An alternative approach, suggested here, uses predicted probabilities. Since predicted probabilities are unaffected by residual variation, tests of the equality of predicted probabilities across groups can be used for group comparisons without assuming the equality of the regression coefficients of some variables. Using predicted probabilities requires researchers to think differently about comparing groups. With tests of the <b>equality</b> of regression <b>coefficients,</b> a single test lets the researcher conclude easily whether the effects of a variable are equal across groups. Testing the equality of predicted probabilities requires multiple tests since group differences in predictions vary with the levels of the variables in the model. A researcher must examine group differences in predictions at multiple levels of the variables often requiring more complex conclusions on how groups differ in the effect of a variable...|$|R

That is, only with a few exceptions, in the case of own-price elasticity (textiles and rubber and plastic, furniture and rubber and plastics, and furniture with metal products), the results suggest that conditional demand for permanent skilled workers is homogeneous. Differences in output elasticity are found between chemicals and subsectors such as apparel, metal products, and furniture, while in the TFP elasticity the difference of chemical sector is with apparel. Thus, for this type of labour force, chemical shows significant differences in output and TFP elasticities. In the case of unskilled permanents workers, the results are diverse and heterogeneity seems to be a property. Differences are found mainly in the own-price elasticity of textile and mineral products subsectors (not shown).|$|R

This paper {{provides}} further {{empirical evidence}} {{of the validity of}} environmental benefits transfer based on CV studies by expanding the analysis to include control factors which have not been accounted for in previous studies.

Traditional population characteristics were taken into account, but these variables do not explain why respondents from the same socio-economic group may still hold different beliefs, norms or values and hence have different attitudes and consequently state different WTP amounts. The test results are mixed. The function transfer approach is valid in one case, but is rejected in the 3 other cases investigated in this paper. We provide further evidence {{that in the case of}} statistically valid benefits transfer, the function approach results in a more robust benefits transfer than the unit value approach. We also show that the <b>equality</b> of <b>coefficient</b> estimates is a necessary, but insufficient condition for valid benefit function transfer and discuss the implications for previous and future validity testing...|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} {{patterns}} emerge. The {{relationship between the}} pay gap and the hourly wage quantiles is generally negative. This finding is also observed in previous studies, such as Mueller (1998) for Canada and Lucifora and Meurs (2006) for Italy, France and the UK. As shown in Table  2, interesting points of detail can be discerned. Many countries have individually significant and positive gaps at the lowest quantiles, which decline and turn insignificant or even negative at higher quantiles (Cyprus, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Denmark, and the UK). For Bulgaria, Finland, Lithuania, Sweden, Slovenia, and Denmark, the coefficient on Public is individually insignificant at all quantiles except at the lowest part of the distribution, where the public sector is shown to pay significantly more than the private sector. The pattern is more complex in some countries, where a positive and individually significant gap for all quantiles is higher {{in the middle of}} the distribution at q 25 to q 50 (Czech Republic, Spain, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, and Portugal). Belgium and Norway have negative or insignificant gaps for all quantiles, which become more negative and individually significantly different from zero at the highest quantiles. Austria has individually insignificant public sector coefficients at all points of the distribution. In the case of Austria and Belgium, the F test does not reject the <b>equality</b> of <b>coefficients.</b> Finally, Romania is the only country where the gap is smallest and insignificant at the lowest quantile, while positive and significant at higher quantiles; however, the F test accepts <b>coefficient</b> <b>equality.</b> Table  2 provides further details.
