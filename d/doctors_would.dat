5|$|On 11 October 2012, a {{panel of}} Pakistani and British doctors decided to move Yousafzai to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. Mumtaz Khan, a doctor, {{said that she had}} a 70% chance of survival. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Yousafzai would be moved to Germany, where she could receive the best medical treatment, as soon as she was stable enough to travel. A team of <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> travel with her, and the {{government}} would bear the expenditures of her treatment. Doctors reduced Yousafzai's sedation on 13 October, and she moved all four limbs.|$|E
5|$|This was the {{original}} idea for the story to open the tenth season. This story took aspects from The Seventh Seal, with the ruler of the Time Lords playing a variation of Chess with Death, who was leading a Federation of Evil. The three <b>Doctors</b> <b>would</b> get transported to an Underworld-like realm, where they would face such creatures of evil like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was deemed too expensive and not suitable for a family show.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E

5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|On the April 11, 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, Edge gave an {{emotional}} speech about {{his career and}} the realities of wrestling. He said he took further tests to his basic-strength tests, and an MRI result forced him to retire. Leading up to this announcement, he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and felt numbness in his arms. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than it being too late.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to numerous educational advances, Aristide and Lavalas {{embarked on an}} ambitious plan to develop the public primary health care system with Cuban assistance. Since the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Georges in 1998, Cuba entered a humanitarian agreement with Haiti whereby Haitian <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be trained in Cuba, and Cuban <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> work in rural areas. At the time of 2010 Haiti earthquake, 573 doctors had been trained in Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the mid 20th century, upon {{graduation}} Australian doctors {{spent time}} in general practice. A medical career usually included completing an intern year immediately after graduation as a resident in a major teaching hospital. After {{a period of time}} in general practice, some <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> seek specialist qualifications. Possibly reflecting the historical origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, these <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> travel overseas, most often to the UK, to specialise and then return to establish practice.|$|E
25|$|The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Bill {{became law}} in November 1961, {{and the medical}} society {{announced}} <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> refuse to participate, complaining that it would bring regimentation and would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. The doctors even went on strike {{for a few weeks}} in July 1962, but returned when new legislation allowed them to practise outside the system. Eventually the Saskatchewan plan was so popular that in 1968 the federal government extended it nationwide.|$|E
25|$|In July, it was {{announced}} that Taiwanese <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be providing free medical care to Solomon Islands villagers, and that unskilled Solomon Islands workers would be granted access to the Taiwanese labour market. At the same time, Taiwan was funding rural development projects in the Solomons. Taiwan has also pledged to provide SI$10million to Solomon Islands in 2009 and 2010, to enable the government to abolish school fees paid by parents and provide free primary and secondary education to Solomon Islands children.|$|E

25|$|The inquiry further {{found that}} Clarke had {{subsequently}} lied about this medical history, both when {{he applied for}} a Large Goods Vehicle (LGV) licence from the DVLA in Swansea and in his job application to Glasgow City Council. As a result, Clarke was suspended by the council on 6 August 2015. In giving evidence the DVLA admitted its self-declaration system had a weakness, since it allowed applicants to be assessed by either an employer-appointed occupational-health doctor or their own GP, and occupational-health <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> not usually {{have access to the}} applicant's medical records.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 1995, Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis {{announced}} that Greece would be sending humanitarian aid consisting of medicine, food, and clothing to Serbian refugees from Krajina. The first two planes carrying the aid left on 8 August. Greece also {{announced that}} Greek <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> {{be sent to}} the region and that some of the wounded would be allowed to be treated at Greek military hospitals. Regarding the conflict itself, the government criticized the West for its role. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias condemned the Croatian offensive and Deputy Foreign Minister for European Affairs Georgios Alexandros Mangakis criticized the United States and Germany for backing Croatia's offensive against the Krajina Serbs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make us want to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E

[...] But even with Briscoe's care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert with his eyes which now have a feral and cunning aspect. Briscoe also discovers a strangely disfigured place on his shoulder, and notices changes in his face which suggest some sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints resemble those of nothing human.|$|E
500|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto was hospitalised {{repeatedly}} for stroke, heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute {{him as his}} lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial. [...] Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial. One physician, Brigadier-General Dr Marjo Subiandono, stated his doubts about by noting that [...] " [...] has two permanent cerebral defects." [...] In a later Financial Times report, Attorney General Abdurrahman discussed the re-examination, and called it part of a [...] "last opportunity" [...] to prosecute Suharto criminally. Attorney General Abdurrahman left open the possibility of filing suit against the Suharto estate." ...|$|E
500|$|Scheiber and Cohn {{rejected}} critical {{assessments of}} the law's deficit impact, arguing that predictions were biased towards underestimating deficit reduction. They noted that for example, {{it is easier to}} account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than account for savings from preventive healthcare, and that the CBO had a track record of overestimating costs and underestimating savings of health legislation; stating, [...] "innovations in the delivery of medical care, like greater use of electronic medical records and financial incentives for more coordination of care among <b>doctors,</b> <b>would</b> produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses... But the CBO would not consider such savings in its calculations, because the innovations hadn't really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one another—and that meant there wasn't much hard data to prove the savings would materialize." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 14, 1990, {{before the}} start of Favre's senior year at Southern Miss, he was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated and rushed to the hospital. In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him. [...] "All I kept asking [...] was 'Will I be able to play football again?'" [...] Favre recalled later. <b>Doctors</b> <b>would</b> later remove 30 inches (76cm) of Favre's small intestine. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama. Alabama coach Gene Stallings said, [...] "You can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to. I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator David Shore {{traced the}} concept for House to his {{background}} as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that [...] "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [...] and I {{thought that it would}} be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room." [...] In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were [...] "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question [...] "Why am I wasting your time?".|$|E

The Solomons’ Minister of Foreign Affairs Patterson Oti said that Solomon Islander <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> [...] "learn from their Cuban colleagues in specialized areas". In addition to providing doctors, Cuba provided scholarships for 50 Solomon Islanders to study medicine in Cuba for free. According to a spokesman for the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health, the Solomons are [...] "desperately in need" [...] of doctors, and hence grateful to Cuba for its [...] "much needed assistance".|$|E
