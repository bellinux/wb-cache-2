In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E
