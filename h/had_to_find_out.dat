500|$|During the Closed Beta of PlayStation Home on October 11, 2008, Naughty Dog {{released}} an Uncharted themed game space for PlayStation Home. This space is [...] "Sully's Bar" [...] from the game. In this space users {{can play an}} arcade mini-game called [...] "Mercenary Madness", which during the Closed Beta, there were rewards. The rewards were removed {{with the release of}} the Home Open Beta. There are also three other rooms in this space, in which during the Closed Beta, users <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> codes to the doors that accessed these rooms. The code entry to the rooms was also removed with the release of the Home Open Beta. The three other rooms are the [...] "Artifact Room", [...] "Archives", and [...] "Smuggler's Den". There is an artifact viewer in the Archives and Smuggler's Den rooms. Also in the Archives there is a video screen that previews Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. The Artifact Room only features seating and different artifacts for users to look at. This space {{was one of the first}} five-game spaces of the PlayStation Home Open Beta in North America, which Home went Open Beta on December 11, 2008. This space was released to the European version on November 5, 2009, almost a year after the Open Beta release. Naughty Dog has also released a game space for Uncharted's sequel on October 23, 2009 making Uncharted the first game series to have a game space for both games in its series.|$|E
2500|$|The work of Abramović and Ulay {{tested the}} {{physical}} {{limits of the}} body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramović herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramović/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: [...] "The main problem in this relationship was {{what to do with the}} two artists' egos. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self." ...|$|E
60|$|But the glider {{brought me}} up smartly. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> {{how these things}} went down the air, {{and the only way}} to find out is to go down with one. And for a time I wouldn't face it.|$|E

"Just then 'Squire Owl, who {{had been}} awakened by the disturbance, came out to learn what the matter was, but Mr. Crow was so frightened that he couldn't give him the least little bit of information, and the 'Squire <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> for himself. Being near-sighted in the daytime, {{it was quite a}} while before he saw Mr. Turtle's head, and then he cried out angrily: ...|$|E

[...] "I {{had just returned from}} Delft, where I had business to transact and I recognized Jan beside the sledge into which the jongejuffrouw was stepping even then. He had ten or a dozen men with him. I felt that they meant mischief--but I had to follow ... I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> whither they were taking her...." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} head to {{consider}} a noise overhead--the faint, domestic thunder of a sewing-machine shaking the walls with its rhythm. The machine stopped. She heard the noise of scissors dropped on the floor--the most stuffily domestic sound in the world. The airless house was crushing her. She sprang up--and then she sat down again. There {{was no place to}} which she could flee. Henry Carson and the district school were menacing her. And meantime she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what her mother was sewing--whether she had again been wasting money in buying mourning.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{initiated}} situation. Father and son where {{asked to}} play the riddles. Most of the time, the father is posing the question and the son <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> {{what is meant by}} the short description. Riddles are played in the following manner in Bezen: one person describes shortly a situation. The description is usually abstract. The other player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out,</b> what the description refers to. If he or she fails, he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> announce the sacrifice of a neighbouring village head. This village head and his community are then tortured verbally by the person who had posed the question...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{know of a}} good game,” {{said the}} elder Wrotsley innocently. “The fellows leave the room and think of a word; then they come back again, and the girls <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what the word is.” ...|$|R
60|$|James {{looked at}} his daughter-in-law. That unseen glance of his was cold and dubious. Appeal and fear were in it, {{and a sense of}} {{personal}} grievance. Why should he be worried like this? It was very likely all nonsense; women were funny things! They exaggerated so, you didn't know what to believe; and then, nobody told him anything, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> everything for himself. Again he looked furtively at Irene, and across from her to Soames. The latter, listening to Aunt Juley, was looking up, under his brows in the direction of Bosinney.|$|E
60|$|So Peter <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> {{many things}} for himself. He often played ships at the Round Pond, but his ship {{was only a}} hoop which he had found on the grass. Of course, {{he had never seen}} a hoop, and he {{wondered}} what you play at with them, and decided that you play at pretending they are boats. This hoop always sank at once, but he waded in for it, and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond, and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops.|$|E
6000|$|With this Jenny Wren {{disappeared}} {{inside her}} house, {{and there was}} nothing for Peter to do but once more start for the dear Old Briar-patch. On his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the Green Forest, which was just beyond the Old Orchard. He just <b>HAD</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if there was anything new over there. Hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying, [...] "Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee!" [...] Peter chuckled happily. [...] "I declare, there's Pee-wee," [...] he cried. [...] "He usually {{is one of the last}} of the Flycatcher family to arrive. I didn't expect to find him yet. I wonder what has brought him up so early." ...|$|E

60|$|For seamen {{have been}} forced, {{by the nature}} of their calling, to be {{scientific}} men. From the very earliest ages in which the first canoe put out to sea, the mariner has been educated by the most practical of all schoolmasters, namely, danger. He has carried his life in his hand day and night; he has had to battle with the most formidable and the most seemingly capricious of the brute powers of nature; with storms, with ice, with currents, with unknown rocks and shoals, with the vicissitudes of climate, and the terrible and seemingly miraculous diseases which change of climate engenders. He has had to fight Nature; and to conquer her, if he could, by understanding her; by observing facts, and by facing facts. He dared not, like a scholar in his study, indulge in theories and fancies about how things ought to be. He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> how they really were. He dared not say, According to my theory of the universe this current ought to run in such a direction; he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> which way it did actually run, according to God's method of the universe, lest it should run him ashore. Everywhere, I say, and all day long, the seaman has to observe facts and to use facts, unless he intends to be drowned; and therefore, so far from being a superstitious man, who refuses to inquire into facts, but puts vain dreams in their stead, the sailor is for the most part a very scientific-minded man: observant, patient, accurate, truthful; conquering Nature, as the great saying is, because he obeys her.|$|E
60|$|When Peter's {{stomach was}} stuffed full {{he gave a}} great sigh of relief and limped back to the {{friendly}} old bramble-bush to rest. But he couldn't sit still long, for he just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> all about the Old Pasture. So pretty soon he started out to explore. Such a wonderful place as it seemed to Peter! There were clumps of bushes with little open spaces between, just the nicest kind of playgrounds. Then there were funny spreading, prickly juniper-trees, which made the very safest places to crawl out of harm's way and to hide. Everywhere were paths made by cows. Very wonderful they seemed to Peter, who had never seen any like them before. He liked to follow them because they led {{to all kinds of}} queer places.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Hooty and Mrs. Hooty, at their hooked bills and great claws, {{and decided that}} he would take a stout stick along with him. He had no desire to feel these great claws. When he had found a stick to suit him, he began to climb the tree. Hooty and Mrs. Hooty snapped their bills and hissed fiercely. They drew nearer. Farmer Brown's boy kept a watchful eye on them. They looked so big and fierce that he was almost tempted to give up and leave them in peace. But he just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if there was {{anything}} in that nest, so he kept on. As he drew near it, Mrs. Hooty swooped very near to him, and the snap of her bill made an ugly sound. He held his stick ready to strike and kept on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sure I {{did not say}} {{anything}} wrong,' said Jane, 'and I suppose it is like that. A gentleman <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> whom he likes best. And as he liked Miss Bolton best, I think it's a thousand pities they should be parted.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, then, you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out,</b> my pretty one," [...] he said decisively, [...] "for it <b>has</b> got <b>to</b> be done somehow, or {{that gold}} watch we {{spoke of the}} other day will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to {{somebody}} else. And you know when I say a thing I mean it. Eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was at Suva, in the Fijis, that I {{discharged}} {{my third}} and last captain {{and took up}} gain the role of amateur navigator. I had essayed it once before, under my first captain, who, out of San Francisco, jumped the Snark so amazingly over the chart that I really <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what was doing. It was fairly easy to find out, for we had a run of twenty-one hundred miles before us. I knew nothing of navigation; but, after several hours of reading up and half an hour's practice with the sextant, I {{was able to find}} the Snark's latitude by meridian observation and her longitude by the simple method known as [...] "equal altitudes." [...] This is not a correct method. It is not even a safe method, but my captain was attempting to navigate by it, and {{he was the only one}} on board who should have been able to tell me that it was a method to be eschewed. I brought the Snark to Hawaii, but the conditions favoured me. The sun was in northern declination and nearly overhead. The legitimate [...] "chronometer-sight" [...] method of ascertaining the longitude I had not heard of--yes, I had heard of it. My first captain mentioned it vaguely, but after one or two attempts at practice of it he mentioned it no more.|$|E
60|$|TOMARCHER, I am now a {{distinguished}} litterytour, {{but that was}} not the real bent of my genius. I was the best player of hide-and-seek going; not a good runner, I was up to every shift and dodge, I could jink very well, I could crawl without any noise through leaves, I could hide under a carrot plant, it used to be my favourite boast that I always walked into the den. You may care to hear, Tomarcher, about the children in these parts; their parents obey them, they do not obey their parents; and I am sorry to tell you (for I dare say you are already thinking the idea a good one) that it does not pay one halfpenny. There are three sorts of civilisation, Tomarcher: the real old-fashioned one, in which children either <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> how to please their dear papas, or their dear papas cut their heads off. This style did very well, but is now out of fashion. Then the modern European style: in which children have to behave reasonably well, and go to school and say their prayers, or their dear papas will know the reason why. This does fairly well. Then there is the South Sea Island plan, which does not do one bit. The children beat their parents here; it does not make their parents any better; so do not try it.|$|E
