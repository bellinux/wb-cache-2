5000|$|<b>Gyttja</b> (sometimes Gytta) is a mud {{formed from}} the partial decay of peat. It {{is black and}} has a gel-like consistency. Aerobic {{digestion}} of the peat by bacteria forms humic acid [...] and reduces the peat in the first oxygenated metre (generally 0.5 metre) of the peat column. As the peat is buried under new peat or soil the oxygen is reduced, often by water logging, and further degradation by anaerobic microbes, anaerobic digestion can produce <b>gyttja.</b> The <b>gyttja</b> then slowly drains {{to the bottom of}} the column. It pools at the bottom of the peat column, about 10 m below the surface or wherever it is stopped by e.g. compacted soil/peat, bedrock, or permafrost. <b>Gyttja</b> accumulates as long as new material is added to the top of the column and the conditions are right for anaerobic degradation of the peat. <b>Gyttja</b> can form in layers reflecting changes in the environment as with other sedimentary rock. <b>Gyttja</b> is the part of peat that forms coal, but it must be buried under thousands of meters for coalification to occur because it has to be hot enough to drive off the water it contains.

50|$|Along {{the coast}} of Hjarnø, archaeologists have {{discovered}} several finds that indicate previous coastline settlement by people of the Mesolithic Stone Age. Due {{to changes in the}} shoreline caused {{by the end of the}} Ice Age, many of these settlements were submerged and therefore preserved. Although the relieved weight of the melted ice has led to most of Denmark’s shores rising, around Horsens Fjord, which sits in an area that is sinking due to fracture lines in the earth’s plates, the coastline is instead falling. This depression of the coastline has resulted in the trapping of many artifacts in an anaerobic environment, called the <b>gyttja,</b> which led to their preservation through the centuries. In the past few decades, erosion along the seabed has been exposing previously covered Stone Age sites, a process that is evident at Hjarnø.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Peter Astrup, of the University of Aarhus, {{during a}} survey of a {{previously}} known submerged Stone Age site {{along the coast of}} Hjarnø, noticed that erosion had exposed many layers of the <b>gyttja.</b> In further exploring the site, he discovered a number of finds from the Stone Age. Following this, the University of Aarhus, the Moesgård Museum, and the Horsens Museum cooperated in excavating the site. The conclusion was that the site was likely from the Ertebølle period and had been settled due to its convenient location with regards to fishing. Finds at the site included three wooden paddles made of ash wood, an antler axe, a dugout canoe, and a bow made of elmwood. There were also numerous stakes made of hazel wood, hazelnut shells, plant seeds, string, and flint flakes and tools.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{peat bog}} {{near the village}} of ¯ydowiec in the Nida Basin was {{subjected}} to malacological analy-sis. The peat bog is located in a subsidence basin in a gypsum karst area. The profile of deposits was identified based on materials obtained from shallow (maximum depth of 2. 55 m) drillings. Lithologically diverse calcar-eous <b>gyttjas</b> and peats predominated, accompanied by dark muds. Numerous, but poorly preserved and often crushed molluscan shells were found in the calcareous <b>gyttjas,</b> as well as in some types of peat. Aquatic species were represented most frequently, especially drought-resistant forms and euryecological taxa. Land snails oc-curred in small numbers and constituted an admixture of low significance. Based on the composition and structure of faunistic assemblages, it was possible to characterise the features of the natural environment, peat bog evolution, and to determine the stratigraphic position of deposits...|$|R
40|$|Unambiguously {{pristine}} {{and largely}} unpolluted sediments from the Late Weichselian and Holocene infillings of the Meuse residual channels in northern Limburg (the Netherlands) have been sampled {{to determine the}} natural compositional variation of the river’s suspended load. Bulk geochemical and granulometric analyses demonstrate that about 70 ␘f the variation can be ascribed to hydrodynamic mineral sorting. Clay- and fine silt-sized phyllosilicates {{are the most important}} deterministic features, hosting the bulk of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, MgO and trace element variability (notably Ba, Cr, Ga, Rb and V). Quartz is abundant in the fine and coarse sand fractions. Na 2 O and the Zr-Nb-Nd-Y quartet relate to albitic feldspars and heavy minerals, respectively, in the coarse silt fraction. The granulometry should therefore be quantified if geochemical baseline data for a particular geological unit or region are drawn up and for the evaluation of potentially polluted sediments. Although provenance has not changed, the composition of Meuse sediments cannot be considered constant over a time frame of 1000 - 10, 000 years, due to climatic change. Weathering of phyllosilicates in both interstadial and interglacial soil environments and changing relative source-area contributions alter the detrital clay-mineral supply to raise the Al 2 O 3 and lower the K 2 O and MgO contents in Holocene Meuse sediments. Early diagenetic siderite and vivianite formation in <b>gyttjas</b> causes relative accumulations of Fe 2 O 3, MnO, P 2 O 5, Co, Ni and notably Zn above the phyllosilicate background values. These accumulations are natural and show that sediments with elevated trace metal contents are not necessarily polluted. Very early atmospheric pollution in relation to ore mining and smelting activities in the Roman era, however, probably caused elevated Pb contents in Subatlantic humic clays and peat samples, long before the historic pollution of the Industrial Revolution started. The Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 and CaO contents are used to predict the trace-element values as a function of sample granulometry, siderite/vivianite and lime content, respectively. As such, they can provide a sound basis for environmental researchers to determine baseline values of heavy metals in bulk samples of fine-grained fluvial sediments...|$|R
40|$|The intermontane Soma Basin of West Anatolia holds a key {{position}} as regards palynologic indication of its continental {{sequence of strata}} for the Miocene span of time. In pre-Neogene vales, which were framed by high mountains, a rather extensive sedimentary succession of approx. 500 m was accumulated; the section is composed of fluviatile and lacustrine rocks in both clastic and calcareous facies, including, however, several coal seams (lignites). Two depositional cycles, separated by an erosional phase, are to be distinguished. During the Late Neogene volcanic events caused such drastic changes in the local relief and drainage pattern that in Soma Daglari {{the final stages of}} basin evolution no longer matched adjacent ones. In consequence of the cyclic progress in sedimentation the section was stratigraphically subdivided in Soma and Denis Formations, with subsequently correlated Turgut, Sekkoy and Yatagan Members. Meanwhile, these members have been radiometncally dated at sites near by and in other regions of West Anatolia. Accordingly, the Lower Coal Bed (KM 1, 2) traces back to Late Burdigalian, the Middle Coal Bed (KM 3) most likely to Langhian- Serravallian and the Upper Coal Bed (KP 1, 2) finally to Tortonian. As the section so far includes Early, Middle and Late Miocene units, their characteristics in both facies development and structural evolution seem to correspond quite well modern ideas on the regional geology of Anatolia. A fossil microflora, rich in form species as well as individual specimens, was recognized in those samples taken from the three coal beds. This material occasioned a first comprehensive presentation of Miocene sporomorph assemblages from Soma Basin. Altogether 169 species were noted which refer to 59 form genera. A good few of these palynomorphs, their essential characteristics, stratigraphic ranges, botanical affinities and synonymous taxa being described and listed, show such a long stratigraphical and wide regional distribution that they allow no definite dating. There were, however, certain species noted which not only support a Miocene age of the sedimentary sequence with the coal seams, but also mark out Early Miocene (Burdigarian) for the Lower Coal Bed (KM 1, 2) and Late Miocene (Tortonian) for the Upper Coal Bed (KP 1, 2). The following 18 palynomorphs were recognized to be new species which accordingly had to be described with a diagnosis: Laevigatosporites turcicus n. sp., Cedripites anatolicus n. sp., C. pseudodeodaraeformis n. sp. Piceapollis anatoliensis n. sp., P. minor n. sp., Ephedripites (Ephedripites) anatolicus n. sp., E. (E.) minor n. sp., Cupuliferoidaepollenites longus n. sp., Quercoidites somaensis n. sp., Retitrescolpites globosus n. sp., Striatopollis circularis n. sp., Tricolpites tecturatus n. sp., Tricolpopollenites anatolicus n. sp., Tricolporopollenites turcianus n. sp., Momipites somaensis n. sp., Tricolporopollenites moderates n. sp., Ovoidites lanceolatus n. sp., and Schizosporis ellipsoideus n. sp. In addition to that emendation were considered to suit the following 7 species: Piceapollis neogenicus Nagy n. comb., Pityosporites baileyanus Traverse n. comb., P. miocaenicus Nagy n. comb., Tricolpopollenites robusteus Song, Li & Zhong n. comb., Compositoipollenites denizliensis Nakoman n. comb., Intrabaculitricolporites ellipsoideus Takahashi & Jux n. comb., and Nyssapollenites kruschi (Potonie) Nagy asp. pseudolaesus Potonie n. comb. The coal seams of Soma Daglari, exhibiting Early, Middle and Late Miocene sporomorph associations, serve not only as biostratigraphic markers for regional correlation of Neogene sections but also for the recognition of paleoecologic trends and paleoclimatic events. It turned out, that West Anatolia micro floras of Miocene age do reveal their own characteristics and are not easily compared with those of Central Europe. These lignites were not formed in open low land environments, instead, they arose in insufficiently drained mountain valleys from peats of boggy forests and <b>gyttjas</b> deposited on swampy grounds. Most likely, these marshy places were fringed by some bushwood which connected with extended areas of mixed forests along the hillsides. Proper stands of conifer trees did perhaps only flourish on top of the hills. Sporomorph associations as they were recognized in three successive horizons of the Lower Coal Bed (KM 1, 2) point at a gradual impoverishment of species diversities. This trend seems, however, to be reversed when the microflora of the Upper Coal Bed (KP 1, 2) is considered. To sum up, the mountainous area has highly influenced the composition of the fossil associations as can be concluded again and again from the pollen spectra presented. Nevertheless, disappearances and new occurrence of certain palynomorph groups as well as sporomorph species-in particular among herbs and conifers-may be taken as a prelude of the decisive climatic changes of Late Neogene...|$|R
50|$|Lake Waccamaw has a broad, {{flat bottom}} of <b>gyttja</b> (mud) and peat encircled by sandy {{shallows}} and submerged sandy terraces that {{extend up to}} 500 m offshore. A natural sand bar, which extends along the northwest shore between a fringing cypress swamp and the main lake, was supplemented with spoil dredged to form a neighboring canal in 1946 and developed with private residences. Big Creek delivers tea-colored water from the large cypress and gum tree swamp at {{the northeast corner of}} the lake, and the Waccamaw River emerges from the southern shore. A dam at the outlet built in 1926 now regulates lake levels, which used to fall by as much as a meter during dry spells, occasionally exposing the sand terraces. The dam was renovated in 2008 to help restore control of the lake water levels.|$|E
5000|$|Limnoforming (from Greek: limnee, [...] "lake"; Latin: formo, [...] "to shape", as in shaping, fashioning, molding, modeling) is {{the process}} of {{manipulating}} the physical or chemical properties of a body of water by introducing organisms which facilitate higher level biological activity, thus impacting the overall ecology of a given body of water, and eventually adjacent ecosystems. [...] Limnoforming is a process using living organisms to enhance a habitat's abiotic component, ultimately rendering it more conducive to a higher ecological quality. This could be accomplished by introducing a population of organisms, e.g., invertebrates or microbes, en masse to the substrate of a body of water. These organisms would then physically and/or chemically alter the underwater environment to furnish a more suitable substrate for a wider range of biological activity; the result being an increased ecological function (e.g., in trophic dynamics), and thus a higher quality ecological state. Ultimately, limnoforming aims to accelerate the rate of ecological succession in distressed aquatic systems (e.g., lower Green Bay, Lake Michigan), so as to produce a biologically complex climax community in a comparatively short amount of time. The concept of limnoforming originated from the benthic ecology laboratory of Dr. Jerry L. Kaster, School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. Limnoforming was partially inspired by, and is similar in several aspects to, the concept of terraforming. The two concepts' main similarity is that both aim to accelerate the rate of change occurring in a given environment, in terms of its habitability for a given species or for a number of species, and furthermore, the overall function of its ecology. Instead of creating a habitable ecosystem or biosphere from scratch, limnoforming simply aims to amend degradated Earthly aqueous environments less apt to harboring a high quality ecological community into an environment which does support an ecologically flourishing system. Limnoforming differs from traditional habitat rehabilitation or restoration in that limnoforming is driven by an early sere biological succession process that modifies the physical substrate making it better suited for later seres, whereas rehabilitation/restoration is generally driven by targeting a terminal sere that is poorly adapted at re-forming habitat upon which it depends. The initial limnoforming study, in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, uses freshwater oligochaetes to re-consolidate highly fluid <b>gyttja</b> substrate (organic black ooze) found extensively in lower Green Bay. The goal is to modify substrate suitability for the mayfly Hexagenia. Historically, this mayfly was found in abundance but the eutrophication of the bay led to their demise in first half of the 20th century.|$|E
40|$|Water {{availability}} is a {{major concern}} when restoring degraded vacuum harvested peatlands. The seasonal expression of water arising from the compression of underlying organic deposits may provide a source of water. A bog near Rimouski, Québec (Canada) was harvested using the vacuum extraction method and cut down to underlying sedge peat; restoration procedures were implemented in the autumn of 2009. The residual peat layer is 0. 4 – 1 m thick, and overlies a 1 – 1. 5 m thick <b>gyttja</b> deposit. <b>Gyttja</b> is a coprogenous lake bottom sediment on which peat sometimes forms. Little is known about the hydrophysical properties of <b>gyttja</b> and the implications it may have for peatland restoration. The upper 40 cm of <b>gyttja</b> had average bulk density 0. 12 g cm- 3, particle density 1. 57 g cm- 3 and porosity 92 %. The organic matter and fibre contents of the <b>gyttja</b> were > 45 %, and both decreased with depth. Oedometer test results showed 9 and 72 % strain at 3. 5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for water release upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. However, during the year of measurement (2011) the changes in effective stress caused by water table lowering were < 1 kPa, corresponding to a water table decline of < 10 cm. Under these conditions the volumetric moisture content of the top 30 cm of <b>gyttja</b> decreased by only 0. 4 % and we observed 0. 5 cm of <b>gyttja</b> settlement; this represented 0. 4 % and 1. 7 % strain, respectively. On the basis of these strains, we conclude that the release of water due to the consolidation of <b>gyttja</b> in 2011 had little impact on rewetting of the overlying peat. However, it may be important under drier conditions with a larger seasonal water deficit, and may have been important prior to restoration when larger water table fluctuations were observed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} whether artificially mixing <b>gyttja,</b> {{an organic}} sediment that contains {{high levels of}} NH 4, with its overlying waters, affected phytoplankton abundance and species composition in Myall Lake (NSW, Australia). A series of mesocosms was employed, with three mesocosms being designated as controls, i. e. no <b>gyttja</b> mixing, and three others termed impact mesocosms, i. e. in which <b>gyttja</b> was mixed with the overlying waters. Sampling was undertaken during a 5 day period in sediment disturbance, and phytoplankton community variables were recorded at seven intervals, i. e. just prior to disturbance and 30 minutes, 3 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days after <b>gyttja</b> disturbance. Comparisons of these community variables among treatments and over time convincingly demonstrated that overall phytoplankton abundance rose from 20, 000 cells/mL just prior to disturbance to between 30, 000 cells/mL and 55, 000 cells/mL 2 to 4 days after <b>gyttja</b> mixing. This rise in abundance was attributable to {{a substantial increase in}} the cyanophycea over the same period.

This supported the hypothesis that <b>gyttja</b> mixing does introduce benthic microalgae into the water column.

40|$|Vacuum {{harvested}} peatlands do {{not easily}} regain their hydrological function after peat production therefore restoration {{is required to}} create hydrological conditions appropriate {{for the growth of}} peat producing fen plant species. Peat extraction at Bic-Saint-Fabien peatland by the block-cut method began in 1946, converted to vacuum harvesting in the early 1970 ’s and ceased in 2000. After exploitation, about 0. 04 - 1 m of residual minerotrophic sedge peat remained; therefore Bic-Saint-Fabien was restored as a fen. Research occurred in 2008 - 2011 and restoration began fall 2009 so we have two pre-restoration and two post-restoration study years. Rewetting consisted of blocking active drainage ditches, contouring the peat surface into level terraces to even out elevation differences, and building peat ridges (bunds) to retain runoff. Vegetation was introduced to some recontoured parts of the site by the surface layer transfer method. A straw mulch treatment was applied to minimize evapotranspiration. A water budget was created for the harvested cutover area and an adjacent undisturbed section of Bic-Saint- Fabien for all study years. Data collection for the water budget occurred June 2 -August 7 (day of year 153 - 219). Water table, volumetric soil moisture content and soil-water pressure were also examined to better understand the impact of reconfiguration on the hydrology of the system. A 1 - 1. 5 m thick layer of <b>gyttja</b> (a low permeability, high porosity lake-bed sediment) underlies the residual peat; it was parameterized and assessed to see if it could potentially compress and supply water to the overlying peat when the system is stressed. In 2011, the volumetric moisture content and thickness of <b>gyttja</b> were monitored in the field to estimate the strain placed on the <b>gyttja</b> by seasonal water table variability. <b>Gyttja</b> samples were collected and brought back to the laboratory for parameterization and compressibility tests. A water budget was completed annually for the cutover and undisturbed areas of the peatland. There were no distinguishable differences between study years except that 2008 and 2009 were climatologically wetter. During the water budget period surface and groundwater run-on into the cutover area were negligible making precipitation the principle water input. The dominant water loss from the cutover area was evapotranspiration since runoff was only 2 and 9 mm in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Rewetting did not result in a uniform wetness across the cutover site chiefly due to local differences in peat surface elevation. An interior section of Bic- Saint-Fabien remained saturated for nearly all of 2011; it had mean seasonal water table of + 2. 8 cm, and volumetric soil moisture content and soil-water pressure, 5 cm below the peat surface were 86 % and + 4 mbar. At a peripheral section (~ 100 m away) the values were - 14. 4 cm, 67 % and - 13 mbar, respectively. While the interior was generally wetter than the peripheral regions, there were some exceptions, notably near where dams were installed on peripheral drainage ditches. The markedly different spatial patterns of wetness suggests that a uniform prescription regarding vegetation re-establishment in the rewetted section may not be warranted. The bulk density, particle density and porosity of <b>gyttja</b> averaged 0. 12 g cm- 3 1. 57 g cm- 3 and 92 %, in the top 40 cm of the layer. The organic matter content of <b>gyttja</b> decreased with depth from about 70 % at a 5 cm depth to 45 % at a 45 cm depth. Laboratory compression tests showed 9 and 72 % strain at effective stresses of 3. 5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for releasing water upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. From day of year 192 to 202 in 2011, when a ~ 8 cm water level change occurred (effective stress range ~ 0. 8 kPa), the volumetric moisture content and thickness of the top 30 cm of <b>gyttja</b> decreased by 0. 4 %, and 0. 5 cm, respectively, representing 0. 1 and 1. 7 % strain, respectively, as determined from these two different approaches. The compression of <b>gyttja</b> after Bic-Saint-Fabien was rewetted (2011) was small but might have been significant under drier conditions with greater water table variability, such as during the early stages of site drainage when it was being prepared for peat extraction or after peat production ceased. The release of water to the peat layer from the compression of <b>gyttja</b> after peat production finished and before rewetting occurred, might have been an important self-preservation mechanism, eventually making it easier to rewet. Water table drawdown in 2011 produced very small strain rates suggesting <b>gyttja</b> compression in this year had no important role; hence rewetting success was more reliant on other rewetting techniques implemented at this site...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{archives}} are {{of greatest}} significance {{when it comes}} to paleoclimate studies, since these types of archives in a natural way have registered and preserved the conditions of the past. There are several types of climate archives, one of the most commonly used are lake sediments, because lakes can reveal different types of information, for example weathering, vegetation and precipitation. Another reason why lakes are important in climate research is because they are widely spread over the world, and therefore they can be chosen depending on where the focus of the study will be. In this study, -the Lake Kuchi {{in the southern part of}} Taiwan, situated at the boundary between the Asian Mainland and the Western Pacific, was used. What makes this densely populated region of the world particularly interesting for climate research is because it is affected not only by monsoons, but also by typhoons and earthquakes. In this paleoclimate study, a total 16 core sections from three different coring points in the Kuchi Lake were analyzed. The main goal was to clarify if the lake could be used as a reliable climate archive, and also interpret the depositional environment of the sediment layers in the cores. All core sections were described and analyzed with the ITRAX XRF-scanner, which lead to the conclusion that the cores consist of a sedimentary sequence of alternating gray clay and dark gray <b>gyttja</b> clay layers, capped by peat, <b>gyttja</b> or clayey <b>gyttja</b> at topmost part.  By sieving samples from all different layers, it was observed that some dark <b>gyttja</b> clay layers contained terrestrial organic matter, and hard, angular clay clasts that suggest intense rain falls and flash floods as transportation mechanism. The uppermost part of the cores, from 310 cm to the top layers, consist of homogenous clay and in situ organic matter which indicate calmer depositional environments compared to the alternation between dark <b>gyttja</b> clay and homogenous gray clay. LOI- 950 data indicate that the carbonate content of the Kuchi Lake is low, since the weight loss during this temperature is insignificant compared to LOI- 550, which stood for the majority of the weight loss. Thus, the sediment sequence in the Kuchi Lake consist of alternation of clays deposited in a calm and relatively deep lake, mixed with layers apparently flushed in from land, possibly due to typhoons. This alternation is capped by organic rich layers, including peat, which indicating filling up of the basin, and shallower conditions...|$|E

The change of the environment from limnic to telmatic and often the interference of a man associated with the regulation of water relations led to the emergence of limnic deposits that underwent the process of pedogenesis. In this work, 137 samples of carbonate deposits from 6 sites in NW Poland were analyzed in terms of their physical properties. Carbonate sediments were subject to determination of specific and bulk densities, total porosity and air porosity, current and capillary water capacity.

40|$|The effec s of {{relative}} water level changes in Lake Ontario were {{detected in the}} ysical, chemical and biological characteristics of the sediments of the Fifteen, Sixteen and Twenty Mile Creek lagoonal complexes. Regional environmental changes have occurred resulting in the following sequence of sediments in the three lagoons and marsh. From the base up they are; (I) Till,(2) Pink Clay, (3) Bottom Sand, (4) <b>Gyttja,</b> (5) Orange Sandy Silt, (6) Brown Clay and (7) Gray Clay. The till was only encountered in the marsh and channel; however, it is presumed to occur throughout the entire area. The presence of diatoms and sponge spicules, the vertical and ongitudinal uniformity of the sediment and the stratigr ic position of the Pink Clay indicate {{that it has a}} glacial or post-glacial lacustrine origin. Overl ng the Pink Clay or Till is a clayey, silty sand to gravel. The downstream fining and unsorted nature of this material indicate that it has a fluvial/deltaic origin. Water levels began rising in the lagoon 3, 250 years ago resulting in the deposition of the <b>Gyttja,</b> a brown, organic-rich silty clay probably deposited in a shallow, stagnant environment as shown by the presence of pyrite in the organic material and relatively high proportions of benthic diatoms and grass pollen. Increase in the rate of deposition of the <b>Gyttja</b> on Twenty Mile Creek and a decrease in the same unit on Sixteen Mile Creek is possibly the result of a capture of the Sixteen Mile Creek by the Twenty Mile Creek. The rise in lake level responsible for the onset and transgression of this III unit may have been produced by isostatic rebound; however, the deposition also corresponds closely to a drop in the level of Lake Huron and increased flow through the lower lakes. The o ange Sandy Silt, present only in the marsh, appears to be a buried soil horizon as shown by oxidized roots, and may be the upland equivalant to the <b>Gyttja.</b> Additional deepening resulted in the deposition of Brown Clay, a unit which only occurs at the lakeward end of the three lagoons.

The tentative correlation of the new cores to those described and analysed by de Beaulieu et al. (1980) and de Beaulieu & Reille (1984 a) provides a preliminary chronostratigraphic framework. Sedimentation during MIS 3 started with accumulation of sands and silts and was followed by alternating <b>gyttja</b> and clayey <b>gyttja</b> silts. Exceptionally high sedimentation rates during MIS 2 led to the infilling of the basin. Alternating organic-rich and minerogenicrich sediments appear to coincide with changes in pollen assemblages (de Beaulieu & Reille 1984 a) and suggest that millennial-scale climatic changes controlled lake productivity and catchment stability during most of MIS 3...|$|E
40|$|Sediments were {{collected}} with Eckman and Petersen dredges {{from the bottom}} of Trout Lake, northern Wisconsin, at 221 stations. Sampling was done with a spud sampler at 32 stations, and core samples were obtained with a Jenkins and Mortimer and a Twenhofel sampler at 17 stations. The shore and offshore deposits of the shores of Trout Lake and the shores of the islands are described. Megascopic descriptions are given of the samples collected with the Eckman and Petersen dredges. Sediments on bottoms of about 10 meters or deeper are mainly <b>gyttja,</b> or crusts composed of mixtures of organic matter, ferric hydroxide, and some form of manganese oxide. The latter deposits are extensive. Detailed descriptions of some of the samples of sands are given, and generalizations respecting size and distribution are made. Tables showing quartiles, medians, and coefficients of sorting and skewness of the coarse sediments collected from the bottom are given in tables. Mechanical analyses of all fine sediments, mainly <b>gyttja,</b> were not made, as previous experience seems to have demonstrated that results have no sedimentational value. Organic matter of the <b>gyttja</b> was determined and also the percentages of lignin in the organic matter. Core samples are composed almost entirely of fine materials, mainly <b>gyttja,</b> and determinations were made on these samples {{in the same way as}} on the samples obtained with the Eckman and Petersen dredges. Studies of the core samples show that the fine sediments usually contain in excess of 90 per cent moisture and there is very little change in the moisture content from top to bottom of cores. A map shows the distribution of the iron and manganese deposits. These deposits were found to contain 10 to 20 per cent of organic matter, 11 to 16 per cent of metallic iron, and 12 to 30 per cent of metallic manganese. No stratification of any kind was found in any of the deep-water sediments of Trout Lake except in the iron and manganese crusts. Absence of stratification is considered to be due to the slow rate of deposition and the mixing of sediments by organisms which dwell in them. The data indicate that the rate of deposition in the deep waters of Trout Lake is of the order of 1 foot in 15, 000 years...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{changes in}} the Holocene {{molluscan}} fauna are elucidated by {{the investigation of the}} Korupsø area in the central part of Djursland, Denmark, on macrofossils and 14 C datings of shell material. The oldest recorded stratum is a lacustrine Boreal lime <b>gyttja</b> which in the Early Atlantic was covered by saltwater <b>gyttja</b> with a rich fauna of molluscs. The fauna is characterised by Ostrea edulis, Venerupis decussata, Macoma balthica, and Corbula gibba. Bittium reticulatum is only found in large quantities within this older part of the sequence up {{to the end of the}} Atlantic. The disappearance of Bittium reticulatum in the Subboreal is explained as having been caused by a change to a more brackish environment. This explanation is supported by the decline in numbers of Hydrobia ulvae and the occurrence in equal numbers of Hydrobia ventrosa in the Subboreal. The rate of sedimentation was low during the Atlantic (1 m per thousand years) compared to the Subboreal, when a sedimentation of up to 5 m per thousand years has been observed. This change in sedimentation rate is tentatively connected with a lowering of the tidal range in the Danish waters since the Atlantic...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA deep {{sequence}} of Last Glacial peats and slope deposits {{at the foot}} of the Lascaux hill was investigated using a large array of methods (geology, geophysics, C- 14 and OSL dating, palynology, macro-remain analysis, entomology). The peaty levels, OSL dated to between similar to 73 and 60 ka, are found Within a doline developed in a fluvial terrace of the Vezere River. These <b>gyttja</b> and chalky <b>gyttja</b> deposits covered by fen peat yielded abundant beetle and plant (seeds, pollen) remains. Palaeoecological reconstructions suggest a cool steppe with willow stands compatible with an interstadial of marine isotopic stage (MIS) 4, probably Ognon II (GI- 192). Aquatic and hygrophilous plants (sedges), which reflect local vegetation, and their dependent insects are equally well represented in the record. The peats are covered by a {{sequence of}} slope deposits: a coarse-grained lower unit deposited during late MIS 4, overlain by a heavily decalcified sandy unit with a boreal soil complex correlated with early MIS 3, and finally, a coarse grained, calcareous unit formed during late MIS 3 and MIS 2 in connection with slope dynamics typical of periglacial environments.

Here we compare stable isotope and elemental records (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, C/N) with high resolution XRF-derived geochemical and colour data from low Arctic lakes (SS 1220 and SS 85) in southwest Greenland. Lake SS 1220 sediments are laminated <b>gyttja</b> whereas SS 85 consist of homogeneous <b>gyttja,</b> both records cover the last c. 5000 years. δ 13 C and carbon content suggest that organic matter in both lakes is predominantly autochthonous. The C/N variability, ranging between 11 and 15, is interpreted to {{be a function of}} nitrogen deficiency which is further supported by δ 15 N values (at SS 1220) falling close to atmospheric δ 15 Natmosphere. Although some changes in the geochemical stratigraphies presented here can be related to regional environmental change (i. e. hydrology, effective precipitation, aeolian activity), these effects are filtered through the lake catchments. These changes alter the nutrient supply and hence lake productivity which appear to be the primary controls on the stable isotope data. We suggest that information of past environmental change can only be gained from the stable isotope composition of lake sediments when there is a reasonable understanding of limnological processes, and records may be lake specific. ...|$|E
40|$|Sediment cores {{from the}} Kriegers Flak {{area in the}} southwestern Baltic Sea show a {{distinct}} lithological succession, starting with a lower diamict that is overlain by a c. 10 m thick clay unit that contains peat, <b>gyttja</b> and other organic remains. On top follows an upper diamict that is inter-layered with sorted sediments and overlain by an upward-coarsening sequence with molluscs. In this paper {{we focus on the}} clay unit, which has been subdivided into three subunits: (A) lower clay with benthic foraminifera and with diamict beds in the lower part; (B) thin beds of <b>gyttja</b> and peat, which have been radiocarbon-dated to 31 - 35 14 C kyr BP (c. 36 - 41 cal. kyr BP); and (C) upper clay unit. Based on the preliminary results we suggest the following depositional model: fine-grained sediments interbedded with diamict in the lower part (subunit A) were deposited in a brackish basin during a retreat of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, probably during the Middle Weichselian. Around 40 kyr BP the area turned into a wetland with small ponds (subunit B). A transgression, possibly caused by the damming of the Baltic Basin during the Kattegat advance at 29 kyr BP, led to the deposition of massive clay (subunit C). The data presented here provide new information about the paleoenvironmental changes occurring in the Baltic Basin following the Middle Weichselian glaciation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study investigates {{sediment}} cores {{from the}} Mediterranean alpine lakes located in upvalley cirques upper than 1700 metres a. s. l. using sedimentological, palynological and geomorphological studies, {{in order to}} document environmental changes following the last phase of glacier retreat. These results are considered {{in the framework of}} the deglaciation characterized from 16 sediment cores from high-altitude lakes and mires including 104 14 C ages and geomorphological studies of the Mediterranean Alps. Considering each sediment core proxy as an independent observation, i. e., comparisons between 14 C ages and palynostratigraphy, between 14 C ages and lithostratigraphy, between palynostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy, these data are aimed at contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the timing of postglacial environmental changes. The 14 C ages combined with pollen biostratigraphy indicate that the deglaciation of cirque catchments is dated between 14, 500 and 13, 000 cal. BP, i. e., during the Lateglacial Interstadial (Greenland Interstadial- 1 e). The sixteen lacustrine and mire sediment records are systematically characterized by three units from bottom to top: organic-poor blue clay, beige to light-brown silty clay and organic rich dark brown <b>gyttja</b> lithotype. During the Younger Dryas, lakes located below 2300 m a. s. l. were ice-free and their pollen record indicates steppe conditions. The sedimentary facies also informs on the timing of glacial-dominated processes. The onset of organic-rich <b>gyttja</b> is dated at 11, 000 cal. BP suggesting the last influence of cirque glaciers in these lakes at the beginning of the Holocene. The timing of the onset of this organic rich unit differs in sites (± 2000 years) probably due to an altitudinal and exposure gradient of the glacial cirques. The presence of <b>gyttja</b> from 11, 000 cal. BP to Present indicates biogenic infilling lake for all the Holocene. Even though the literature have indicated rock glacier advances occurred during the Holocene (Subboreal and LIA) in the south of the Alps, no significant sedimentological patterns related to glacier fluctuations are recorded in Lake Vens. The glacier fluctuations in the Mediterranean Alps are concomitant with those dated in the non-Mediterranean Alps, thus suggesting a main common climate forcing. However, the increase in terrigenous sediment inputs since 1800 cal. BP is mainly due to human activities...|$|E

Alternate luminescence dating techniques (TL and IRSL) place unit III in latter oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5, ' 74, 000 years BP. A suite of 20 AMS ��C dates suggests {{that much of the}} post-OIS 5 paleoenvironmental record is characterized by either extremely low continuous sediment accumulation, or by one or more episodes of more rapid sedimentation. Diverse pollen and spore assemblages have concentrations that are unexpectedly high throughout the pre-Holocene sediments (' 10, 000 grains cm��), by comparison to the Holocene (& 5000 grains cm��). Exceedingly low sediment accumulation rates appear to have resulted in the concentration of atmospherically derived pollen and spores. Diatom assemblages record the evolution of the lake’s chemistry and past algal production. Several abrupt changes occurred synchronously in both the terrestrial and aquatic components of the system, and these appear to represent ecological responses to pre-Holocene climatic variability. The sediments of Fog Lake provide the first integrated paleoecological record older than Holocene for a vast region of the Canadian Arctic, thereby refining our understanding of long-term arctic ecosystem ontogeny. � 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Peat and <b>gyttja</b> (organic lake sediment) are {{important}} indicators for past environmental conditions; they form {{in areas where}} the supply of clastic sediment is insufficient to fill the accommodation space. Previous studies of delta sediments, however, have focused mainly on clastic deposits, whereas organics have received only minimal attention. Identification of organic facies can be of value for understanding delta formation as it provides insight into, for example, palaeoenvironmental conditions and compaction susceptibility of these layers. Currently, however, field characteristics of organics are not well-documented for the full range of facies present in delta plains. In this study, a field method - a classification key - for identifying organic facies in delta plains was developed based on concisely described organic facies in selected cores from the Rhine-Meuse delta, The Netherlands. This method was tested on archived borehole descriptions of the diachronous basal peat layer in the distal Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta; this was done by means of a semi-automated procedure to select and classify samples from a database. The resulting data set was used for mapping organic facies in the basal peat layer by means of indicator kriging and inverse distance weighting. The resulting facies distribution map shows consistent and geologically meaningful patterns, which were interpreted in terms of hydrological regimes. The formation of the basal peat layer, which marks the onset of Holocene aggradation, has been controlled by marine-dominated, fluvial-dominated and seepage-dominated environments. Before 9000 cal yr bp, marine processes influenced the initial stage of organic accumulation {{in the western part of}} The Netherlands. After 9000 cal yr bp, on the flanks of topographical higher regions, seepage-dominated mesotrophic organic facies characterized the onset of accumulation. Simultaneously, nutrient-rich organic facies could develop in the Rhine-Meuse valley: <b>gyttja</b> formed in the sediment-limited Meuse realm, whereas reed peat accumulated in the Rhine realm, indicating lower water depths and thus a higher elevated surface level. It is concluded that the classification key for identifying organic facies is a strong tool to better recognize peat and <b>gyttja</b> types on the basis of macroscopic field characteristics. Application of the key on archived boreholes also proved to be feasible. Identification of organic facies and determination of their spatial distribution at delta scale, as is shown in this study, contributes to understanding delta evolution. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Two {{sediment}} cores of 70 and 252 cm length {{were recovered}} from Hjort Sø, a small lake on Store Koldewey, Northeast Greenland, and studied with a multidisciplinary approach {{in order to}} reconstruct the local environmental history and to test the relevance of proxies for paleoenvironmental information. The basal sediments from the longer core are dominated by clastic matter, which was likely deposited during deglaciation of the lake basin. These clastic sediments are overlain by <b>gyttja,</b> which is also present throughout the shorter core. AMS radiocarbon dating was conducted on plant macrofossils of 11 samples from the <b>gyttja</b> in both cores. A reliable chronology was established for both cores, which dated the onset of organic accumulation at 9, 500 cal. year BP. The Holocene temperature development, with an early to mid Holocene thermal maximum, is best reflected in the grain-size composition. Nutrient availability was apparently low during the early Holocene and led to low productivity in the lake and its vicinity. From ca. 7, 000 cal. year BP, productivity in the lake increased significantly, probably induced by external nutrient input from goose excrements. From this time, micro- and macro-fossil remains reflect relatively well the climate history of East Greenland, with a cooling during the middle Holocene, the medieval warming, and the Little Ice Age. The amount of organic matter in the sequence {{seems to be more}} affected by lake ice cover or by nutrient supply from the catchment than by temperature changes.
