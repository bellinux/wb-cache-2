5000|$|Whilst {{the white}} <b>hackle</b> of 2 SCOTS, red <b>hackle</b> of 3 SCOTS and blue <b>hackle</b> of 4 SCOTS have a known ancestry, {{the origin of}} 1 SCOTS black <b>hackle</b> and 5 SCOTS green <b>hackle</b> are not clear and have no {{apparent}} precedent. It {{may be that the}} black <b>hackle</b> of 1 SCOTS simulates the black-cock tail feathers originally worn in the 1904 pattern Kilmarnock Bonnet and latterly in the regimental Glengarry Cap by the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers, who merged in August 2006 to form 1 SCOTS. Alternatively, it may be a sympathetic gesture to a former Lowland regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), who went into 'suspended animation' in 1968 (and later disbanded), who wore a black <b>hackle</b> in their rifle green dress Balmoral. The adoption of the green <b>hackle</b> now being worn by the Argylls battalion (5 SCOTS) is no doubt a continuation of that regiment's association with the colour green, most prominent in the hue of their regimental kilts and stripes on their regimental association ties. (It is, however, worthy of note that in the 19th Century, all line regiments of the British Army used to designate their [...] "light company" [...] with a green <b>hackle.)</b> The Regimental Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland does not wear the <b>hackle.</b> However, the Highland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Territorial Army) continues to wear the red <b>hackle</b> with the Tam o' Shanter.

To improve practice teachers need the support of quality professional learning and curriculum resources (Goodrum, <b>Hackling</b> 2 ̆ 6 Rennie, 2001). Research with professional learning programs at secondary and primary schools (Goodrum, <b>Hackling</b> 2 ̆ 6 Trotter, 2003; Goodrum, <b>Hackling</b> 2 ̆ 6 Sheffield, 2003; <b>Hackling</b> 2 ̆ 6 Prain, 2005; Lewthwaite, 2006; Peers, Diezmann 2 ̆ 6 Watters, 2003) indicates that the provision of professional learning workshops and exemplary curriculum resources, successful pedagogical experiences, opportunities for collegial interaction and reflection on practice, support of the principal and strong leadership by leader teachers/co-coordinators are required for successful implementations of new initiatives. The growth and effectiveness of teacher leaders depends on their personal attributes (e. g., motivation, self-efficacy, willingness to modify practice and beliefs (Peers, Diezmann 2 ̆ 6 Watters, 2003)) microsystem factors such as collegial and external supports, mesosystem {{factors such as the}} priority placed on the subject by their school and the schools openness to change, exosystemfactors such as parent and community expectations, and macrosystem factors such as state and national curriculum agendas (Bronfenbrenner, 1989; Lewthwaite, 2006). Research into the perceptions of trial teachers regarding the implementation of Primary Connections in their classrooms and more broadly in their schools is required to understand how trial teachers and their schools can be further supported to ensure a successful implementation. By this stage of the trial, original trial teachers had implemented one trial unit in each of term 1, 2005 and term 3, 2005. The workshop was to prepare them to implement a third trial unit in term 2, 2006.

30|$|Two {{types of}} {{research}} {{have been conducted}} to assess or analyze science classroom discourses.

(Gee 2011; <b>Hackling</b> et al. 2010; Hicks 1996; Lemke 1998; Rojas-Drummond et al. 2013). These tools use a dialog between a teacher and students as the unit of episode and an utterance between them as the unit of coding (Gee 2011; <b>Hackling</b> et al. 2010; Lemke 1998). The others evaluated the activities along with discourse in a science classroom using Likert-type questionnaires, i.e., Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP), Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol (EQUIP) (Brandon et al. 2008; Piburn et al. 2000; Weiss et al. 2003).

Second, to investigate the effects of using a computer-assisted instructional strategy in changing those misconceptions. A misconception idenfication test and an interview schedule developed by Garnett 2 ̆ 6 <b>Hackling</b> (1984) were used to diagnose student misconceptions about chemical equilibrium.

The package was designed in accordance with a model of conceptual change proposed by Posner, Strike, Hewson 2 ̆ 6 Gertzog (1982). The CAI package consists of eleven modules. The conceptual change strategies, as implemented in the package, mainly used simulations to create cognitive conflict to assist accommodation.

In addition, these misconceptions were found to be similar to those reported by <b>Hackling</b> and Garnett (1985) which identified misconceptions among Western Australian students.

40|$|The {{national}} {{review of the}} status and quality {{of teaching and learning}} of science in Australian schools (Goodrum, <b>Hackling,</b> & Rennie, 2001) argued that the broad purpose of science in the compulsory years of schooling is to develop scientific literacy for all students. Scientific literacy is a high priority for all citizens, helping them to be interested in, and understand the world around them, to engage in the discourses of and about science, to be sceptical and questioning of claims made by others about scientific matters, to be able to identify questions, investigate and draw evidence-based conclusions, and to make informed decisions about the environment and their own health and well-being (<b>Hackling,</b> Goodrum, & Rennie, 2001, p. 7). Scientific literacy is important as it contributes to the economic and social well-being of the nation, and improved decision-making at public and personal levels (Laugksch, 2000). The OECD PISA assessments focus on aspects of preparedness for adult life in terms of functional knowledge and skills that allow citizens to participate actively in society. It is argued that scientifically literate persons are “able to use scientific knowledge and processes not just to understand the natural world but (also) to participate in decisions that affect it ” (OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, 1999, p. 13). The OECD PISA (1999) has defined scientific literacy as: …the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions (investigate) 1 and to draw evidence-based conclusions in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity (p. 60...|$|E
