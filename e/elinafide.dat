40|$|Bis- 2, 3 -heteroarylmaleimides and polyheterocondensed imides joined through {{nitrogen}} {{atoms of}} the N,Nâ€²-bis(ethyl) - 1, 3 -propanediamine linker were prepared from substituted maleic anhydrides and symmetrical diamines in good to satisfactory yields and short reaction times using microwave heating. The novel molecules {{were shown to}} inhibit proliferation of human tumor cells (NCI-H 460 lung carcinoma) and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) with variable potencies. Compound 11 a, the most potent one of the series, showed IC 50 values comparable to those observed for the leading molecule <b>elinafide</b> in both cell lines, but with a higher selectivity toward human tumor cells. Compound 11 a affected G 1 /S phase transition of the cell cycle, showed in vitro DNA intercalating activity and in vivo antitumor activity. A thorough structural analysis of the 11 a-DNA complex was also made by mean of NMR and computational techniques...|$|E
