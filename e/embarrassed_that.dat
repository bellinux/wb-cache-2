When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} starts in pre-war Amiens, France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with René Azaire, his wife Isabelle and their children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He {{witnesses}} a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen's interest in Isabelle, {{with whom he}} soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> he and Isabelle cannot have another child, beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food {{to the families of}} striking workers, stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.|$|E

5|$|Edward now {{expected}} Isabella {{and their}} son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage {{appears to have been}} successful, {{but by the time the}} Queen left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's. She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given the custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.|$|E
25|$|Already in 1883, Eckenfelder had {{exhibited}} his Überschwemmung im Neckarthal (Flooding in the Neckar Valley) at {{the international}} art exhibition in the Glaspalast in Munich. Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria purchased his painting Pferde vor dem Pflug (Ploughing Horses) in 1888 and Eckenfelder was {{for the first time}} mentioned in the specialist press. The prince regent took a lively interest in the artistic life of Munich and through such acquisitions supported young artists not only financially, but also with the renown they entailed. He often visited painters in their studios. When he paid his first such visit to Eckenfelder, it was a cold day and the artist was wrapped up against the cold and wearing thick winter slippers; Eckenfelder was so <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> soon after he formed the habit of wearing dress shoes and a suit with no smock when working. He maintained this habit until late in life.|$|E

It is claimed that his family would have been <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> their son was playing baseball for money, and would have disapproved.

[...] <b>Embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> he had been tricked, the emperor ordered Shaoweng's execution and kept quiet about the affair. Shaoweng purportedly died from consuming horse liver, which was thought to be poisonous at the time. Later, Emperor Wu reconsidered Shaoweng's fraud, wondering if perhaps some of his mystical arts had been genuine. The emperor realized that his chance for immortality might have passed with Shaoweng's execution, and began to search for a new mystic.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Wiesenthal was {{involved}} in two high-profile events involving Austrian politicians. Shortly after Bruno Kreisky was inaugurated as Austrian chancellor in April 1970, Wiesenthal pointed out to the press that four of his new cabinet appointees had been members of the Nazi Party. Kreisky, angry, called Wiesenthal a [...] "Jewish fascist", likened his organisation to the Mafia, and accused him of collaborating with the Nazis. Wiesenthal successfully sued for libel, the suit ending in 1989. In 1986, Wiesenthal {{was involved}} in the case of Kurt Waldheim, whose Nazi past was revealed in the lead-up to the 1986 Austrian presidential elections.

500|$|In May 1974, the Church {{asked the}} Navy Department to supply {{seventeen}} medals {{that he was}} said to have been awarded, including the Purple Heart and Navy Commendation Medal, many of them with bronze service stars denoting participation in military campaigns or multiple bestowals of the same award. The Navy sent only four medals, noting, [...] "The records in this Bureau fail to establish Mr. Hubbard's entitlement to the other medals and awards listed in your response." [...] Hubbard responded by circulating to Scientologists a photograph of 21 medals and palms that he said he had been awarded and explained that he had actually won 28, but that the missing seven had been awarded to him in secret because the naval high command was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> he had sunk two Japanese submarines in the United States' [...] "back yard". A 1994 biography published by the Church of Scientology states that he was awarded 29 medals and awards.|$|E
500|$|The Heliand, an Old Saxon {{adaptation}} of the New Testament from the 9th century, differs from the New Testament in that an explicit reference is made to a dove sitting {{on the shoulder of}} Christ. Regarding this, G. Ronald Murphy says [...] "In placing the powerful white dove not just above Christ, but right on his shoulder, the Heliand author has portrayed Christ, not only as the Son of the All-Ruler, but also as a new Woden. This deliberate image of Christ triumphantly astride the land with the magnificent bird on his shoulders (the author is perhaps a bit <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> the bird is an unwarlike dove!) is an image intended to calm the fears and longings of those who mourn the loss of Woden and who want to return to the old religion's symbols and ways. With this image, Christ becomes a Germanic god, one into whose ears the Spirit of the Almighty whispers".|$|E

500|$|Hall also {{enacted a}} {{complete}} {{reform of the}} electoral system. [...] He was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> the LCL {{was in a position}} to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. [...] The reforms were significant, but did not go as far as the change to [...] "one vote one value" [...] that Labor and Dunstan had demanded. The lower house formerly had 39 seats—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Now, 47 seats were to be contested: 28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. [...] While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state's population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely. [...] Under the Playmander, Labor usually dominated Adelaide. [...] In most years, the LCL won almost no seats in the capital outside of the wealthy eastern crescent and around Holdfast Bay. [...] Under the circumstances, conventional wisdom was that Hall undertook electoral reform knowing he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.|$|E

[...] Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003-release of Impossible Princess, had observed that critics slated [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] due to Minogue's approach to [...] "obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole". Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands." [...] She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on [...] "good terms".|$|E
500|$|Ashman {{was aware}} that writing a ballad capable of {{captivating}} young audiences during the [...] "modern era" [...] of animation would be challenging. In {{an effort to keep}} children interested, Ashman suggested that Ariel should own a grotto in which she hides human artifacts she has collected from various shipwrecks and refer to them throughout the scene. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] be removed from the film after observing that some children appeared to grow restless during the sparsely animated musical sequence while attending an early test screening of The Little Mermaid. One child in particular spilled his popcorn during the scene, prompting Katzenberg to worry that children would find the song boring. Bored by [...] "Part of Your World" [...] himself, Katzenberg felt that the ballad only slowed down the film. Nearly everyone involved in the project protested and defended [...] "Part of Your World"; Ashman reportedly threatened that the song could only be removed over his dead body. Clements and Musker reminded Katzenberg that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Disney's first animated film, features a song similar to [...] "Part of Your World" [...] entitled [...] "Someday My Prince Will Come" [...] which ultimately became very successful. The directors also reminded him that MGM executives had wanted to remove Judy Garland's song [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] from the film The Wizard of Oz (1939) until they reconsidered. Keane argued that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is essential to the film's narrative and eventually convinced Katzenberg to let the sequence remain at least until the film's next test screening, by which time it would be fully animated. Children responded better towards the song during the second screening, some of whom enjoyed it to the point of which they mimed some of its lyrics. The song even moved some older audience members to tears, who ultimately applauded. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was ultimately spared; Katzenberg eventually admitted that he now feels <b>embarrassed</b> <b>that</b> he had ever wanted to dismiss [...] "Part of Your World", expressing gratitude towards the fact that no one agreed with him at the time because he is now unable to imagine The Little Mermaid without the song.|$|E

50|$|Humiliation was {{the most}} common {{consequence}} of the European charivari. The acts which victims endured were forms of social ostracism often so <b>embarrassing</b> <b>that</b> they would leave the community for places where they were not known. Sometimes the charivari resulted in murder or suicide. Examples from the south of France include five cases of a charivari victim's firing on his accusers: these incidents resulted in two people being blinded and three killed. Some victims committed suicide, unable to recover from the public humiliation and social exclusion.|$|R
