25|$|The {{result was}} a sulfa craze. For several years in the late 1930s, {{hundreds}} of manufacturers produced {{tens of thousands of}} tons of myriad forms of sulfa. This and nonexistent testing requirements led to the elixir sulfanilamide disaster in the fall of 1937, during which at least 100 people were poisoned with diethylene glycol. This led to the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 in the United States. As the first and only effective antibiotic available in the years before penicillin, sulfa drugs continued to thrive through the early years of World War II. They are credited with saving the lives {{of tens of thousands of}} patients, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. (son of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and Winston Churchill. Sulfa had a central role in preventing wound infections during the war. American soldiers were issued a <b>first-aid</b> <b>kit</b> containing sulfa pills and powder, and were told to sprinkle it on any open wound.|$|E

In 1924, she became a part-time instructor for the Department of Zoology at Cambridge, one of only two women, both of whom were sometimes marginalised. For example, she was not allowed to sit at the table with the men of the department at tea: instead, she sat on a <b>first-aid</b> <b>kit.</b> There, Bishop continued her work with Spirostomum as the only protozoologist on the faculty.|$|E

5000|$|United Kingdom: In a {{statement}} {{at a meeting}} of the UN Security Council on 6 August, UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sir Mark Lyall Grant said: [...] "The truth of the matter is that this is not an insurrection born in the Donbas; it is an insurgency manufactured in Moscow. It is led by Russians, using Russian-supplied weapons, in a deliberate effort to destabilise Ukraine and to exert control over Kiev". Sir Mark made another statement to the Security Council on 28 August, and listed [...] "100 main battle tanks, 80 armoured personnel carriers, 100 man-portable air-defence systems, 100 anti-tank weapons and over 100 artillery pieces" [...] that were supplied to the Donbass insurgents directly by Russia. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced on 7 March 2015 that Britain would send an additional Â£850,000 in non-lethal aid following Ukraine's request. This included <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits,</b> night vision goggles, helmets, GPS units and laptops. On 19 January 2016, Michael Fallon said that Ukraine will receive 3,500 <b>first-aid</b> <b>kits</b> equal to Â£500,000 in April before the British training of Ukrainian troops.
