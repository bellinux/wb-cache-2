5|$|A archaeological {{study in}} 2010 {{revealed}} that {{the layout of the}} rock-cut caves in the temple {{is similar to that of}} other rock-cut temples such as the Rockfort and Pechipalai cave temple.

5|$|Although more {{abundant}} in montane and northern coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> <b>and</b> more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> the Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Bricks {{were also}} {{exported}} by the Dutch for major buildings in their colonies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> around the world. The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, South Africa, {{was built in}} 1666, and its entrance {{was made of the}} small yellow bricks called ijselstene (IJssel stones). Christ Church in Malacca, Malaysia, the oldest Dutch church building outside the Netherlands, was made of Dutch bricks that had been brought as ballast in ships from the Netherlands, coated with Chinese plaster.|$|E

5|$|Burma in the 15th {{century was}} divided into four {{principal}} power centers: the Ava Kingdom in present-day central Burma, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom on the southern coast, the Mrauk-U Kingdom (Arakan) in the west, and various Shan States <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> the north. Beginning in the 1480s, Ava began to disintegrate into even smaller kingdoms. By the early 15th century, Ava's former vassals—Mohnyin (and its allies Confederation of Shan States) {{in the north and}} the Prome Kingdom (Pyay) in the south—were regularly raiding their former overlord's territory with increasing frequency and intensity.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things {{a step further and}} had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E

Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> <b>and</b> rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{was much}} slower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> <b>and</b> the modest {{extensions}} {{on this side}} were separated from the much larger extensions in the west by the marshy open area of Moorfields adjacent to the wall {{on the north side}} which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E
5|$|In 6BC, on {{the verge}} of {{accepting}} command <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes.

Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
