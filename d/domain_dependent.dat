Here we analyzed the nuclear distribution of the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) /p 300 in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and in vivo complex formation by coimmunoprecipitation. A subpopulation of CBP and p 300 is targeted to active sites of transcription and partially colocalizes with hyper- and hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II (pol II) in discrete regions of variable size throughout the nucleus. However, the coactivators were found in tight association with hypophosphorylated, but not hyperphosphorylated pol II. Transcriptional inhibition induced a relocation of CBP/p 300 and pol II into speckles. Moreover, double and triple immunofluorescence analyses revealed the presence of CBP, p 300, and pol II in a subset of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies.

40|$|Integrative {{curriculum}} as both {{a theoretical}} construct and a practical reality, and as a theme-based, problem-centered, democratic way of schooling, is becoming more widely considered as a feasible alternative to traditional middle-level curricula. Importantly for teaching and learning, domain dependence requires teachers to view one area of knowledge as fully interdependent with other areas of knowledge during the learning process. This requires teachers to adopt personal epistemological theories that reflect integrative, <b>domain</b> <b>dependent</b> knowing. This study explored what happened when teachers from highly traditional domain independent school settings encountered an ambitious college-level curriculum project {{that was designed to}} help the teachers understand the potential that integrative, <b>domain</b> <b>dependent</b> teaching holds for precollege settings. This study asked: What influence does an integrative, <b>domain</b> <b>dependent</b> curriculum project have on teachers` domain independent, epistemological theories for teaching and learning? Finding an answer to this question is essential if we, as an educational community, are to understand how integrative curriculum theory is transformed by teachers into systemic curriculum reform. The results suggest that the integrative curriculum project that teachers participated in did not explicitly alter their classroom practices in a wholesale manner. Personal epistemological theories of teachers collectively precluded teachers from making any wholesale changes in their individual classroom teaching. However, teachers became aware of integrative curriculum as an alternative, and they expressed interest in infusing integrative practices into their classrooms as opportunities arise...|$|E

Recent studies of murine knockouts of key genes in the microdeleted region, LIM kinase 1 (LIMK 1) and cytoplasmatic linker protein 2 (CYLN 2), demonstrated significant functional and metabolic abnormalities, but grossly normal structure, in the hippocampal formation (HF). Furthermore, deficits in spatial navigation and long-term memory, major cognitive <b>domains</b> <b>dependent</b> on hippocampal function, have been described in WS. We used multimodal neuroimaging to characterize hippocampal structure, function, and metabolic integrity in 12 participants with WS and 12 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched healthy controls. PET and functional MRI studies showed profound reduction in resting blood flow and absent differential response to visual stimuli in the anterior HF in WS. Spectroscopic measures of N-acetyl aspartate, considered a marker of synaptic activity, were reduced. Hippocampal size was preserved, but subtle alterations in shape were present. These data demonstrate abnormalities in HF in WS in agreement with murine models, implicate LIMK 1 and CYLN 2 in human hippocampal function, and suggest that hippocampal dysfunction may contribute to neurocognitive abnormalities in WS...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that biological membranes can be laterally subdivided into domains enriched in specific lipid and protein components and that these domains {{may be involved in}} the regulation of a number of vital cellular processes. An example is membrane rafts, which are lipid-mediated <b>domains</b> <b>dependent</b> on preferential association between sterols and sphingolipids and inclusive of a specific subset of membrane proteins. While the lipid and protein composition of rafts has been extensively characterized, the structural details determining protein partitioning to these domains remain unresolved. Here, we review evidence suggesting that post-translation modification by saturated lipids recruits both peripheral and transmembrane proteins to rafts, while short, unsaturated, and/or branched hydrocarbon chains prevent raft association. The most widely studied group of raft-associated proteins are glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-AP), and we review a variety of evidence supporting raft-association of these saturated lipid-anchored extracellular peripheral proteins. For transmembrane and intracellular peripheral proteins, S-acylation with saturated fatty acids mediates raft partitioning, and the dynamic nature of this modification presents an exciting possibility of enzymatically regulated raft association. The other common lipid modifications, that is, prenylation and myristoylation, are discussed in light of their likely role in targeting proteins to nonraft membrane regions. Finally, although the association between raft affinity an...|$|R
40|$|TMEFF 2 {{is a type}} I {{transmembrane protein}} with two follistatin (FS) and one EGF-like domain over-expressed in {{prostate}} cancer, however its biological role in prostate cancer development and progression remains unclear, which may, at least in part, be explained by its proteolytic processing. The extracellular part of TMEFF 2 (TMEFF 2 -ECD) is cleaved by ADAM 17 and the membrane-retained fragment is further processed by the gamma-secretase complex. TMEFF 2 shedding is increased with cell crowding, a condition associated with the tumour microenvironment, which was mediated by oxidative stress signalling, requiring jun-kinase (JNK) activation. Moreover, we have identified that TMEFF 2 is also a novel substrate for other proteases implicated in prostate cancer, including two ADAMs (ADAM 9 and ADAM 12) and the type II transmembrane serine proteinases (TTSPs) matriptase- 1 and hepsin. Whereas cleavage by ADAM 9 and ADAM 12 generates previously identified TMEFF 2 -ECD, proteolytic processing by matriptase- 1 and hepsin produced TMEFF 2 fragments, composed of TMEFF 2 -ECD or FS and/or EGF-like domains as well as novel membrane retained fragments.
