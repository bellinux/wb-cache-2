40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the joint responses of commodity futures prices and traders’ futures positions {{to changes in}} the VIX before and after the recent financial crisis. We find that while <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> accommodate the needs of commercial hedgers in normal times, in times of distress, <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> reduce their net long positions in response to an increase in the VIX causing the risk to flow to commercial hedgers. By exploiting a cross-section of traders, we provide micro-level evidence for a convective flow of risk from distressed <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> to commercial hedgers. The presence of such risk convection confirms the market impact of <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> conditional on trades initiated by them and motivates an extension of the long-standing hedging pressure theory of commodity futures markets to incorporate time-varying risk capacities of <b>financial</b> <b>traders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} joint {{responses}} of commodity future prices and positions of various trader groups to {{changes of the}} CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) {{before and after the}} recent <b>financial</b> crisis. <b>Financial</b> <b>traders</b> reduced their net long positions during the crisis in response to market distress, whereas hedgers facilitated this by reducing their net short positions as prices fell. This “convective risk flow ” induced by the greater distress of financial institutions led to a change in the allocation of risk with hedgers holding more risk than they did previously. The presence of such a risk flow confirms the market impact of <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> conditional on trades they initiate...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} differences in decision-making style and risk-taking between <b>financial</b> <b>traders,</b> non-trading bank employees, and people not working in finance. Traders {{scored significantly higher}} than participants in the other two groups on the cognitive reflection test (CRT) which measures the tendency to inhibit automatic but frequently false responses in reasoning tasks. Scores for traders compared to people outside the banking sector were also higher on a self-rated scale for reflective thinking in decision-making, but there were no differences in self-rated intuitive thinking between groups. Financial risk-taking correlated with cognitive reflection scores and was significantly lower in the non-expert group compared to the other groups working in <b>financial</b> services. <b>Traders</b> in the current study showed no elevated preference to use 'intuition' in their decision-making compared to other groups. Overall, these results indicate that compared to non-expert participants <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> have a higher self-rated tendency for reflective thinking and a greater propensity to inhibit the use of mental shortcuts (heuristics) in decision-making...|$|R

40|$|We {{study how}} the {{exposure}} of fundamental and <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> affects the futures curve of WTI oil and the market integration between WTI and Brent as measured by their price spread. To obtain a parsimonious representation of the futures curve, we decompose it into a level-, a slope- and a curvature factor. In a second step, we separately regress each extracted factor on measures of the market exposure of fundamental and <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> revealing whether and how {{the exposure of}} the two trader groups affects the different dimensions of the futures curve. Spanning from 2006 until 2012, our dataset covers sub-periods of a sharp WTI-price rise {{as well as a}} diverging Brent-WTI-spread. Our contribution is threefold: First, we suggest {{that it is important to}} distinguish between level and slope as we find that fundamental traders have a measurable impact on the level of the futures curve, but do not play much of a role for its slope or curvature, whereas the exposure of <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> mainly influences the slope of the futures curve. Despite allegations to the contrary, we find no evidence of a systematic impact of non-fundamental traders on the level of the futures curve, for example during the 2006 - 2008 oil price surge. Second, we suggest using relative short- and relative long positions for fundamental and <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> instead of the net position as the former reflect better the overall group exposure and yield more significant results. Third, we find that the exposure of financials is the key driver of the Brent-WTI spread. It confirms that financial rather than fun-damental traders are responsible for integrating the two markets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{allocation}} of IBRD net income is the {{lens through which}} the burdensharing issue in the World Bank Group is viewed. The paper concludes that (1) the distribution of voting power {{does not reflect the}} contribution to IBRD equity made by its borrowing members as the share of retained earnings has risen while the share of paid-in capital has declined over the years; (2) the major shareholders have used their control rights to allocate portions of IBRD net income to serve their interests in ways that have been {{at the expense of the}} borrowing members and (3) a continuation of a stagnating loan portfolio in nominal terms and a declining one in inflation-adjusted terms is likely to constrain the Bank’s net income from lending operations and to render it increasingly dependent for its continuing profitability on its role as a <b>financial</b> <b>trader</b> and arbitrageur. In order to regain its competitiveness as an international development lending intermediary, it is important to review the pricing of loans and the conditions attached to them as well the restraints that have applied on the purposes for which the Bank lends.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to assess the effectiveness of technical analysis as a tool for financial security price forecasting. This form of analysis was examined so as {{to determine whether or not}} any benefit could be attributed to an investor or <b>financial</b> <b>trader</b> who applied it. Two technical trading strategies, consisting of three indicators each, were applied to fifteen financial securities over a five year period; so as to observe the price forecasting signals offered by the technical indicators. The resulting technical signals offered by the trading strategies were recorded and assessed for accuracy; allowing for various observations to be made; namely the forecasting precision of the technical strategies, the application of technical analysis in the equity and foreign exchange markets, the use of single or multiple technical indicators within a strategy, and the combining of technical analysis with fundamental analysis. The results indicated that the effective implementation of technical analysis could very well benefit the price forecasting practices of financial analysts and investors. However, it was determined that a fair amount of discretion on behalf of the analyst would be required when examining the signals offered by the technical indicators for the purpose of predicting financial security price movements...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{development}} of a game based approach to improving the decision-making capabilities of <b>financial</b> <b>traders</b> through attention to improving the regulation of emotions during trading. Design/methodology/approach: The project used a design-based research approach to integrate the contributions of a highly inter-disciplinary team. The approach was underpinned by considerable stakeholder engagement to understand the ‘ecology of practices’ in which this learning approach should be embedded. Findings: Taken together, our 35 laboratory, field and evaluation studies provide much support for the validity of our game based learning approach, the learning elements which make it up, {{and the value of}} designing game-based learning to fit within an ecology of existing practices. Originality/value: The novelty of the work described in the paper comes from the focus in this research project of combining knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines informed by a deep understanding of the context of application to achieve the successful {{development of}} a Learning Pathway, which addresses the transfer of learning to the practice environment Key words: Design-based research, emotion-regulation, disposition–effect, <b>financial</b> <b>traders,</b> serious games, sensor-based game...|$|R

40|$|Shadow banking {{has emerged}} as a {{practice}} and system that challenges regulatory efforts and financial and economic theory. This thesis undertakes an investigation of the ontology of shadow banking seen through the financial economics of Fischer Black and the work of <b>financial</b> <b>trader</b> Elie Ayache. I argue Black provides a particular vocabulary of what comes to be described as shadow banking. Black shows the way that financial economics redefines fixed relations into contingent conjectures. Risky debt can be redefined as safe via an interest rate swap and credit default swap. More generally financial economics reframes social, economic and institutional relations in terms of price. The underlying reality of derivatives markets is the price process. Financial theory creates options to delay decisions under situations of uncertainty, while derivatives are the mechanism through which these options are enacted. The thesis captures the interplay between the subjective interventions of financial economists {{and the way in which}} these interventions are modified and enacted in financial markets. Financial processes gain their meaning through being put in front of somebody else. This means that the process of the financial market is one of continual integration and replication of difference via pricing, writing and trading. I contend throughout the thesis that radical thought must be attuned to the way financial economists breakdown categorical distinctions between safety and risk both conceptually and in reality. I consider the ways in which macroeconomists are grappling with financial derivatives via the concept of dealer-of-last-resort. Central banks hold a heightened position in financial markets, but are constrained by the same calculative issues as other market dealers: how to calculate derivative exposures. By intermediating at the level of collateral, central banks are exposed to price in markets in new ways...|$|E
