50|$|Certain {{theoretical}} works, {{combined with}} empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products).

50|$|Services {{marketers}} {{have argued}} that risk perception is higher for services because they lack the search attributes of products (i.e. tangible properties that can be inspected prior to consumption). In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists identify three broad classes of purchase; search goods, <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> and credence goods with implications for consumer evaluation processes. Search goods, which include most tangible products, possess tangible characteristics that allow consumers to evaluate quality prior to purchase and consumption. <b>Experience</b> <b>goods,</b> such as restaurants and clubs, can only be evaluated with certainty after purchase or consumption. In the case of credence goods, such as many professional services, the consumer finds it difficult to fully appreciate {{the quality of the}} goods even after purchase and consumption has occurred. Difficulties evaluating quality after consumption may arise because the cost of obtaining information is prohibitive, or because the consumer lacks the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake such evaluations. These goods are called credence products because the consumer’s quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.|$|E
50|$|Perceived risk is {{associated}} with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> and credence goods with implications for consumer evaluation processes. Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services {{are more likely to}} engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a risk reduction activity.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how the electronic {{word of mouth}} (eWOM) information direction (positive vs. negative) and a website's reputation (established vs. unestablished) contribute to the eWOM effect. The article describes a study focusing on the moderating role of the product type (search vs. experience). The results of the experiment show that the eWOM effect is greater for negative eWOM than for positive eWOM, greater for established websites than for unestablished websites, and greater for <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> than for search goods. The results support the moderating effects of product type on the eWOM information direction-website reputation-eWOM effect relationship. The impact of negative eWOM on the eWOM effect is greater for <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> than for search goods. Similarly, the impact of website reputation on the eWOM effect is greater for <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> than for search goods.

40|$|By {{lowering}} {{the costs of}} gathering and sharing information and offering new ways to learn about products before purchase, the Internet reduces traditional distinctions between search and <b>experience</b> <b>goods.</b> At the same time, differences {{in the type of}} information sought for search and <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> can precipitate differences in the process through which consumers gather information and make decisions online. A preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant differences in consumers ’ perceived ability to evaluate product quality before purchase between search and <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> in traditional retail environments, these differences are blurred in online environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative sample of U. S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of time online gathering information for both search and <b>experience</b> <b>goods,</b> but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase behavior of consumers for these two types of goods. In particular, <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> involve greater depth (time per page) and lower breadth (total number of pages) of search than search goods. In addition, free riding (purchasing from a retailer other than the primary source of product information) is less frequent for experience than for search goods. Finally, the presence of product reviews from other consumers and multimedia that enable consumers to interact with products before purchase has a greater effect on consumer search and purchase behavior for experience than for search goods...|$|E

A theoretical framework was developed by merging two existent academic theories. Obstacle categories that were explored encompassed Trust and Credibility, Differentiators, Information Requirement, No Physical Touch, Loyalty, and Returns. Some prevalent propositions in academic literature were not reconfirmed. Markedly distinct perceptions were revealed with regard to Differentiators, No Physical Touch, and Loyalty. Based on the findings from an extensive literature review, the qualitative research, and an Internet search practical recommendations to e-tailers of Decorative Cosmetics – an experience good – were presented. The implementation of these recommendations might alleviate the online selling of <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> by reducing online shoppers‟ uncertainty concerning their actual characteristics prior to the purchase.

Drawing on the paradigm of search and <b>experience</b> <b>goods</b> from information economics, we develop and test a model of customer review helpfulness. An analysis of 1, 587 reviews from Amazon. com across six products indicated that review extremity, review depth, and product type affect the perceived helpfulness of the review. Product type moderates the effect of review extremity on the helpfulness of the review. For <b>experience</b> <b>goods,</b> reviews with extreme ratings are less help-ful than reviews with moderate ratings. For both product types, review depth has a positive effect on the helpfulness of the review, but the product type moderates the effect of review depth on the helpfulness of the review.
