25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side I played against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them first up in my Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E
500|$|Literary critics, {{primarily}} in French-speaking Europe, have also examined The Adventures of Tintin. In 1984, Jean-Marie Apostolidès published {{his study of}} the Adventures of Tintin from a more [...] "adult" [...] perspective as Les Métamorphoses de Tintin, published in English as The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults in 2010. In reviewing Apostolidès' book, Nathan Perl-Rosenthal of The New Republic thought that it was [...] "not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart: it is packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon." [...] Following Apostolidès's work, French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books Tintin et les Secrets de Famille ("Tintin and the Family Secrets"), which was published in 1990, and Tintin et le Secret d'Hergé ("Tintin and Hergé's Secret"), published in 1993.|$|E
500|$|The Incredible Hulk {{has been}} well received. In its debut year, the ride was voted the [...] 1 roller coaster by Discovery Channel viewers, {{appearing}} on the Thrills, Chills and Spills documentary. Amusement Business described The Incredible Hulk as one of Islands of Adventure's two world-class roller coasters (the other being the now dismantled Dueling Dragons, {{also known as the}} Dragon Challenge). Dewayne Bevil of the Orlando Sentinel rated the ride as his eighth favorite attraction in Orlando. He states the ride is [...] "too intense to take back-to-back trips. It rattles our nerves, in a good way." [...] Arthur Levine of About.com gave the ride 9 out of 10 stars. Levine describes the ride as [...] "both terrifying and exhilarating" [...] and [...] "not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart".|$|E

500|$|As one {{reviewer}} put it, {{the cats}} {{in the series}} are [...] "true to their feline nature," [...] leading some critics to jokingly comment that the books will [...] "leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously" [...] and wondering [...] "what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat." [...] However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence, with one critic stating that it is [...] "not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart." [...] Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques' Redwall series, though one commented that it was [...] "not as elegantly written." [...] The New York Times called the series a [...] "hit with young readers", specifically because of its [...] "sprawling universe", and the series was able {{to appear on the}} New York Times Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks, as of 24 November 2013.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E
500|$|Several anime and manga {{publications}} {{have provided}} praise for Saitō. His fight {{scenes in the}} series, in particular, have also been acclaimed. While reviewing the volume 7 from the manga, Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey applauded the fight between Himura Kenshin and Saito Hajime at the Kamiya Dojo as the [...] "high spot of the [...] high spot". In the volume 14 review for the manga, Lavey described {{the end of the}} fight between Saitō and Usui as [...] "very gruesome and not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart". In the DVD volume 7 review for the anime, Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge described the fight scene between Saitō and Kenshin as [...] "definitely choreographed well". He praised [...] "the viciousness in the attacks, masked under their cold calculating facade" [...] as being [...] "wonderfully done, providing a real feel for these ultimate killers". His appearance in the OVAs has also received praise. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network states that during the character's brief appearances in the [...] OVA series, he appears to be [...] "truly menacing." [...] Mark A. Grey of Anime News Network said that the song [...] "Hoeru Miburo (Howling Wolf of Mibu)" [...] in the anime series [...] "perfectly" [...] represents the character. Reviewing the manga Restoration, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network felt Saitō's was interesting in regards to his philosophy as it contrasted Kenshin's but lamented his lack of appearances in this version. Daryl Surat from Otaku USA considers him as the greatest character from the series based on the impact he brings to the series during his introduction.|$|E

[...] The {{trail to the}} observation tower lookout hill is not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faint</b> <b>of</b> heart. It is very steep and very slippery. It is a one-way trail (in {{the sense that the}} same trail is used in the return trip) and the trail feels even more slippery in the downhill return hike. This trail is made of rocks but, because of the high humidity and low traffic, algae have overtaken the rocks to make the trail very slippery. Walking around the rocks does not always help as the area is muddy - though albeit less slippery. The view and fresh air and breeze make the trek quite rewarding. The views are unobstructed and panoramic 360° views are possible. The tower is 3,537 feet above sea level. Altogether the distance from the visitor's parking area to the tower is 2.14 miles.|$|E

60|$|About {{the middle}} of October the dark months overspread the Bay of Mercy, and the reign of {{perpetual}} night began.

The door opened as he rode up and a man's dark figure appeared in the entrance.|$|R
