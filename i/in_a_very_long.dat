5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E

After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E

The League, so successful in Cork, was less successful elsewhere. Its principles of establishing a movement of a new kind to attract rather than repel Unionist and Protestant support for an All-Ireland Home Rule settlement, while influentially limited, did motivate a worthy political initiative.|$|E

500|$|Uzumaki {{was written}} and {{illustrated}} by Junji Ito. Junji Ito's initial desire was to create a story about strange changes that would occur to people living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> traditional Japanese terraced house. This story would have been based on Ito's personal experience living in such a house as a child. During the process of finding a way to draw such a long building, Ito was inspired by the shape of a mosquito coil and decided he could make the building long by having it spiral. Ito has noted that the spiral is a [...] "mysterious pattern" [...] and described writing Uzumaki as an attempt to learn the secrets of the spiral. Ito sought inspiration by methods such as staring at spirals, researching spirals, creating spiral patterns by draining water from bath tubs, eating foods with spiral patterns, and raising snails. Looking back on the series in 2006, Ito stated that while he was still uncertain what the spiral stood for, he thought it might be representative of infinity.|$|E

A review in The Guardian praised Taran Mansukhani's direction and writing, calling it a [...] "a straight victory for gay comedy": [...] "India's convoluted attitude to gayness finally has its cinematic manifestation in Dostana, one of the gayest films ever made in any country but in which almost no one is actually gay. It's also a terrific movie – the best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time." [...] Describing the film as a [...] "decent-hearted comedy", Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Dostana deserves credit. It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India, and does so using contemporary Bollywood’s best not-so-secret weapon: star power." [...] David Chute of LA Weekly called it [...] "a pure star vehicle, gliding along on charm and timing – {{exactly the sort of}} comfort cinema Hollywood now seems incapable of making." ...|$|E

Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "The Camel" [...] was a particularly funny episode, and that the parks department's collaboration on the mural allowed [...] "each character being able to instill their own level of brand-specific insanity into the mix". Fowler also praised the sewer department jokes, the [...] "murinal" [...] scene involving Jerry {{and the fact that}} no department ended up winning the mural contest, which Fowler called a commentary on [...] "the futility of local government in their attempts to accomplish anything". The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared [...] "The Camel" [...] one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall said the Ron and Andy subplot [...] "made me laugh as hard as I have <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time", and said the episode had a good mix of funny, sweet and ridiculous moments, and said the ensemble cast was starting to work extremely well together.|$|E
