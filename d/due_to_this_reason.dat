25|$|Serbia and Greece share a lot {{of mutual}} history in {{contemporary}} football. In Serbia, the Superleague Greece is closely followed due to the large migration of Serbian expat footballers to Greece, where the league has more {{money to pay for}} players' salaries than in Serbia—it is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that Greek football players are practically nonexistent in Serbia despite Serbian footballers having a large presence in Greek football. Serbian football players have frequently made their career heyday in Greece and have a special place in Greek popular culture. The first Serbian player to ever make a revered name for himself in Greece was Borivoje Đorđević, who represented Panathinaikos in the late 1970s. Arguably, Predrag Đorđević, affectionately called Djole by Olympiakos spectators, was one Serbian footballer to have played in Greece. Otherwise, Vladimir Ivić was the most successful Serbian football player to have played in Greece for a team other than Olympiacos—Ivić had an illustrious career with PAOK, before which he had played briefly for AEK Athens. In 1995, when UEFA suspension on FR Yugoslavia was lifted, the first international game played by a Serb club was precisely a friendly Red Star vs. Olympiacos, in Belgrade.|$|E

This paper addresses controlling of speed of a BLDC motor which remains among the vital issues. A BLDC motor is generally controlled by Proportional plus Integral (PI) controller.

This control technique works against parameters variations and external disturbances, and also its ability in controlling linear and nonlinear systems. Performance of these controllers has been verified through simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation results showed that SMC was a superior controller than PI controller for speed control of a BLDC moto...|$|R

The bridge was finally completed in 2009, improving the traffic flow into the island and development of Madura Island. Unfortunately, the strategy would not be comprehensive without strategic development of the Madura Island, especially in Bangkalan District (Kabupaten Bangkalan). The Central Government has proposed a Green Industry with zero waste and clean energy concept. This industry and port would process the agriculture products from Madura for the export and Eastern part of Indonesia market. Therefore, an industrial ecology concept was needed to achieve the sustainable green industry for Eastern of Indonesia. ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a study about dynamics of territorial gaps in agriculture between EU NUTS 2 and 3 from three perspectives: agricultural production model, rural development and productivity. Our {{choice of methodology}} is driven by two considerations. First of all, different performances in agriculture of EU areas may lead to multimodal distributions of indicators, and this implies that no significant average behaviour a parametric estimates refers to can be identified. Secondly, even if one wants to highlight multimodality within distributions, techniques like univariate density estimates can not catch intra-distribution dynamics which lead {{to the formation of}} "poles" of units showing a "similar conduct". <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>reasons,</b> we adopt a statistical approach which aims to point out the main features of a whole distribution, rather than to focus on a single parameter estimate. The non parametrical statistical technique of stochastic kernel (Quah, 1999) allows to detect the underlying law of motion of a distribution, as well as the influence of a "conditioning factor" on it following a regression-like rationale...|$|R
