60|$|<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> up <b>the</b> creaky stairs two flights, and rapped on the door.|$|R
60|$|Promptly at four <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> {{stairs and}} knocked at Mr. Fox's door. The Swiss who opened it {{shook his head}} dubiously when I asked for his master, {{and said he had}} not been at home that day.|$|E
60|$|At last it came, and its hoarse boom thrilled {{the heart}} of many a homesick man like myself. We had not much to put aboard, and when <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> {{gang-plank}} {{it was with a}} feeling of fortunate escape.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} wait," [...] he {{answered}} simply. [...] "I saw the flutter of your gown as I came along the lane, and <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> wall. All {{the way down}} I fancied {{that you might be}} wearing blue." ...|$|E

60|$|I hastened home. <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> to <b>the</b> {{top of the}} old chimney, {{hammer in}} hand, and began the work of demolition.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> steps. The wide {{vestibule}} {{was empty}} except for two men who stopped a low-toned conversation to look at me. I wondered whether they recognized me; that I might be recognized was an alarming possibility which had not occurred to me.|$|E
60|$|A fishing-boat {{was lying}} {{alongside}} the brig. By the murky {{light of the}} poop lanterns I could see the figures upon her deck, and the great brown sail all ready for hoisting. <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> bulwark and set my foot upon the rope-ladder which led down to her.|$|E
6000|$|Bill Brown and the {{chairman}} shoved Blackey back, and the crowd gathered in. Cries and protestations rose from its midst. [...] "No, you don't," [...] a boy's shrill voice made itself heard. [...] "I'm not going to go. <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> tree and made the rope fast, and I've got a right to stay." [...] "You're only a kid," [...] replied a man's voice, [...] "and it ain't good for you." [...] "I don't care, and I'm not a kid. I'm--I'm used to such things. And, anyway, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> tree. Look at my hands." [...] "Of course he can stay," [...] other voices took up the trouble. [...] "Leave him alone, Curley." [...] "You ain't the whole thing." [...] A laugh greeted this, and things quieted down.|$|E
5000|$|... (<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> to <b>the</b> top of {{the highest}} pine tree to look for you—the pine tree was kind and wept when it saw how I wept.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on, go on," [...] Smoke urged. [...] "At what station do <b>I</b> <b>climb</b> onto <b>the</b> choo-choo cars, or at what water-tank do I {{get thrown}} off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "up you go, old fellow. You are not fit to walk any farther;" [...] {{and with}} his help <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> into <b>the</b> saddle.|$|R
60|$|When Hendry entered to {{take off}} his collar and coat before sitting down to his evening meal of hot water, porter, and bread mixed in a bowl, Jess sent me off to the attic. As <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> stairs I remembered that the minister's wife thought Leeby in need of sharpening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy now, Dale, ole man.... Don't you reckon I'm ridin' in on {{you pretty}} early? Look at thet hoss!"

60|$|Accompanied by twenty picked men bearing {{provisions}} and arms, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> ladders easily enough, {{and now that}} I had food and shelter, crossed the mountains without mishap. They even escorted me through the desert beyond, till one night we camped {{within sight of the}} gigantic Buddha that sits before the monastery, gazing eternally across the sands and snows.|$|E

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> up on <b>the</b> roof. I {{was working}} {{up there on}} the roof.|$|R
5000|$|... "Apocalypse" [...] is the {{shortest}} piece of the song, only about 40 seconds long, it consists only of four lines, accompanied only by Howe's guitars. The lyrics are taken from [...] "Cord of Life", but are sung in the key of B, making them more upbeat:And you and <b>I</b> <b>climb,</b> crossing <b>the</b> shapes of the morning.And you and I reach over the sun for the river.And you and <b>I</b> <b>climb,</b> clearer, towards <b>the</b> movement.And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> ladder on {{the side}} of the for'ard house (which house contained, as I discovered, the forecastle, the galley, and the donkey- engine room), and went part way along the bridge to a {{position}} by the foremast, where I could observe the crew heaving up anchor. The Britannia was alongside, and we were getting under way.|$|E
60|$|I had Jenny to {{ride the}} very next day. Result: my lady smiled on me more sweetly than ever when I went to Prince George Street, and vowed Jenny had never looked prettier than when she went past the house. This left my victory in such {{considerable}} doubt that <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> back wall forthwith in my new top-boots.|$|E
60|$|When we had supped (sitting {{together}} in the great room), <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> ladder into the loft and was soon fast asleep. But from dreams distracted with confusion I awoke at the first shafts of dawn. I stood beside the narrow window in {{the wall of the}} loft and watched the distant river change to silver, the bright green of the grass appear.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> o’er <b>the</b> crags of LankaAnd gazed on {{the golden}} seaWhen out from her ancient places,Her soul came forth to me;"Give me a bard,” said Lanka,“A bard of the things to be.” ...|$|R
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> to <b>the</b> ship's rail. This time I {{succeeded in}} raising {{my eyes to}} the level of the deck, where I could take a careful survey of the {{conditions}} immediately confronting me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bessie, <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> up <b>the</b> {{ladder of}} course. I {{acknowledge}} being unusually light-hearted and happy this morning, but I have not as yet grown wings. Sam said <b>I</b> could not <b>climb</b> up that straight ladder, but I found it easy enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't {{much for}} us to do here," [...] said Mary Louise when the three were left alone, [...] "except to read, to eat and to sleep--lazy occupations all. <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} a little way yesterday, but the view from the Lodge is the best of all and if you leave the road you tear your dress to shreds in the scrub." ...|$|E
60|$|Ere {{long the}} {{laughter}} of Ulpius, while he moved slowly hither and thither {{in the darkness of}} the temple, was overpowered by the sound of her voice--deep, groaning, but yet steady--as she uttered her last words--words poured forth like the wild dirges, the fierce death-songs of the old Goths when they died deserted on the bloody battle-field, or were cast bound into deep dungeons, a prey to the viper and the asp. Thus she spoke:-- 'I swore to be avenged! while I went forth from Aquileia with the child that was killed and the child that was wounded; while <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> high wall in the night-time, and heard the tumult of the beating waves near the bank where I buried the dead; while I wandered in the darkness over the naked heath and through the lonely forest; while <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> pathless sides of the mountains, and made my refuge in the cavern by the waters of the dark lake.|$|E
60|$|A new sound, a purring {{rustle of}} leaves, stopped me {{instantly}} as <b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> beech ridge, one late afternoon, {{to see what}} wood folk I might surprise feeding on the rich mast. Pr-r-r-r-ush, pr-r-r-r-ush! a curious combination of the rustling of squirrels' feet and the soft, crackling purr of an eagle's wings, growing nearer, clearer every instant. I slipped quietly behind the nearest tree to watch and listen.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>climbed</b> to <b>the</b> {{top of a}} {{mountain}} one day [...] To see the sun setting in glory, [...] And I thought, as I looked at his vanishing ray, [...] Of a perfectly splendid story.|$|R
60|$|Sweet, I {{blame you}} not, for mine the fault was, had I {{not been made}} of common clay <b>I</b> had <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> higher heights unclimbed yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> can <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> jointed grass; [...] And on high [...] See {{the greater}} {{swallows}} pass [...] In the sky, [...] And the round sun rolling by [...] Heeding no {{such things as}} I.|$|R
