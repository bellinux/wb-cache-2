5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two <b>ferrets</b> inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the <b>ferrets</b> from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the <b>ferrets</b> be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the <b>ferrets</b> free access from one leg to the other, and the <b>ferrets</b> must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ferrets</b> are {{occasionally}} put {{inside the}} contestants' shirts {{in addition to}} their trousers. An attempt to introduce a female version of the sport—ferret busting, in which female contestants introduced <b>ferrets</b> down their blouses—proved unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, <b>ferrets,</b> weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, <b>ferrets,</b> possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|The forests were {{dominated}} by birds, {{and the lack of}} mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness. The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, <b>ferrets</b> and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as <b>ferrets</b> or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, {{large numbers}} of mustelids (stoats, <b>ferrets</b> and weasels) were {{released}} in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers, but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the kakapo. Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kakapo for food, and caused the extinction {{of some of its}} preferred plant species. The kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the Whanganui River as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the Kaimanawa Ranges by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.|$|E

When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E

5|$|After {{the island}} was {{evacuated}} it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from Barra. In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a sheep farmer in both Australia and Montana. Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company, choosing {{to live on the}} island alone all autumn and winter with his pet <b>ferrets</b> and cats, and joined by two shepherds for the spring and summer only. After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company’s ownership continued for the next forty years.|$|E
5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, <b>ferrets,</b> rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E

5|$|The great spotted kiwi, great grey kiwi, or roroa (Apteryx haastii) is {{a species}} of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The great spotted kiwi, {{as a member of}} the ratites, is flightless. It is the largest of the kiwi. The rugged {{topography}} and harsh climate of the high altitude, alpine, part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators, which include dogs, <b>ferrets,</b> cats and stoats. Because of this, populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi. Nonetheless, there has been a 43% decline in population in the past 45 years, due to these predators and habitat destruction. This has led it to be classified as vulnerable. There are less than 16,000great spotted kiwis in total, almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northwest coast, and the Southern Alps. A minority live on island reserves.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including <b>ferrets,</b> mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage {{in nature and}} in war” in the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form in relation to appearance” in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: a symposium on form in nature and art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of <b>ferrets,</b> rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{habitats}} of the {{black-footed ferret}} included shortgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, desert grassland, shrub steppe, sagebrush steppe, mountain grassland, and semi-arid grassland. Black-footed <b>ferrets</b> use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover. Six black-footed ferret nests found near Mellette County, South Dakota, {{were lined with}} buffalo grass, prairie threeawn, sixweeks grass, and cheatgrass.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>ferret</b> (Mustela putorius furo) {{represents}} an attractive animal {{model for the}} study of respiratory diseases, including influenza. Despite its importance for biomedical research, the number of reagents for molecular and immunological analysis is restricted. We present here a parallel sequencing effort to produce an extensive EST (expressed sequence tags) dataset derived from a normalized <b>ferret</b> cDNA library made from mRNA from <b>ferret</b> blood, liver, lung, spleen and brain. Results We produced more than 500000 sequence reads that were assembled into 16000 partial <b>ferret</b> genes. These genes were combined with the available <b>ferret</b> sequences in the GenBank to develop a <b>ferret</b> specific microarray platform. Using this array, we detected tissue specific expression patterns which were confirmed by quantitative real time PCR assays. We also present a set of 41 <b>ferret</b> genes with even transcription profiles across the tested tissues, indicating their usefulness as housekeeping genes. Conclusion The tools developed in this study allow for functional genomic analysis and make further development of reagents for the <b>ferret</b> model possible. </p...|$|R
