5|$|Beginning on 19 February 1971, {{the court}} heard reports from Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr of McCartney's {{attempts}} to control the band, and McCartney's equally unflattering assessment of Klein. Although the other three former Beatles <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> a united front against McCartney since his April 1970 departure from the band, the recent publication of Lennon's scathing comments to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, about McCartney, Harrison and Starr, added to the ill-feeling surrounding the group.|$|E

5|$|Landman {{had also}} been a {{prominent}} opponent of Zionism: when, in 1922, the United States Congress was considering the Lodge–Fish resolution {{in support of the}} Balfour Declaration, Landman and Rabbi David Philipson <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> the Reform movement's (then) anti-Zionist position to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Landman also printed many opinions against the resolution and Zionism in his American Hebrew Magazine. The bill was eventually unanimously supported by both houses of Congress, and approved by President Harding.|$|E

Mancuso liked Shatner's idea {{and agreed to}} hire a writer to draft a film treatment.

Shatner dictated the story himself {{and gave it to}} Paramount's production president Ned Tanen for input.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Menagerie is {{frequently}} referenced {{during the reign}} of HenryIII. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> Henry with three leopards, circa 1235, which were kept in the Tower. There is evidence, however, that King John (1166 – 1216) had first started keeping wild animals at the Tower. Records from 1210-1212 show payments to lion keepers.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 12 August 1714. When he performed {{it again in}} Leipzig on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity in 1723 (8 August) {{it was the first}} solo cantata and the most operatic work which he <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> to the congregation up to that point.

In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after the sermon.|$|E

5|$|Eugene Sack, {{the father}} of Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge Robert D. Sack, joined Landman as rabbi in 1946.

Starting in 1943 he spent 18 months in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II as an army chaplain; at one point he had to substitute peach juice for Passover wine.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
5|$|His {{elevation}} as emperor {{ushered in}} a period of crisis, the most troublesome in Brazil's history. As Pedro II could not exert his constitutional prerogatives as Emperor (Executive and Moderating Power) until he reached majority, a regency was created. The first regency consisted of a triumvirate, and one of its members was the same Brigadier General Francisco de Lima e Silva who <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> the infant Pedro to the Government more than five years previously. Disputes between political factions resulted in an unstable, almost anarchical, regency. The Liberals who had ousted Pedro I soon split into two factions: moderate liberals (constitutional monarchists who would later split into the Liberal Party and Conservative Party) and Republicans (a small minority, but radical and highly rebellious). There were also the Restorationists who had been previously known as Bonifacians.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Lemmings would be ported to the iOS operating system by developer Mobile 1UP. On 29 June 2010, Mobile 1UP reported that Sony Computer Entertainment Europe <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> them with a cease-and-desist letter, forcing them to halt development of the port. In April 2011, Mobile 1UP has released a re-worked version of the work done in 2010 with a prehistoric setting (new artwork, sfx, music, levels) under the name Caveman, available for the iOS and webOS platforms. Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the porting of the Apple IIgs version of Lemmings, has released the games' source code.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{consists}} of twenty-five letters that address an extensive range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, {{as well as}} less controversial subjects, such as gardening, salt works, and sublime vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> in An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, is informed by her own experiences in revolutionary France and those of her friends, {{many of whom were}} jailed.|$|E

For the second series, John was relegated to host the showbiz Electric Circus segment, leaving Andi and Emma to become the main hosts.

5|$|Said {{disliked the}} Oslo Accords for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and the country would resist any armed incursion.

Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, <b>had</b> <b>presented</b> a similar proposal.|$|E
