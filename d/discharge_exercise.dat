This is the first report to describe severe cardiac involvement, in which a 19 -year-old woman developed atrial fibrillation, diffuse T wave inversion and QT c interval prolongation with elevated specific biochemical markers of myocardial damage. After 7 days of treatment, including supportive care, gas tric lavage, activated charcoal, mannitol and hemodialysis, the patient recovered completely.

40|$|AIMS: Risk {{stratification}} after uncomplicated acute {{myocardial infarction}} is mostly applied by either symptom-limited post <b>discharge</b> <b>exercise</b> electrocardiography or pre-discharge submaximal exercise test. Aim {{of the present study}} was to determine if early pharmacological stress echocardiography and discharge within 24 hours of the test in cases without induced myocardial ischemia leads to lower costs and similar clinical outcome during 1 year follow up when compared to clinical evaluation and exercise electrocardiography after discharge. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four-hundred fifty-eight patients from 10 participating centers with a recent uncomplicated myocardial infarction were randomized to pharmacological stress echocardiography on day 3 - 5 followed by early discharge in the case of negative test result (early discharge strategy) (n= 233) or clinical evaluation with hospital discharge on day 7 - 9 and symptom-limited post-discharge exercise electrocardiography at 2 - 4 weeks after myocardial infarction (usual care strategy) (n= 225). At 1 year follow up there were 63 events (4 deaths, 9 non fatal reinfarctions, 50 chest pains requiring hospitalization) in patients randomized to early discharge, and 69 events (6 deaths, 13 reinfarctions, 50 chest pains requiring hospitalization) in usual care (p=ns). Total median individual costs calculated on the basis of hospitalizations, investigations and interventions during 1 year follow up were 3561 for early discharge strategy vs 3850 for usual care strategy (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Early pharmacological stress echocardiography followed by early discharge in case of negative test result gives similar clinical outcome and lower costs after uncomplicated myocardial infarction than clinical evaluation and delayed post-discharge symptom-limited exercise electrocardiography...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{describe}} {{the course of}} patients’ level of physical activity after <b>discharge</b> from physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> therapy and to identify predictors of physical activity decline after <b>discharge</b> from physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> therapy in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, focussing on potential individual, psychological and illness-related predictors. Methods: Data for this observational study were obtained from a randomized clinical trial comparing {{the effectiveness of a}} behavioural graded activity program and usual exercise therapy treatment according to the Dutch guidelines in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Assessments took place at baseline, 13, and 65 weeks follow-up. The relationship between physical activity decline after <b>discharge</b> from physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> therapy and potential individual, psychological and illness-related predictors was assessed using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: At 65 weeks follow-up, the amount of physical activity declined in 44 % of patients with more than 60 minutes compared to the amount of physical activity measured at <b>discharge</b> from physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> therapy. The decrease of physical activity was substantial but not significant. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that male gender, a higher number of coexisting disorders and a shorter duration of complaints are predictors of physical activity decline after <b>discharge</b> from physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> therapy. Conclusion: A large part of patients decline in amount of physical activity after <b>discharge</b> from physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> therapy. Male gender, a higher number of coexisting disorders and a shorter duration of complaints were in some extent identified as predictors of the course of physical activity decline. If needed, clinicians can adjust management strategies to prevent patients from physical activity decline after physiotherapy exercise therapy, thereby improving the long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy exercise therapy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis evaluates and {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of post <b>discharge</b> physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for osteoarthritis in three ways. 1. A systematic review evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} post <b>discharge</b> physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> on function, walking, range of motion, {{quality of life and}} muscle strength, for patients following elective primary TKA. Functional physiotherapy <b>exercise</b> interventions following <b>discharge</b> resulted in short term, but not long term, benefit. Effect sizes were small to moderate for function (0. 33). Weighted mean differences were small to moderate for motion (2. 9) and small for quality of life (1. 66). 2. A randomised clinical trial compared the effectiveness of a post discharge physiotherapy intervention in improving patient function versus usual physiotherapy for patients undergoing primary TKA. No significant statistical differences were observed between the two groups for all outcomes. This early trial was underpowered and impacted upon by some important factors which could potentially have masked any treatment trends occurring in the home visit group. 3. Since blinding procedures are often assumed to indicate trial quality, the feasibility of achieving blind outcome assessment in a pragmatic physiotherapy rehabilitation trial involving older people was explored. Reasons for unblinding were explored and successful blinding rates of 81 - 91 % were achieved. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the efficiency of}} a screening protocol based on coronary calcium scores (CCS) compared with exercise testing in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), a normal ECG and troponin levels. Three-hundred-and-four patients were enrolled in a screening protocol including CCS by electron beam computed tomography (Agatston score), and exercise testing. Decision-making was based on CCS. When CCS >= 400, coronary angiography (CAG) was recommended. When CCS < 10, patients were <b>discharged.</b> <b>Exercise</b> tests were graded as positive, negative or nondiagnostic. The combined endpoint was defined as coronary event or obstructive CAD at CAG. During 12 +/- 4 months, CCS < 400, 10 - 399 and < 10 were found in 42, 103 and 159 patients and the combined endpoint occurred in 24 (57 %), 14 (14 %) and 0 patients (0 %), respectively. In 22 patients (7 %), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was performed instead of exercise testing due to the inability to perform an exercise test. A positive, nondiagnostic and negative exercise test result was found in 37, 76 and 191 patients, and the combined endpoint occurred in 11 (30 %), 15 (20 %) and 12 patients (6 %), respectively. Receiver-operator characteristics analysis showed that the area under the curve of 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 85 - 0. 93) for CCS was superior to 0. 69 (95 % CI: 0. 61 - 0. 78) for exercise testing (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|This study {{describes}} the integrated sympathetic/metabolic control of capillary pressure (Pc) and filtration in cat skeletal muscle as studied during graded exercise and superimposed graded (2, 6 and 16 Hz) vasoconstrictor nerve excitation. The applied technique permitted simultaneous {{analysis of the}} underlying changes of resistance in the whole vascular bed (RT) and in its large-bore arterial resistance vessels (greater than 25 microns), small arterioles (less than 25 microns) and veins. Graded exercise per se caused graded increases in capillary pressure, which at heavy work exceeded the resting control value by 12. 2 mmHg, in turn leading to marked loss of plasma fluid by filtration. Sympathetic nerve stimulation was much more efficient in lowering capillary pressure during exercise than at rest, in spite of an exercise-induced marked attenuation of the vasoconstrictor response (RT). The sympathetically evoked capillary pressure fall per unit resistance increase was larger the greater the degree of exercise vasodilation, implying a highly nonlinear relation between capillary pressure and RT and also between the more direct determinant of capillary pressure the post- to precapillary resistance ratio, and RT. Strenuous exercise in vivo {{is known to be}} associated with a markedly increased reflex sympathetic <b>discharge</b> to <b>exercising</b> muscle which has been a puzzling feature in view of its untoward restriction of the exercise hyperaemia response. To the extent the present results are representative for this in vivo situation, they suggest that sympathetic <b>discharge</b> to <b>exercising</b> muscle, in spite of some flow restricting effect, might serve a highly beneficial function, causing effective protection against excessive work-induced rise of capillary pressure and harmful plasma fluid loss into the extravascular space of working muscle...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} safety of home {{exercise}} soon after open-heart surgery, 19 pts. (mean age 55. 7) underwent home exercise 14 to 9 % weeks postsurgery. Individualized exercise prescription heart rates and intensities were determined from a prehospital <b>discharge</b> submaximal <b>exercise</b> evaluation. Pts. performed exercise sessions daily for 8 weeks. During the first 2 week interval, pts. used heart rate monitors to transmit electrocardiograms via telephone on 5 separate days. To reevaluate the exercise prescription at 2 and 4 weeks, pts. subjectively reproduced the heart rate {{and the intensity of}} the previous exercise prescription followed by a submaximal exercise evaluation. At 8 weeks pts. performed a symptom-limited maximal exercise evaluation. For the first 2 week interval, the results indicated 1) there was no significant change in the incidence of arrhythmias in patients at rest and during home exercise, 2) the results of the predischarge exercise evaluation were consistent with the findings of the transtelephone electrocardiography heart rate and rhythm checks, 3) the heart rate responses were within the limits of the exercise prescription given to the patients, and 4) the pts., when given an exercise prescription in conjunction with the teaching of self-monitoring techniques and appropriate intensity adjustments, were able to appropriately monitor their own home exercise prescription.

40|$|Background. This study {{evaluated}} {{changes in}} motor unit (MU) firing rates in young and older adults during exercise training. Methods. Vastus lateralis MU discharge rates were measured in 8 young and 7 older adults. Each participant performed isometric knee extension contractions at 10 %, 50 %, and 100 % of maximal voluntary contraction or effort (MVC) on two separate occasions. Participants then completed a 6 -week resistance exercise training protocol. Results. Significant increases in maximal force were observed {{as early as}} 1 week after the first baseline testing session, and these were accompanied by increases in the MU <b>discharge</b> rate. <b>Exercise</b> training increased maximal voluntary force by 29 % and 36 % in the young and older adults, respectively. Motor unit discharge rates at 100 % of maximal effort were significantly greater in the young (24. 7 pps) than in the older adults (17. 8 pps). Furthermore, the young adults also exhibited significantly greater discharge rates at 50 % MVC, {{but there were no}} differences at the 10 % force level. Maximal MU discharge rates increased during the 1 -week period separating the two initial testing sessions.

METHODS In this prospective trial, 64 patients (57 men, 7 women, mean age = 66 ᠹ years) performed twice daily, moderate-intensity exercise sessions, of 10 -min duration, from postoperative day 3 until discharge from hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to stationary cycling or walking exercise intervention groups. Preoperative and <b>discharge</b> functional <b>exercise</b> capacity and health-related quality of life were assessed using 6 -min walk and cycle assessments and the SF- 36 version 2. 0 questionnaire. Compliance with exercise was calculated as the proportion of scheduled exercise sessions completed. RESULTS There were no significant differences between intervention groups at hospital discharge for 6 -min walk distance (cyclists: 402 ᠹ 3 m vs walkers: 417 ᠸ 6 m, P = 0. 803), 6 -min cycle work (cyclists: 15. 0 ᠶ. 4 kJ vs walkers: 14. 0 ᠶ. 3 kJ, P = 0. 798) or health-related quality of life. There was no significant difference between intervention groups for postoperative length of hospital stay (P = 0. 335). Compliance rates for intervention groups were cyclists: 185 / 246 (75 %) scheduled exercise sessions completed vs walkers: 199 / 242 (82 %) scheduled exercise sessions completed (P = 0. 162).

The {{aim of this}} follow-up study {{is to examine the}} long term effect of comprehensive discharge planning and nursing in-home follow-up for older adults (over 65 year old) incorporating physiotherapy exercise strategies on health characteristics. No published studies were located that had examined the impact of a comprehensive discharge program on the functional status and psychosocial among older frail adults at 12 months post-discharge. Design and methodology: Rehabilitation in Older People (RIO program) is a randomised controlled trial which evaluates the intervention of a comprehensive <b>discharge</b> program, <b>exercise</b> program incorporating nursing follow up. Participants of the RIO study were randomly allocated into usual care control group and an intervention group. The intervention group received a comprehensive training from an advanced practice gerontic nurse (APGN) and exercise strategies by physiotherapists. The APGN visited the participants in their home 48 hours post discharge, followed by telephone follow-up at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. This study followed-up this cohort at 12 month via telephone interviews to evaluate their functional ability, quality of life, psychosocial characteristics and the levels of self-efficacy. The General Self-efficacy Scale (GSE) was used to measure their self-efficacy.

40|$|Background: Cardiac {{rehabilitation}} (CR) is {{a process}} that involves a multidisciplinary team of health professionals in order to optimize the status of patients 2 ̆ 7 physical, psychological, social, and vocational well being. The CR program has been proven to influence health outcomes in patients with cardiac diseases, particularly myocardial infarction (MI) and stable angina. However, patients 2 ̆ 7 compliance with cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to review and identify interventions that enhance cardiac rehabilitation behaviors in MI patients. Method: A literature review was conducted by analyzing related research reports published since 2000 to 2012. Only English language articles were included. Result: There were 10 experimental studies and 2 meta-analysis studies. Interventions widely used to enhance cardiac rehabilitation behaviors in MI patients were self-efficacy and self management derived programs. These programs involved interventions that enhance cardiac rehabilitation behaviors, including training exercise, behavioral change, education and psychological support, and lifestyle changing strategies. None have reported the use of culturally tailored intervention. Four phases of cardiac rehabilitation were accepted as each phase represents a different aspect of care: inpatient care, early post <b>discharge</b> period, <b>exercise</b> training, and long term follow up. Critical factors for patients in maintaining an optimum health condition after a cardiac event are, in order, status of patient 2 ̆ 7 s physical, psychological, social, and vocational well being.

For predicting current soil exposure, scenarios were examined which ranged from dispersion occurring across the entire UK landmass, to only within the urban area, to only 20 m either side of road networks. For soils, the highest predicted contamination level was 0. 016 mg/kg within 20 m of a road following seven years of continuous deposition. This value would represent 0. 027 % of reported natural background cerium. If usage was to double for a further 5 years, levels would not be expected to exceed 0. 04 mg/kg. River water contamination considered direct aerial deposition and indirect contamination via runoff in the water and entrained soil sediment, with the highest level of 0. 02 ng/L being predicted. The highest predicted water concentration of 300 ng/L was associated with water draining from a road surface, assuming a restricted deposition spread. These predictions are well below most toxicological levels of concern...|$|R
60|$|London, it was true, did not lie in his earldom, {{but in that}} of {{his brother}} Leofwyn, but Leofwyn and Harold were as one--true {{brothers}} in heart and in disposition. The gentleness and courtesy of manner that, although natural, had been softened and increased by Harold's contact with foreigners, was not only pardoned but admired because he was England's champion against foreigners. He had fought, and victoriously, alike against the Norwegians, the Danes of Northumbria, and the Welsh, and he struggled as sturdily, though peacefully, against Norman influence in England. Already the dread of Norman preponderance was present {{in the minds of}} Englishmen. It was no secret that in his early days Edward had held out hopes, if he had not given an actual promise, to William of Normandy that he should succeed him. Of late the king had been somewhat weaned from his Norman predilections, and had placed himself unreservedly in Harold's hands, giving to the latter all real power while he confined himself to the <b>discharge</b> of religious <b>exercises,</b> and to the supervision of the building of his abbey, varied occasionally by hunting expeditions, for he still retained a passionate love of the chase; but men knew that the warlike Duke of Normandy would not be likely to forget the promise, and that trouble might come to England from over the sea.|$|R
40|$|Background: Guidelines {{for optimal}} {{exercise}} doses {{in people with}} multiple sclerosis (MS) have to be established. We need to ascertain the basic physiological and perceptual response and adaptation to different exercise doses in this clinical population. Aim: The aim {{of this paper was}} to explore the response during maximal and sub-maximal exercise in people with MS prior to and following two different twelve week exercise programmes. Design: Sub-analysis of per protocol exercise data of a two group, single blinded, randomised control trial. Setting: Multicentre (community leisure and rehabilitation centres). Population: Participants with MS assigned to a continuous (N. = 12; mean±SE age= 52. 3 ± 2. 08; Barthel index median & range= 19 & 13 - 20) or interval (N. = 9; mean±SE age= 49. 3 ± 3. 5; Barthel index median & range= 19 & 18 - 20) exercise programme. Methods: Cardiovascular, respiratory and perceptual exercise response and adaption was measured at maximal and sub-maximal levels of physical exercise prior to and following a twelve week exercise programme, delivered at different intensities. Results: Irrespective of the type of exercise programme followed, there was a significant increase in peak power (z=- 1. 98; P= 0. 05) and normalised oxygen uptake during unloaded cycling (z =- 2. 00; P= 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} home-based walking training to maintain {{the benefits of a}} short-term exercise training in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After initial recovery from an exacerbation, 46 patients were randomized into a training and a control group, and 30 patients completed the programme (mean±SD FEV 1, 36 ± 7 % predicted). The training group performed a 10 -day walking training programme in the hospital, followed by a 6 -month programme of supervised walking training at home, integrated into daily activities. The control group did not have exercise training in the hospital or at home. Until 6 months after <b>discharge,</b> lung function, <b>exercise</b> performance and symptom scores were assessed. Six-minute walking distance in the training group improved from day 1 to day 10 (P< 0 · 001) and this effect was maintained over 6 months (P< 0 · 001). On average, daily walking distance at home was 2308 m and walking was reported on 157 days. Quality of life (QoL) scores changed significantly over 6 months (P< 0 · 001). The control group showed no significant changes in exercise performance or QoL scores throughout the whole study period. Therefore, (i) significant improvements in exercise performance and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) scores could be achieved after recovery from an exacerbation and (ii) these improvements were maintained after discharge, when supported by a home-based walking training...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} is an intensive therapy {{used to improve}} survivorship and cure various oncologic diseases. However, this therapy is associated with high mortality rates and numerous negative side-effects. The recovery {{of the immune system}} is a special concern and {{plays a key role in}} the success of this treatment. In healthy populations it is known that exercise plays an important role in immune system regulation, but little is known about the role of exercise in the hematological and immunological recovery of children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The primary objective of this randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is to study the effect of an exercise program (in- and outpatient) on immune cell recovery in patients undergoing an autologous stem cell transplantation. The secondary objective is to determine if an exercise intervention diminishes the usual deterioration in quality of life, physical fitness, and the acquisition of a sedentary lifestyle. Methods This RCT has received approval from The Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (CHREB) of the University of Calgary (Ethics ID # E- 24476). Twenty-four participants treated for a malignancy with autologous stem cell transplant (5 to 18 [*]years) in the Alberta Children’s Hospital will be randomly assigned to an exercise or control group. The exercise group will participate in a two-phase exercise intervention (in- and outpatient) from hospitalization until 10 [*]weeks after <b>discharge.</b> The <b>exercise</b> program includes strength, flexibility and aerobic exercise. During the inpatient phase this program will be performed 5 times/week and will be supervised. The outpatient phase will combine a supervised session with two home-based exercise sessions with the use of the Wii device. The control group will follow the standard protocol without any specific exercise program. A range of outcomes, including quantitative and functional recovery of immune system, cytokine levels in serum, natural killer (NK) cells and their subset recovery and function, and gene expression of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, body composition, nutrition, quality of life, fatigue, health-related fitness assessment and physical activity levels will be examined, providing the most comprehensive assessment to date. Discussion We expect to find improvements in immunological recovery and quality of life, and decreased acquisition of sedentary behavior and fitness deconditioning. The comprehensive outcomes generated in this RCT will provide preliminary data to conduct a multisite study that will generate stronger outcomes.

60|$|This way of PROSCRIBING THE CITIZENS BY DENOMINATIONS AND GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS, dignified by {{the name}} of reason of state, and {{security}} for constitutions and commonwealths, is nothing better at bottom, than the miserable invention of an ungenerous ambition, which would fain hold the sacred trust of power, without any of the virtues or any of the energies that give a title to it: a receipt of policy, made up of a detestable compound of malice, cowardice, and sloth. They would govern men against their will; but in that government they would be <b>discharged</b> from the <b>exercise</b> of vigilance, providence, and fortitude; and therefore, that they may sleep on their watch, they consent to take some one division of the society into partnership of the tyranny over the rest. But let government, in what form it may be, comprehend the whole in its justice, and restrain the suspicious by its vigilance; let it keep watch and ward; let it discover by its sagacity, and punish by its firmness, all delinquency against its power, whenever delinquency exists in the overt acts; and then it will be as safe as ever God and nature intended it should be. Crimes are the acts of individuals, and not of denominations; and therefore arbitrarily to class men under general descriptions, in order to proscribe and punish them in the lump for a presumed delinquency, of which perhaps but a part, perhaps none at all, are guilty, is indeed a compendious method, and saves a world of trouble about proof; but such a method, instead of being law, is an act of unnatural rebellion against the legal dominion of reason and justice; and this vice, in any constitution that entertains it, at one time or other will certainly bring on its ruin.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incorporation}} of right-sided chest leads (V(3) R-V(5) R) into the standard exercise testing {{has been reported}} to improve its diagnostic accuracy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the ability of exercise testing in detecting right ventricular (RV) dysfunction post myocardial infarction (MI) of the inferior wall, using additional V(3) R-V(5) R leads. METHODS: We studied 133 patients (59 ± 5 years, 81 males) with a history of inferior MI due to right coronary artery obstruction (affirmed with coronary angiography). All patients underwent an echocardiographic assessment of RV function 4 weeks after <b>discharge</b> and an <b>exercise</b> treadmill test in order to detect possible RV dysfunction. Recordings during exercise were obtained with the standard 12 leads plus V(3) R-V(5) R. RESULTS: From 133 patients, 97 (group A) presented with normal right ventricle according to the echocardiographic study while the rest 36 patients (group B) presented with RV dysfunction. Maximal exercise-induced ST-segment deviation (in mm) was similar in the standard 12 leads for the 2 groups (2. 1 ± 0. 4 vs 1. 8 ± 0. 3, p = NS) while in V(3) R-V(5) R it was greater in group B (0. 7 ± 0. 3 vs 1. 4 ± 0. 4, p< 0. 05). Sensitivity, positive prognostic value, negative prognostic value and accuracy of exercise testing in detecting RV dysfunction were all improved using V(3) R-V(5) R (78 vs 47 %, 39 vs 29 %, 87 vs 75 %, 62 vs 55 % respectively, p< 0. 05 for all) while specificity was not deteriorated (56 vs 58 %, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of right-sided chest leads (V(3) R-V(5) R) improves the diagnostic ability of standard exercise testing in detecting and especially in excluding RV dysfunction post inferior MI...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Pre-operative {{physical}} therapy {{has been shown}} to reduce post-acute care service utilization. Shifting rehabilitation to the presurgical period, referred to as prehabilitation, could result in reduced recovery time and cost. Limited access to {{physical therapy}} may prevent patients from achieving the benefits, and a standard set of independent exercises may be an alternative. We aim to assess the feasibility of an independent exercise program as a pre-surgical intervention for total hip and knee replacement. Design: Participants were taught two exercises for hip or knee arthritis at least one week prior to surgery and instructed to perform them independently at home. Subjects were contacted three days to one month post-operatively and surveyed about <b>discharge,</b> frequency of <b>exercise,</b> and living status of alone or with others. No adverse effects were reported. Additional information was collected from the subjects’chart including age, BMI, and sex. Discharge outcomes were compared with pre-existing independent factors using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 80 subjects were followed with a home discharge rate of 78. 75 %. Univariate analyses showed that the presence of other people in the home showed a slight, but non-significant, association with differences of discharge destination. 82. 1 %- 83. 3 % of patients who live with others were discharged home versus 57. 1 % of patients living alone (LR chi-square: 3. 84, p= 0. 15). Multivariate analyses showed a slight, but non-significant, association between frequency of prehabilitation and discharge destination (OR= 1. 212; 95 % CI, 0. 960 - 1. 530). BMI showed no associated difference in discharge destination. Conclusions: Increased frequency of prehabilitation and presence of others at home showed slight associations with increased discharges to home, but were non-significant. Increased exposure to prehabilitation (duration times frequency) trends toward more frequent home discharge. Independently performed prehabilitation may be offered as an alternative pre-surgical intervention with likely little to no adverse effect. Larger numbers are needed to determine likelihood of discharge home...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} and prognostic significance of silent myocardial ischemia were prospectively assessed in 217 patients (mean age 57 ± 9 years, 83 % male) {{recovering from a}} first uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction and undergoing a dipyridamole echocardiography test before hospital <b>discharge.</b> Clinical, angiographic, <b>exercise</b> electrocardiographic (ECG) and dipyridamole echocardiographic variables were also examined. Of the 217 patients, 89 had no echocardiographically proved dyssynergy after dipyridamole, whereas 128 had dipyridamole-induced wall motion abnormalities that were silent in 94 (Group I) and symptomatic in 34 (Group II). There was no intergroup difference with respect to dipyridamole time (i. e., the time from onset of the test to frank dyssynergy: 7 ± 3 vs. 8 ± 3 min; p = NS); prevalence of inferior myocardial infarction (69 % vs. 71 %; p = NS); ischemic ECG changes during the test (83 % vs. 71 %; p = NS); diabetes (8. 5 % vs. 6 %; p = NS); ongoing medical therapy; multivessel disease (57 % vs. 56 %; p = NS); and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (57 ± 13 % vs. 57 ± 10 %; p = NS). There was also {{no significant difference between}} Group I and Group II with respect to watt motion score index at peak dipyridamole effect (1. 77 ± 0. 39 vs. 1. 78 ± 0. 36; p = NS). Patients were followed up for 24 ± 4 and 25 ± 5 months, respectively (p = NS). Life table analysis revealed no difference in unstable angina, reinfarction and death between the two groups. A Cox survival analysis identified a positive echocardiogram after dipyridamole administration as the best predictor of cardiac events (chi-square = 9. 1; p < 0. 003), whereas dipyridamole-induced chest pain showed no independent predictive value (chisquare = 2. 7; p = NS). Thus, patients with silent ischemia and symptomatic ischemia had comparable 1) severity of dipyridamole-induced ischemia (as assessed by dipyridamole time and extent of wall motion abnormalities), 2) extent of angiographic coronary artery disease, and 3) incidence of critical cardiac events...|$|R
