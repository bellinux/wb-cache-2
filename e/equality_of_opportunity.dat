5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E

The importance of the {{organizational culture}} like key factor for the efficiency of the organization, like comparative advantage and also like process of change is demonstrated. The organization can through performances and policies generate behaviors that support the existence of values within the organization. The <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> between women and men constitutes a value that must join the organizations, understanding the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> kind as the absence of obstacles or barriers that make difficult to the women the participation in the economic area, cultural and social politician in <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> conditions that the masculine group. The <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> sort <b>opportunities</b> reports to the organizations a series of advantages and benefits that have their base in the satisfaction of the personnel, the labor climate, the commitment with the organization, the enrichment and the corporative image. The perception of an unjust treatment or discriminatory has organizational and personal, such consequences as the decrease of the productivity, the increase of the labor absenteeism and the increase of complaints and legal actions. The nonexistence of information and investigations on the perception <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> kind and his possible relation with the organizational culture, has motivated the exposition of this thesis. The general aim of the thesis consists of determining if relation exists between the organizational culture and the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> kind. To obtain this general aim it has considered to identify the areas or dimensions more relevant that they affect the perception <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> kind. To identify if there exists a typology of organizational culture that favors or impedes the perception <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> kind and to analyze the relation between the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> kind and the type of organizational culture. To reach the proposed aims has followed a concrete methodology characterized by 3 phases of investigation: the first one where it is designed and validated a Scale of measurement of the perception <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>of</b> kind (EIOG), the second phase, there raises a model of structural equations who relates the different typologies of organizational culture and the perception of discrimination of kind and the third phase that relates the different typologies of organizational culture and the scale of perception (EIOG). For the elaboration of scale EIOG two representative samples have been used, one of 274 people belonging to the university sector and other of 354 people belonging to organizations of the industrial sector and with more than 50 workers / hard-working that have allowed the validation of the scale by means of an analysis of validity of content, convergent and discriminante, as well as an analysis of reliability of the scale. The phase 2 and 3 develop across models of structural equations, statistical powerful tool for the study of causal relations. The investigation concludes that relation exists between both variables object of this thesis, relation exists between the organizational culture and the perception <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> between women and men. The contribution of this investigation to the business management is that the persons with responsibilities that occupy the management dome, can have more prudent behaviors, identifying more dominant organizational or influential cultures in the perception and behaviors of his employees and employees. The high direction must be conscious of this advantage implementing policies that promote the equity. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the consequences of higher educational expansion on two goals of the educational system, that of promoting equity <b>of</b> educational <b>opportunities</b> and that <b>of</b> providing credentials that facilitate the matching between labour supply and demand. The first goal is typically studied by research on inequality <b>of</b> educational <b>opportunities,</b> the second by research on returns to education and credential inflation. The key idea of the paper is that educational expansion can have different and possible opposite effects on the two goals. [...] a. If with educational expansion <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> educational <b>opportunities</b> increases, while the occupational values of the titles decreases, one has a trade-off scenario, ie an increase in <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> educational <b>opportunities</b> is matched by {{a decline in the}} value of higher education in the labour market. [...] b. If <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> does not increase, despite expansion of higher education, and the returns of higher education degrees decline, one has then a worst-off scenario. [...] c. Finally, if with educational expansion <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> increases and there is no credential inflation, one has a best-off scenario In this paper we systematically investigate these alternative scenarios. We perform the same empirical analysis on two distinct data sets in order to test the robustness of our findings.

A higher probability of upward income mobility theoretically would help mitigate higher income inequality, as each generation has a better chance of achieving higher income groups.

25|$|Wilson envisioned The Open University {{as a major}} marker in the Labour Party's {{commitment}} to modernising British society.

The planned utilisation of television and radio to broadcast its courses was also supposed to link The Open University to the technological revolution underway, which Wilson saw as a major ally of his modernization schemes. However, from the start Lee encountered widespread scepticism and even opposition from within and without the Labour Party, including senior officials in the DES; her departmental head Anthony Crosland; the Treasury; Ministerial colleagues, such as Richard Crossman; and commercial broadcasters. The Open University was realized due to Lee's unflagging determination and tenacity in 1965–67, the steadfast support from Wilson, {{and the fact that}} the anticipated costs, as reported to Lee and Wilson by Arnold Goodman, seemed very modest. By the time the actual, much higher costs became apparent, it was too late to scrap the fledgling open university.|$|E
