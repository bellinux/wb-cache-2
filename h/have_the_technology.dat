Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as they do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, Purdue Pharma's abuse-resistant OxyNEO and six generic {{versions}} of OxyContin {{had been on}} the Canada-wide approved list for prescriptions since 2012.

25|$|After World War I, {{in which}} Brazil was {{an ally of}} the United States, Great Britain, and France, the country {{realized}} it needed a more capable army but didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil.

2500|$|Display units (CRT, LCD, LED monitors), {{processors}} (CPU, GPU, or APU chips), memory (DRAM or SRAM), {{and audio}} components have different useful lives. [...] Processors {{are most frequently}} out-dated (by software no longer being optimized) {{and are more likely}} to become [...] "e-waste" [...] while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts, due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology. This problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or Phonebloks. These types of phones are more durable and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly. Being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce e-waste.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was more}} than Renault engines, however, which allowed Williams and later Benetton to {{dominate}} Formula One from [...] to [...] Refuelling at pit stops was reintroduced turning each race {{into a series of}} sprints – as a result the race strategy became as important as the driver's ability. In the early 1990s, teams started introducing electronic driver aids, whose use spread rapidly. Active suspension, (pioneered by Lotus in 1987), semi-automatic gearboxes (Ferrari in 1989), and traction control (Williams in 1991) became essential to compete. Some of these technologies were borrowed from contemporary road cars. Others were primarily developed for the track and later {{made their way to the}} showroom. All enabled cars to reach higher and higher speeds, provided the teams were willing to spend the money. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids in 1994. However, many observers felt that the ban on driver aids was a ban in name only as the FIA did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> or the methods to eliminate these features from competition. Even this controversy did not diminish the pleasure British fans of the sport felt in 1992, when Nigel Mansell finally won the title, after a decade of trying, nor French fans in [...] when Alain Prost took his 4th Championship, both drivers piloting Williams cars.|$|E
