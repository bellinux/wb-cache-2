50|$|This is {{actually}} an air <b>distribution</b> <b>device</b> and is not intended as a conduit for conditioned air. The term fabric duct is therefore somehow misleading; fabric air dispersion system would be the more definitive name.

Usually made of polyester material, fabric ducts can provide a more even distribution and blending of the conditioned air in a given space than a conventional duct system. They may also be manufactured with vents or orifices.|$|E

50|$|In {{times of}} fewer {{available}} resources, {{a common occurrence}} among Spanish youth, (lack of one liter 'mini') drastic measures are taken by young Spaniards {{in order to save}} money. One common cheap way of mixing Kalimotxo involves a plastic bag and the Tetra Brik cartons of cheap red wine (Don Simón is a common brand). An entire two liter bottle of Coca-Cola and two liters of wine are emptied into a plastic shopping bag. Once the concoction is mixed in the bag, the bag is squeezed tightly around the rim of the two litre Coca-Cola bottle and the contents of the bag are poured into the bottle. The now-empty Tetra Brik wine cartons are fully opened and peeled back as to mimic the function of the 'mini'. The Coca-Cola bottle is then used as a <b>distribution</b> <b>device</b> to fill the makeshift 'mini'.|$|E

Firing it would cause a chain reaction that would destroy Earth. They shut off the weapon before it has enough energy to fire. Along the way, Psycho discovers Claire {{was one of the}} scientists who reluctantly skinned him, causing friction in his previously romantic relationship with her. Unfortunately, Karl, who had secretly used Ceph technology to extend his lifespan, is possessed by the Ceph and critically wounds Claire while psychically crippling Prophet. Regaining control after Psycho shot him, he sacrificing himself to distract the Alpha Ceph. Prophet, Psycho, and Claire board the VTOL and engage in a massive air battle with Ceph ships, eventually crashing. Claire dies in the process. Psycho, saddened by her death, laments to Prophet that he is powerless because he no longer possesses a Nanosuit. Upon being told his lack of a Nanosuit saved him from Karl's control earlier, Psycho, now going by his real name, Michael, finds another VTOL to take Prophet to the Ceph.|$|E

Without regular boundaries and homogeneous intensities, images of water film acquired from these tests are hard to be detected by conventional approaches. We propose an improved segmentation method to identify the water film areas from the complex background. Considering the gray distortion resulted from asymmetric illumination, the method combines the modified motion segmentation and optimal threshold method. Detection results show that this method is hardly affected by the illumination change, and also insensitive to noise...|$|R
