40|$|The {{relationship}} between the bulk density and the compactibility of lactose granulations was studied. The granulations were prepared from different alpha-lactose monohydrate and roller dried beta-lactose powders by wet granulation, using different techniques with only water as a binder, or by slugging. The results demonstrate that {{by the process of}} granulation of one lactose powder, granules with different bulk densities and different compactibilities can be prepared. In addition to the type of lactose used, the compactibility of the granule fractions is dependent on the bulk density of the granule fraction. Generally, with an increase of the bulk density, the compactibility of a granule fraction decreases. Little variation is observed between the <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosities</b> of the granule fractions. More differences are found between the intragranular porosities of the granule fractions. However, the compactibility of granule fractions of one lactose type is mainly determined by the total porosity of the granule powder bed. Mercury porosimetry determinations on tablets compacted from the granule fractions show a {{relationship between}} the tablet pore system and the compact strength: compression of granulations with a low bulk density results into tablets with a small average pore diameter and a high crushing strength. Obviously, the possibility to deform a granule fraction during compression, the deformation potential, is determined by the total porosity of the powder bed. A high deformation potential, i. e., a high compactibility, can be obtained by using a granulation procedure in which granulations with a low bulk density are produced...|$|R

The use of evacuated glass capsules to perform HIP treatment allowed samples that showed open porosity after vacuum sintering to be sintered to transparency. The sintering response of the investigated powder was studied by careful microstructural observations using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy both in reflection and transmission. The key to this method is to keep porosity intergranular during pre-sintering, {{so that it can}} be removed subsequently by HIP treatment.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} authigenic grain-coating chlorite has a good positive correlation with primary <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity,</b> a conclusion shared with the studies by Sun et al. (2012, 2014) and Xiang et al. (2016). Many researchers thought grain-coating chlorite was beneficial to reservoir porosity preservation, especially for primary intergranular pores. However, some researchers believed good-quality reservoirs develop as a result of good primary <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity,</b> and the existence of grain-coating chlorite is only indicative of primary <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity</b> (Xiang et al. 2016). Based on the correlation of chlorite content with surface porosity and sample porosity in this study, it was concluded that the development of chlorite did not play a positive role in the reservoir porosity preservation and it may have influenced dissolution, to a certain extent. This may be attributed to two reasons: (1) As primary <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity</b> increased with chlorite content, acidic fluids flowed into the reservoir, and the increased pore space diluted the acidic fluids, reducing the effects of dissolution; (2) it is rare to find authigenic chlorite grains in areas which have not undergone dissolution; therefore, the increased chlorite content may cause a reduction in solution porosity. Further study is needed to discover the effects of authigenic grain-coating chlorite on reservoir porosity preservation. However, the effects of chlorite development on sandstone reservoir properties are not disputed.|$|E

The fractures are two-dimensional planar features that occur as bedding planes, joints, or faults. Conduits develop along fractures or other places, where the aquifer is susceptible to solution, and it is believed that these conduits were developed through the shale content or the veins of shale by dissolution and we believe that those conduits are occurred at the aquifer under study because of occurring of shale content. The conduits have the greatest permeability and the least volume of the porosity elements. Where there is faulting, fracture density and the opportunity for conduits to develop through solution processes increase. Both limestone and limy shale are extensively fractured.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Proper {{analysis}} of the original <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity</b> loss of sedimentary strata is an important tool to gain insight into the influence of diagenetic processes {{on the quality of}} hydrocarbon reserviors. With emergence and progress of numerical technologies for simulating diagenetic processes in sedimenraty formations, the changes in the original porosity of reserviors attributed to more diagenetic processes (e. g. dissolution processes and the stabilization from one mineral to another one) can also be quantitatively evaluated. This paper proposed a set of formulas for the numerical computation of the loss in the original <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity</b> of sandstone reserviors by compactional processes (COPL) and by intergranular cemention processes (CEPL), which consider the gain in the <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity</b> by dissolution processes (DIPL). Theoretical analysis based on the measured data of sandstone samples shows that the real COPL will be obviously underestimated if the COPL computed by the traditional point-count method is far below CEPL and dissolution processes generated the additional porosity. Comparably, the real CEPL will only be slightly over-estimated.

40|$|The Shattuck Sandstone Member of the Guadalupian age Queen Formation was {{deposited}} in back-reef environments on a carbonate platform of the Northwest Shelf (Permian Basin, New Mexico, USA) during a lowstand of sea level. At Mesa Queen Field, the Shattuck Sandstone is a sheet-like sand body that averages 30 ft (9. 1 m) in thickness. The Shattuck Sandstone includes deposits of four major siliciclastic environments: (1) fluvial sandflats, (2) eolian sand sheets, (3) inland sabkhas, and (4) marine-reworked eolian sands. Fluvial sandflat deposits are further subdivided into sheetflood, wadi plain, and river-mouth deposits. Dolomites, evaporites, and siliciclastics that formed in adjacent coastal sabkha and lagoonal environments bound the Shattuck Sandstone {{from above and}} below. The Shattuck Sandstone is moderately- to well-sorted, very fine-grained subarkose, with a mean grain size of 98 ?m (3. 55 ?). Eolian sand sheet, wadi plain, and marine-reworked eolian facies comprise the productive reservoir intervals. Reservoir quality reflects intragranular and <b>intergranular</b> secondary <b>porosity</b> formed by partial dissolution of labile feldspar grains, and pore-filling anhydrite and dolomite cements.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the sedimentology, morphology and diagenesis of recently discovered Middle Silurian low-relief micro-epikarst from the Klintehamn area on western Gotland (Sweden). The epikarst represents the most distal portion of an unconformity that truncates stratigraphic units across {{a major part}} of the Baltic palaeo-basin. It formed in the intertidal area during the late stage of platform development and following a short period of regression and siliciclastic influx to the basin at the closing of the Cyrtograptus lundgreni Chron, An overlying oncolite shows signs of repeated exposure to meteoric and marine waters, supporting the interpretation of a karstic flat setting. Four microfacies with different stable isotopic signatures are recognised across the unconformity: dolomitic siltstone and altered siltstone in the topmost Frojel Formation, below the contact, and ferruginous crinoid algal packstone and ferruginous oncolite grainstone above the contact, in the basal lag of the transgressive Halla Formation. Endolithic structures of inferred fungal/algal origin occur frequently in the two transgressive microfacies. The set of observations pointing towards subaerial exposure and karstic processes include: (a) an understanding of the regional geology; (b) erosional relief with undercutting and an associated conglomerate; (c) vertical and subvertical conduits (karren), indicating gravitationally controlled waters; (d) widening of fissures and subsequent polyphase fillings (splitkarren); (e) eluviated, internal sediment (e. g,, crystal silt); (f) blackening; (g) repeated etching of carbonate allochems; (h) a fitted grain-fabric; (i) circum-granular cracking; (j) pendant nonluminescent cements; (k) abundant intercrystalline and <b>intergranular</b> (secondary) <b>porosity,</b> and (1) anomalous stable isotopes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cathodoluminescence {{petrography}} and scanning {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) reveal that grain size and temperature significantly influenced intergranular pressure solution, quartz cementation, and porosity evolution in the quartzose Hartshorne Sandstone (Middle Pennsylvanian) of the Arkoma basin. Among samples from each locality, a negative, linear relationship exists between mean grain size and volume of quartz dissolved by intergranular pressure solution. In contrast, agenerally positive relationship exists between mean grain size and volume of quartz cement, although considerable variability exists in this relationship. A positive relationship also exists between mean grain size and <b>porosity.</b> <b>Intergranular</b> pressure solution directly reduced minus-cement porosity by causing tighter packing of detrital grains; it thereby controlled volumes of both cement and primary porosity. For this reason, little primary porosity is preserved in pressolved, finer-grained sandstones even though they contain small absolute volumes of quartz cement. Appreciably more primary porosity may be retained by unpressolved, coarser-grained sandstones ven though they contain larger absolute volumes of quartz cement. These relationships also vary with thermal maturity, which increases eastward across the basin.

40|$|Dolerites sampled {{from the}} lower sheeted dikes from Hole 504 B during Ocean Drilling Program Legs 137 and 140, between 1562. 4 and 2000. 4 mbsf, were {{examined}} to document the mineralogy, petrography, and mineral parageneses associated with secondary alteration, to constrain the thermal history and composition of hydrothermal fluids. The main methods used were mineral chemical analyses by electron microprobe, X-ray diffraction, and cathodoluminescence microscopy. Temperatures of alteration were estimated {{on the basis of}} single and/or coexisting mineral chemistry. Permeability is important in controlling the type and extent of alteration in the studied dike section. At the meter-scale, intervals of weakly altered dolerites containing fresh olivine are interpreted as having experienced restricted exposure to hydrothermal fluids. At the centimeter- or millimeter-scale, alteration patches and extensively altered halos adjacent to veins reflect the permeability related to <b>intergranular</b> primary <b>porosity</b> and cracks. Most of the sheeted dike alteration in this case resulted from non-focused, pervasive fluid-rock interaction. This study confirms and extends the previous model for hydrothermal alteration at Hole 504 B: hydrothermal alteration at the ridge axis followed by seawater recharge and off-axis alteration. The major new discoveries, all related to higher temperatures of alteration, are: (1) the presence of hydrothermal plagioclase (An 80 - 95), (2) the presence of deuteric and/or hydrothermal diopside, and (3) the general increasing proportion of amphiboles, and particularly magnesio-hornblende with depth. We propose that the dolerites at Hole 504 B were altered in five stages. Stage 1 occurred at high temperatures (less than 500 ° to 700 °C) and involved late-magmatic formation of Na- and Ti-rich diopside, the hydrothermal formation of Na, Ti-poor diopside and the hydrothermal formation of an assemblage of An-rich plagioclase + hornblende. Stage 2 occurred at lower temperatures (250 °- 320 °C) and is characterized by the appearance of actinolite, chlorite, chlorite-smectite, and/or talc (in low permeability zones) and albite. During Stage 3, quartz and epidote precipitated from evolved hydrothermal fluids at temperatures between 310 ° and 320 °C. Anhydrite appeared during Stage 4 and likely precipitated directly from heated seawater. Stage 5 occurred off-axis at low temperatures (250 °C) with laumontite and prehnite from evolved fluids...|$|R

40|$|The Kumano {{fore-arc}} basin overlies the Nankai accretionary prism, {{formed by}} the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Eurasian plate offshore the Kii Peninsula, SW Honshu, Japan. Seismic surveys and boreholes {{within the framework of}} the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) project show evidence of gas hydrates and free gas within the basin. Here we use high-quality borehole sonic data from Integrated Oceanic Drilling Program (IODP) Site C 0009 to quantify the free gas distribution in the landward part of the basin. The Brie theory is used to quantify gas content from sonic logs, which are calibrated from laboratory measurements on drill cores. First, we show that the sonic data are mainly sensitive to the fluid phase filling the <b>intergranular</b> pores (effective <b>porosity),</b> rather than to the total porosity that includes water bound to clay minerals. We then compare the effective porosity to lithodensity-derived porosity that acts as a proxy for total porosity. The combination of these two data sets also allows assessment of clay mineralogy of the sediments. Second, we compute free gas saturation and find a gas-rich interval that is restricted to a lithological unit characterized by a high abundance of wood fragments and lignite. This unit, at the base of the fore-arc basin, is a hydrocarbon source that should be taken into account in models explaining gas distribution and the formation of the bottom-simulating reflector within the Kumano fore-arc basin...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a sequence stratigraphic framework for the Upper Cretaceous (Albian to Santonian) sedimentary rocks of South Jordan. This was accomplished by detailed sedimentological studies and facies analysis. Furthermore the provenance and weathering history of the siliciclastic rocks was determined by using sedimentary petrography and bulk rock geochemistry. The study area is situated in the southern part of Jordan, about 60 km south of the city Ma'an, between the city Ras en Naqb in the West to Naqb Ataik in the East. Here a succession of Palaeozoic to Cretaceous sedimentary rocks is exposed along a NW-SE to E trending, about 90 km long escarpment. Along this escarpment fifteen vertical sections were logged in detail and samples where taken in the Cretaceous deposits. On the basis of these logs the facies analysis and sequence stratigraphic interpretation was carried out. Selected samples were used for petrographical and geochemical studies. Facies analysis showed that the Upper Cretaceous sediments were deposited in a terrestrial to marine setting. The examined sedimentary succession comprises ten environmental depositional facies, which can be grouped into four major facies associations. These four facies associations are (i) the shelf facies association, (ii) the shoreface facies association, (iii) the marginal marine facies association and (iv) the coastal plain facies association. The repeated interfingering of terrestrial and marine environments shows, that the examined sediments were deposited in a shallow marine siliciclastic to mixed siliciclastic-carbonate coastal system. The facies correlation of the logged sections reveals that the sedimentary succession can laterally be sub-divided into three major depositional systems: (i) a siliciclastic ramp, (ii) a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic ramp and (iii) an alluvial system. Vertically these depositional systems are arranged in repeating cyclothems. An ideal cyclothem consists of a retrograding siliciclastic ramp system, a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp system, a prograding siliciclastic ramp system and is ended by an alluvial plain system. The shelf system was generally wave/storm dominated, whilst the prograding siliciclastic ramp system was supply dominated. The retrograding siliciclastic ramp, as well as the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp system was accommodation-dominated. The coastal system can be divided into a regressive and a transgressive system. Under regressive sea-level conditions sand dominated braid deltas formed. Transgressive sea-level conditions resulted in a coastal system controlled by wave dominated estuaries and barrier/lagoon complexes. On the coastal plain anastomosing to meandering sand dominated river systems with wide overbank areas developed during transgressive times. During regressive sea-level conditions the nearshore river system changed to a more braided one that was directly linked to the braid deltas forming during these intervals. The sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the correlated sections shows that the studied sedimentary succession includes eight third-order sequences. The basal four sequences comprise the Cenomanian to Coniacian Ajlun Group, while the top four sequences are situated within the Coniacian to Santonian Belqa Group. Moreover sequences 1, 2 and 4 can each be further subdivided into two sequences of higher order. Basically all sequences include forced regressive deposits formed during the relative sea-level fall. Characteristic features of forced regressions, like for example sharp based shoreface deposits, are frequently present within the logged sections. Due to the significance of the regressive part of the relative sea-level for the studied sediment succession the sequence stratigraphic model introduced by Plint and Nummedal (2000) was used. This sequence stratigraphic model combines the complete sea-level fall in a new falling stage systems tract (FSST), which opposes LST, TST and HST. Comparison of the sequence stratigraphic interpretation with the major depositional systems shows that the depositional systems correspond very well with the four systems tracts of the applied sequence stratigraphic model. The alluvial plain system developed during the LST, the retrograding siliciclastic ramp system during the TST. The mixed carbonate-siliciclastic ramp system corresponds to the HST and the prograding siliciclastic ramp system is associated with the FSST. Relative sea-level changes and sediment supply were the main controlling parameters for the sequence architecture of the examined deposits. Since subsidence was low and no synsedimentary tectonic influenced the examined sediments, the relative sea-level changes are basically eustacy driven. Therefore the reconstructed sea-level curve resembles strongly global curves. The siliciclastic sediment supply is related to sea-level changes and associated with back stepping fluvial incision during the FSST and LST. Light mineral analysis shows that the Cretaceous sands and sandstones of South Jordan are basically mineralogical mature and can be classified as quartz arenites. Only the fine to medium grained sands and sandstones of the study area exhibit a slightly higher content of feldspar, classifying them as subarkoses. Heavy mineral analysis reveals a dominance of the ultrastable heavy minerals zircon, tourmaline and rutile. Especially zircon is predominant in the examined samples. With a mean ZTR-index of 97. 9, the heavy mineral content reflects the mineralogical maturity of the sediments shown by the light mineral analysis. The studied sands and sandstones experienced a rather restricted spectrum of diagenetic processes. The compaction of the sediments was low to moderate, which is for example reflected by high IGV values. This and the lack of destructive grain contacts and pressure solution indicate that the sediments did not encounter deep burial or thick overburden. Concerning the cementation of the examined sediments, the sandstones display three major cementing phases. Sandstones cemented by clay minerals are only weakly lithified and display the highest <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosities</b> of all samples. Sandstones cemented by carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) or iron-oxides are well lithified and usually display only low values of <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosities.</b> The cementation with carbonate minerals is facies dependant and only occurs in marine sediments. Both, petrographic and geochemical provenance analysis point to the deposition of the Cretaceous sandstones of South Jordan within a passive continental margin setting. As source rock for the studied samples a continental block and/or a craton interior is most likely. Furthermore, a clear trend towards a recycled sedimentary source is obvious in the petrographical as well as in the geochemical studies. Especially the presence of resedimented quartz grains and the enrichment of zircon in the sediments support this. The presented study shows that the Arabo-Nubian-Shield and its Palaeozoic sedimentary cover are the source area for the Cretaceous siliciclastic sediments of South Jordan. The examined sediments follow normal weathering trends in the weathering diagrams. The corresponding CIA values point to a moderate weathering for most samples. Only the sandstone and some claystone samples have high CIA values typical of recycled sediments. Das Ziel der vorgelegten Arbeit ist es einen sequenzstratigraphischen Rahmen für die oberkretazischen (Albium bis Santonium) Sedimentgesteine Südjordaniens zu schaffen. Des Weiteren wurde die Provenienz, Diagenese und Verwitterungsgeschichte der siliziklastischen Ablagerungen mit Hilfe von Sedimentpetrographie und Geochemie am Gesamtgestein bestimmt. Das Arbeitsgebiet liegt im Wüstengebiet im Süden Jordaniens, etwa 60 km südlich der Stadt Ma’an. Entlang einer 90 bis 100 km langen, NW-SE streichenden Steilstufe (‚Escarpment’) ist dort eine Abfolge von paläozoischen bis kretazischen Sedimentgesteinen aufgeschlossen. Als Grundlage für die Faziesanalyse und die sequenzstratigraphische Interpretation wurden 15 detaillierte stratigraphische Profile innerhalb der Kreidegesteine aufgenommen. Für petrographische und geochemische Untersuchungen wurden Sandsteinhorizonte und vereinzelt auch feinkörnigere Gesteine beprobt. Die kreidezeitlichen Sedimentgesteine im Arbeitsgebiet wurden in einem terrestrischen bis marinen Bereich abgelagert. Insgesamt wurden zehn Ablagerungsbereiche für die untersuchte Schichtfolge definiert, die sich in vier Hauptfaziesassoziationen zusammenfassen lassen: (i) der Schelfbereich, (ii) die Küste, (iii) der randmarine Ablagerungsraum und (iv) die Küstenebene. Das wiederholte Auftreten von lateralen Verzahnungen der terrestrischen und marinen Ablagerungsbereiche innerhalb der Abfolge weißt darauf hin, dass die untersuchten Sedimentgesteine in einem flachmarinen Küstensystem zur Ablagerung kamen. Durch Fazieskorrelation lässt sich dieses siliziklastisch bis gemischt karbonatisch-siliziklastisch geprägte Küstensystem in drei zeitlich getrennte Hauptablagerungssysteme unterteilen: (i) eine siliziklastische Rampe, (ii) eine gemischt siliziklastisch-karbonatische Rampe und (iii) ein Alluvialebenen System. Vertikal sind diese Ablagerungssysteme in sich wiederholenden Zyklothemen angeordnet, die im Idealfall aus einem retrogradierenden siliziklastischen Rampensystem, einem gemischt siliziklastisch-karbonatischen Rampensystem, einem progradierenden siliziklastischen Rampensystem und, am Ende, einem Alluvialebenen System zusammengesetzt sind. Die Ausbildung des Küstensystems wurde durch einen sich verändernden Meeresspiegel gesteuert. Bei regressivem Meeresspiegel bildeten sich sanddominierte Braid-Deltas aus. Transgressive Meeresspiegelbedingungen führten zu einem Küstensystem, das von wellendominierten Ästuaren und Barriere/Lagunen Komplexen geprägt war.

40|$|Carbonaceous (black) Devonian gas shales {{underlie}} approximately {{two-thirds of}} Kentucky. In these shales, natural gas {{occurs in the}} <b>intergranular</b> and fracture <b>porosity</b> and is adsorbed on clay and kerogen surfaces. This is analogous to methane storage in coal beds, where CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed, displacing methane. Black shales may similarly desorb methane {{in the presence of}} CO 2. Drill cuttings from the Kentucky Geological Survey Well Sample and Core Library were sampled to determine both CO 2 and CH 4 adsorption isotherms. Sidewall core samples were acquired to investigate CO 2 displacement of methane. An elemental capture spectroscopy log was acquired to investigate possible correlations between adsorption capacity and mineralogy. Average random vitrinite reflectance data range from 0. 78 to 1. 59 (upper oil to wet gas and condensate hydrocarbon maturity range). Total organic content determined from acid-washed samples ranges from 0. 69 to 14 percent. CO 2 adsorption capacities at 400 psi range from a low of 14 scf/ton in less organic-rich zones to more than 136 scf/ton in the more organic-rich zones. There is a direct linear correlation between measured total organic carbon content and the adsorptive capacity of the shale; CO 2 adsorption capacity increases with increasing organic carbon content. Initial volumetric estimates based on these data indicate a CO 2 sequestration capacity of as much as 28 billion tons total in the deeper and thicker parts of the Devonian shales in Kentucky. In the Big Sandy Gas Field area of eastern Kentucky, calculations using the net thickness of shale with 4 percent or greater total organic carbon, indicate that 6. 8 billion tonnes of CO 2 could be sequestered in the five county area. Discounting the uncertainties in reservoir volume and injection efficiency, these results indicate that the black shales of Kentucky are a potentially large geologic sink for CO 2. Moreover, the extensive occurrence of gas shales in Paleozoic and Mesozoic basins across North America make them an attractive regional target for economic CO 2 storage and enhanced natural gas production...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the effect that the moisture content has on the physical properties of sunflower seeds. The cultivar Olisun 3, with an initial moisture content of 34. 1 (% wb), was used and then subjected to drying in an oven with forced air ventilation under three temperature conditions: 40, 60 and 80 °C. The reduction in the moisture content during drying was monitored by the gravimetric method until it reached a final moisture content of 8. 0 ± 1. 0 (% wb). The physical properties were analysed: the bulk density, true density, <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity</b> and volumetric shrinkage of the mass and unit and terminal velocity. The reduction in the moisture content influenced the physical properties of sunflower seeds and caused a decrease in the <b>intergranular</b> <b>porosity,</b> bulk density and true density at all examined temperatures. The mass and volumetric contractions of the unit and reduction in shrinkage rates all increased with the drying of sunflower seeds at all studied temperatures. The terminal velocity increased as the moisture content of the grains increased, which was more evident at the drying temperature of 80 °C...|$|E

40|$|The {{provenance}} and reservoir {{properties of}} Upper Cretaceous Lange-Lysing sandstone in the Norwegian Sea have been determined by using integrated whole-rock geochemical, petrographic and detrital zircon U-Pb age dating by LA- ICP-MS. Three different provenance signatures are revealed within three geographical areas containing the Lange-Lysing succession. They {{have contributed to}} significant response on diagenesis, which gives implication for reservoir properties, whereby the petrographic data expose several controls on porosity development, including textural and mineralogical factors. (1) Quartzofeldspathic petrofacies in the Møre Margin are interpreted to have the highest potential as hydrocarbon reservoir due to better sorting and larger grain size, combined with preservation of <b>intergranular</b> and intragranular <b>porosity,</b> not occluded by cement. The zircon grains were derived from felsic sources in the Western Gneiss Region of Baltica, due to a prominent age peak that closely corresponds with the Sveoconorwegian (1000 - 950 Ma) and the Gothian orogenies (1700 - 1500 Ma). (2) Sandstone of the quartzolithic petrofacies from the Halten-Dønna Terrace has smaller grain size and is less sorted than the quartzofeldspathic petrofacies, yielding a lower reservoir quality. The detritus is suggested to have been sourced from more mixed ?andesitic-felsic rocks. The zircon grains derived from the Paleozoic Caledonian Nappe Domain of western Baltica and from the Lofoten Islands or Western Tromsø Basement Complex in northern Norway because of a dominance of Early Proterozoic crust-forming zircon grains (1800 - 1750 Ma) and an Archean component. (3) The main diagenetic features of the quartzarenitic petrofacies in the deeper Vøring Basin includes mechanical and chemical compaction, precipitation and replacement of quartz overgrowth, kaolinite, clay minerals, iron oxide and formation of secondary porosity due to dissolution of labile minerals. Grain coating of authigenic clay minerals exerts a critical control on the reservoir quality as it inhibits quartz cement. The deposits are inferred to have mixed sand distribution from the eastern Greenland and the Norwegian margins based on wide zircon-age spectra with predominance of Early Proterozoic (1900 - 2100 Ma) and Archean contribution (> 2600 Ma). Contradictory to previous studies, the U-Pb analysis of the Lange-Lysing sandstone has proved that Late Archean zircon is present within deposits derived from the Norwegian landmass. Furthermore, the study stresses {{a strong correlation between}} provenance, diagenetic products and reservoir qualit...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of pore fluids migrating through the forearc basins, continental massif, and accretionary prism of the Peru margin is {{recorded in the}} sequence of carbonate cements filling <b>intergranular</b> and fracture <b>porosities.</b> Petrographic, mineralogic, and isotopic analyses were obtained from cemented clastic sediments and tectonic breccias recovered during Leg 112 drilling. Microbial decomposition of the organic-rich upwelling facies occurs during early marine diagenesis, initially by sulfate-reduction mechanisms in the shallow subsurface, succeeded by carbonate reduction at depth. Microcrystalline, authigenic cements formed in the sulfate-reduction zone are 13 C-depleted (to - 20. 1 per mil PDB), and those formed in the carbonate-reduction zone are 13 C-enriched (to + 19. 0 per mil PDB). Calcium-rich dolomites and near-stoichiometric dolomites having uniformly heavy d 18 O values (+ 2. 7 to + 6. 6 per mil PDB) are typical organic decomposition products. Quaternary marine dolomites from continental-shelf environments exhibit the strongest sulfate-reduction signatures, suggesting that Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations created a more oxygenated water column, caused periodic winnowing of the sediment floor, and expanded the subsurface penetration of marine sulfate. We have tentatively identified four exotic cement types precipitated from advected fluids and derived from the following diagenetic environments: (1) meteoric recharge, (2) basalt alteration, (3) seafloor venting and (4) hypersaline concentration. Coarsely crystalline, low-magnesium (Lo-Mg) calcite cements having pendant and blocky-spar morphologies, extremely negative d 18 O values (to - 7. 5 per mil PDB), and intermediate d 13 C values (- 0. 4 per mil to + 4. 6 per mil PDB) are found in shallow-marine Eocene strata. These cements are evidently products of meteoric diagenesis following subaerial emergence during late Eocene orogenic movements, although the strata have since subsided to greater than 4, 000 m below sea level. Lo-Mg calcite cements filling scaly fabrics in the late Miocene accretionary prism sediments are apparently derived from fluids having lowered magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) and 18 O/ 16 O ratios; such fluids may have reacted with the subducting oceanic crust and ascended through the forearc along shallow-dipping thrust faults. Micritic, high-magnesium (Hi-Mg) calcite cements having extremely depleted d 13 C values (to - 37. 3 %c PDB), and a benthic fauna of giant clams (Calyptogena sp.) supported by a symbiotic, chemoautotrophic metabolism, provide evidence for venting of methane-charged waters at the seafloor. Enriched d 18 O values (to + 6. 6 %c PDB) in micritic dolomites from the continental shelf may be derived from hypersaline fluids that were concentrated in restricted lagoons behind an outer-shelf basement ridge, reactivated during late Miocene orogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{increasing}} demand the recent {{development of the}} world energy led to a shift of interest towards the assessment and, partially, exploitation of unconventional petroleum resources, especially in the U. S. Strong advances in well completion technologies such as artificial reservoir stimulation (hydraulic fracturing) and multi-lateral wells enabled the utilization of these previously inoperable assets. Following these initial successes in exploration and production of shale gas in particular, unconventional reservoirs became a prominent target for scientific and commercial investigations worldwide. Exploration and evaluation of shale gas systems, and unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs in general, are being performed in Europe to potentially increase the domestic hydrocarbon production. In Germany, the main focus lies on organic-rich shale formations that {{are known to have}} sourced conventional oil- and gas fields. In this context, the main source rocks investigated are the Mississippian Upper Alum Shale, the Toarcian Posidonia Shale and the Berriasian Wealden shales. Production history and -experience of shale gas in the U. S. showed that a multitude of factors influence the suitability and production performance of low permeable rocks. These factors include (organic) geochemical, mineralogical, petrophysical and reservoir characteristic properties. The organic geochemical component defines {{the quality and quantity of}} hydrocarbons generated from these rocks and has a strong influence on the adsorption of gas molecules on particulate organic matter (kerogen). Typical organic geochemical parameters include the kerogen type, total organic carbon (TOC) content and the hydrogen index (HI), which define the quality of a source rock. Petrophysical properties represent critical parameters for the potential storage capacity in <b>intergranular</b> spaces (<b>porosity)</b> of rocks as well as production related factors (permeability). Information on the mineralogical composition allows an estimate of susceptibility to artificial stimulation techniques, while reservoir scaled characteristics provide information on both hydrocarbon generation and storage variability (burial/uplift history, compaction, thermal maturity, facies variation etc.). A multitude of different analytical procedures was performed to gain information on many of these aspects for the Wealden shales and the Posidonia Shale. The main focus was set hereby on the organic geochemical and –petrological inventory of the Wealden shales and the influence of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion/retention on the petrophysical parameters of organic-rich shales using the example of the Posidonia Shale. Based on these findings, a high resolution 3 D numerical basin model was established to estimate the amount of adsorbed and free gas in these formations throughout the central Lower Saxony Basin, representing a much more detailed approach than those of previously published studies. The sample suite investigated from three wells from the central area of the Lower Saxony Basin represent a thermal maturity series of the Berriasian Wealden shales ranging from immature/early mature samples from one well to overmature shales in two additional wells. Data from vitrinite reflectance measurements are hereby supported by several biomarker ratios. The analyzed samples revealed four intervals which can be described as excellent source rocks of lacustrine origin, comprising type I kerogen, based on organic geochemical and –petrographical analyses. Effects of oil generation and migration is evident from petrographical analyses of the overmature sample sets. Alginite present in the early mature samples, including botryococcus algae of brackish to lacustrine origin, is replaced by an extensive solid bitumen network in the overmature counterparts. Strong small scale heterogeneities of depositional environment are expressed in the variability of source related biomarker inventories throughout the Wealden succession. Pore space evolution in dependence of thermal maturation was studied using a novel flow-through extraction procedure on core samples of the Posidonia Shale from the Hils Syncline, Germany. The subsequent removal of soluble organic matter resulted in a significant increase of porosity and permeability in all investigated samples. Open fractures were generated by this procedure which are predominantly oriented parallel to the bedding of the rocks as determined via organic petrography. Residues of hydrocarbons precipitated from the solvent indicate a flow direction of DCM along these fractures. Analyses of the gained extracts revealed substantially different hydrocarbon compositions at different time steps during the extraction runs. Results from a high resolution 3 D numerical basin model of the central Lower Saxony Basin show that adsorbed depends mainly on the source rock quality and burial history of the investigated Posidonia Shale and Wealden shale horizons. The amount of free gas in the pore system is strongly influenced by the sealing capacity of overlying strata...|$|R
