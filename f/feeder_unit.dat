40|$|Abstract Powder feeding is a {{fundamental}} unit operation in the pharmaceutical industry. For the cases in which firstprinciple process models are unknown, such as when new powder mixture feeding operations are being evaluated, or no longer accurately describe current operating behavior, surrogate model-based approaches can be employed in order to quantify input–output behavior.

Based on a comparison of predicted with experimental values, an iteratively constructed kriging model is found to more accurately capture the feeder system behavior compared with the response surface methodology.

40|$|The smart {{distribution}} system {{is one of}} the most important aspects of the smart grid and will result in systematic update on the distribution side. In smart distribution grid pilot cities of China, much investment on the infrastructure for the smart {{distribution system}} has been done. For example, in Xiamen, the IEC 61968 / 61970 based data base has been established and the smart terminal units, such as transformer terminal units, distribution terminal <b>units,</b> <b>feeder</b> terminal <b>units</b> and load control units have been installed. This paper proposes an automatic voltage control (AVC) architecture based on these infrastructures, all of which have been employed in Xiamen. The objective of this architecture is to minimize the distribution losses by coordinating the on load-tap changer (OLTC) and the capacitor banks. In this paper, the data base, the data communication mechanism and the related terminal units for this architecture are introduced firstly. Then, an optimal power flow (OPF) model for determining the tap position of the OLTC and switching capacitor banks is also formulated. The proposed architecture is verified in a 33 -buse system. Scenarios are created to verify the impact of DG on the performance of this architecture. The results show that using the proposed architecture, distribution losses can be reduced by selecting reasonable tap position, operated capacitor banks and DG techniques. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Automated feeding systems are growing in popularity for dairy farms in America, but {{little is known}} about how these systems are managed. This study investigated the usage of automated feeders, and the implications of management practices for calf morbidity and mortality. Barn design, environmental and management factors were determined on 38 farms in the upper Midwest USA through a combination of questionnaire and on-farm measurements. These measurements were used to describe the current management practices of farms, identify risk factors for adverse calf health outcomes and calf mortality, and to determine best practices for the use of automated feeders. Among factors measured, those associated with early life procedures (colostrum management, navel disinfection), grouping strategies (age of calves at grouping, stocking density, group size, and age difference between the oldest and youngest animals in the group), feeding management (peak milk allowance, days to reach peak milk allowance), milk contamination (bacterial counts in the liquid diet exceeding recommended levels), and seasonal climatic variation were significantly associated with calf health outcomes. Overall, the outcomes observed in this study indicate that automated calf feeding systems can be effectively managed to provide high quality care for preweaned animals, while more consistency is needed in colostrum management and automated feeder cleaning and maintenance. More research is needed to investigate the causal relationships between factors identified in this work with calf health outcomes, particularly focused on encouraging good postnatal practices, calf grouping strategies, bacterial contamination of the <b>feeder</b> <b>unit</b> and of milk delivered to calves, and strategies for the mitigation of calf health issues resulting from seasonal environmental change...|$|E

The reclosing of CB and the control of reconnection of DG are also designed. The case analysis illustrates the feasibility of the proposed distributed protection and control scheme...|$|R

A significant increase in feeder stress under the extensive fuel channel shift loading condition is found when the feeder spacers are included in the model. However, the feeder stresses for Design, Level A&B loading under fuel channel shift configuration meet the ASME B&PV Code NB- 3600 stress limit requirements. The feeder spacer assessment results also show that the structural integrity of feeder spacers is not affected by the fuel channel shifting.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an intermodal terminal is especially {{measured in terms}} of time waste for both traffic <b>feeders</b> and loading <b>units</b> (known as intermodal transport units, ITUs) from the moment they arrive at the terminal up to the leaving instant. This makes significant the estimation of the maximum traffic (normally referred to as “capacity”) which allows the terminal to work without loss of efficiency and congestion. The amount of the factors from which capacity depends and their nature (the most of them are stochastic processes with a huge grade of indeterminacy—e. g. traffic peaks, economical fluctuations, delays and so on) make the issue challenging and seldom addressed from scientific literature.

40|$|The Archean {{basement}} in {{the northeastern}} part of the Kaapvaal craton is intruded by {{a large number of}} mafic dykes, defining three major dyke swarms, which collectively appear to fan out from the Bushveld Complex. Herein we present U-Pb baddeleyite ages for two of these dyke swarms, the northwest trending Badplaas Dyke Swarm and the east-west trending Rykoppies Dyke Swarm, and infer their correlation with tectonic events in the Kaapvaal craton. We also present a U-Pb baddeleyite age for a noritic phase of the Marginal Zone of the Rustenburg layered Suite (Bushveld Complex). The age of the Badplaas swarm is determined from two dolerites dated at 2965. 9 +/- 0. 7 Ma and 2967. 0 +/- 1. 1 Ma. These ages coincide with units of the Nsuze Group lavas (2967 - 2985 Ma), which constitute the world's oldest preserved rift basin, and suggest that dykes of this swarm are <b>feeders</b> to basaltic <b>units</b> of this group. Similarly, the E-W trending Rykoppies swarm has earlier been interpreted as a potential feeder system to the Bushveld Complex. However, the emplacement ages of six dolerites fall in the range 2. 66 - 2. 68 Ga, thus similar to 600 Myr earlier than the intrusion of the Bushveld Complex (herein dated at 2057. 7 +/- 1. 6 Ma). Rather, these ages coincide with the Allanridge Formation at the uppermost part of the Ventersdorp Supergroup as well as volcanic rocks of the "protobasinal" sequences preserved {{at the base of the}} overlying Transvaal Basin. The Rykoppies Dyke Swarm probably marks the initial stages of rifting of the Transvaal Basin and reflects a major shift from a NW-SE to an E-W trending tectonic setting. The origin of the Rykoppies Dyke Swarm can be linked either to prolonged mantle plume activity or to the onset of back-arc extension associated with south-directed subduction of oceanic lithosphere in a compressional setting along the northern margin of the Kaapvaal craton.
