The initial effort of the optional program was report-in NASA CR 189221, which consisted of high temperature strain controlled fatigue tests to {{study the effects of}} thermomechanical fatigue, multiaxial loading, reactive environments, and imposed stresses. The baseline alloy used in the tests included B 1900 +Hf (with or without coating) and wrought INCO 718. Tests conducted on B 1900 +Hf included environmental tests using various atmospheres (75 psig oxygen, purified argon, or block exposures) and specimen tests of wrought INCO 718 included tensile, creep, stress rupture, TMF, multiaxial, and mean stress tests. Results of these testings were used to calibrate a CDA model for INCO 718 alloy and to develop modifications or corrections to the CDA model to handle additional failure mechanisms. The Socie parameter was found to provide the best correlation for INCO multiaxial loading. Microstructural evaluations consisting of optical, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) techniques, and surface replication techniques to determine crack initiation lives provided data which were used to develop life prediction models...|$|E

40|$|Avoiding kernel {{vulnerabilities}} {{is critical}} to achieving security of many systems, because the kernel is often part of the trusted computing base. This paper evaluates the current state-of-the-art with respect to kernel protection techniques, by presenting two case studies of Linux kernel vulnerabilities. First, this paper presents data on 141 Linux kernel vulnerabilities discovered from January 2010 to March 2011, and second, this paper examines how well state-of-the-art techniques address these vulnerabilities. The main findings are that techniques often protect against certain exploits of a vulnerability but leave other exploits of the same vulnerability open, and that no effective techniques exist to handle semantic vulnerabilities [...] -violations of high-level security invariants.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze both the term {{structure}} of interest and mortality rates role for evaluating a fair value of a life insurance business. In particular, a fair value accounting impact on reserve evaluations is discussed comparing a traditional deterministic model based on local rules for an Italian balance sheet calculation and a stochastic one based on a diffusion process for both mortality and financial risks. As proposed by IAS Board we will separate the embedded derivatives from their <b>host</b> <b>contracts,</b> so the fair value of a traditional life insurance contract would be expressed as the value of four components: the basic contract, the participation option, the option to annuitise and the surrender option.

40|$|A foreign {{contractor}} can {{resort to}} a partnering or joint-venture strategy with a <b>host</b> <b>contracting</b> firm {{to bid for}} a major international construction project. This paper presents {{a case study in}} the Bahrain FORMULA- 1 Circuit (BFC) project focusing mainly on its tendering and construction stages, which is lacking in literatures. Findings illustrate that the success in such an international pact include: advanced technical and engineering expertise; selection of a committed partner; management expertise; creating and sustaining good working environment; appropriate risk management; maintaining a reliable interna­tional materials supply chain; and efficient project planning and tracking system. Manage­ment expertise is the most important factor because of the peculiarities and problems of international projects. This case study is able to assist practitioners to devise their own approach in overcoming the challenges and dynamic influences in the international construction market...|$|R

40|$|Warp is {{a system}} that helps users and administrators of web {{applications}} recover from intrusions such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and clickjacking attacks, while preserving legitimate user changes. Warp repairs from an intrusion by rolling back parts of the database to a version before the attack, and replaying subsequent legitimate actions. Warp allows administrators to retroactively patch security vulnerabilities [...] -i. e., apply new security patches to past executions [...] -to recover from intrusions without requiring the administrator to track down or even detect attacks. Warp's time-travel database allows fine-grained rollback of database rows, and enables repair to proceed concurrently with normal operation of a web application. Finally, Warp captures and replays user input at the level of a browser's DOM, to recover from attacks that involve a user's browser. For a web server running MediaWiki, Warp requires no application source code changes to recover from a range of common web application vulnerabilities with minimal user input at a cost of 24 [...] 27 % in throughput and 2 [...] 3. 2 GB/day in storage.

40|$|ABSTRACT Throughout {{the world}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} attention for international large-scale sports events, but there is still little knowledge of how they operate. The particular relationship as well as the organizational structure and coordination between organizers within large-scale events have not been studied to a large extent. Since large-scale events are truly international, the involved stakeholders operate across borders, which further adds a dimension to the relationship. Due to the often temporary aspect of international large-scale events and thus their diverse network of temporary partnerships, they are seen as highly complex. They are becoming more prevalent and {{there is a need for}} deeper exploration as they have attracted little attention in research and specifically misses out on cases on meaningful relations in terms of collaboration and coordination. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between international and national stakeholders towards the successful hosting and managing of a temporary international large-scale event. It intends, in greater depth, to understand the complex nature of international large-scale sports events in regards to challenges and meaningful collaboration and coordination. Interviews with 14 respondents and a participant observation of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Falun 2015 constitute the basis for this thesis. The main conclusion of this study implies that even though the relationship is structured in accordance to the <b>hosting</b> <b>contract,</b> trust appears to be a necessity and of critical importance as it facilitated the collaboration and coordination in the relationship. The stakeholders moreover highlighted the relationship as a partnership...|$|R

Further, host governments {{are more likely to}} respond to multinationals’ wishes when they are more dependent on foreign capital markets. We draw on the World Bank’s Lex Mundi dataset (Djankov et al. 2003) on micro-level contracting environment for private actors. Our analysis of a cross section of 98 developing countries suggests that FDI is associated with lower contract enforcement costs, particularly when the host country is more indebted...|$|R

Grimsby further stated that the major challenges were in connection with the <b>Host</b> City <b>Contract,</b> which she labelled unbalanced, and as putting too much a burden on the host city. The Norwegian Confederation of Sports also initiated an evaluation on its own. The results were presented 25 March 2015.
