5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites have been {{recorded}} from the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), a semiaquatic rodent found in the eastern and southern United States, north to New Jersey and Kansas and south to Florida and Texas, and in Tamaulipas, <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> Mexico. Some of these parasites are endoparasites, internal parasites, while others are ectoparasites, external parasites.|$|E
5|$|In Tamaulipas and {{southern}} Texas, the ranges {{of the marsh}} rice rat and the related Oryzomys couesi meet; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to O.couesi, the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone, probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.|$|E
5|$|Héctor Cotto Gonzalez participated for Puerto Rico in the men's 110meters hurdles race, {{the only}} Puerto Rican {{participating}} in the event. Cotto was born in Fajardo, a city on Puerto Rico's <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> coast, and participated in the Olympics {{for the first time}} in Beijing at age 23. Cotto participated in the August 17 quarterfinals in the third heat, ranking sixth out of the heat's eight athletes after achieving a time of 13.72seconds. He defeated Haiti's Dudley Dorival (13.78seconds), but fell behind the Cayman Islands' Ronald Forbes (13.59seconds) in a heat that was led by Colombia's Paulo Villar (13.37seconds) and Barbados' Ryan Brathwaite (13.38seconds). Of the 40 athletes who finished the event, Cotto ranked 28th. He progressed to the next round.|$|E

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{currently}} occurs {{in much of}} the eastern and southern United States, northeast to southern New Jersey, and south to southeastern Texas and <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> Tamaulipas, Mexico. The northernmost records in the interior United States are in eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, southern Missouri and Illinois, and the southern half of Kentucky, but the species is absent {{in much of the}} Appalachians. Fossils of the marsh rice rat are known from Rancholabrean (late Pleistocene, less than 300,000 years ago) deposits in Florida and Georgia and remains referred to the extinct subspecies O.p.fossilis are from the Wisconsinan and Sangamonian of Texas and Illinoian and Sangamonian of Kansas. In the Florida Keys, rice rats occur on most of the Lower Keys, but are absent from the Upper Keys, which are of a different geological origin and were probably never connected to the mainland. The western and eastern Cytb clades within the marsh rice rat may represent expansions from different glacial refugia which the species was restricted to during a glacial period.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{populations of}} Oryzomys couesi, those in southernmost Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico, are {{classified}} as the subspecies aquaticus, which {{was described as a}} separate species, Oryzomys aquaticus, in 1891. Here the range of O.couesi meets that of the marsh rice rat; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In the contact zone, couesi occurs further inland, while the marsh rice rat lives along the coast. In experimental conditions, the two fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to populations further to the south, aquaticus is larger and paler and has a more robust skull. Specimens from Tamaulipas are slightly darker than those from Texas. The Cytb sequences of specimens of aquaticus form a separate group, but cluster among specimens of O.c.couesi from further south.|$|E

25|$|Geographers {{traditionally}} {{divide the}} vast territory of Russia into five natural zones: the tundra zone; the taiga, or forest, zone; the steppe, or plains, zone; the arid zone; {{and the mountain}} zone. Most of Russia consists of two plains (the East European Plain and the West Siberian Plain), two lowlands (the North Siberian and the Kolyma, in <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> Siberia), two plateaus (the Central Siberian Plateau and the Lena Plateau to its east), {{and a series of}} mountainous areas mainly concentrated in the extreme northeast or extending intermittently along the southern border.|$|E

The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners.

25|$|Soviet rocket {{tests to}} Kamchatka {{during the late}} 1950s {{increased}} interest in Shemya Island, Alaska at the western Aleutians {{as a location for}} monitoring missile tests from the <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> Soviet Union. Old site facilities were rehabilitated and new ones constructed on the island, including a large detection radar (AN/FPS-17), which went into operation in 1960. Each of three antenna reflectors were similar to the initial FPS-17 at Diyarbakir but employed a different feed horn array and beam scanning method. In 1961, the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar was constructed nearby. Blue Fox refers to a modification of the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar to the AN/FPS-80(M) configuration in 1964. These radars were closed in the 1970s when the Cobra Dane phased array radar was built to monitor missile tests. Shemya was redesignated from an Air Force station to an Air Force base in 1968.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the event, large parts of the country had been {{battered}} by heavy rain and hailstorms. On June 18, the Varna office of the country's forecasting service (NIMH) sent an official memo to the local administration warning of intensive rain and hailstorms on the following day. According to the NIMH, the average 24-hour for Varna Province was between 60 and 85 l/m², while in neighboring Dobrich Province it was from 90 to 155 l/m². The average amount for the whole month of June is around 50-60 l/m². A single weather station in the north of Varna recorded values of 35 l/m² in a two-hour period between 6pm and 8pm on June 19. In the <b>far</b> <b>northeastern</b> parts of Bulgaria, rainfall rates reached 140–200mm/h. On June 20 the NIMH warned that further rains up to 20 l/m² could be expected throughout the weekend.|$|E
