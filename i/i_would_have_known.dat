6000|$|Even {{without the}} glossy green hide and the metal {{ornaments}} which denoted the tribes {{to which they}} belonged, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> them on the instant for what they were, for where else in all the universe is their like duplicated? ...|$|E
60|$|ALEEL. A curse upon {{it for a}} meddlesome house! Had it but {{stayed away}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> What Queen Maeve thinks on when the moon is pinched; And whether now--as in the old days--the dancers Set their brief love on men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{firmly believe}} so, my child; {{it is you}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>know</b> {{what it is that}} you love: I am {{satisfied}} for myself. I repeat, did Anna Miller ever excite such emotions?" ...|$|R

60|$|Which end of {{the street}} I entered I had no idea. The cabins were all alike, and in my hurry I would have passed the cook's shack {{had it not been for}} the sight of a man {{standing}} in the door. That stalwart figure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> anywhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! Living in {{one house}} as you do, {{at your age}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> {{all there was to}} know on such a matter, and yet kept my word. But there, the blood is different, and you are {{somewhat}} over-honest for a lover. Was she frightened for you, now, when that knave made at you with the sword?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Did I {{tell you}} in a former letter from here, to tell Anne, with her old master's love, that I had seen Putnam, my old secretary? Grey, and with several front teeth out, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him anywhere. He is coming to [...] "Copperfield" [...] to-night, {{accompanied}} by his wife and daughter, {{and is in the}} seventh heaven at having his tickets given him.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it in a minute, {{but that}} {{raindrop}} made me quite sure. I'll always remember now. Shu-ya means rain, or [...] "it {{is going to}} rain." [...] Why, Daddy!' She got up and danced round him. 'S'pose you went out before I was awake, and drawed shu-ya in the smoke on the wall, I'd know {{it was going to}} rain and I'd take my beaver-skin hood. Wouldn't Mummy be surprised?' ...|$|E
6000|$|When my train reached Copely {{the next}} afternoon, Aunt Philippa {{was waiting for}} me. There was nobody else in sight, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her had there been a thousand. Nobody but Aunt Philippa could have that {{determined}} mouth, those piercing grey eyes, and that pronounced, unmistakable Goodwin nose. And certainly nobody but Aunt Philippa would have come to meet me arrayed in a wrapper of chocolate print with huge yellow roses scattered over it, and a striped blue-and-white apron! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} {{strictly}} reared, {{but if it}} had not been so dark and solemn and awful there in that lonely, vast room, I do believe I should have said something then which could not be put into a Sunday-school book without injuring the sale of it. If my reasoning powers had not been already sapped dry by my harassments, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better than to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy German floors in the dark; it can't be done in the daytime without four failures to one success. I had one comfort, though--Harris was yet still and silent--he had not stirred.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thy daughter!" [...] said Front-de-Boeuf, as if surprised,--"By heavens, Isaac, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>known</b> of this. I deemed that yonder black-browed {{girl had}} been thy concubine, and I gave {{her to be a}} handmaiden to Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of the days of old, who set us in these matters a {{wholesome}} example." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing. Just {{nothing at}} all. Still, because I see ye are willing, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ye <b>know</b> that there are--two--men from Grand Canary on board yon steamer already." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her voice faltered, {{and there}} were tears on her lashes. Some quality in her {{narration}} brought before me so vividly the scenes of which she spoke that I started when she had finished. There was much more <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> but I could not press her to speak longer on a subject that gave her pain. At that moment she seemed more distant to me than ever before. She rose, went into the house, and left me thinking of the presumptions of the hopes I had dared to entertain, left me picturing sadly the existence of which she had spoken. Why had she told me of it? Perchance she had thought to do me a kindness! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Germans {{captured}} Lodz today," [...] said Miss Oliver, one December evening, when she, Mrs. Blythe, and Susan {{were busy}} sewing or knitting in the cosy living-room. [...] "This war {{is at least}} extending my knowledge of geography. Schoolma'am though I am, three months ago I didn't know {{there was such a}} place in the world such as Lodz. Had I heard it mentioned <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> nothing about it and cared as little. I know all about it now--its size, its standing, its military significance. Yesterday the news that the Germans have captured it in their second rush to Warsaw made my heart sink into my boots. I woke up in the night and worried over it. I don't wonder babies always cry when they wake up in the night. Everything presses on my soul then and no cloud has a silver lining." ...|$|E
60|$|As I was so {{sitting and}} thinking, {{a sound of}} men and horses came to me through the wood; and {{presently}} after, at a turning of the road, I saw four travellers come into view. The way was in this part so rough and narrow that they came single and led their horses by the reins. The first was a great, red-headed gentleman, of an imperious and flushed face, who carried his hat {{in his hand and}} fanned himself, for he was in a breathing heat. The second, by his decent black garb and white wig, I correctly took to be a lawyer. The third was a servant, and wore some part of his clothes in tartan, which showed that his master was of a Highland family, and either an outlaw or else in singular good odour with the Government, since the wearing of tartan was against the Act. If I had been better versed in these things, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the tartan to be of the Argyle (or Campbell) colours. This servant had a good-sized portmanteau strapped on his horse, and a net of lemons (to brew punch with) hanging at the saddle-bow; as was often enough the custom with luxurious travellers {{in that part of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know,</b> {{that the}} head of every man is Christ; {{and the head of the}} woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{addressing}} me, sir? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know</b> that am {{not accustomed}} to be spoken to, in that fashion; and that I bear an insult from no one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assist you!" [...] roared Crispin, {{with a fine}} {{assumption}} of anger. [...] "Assist you take a man? Sink me, sir, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am a soldier, not a tipstaff!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... {{and there}} are certain whole poems that I read {{from time to time}} or try to make others read. There is that poem where the manner is unworthy of the matter, being loose and facile, {{describing}} Adam and Eve fleeing from Paradise. Adam asks Eve what she carries so carefully and Eve replies that it is a little of the apple core kept for their children. There is that vision of 'Christ the Less,' a too hurriedly written ballad, where the half of Christ, sacrificed to the divine half 'that fled to seek felicity,' wanders wailing through Golgotha; and there is 'The Saint and the Youth' in which I can discover no fault at all. He loved complexities--'seven silences like candles round her face' is a line of his--and whether he wrote well or ill had always a manner, which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> from that of any other poet. He would say to me, 'I am a mathematician with the mathematics left out'--his father was a great mathematician--or 'A woman once said to me, [...] "Mr. Ellis why are your poems like sums?"' and certainly he loved symbols and abstractions. He said once, when I had asked him not to mention something or other, 'Surely you have discovered by this time that I know of no means whereby I can mention a fact in conversation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is marvellous," [...] he went on, {{dismissing the}} future {{in an effort to}} shake himself into a wholesomer frame of mind. [...] "It has been one long {{continuous}} miracle, the last few months, since you have been with me. We have seen very little of each other, you know, since your childhood, and when I think upon it soberly it is hard to realize that you are really mine, sprung from me, bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. As the tangle-haired wild young creature of Dyea,--a healthy, little, natural animal and nothing more,--it required no imagination to accept you as one of the breed of Welse. But as Frona, the woman, as you were to-night, as you are now as I look at you, as you have been since you came down the Yukon, it is hard [...] . I cannot realize [...] . I [...] ." [...] He faltered and threw up his hands helplessly. [...] "I almost wish that I had given you no education, that I had kept you with me, faring with me, adventuring with me, achieving with me, and failing with me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you, now, as we sit by the fire. As it is, I do not. To that which I did know there has been added, somehow (what shall I call it?), a subtlety; complexity,--favorite words of yours,--which is beyond me.|$|E
5000|$|In William Faulkner's 1936 novel Absalom, Absalom!, Rosa, in {{explaining}} to Quentin why {{she agreed to}} marry Sutpen, states, [...] "I don't plead propinquity: the fact that I, a woman young and at the age for marrying and {{in a time when}} most of the young men whom <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> ordinarily were dead on lost battlefields, that I lived for two years under the same roof with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{much larger}} share than mine," [...] said Alan, smiling. [...] "If Pat {{had not come}} for me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of your danger. What a {{magnificent}} fellow he is!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] says he, blurting out his words, [...] "I did say {{something}} {{of it to}} Captain Leach, who, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know,</b> is a gentleman, and a man of honor into the bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|First, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know</b> my well-laid plans; Listen: I {{have set}} horses {{at the gate}} Which leads to Parma: when you have done your {{business}} We will ride hence, and by to-morrow night - ...|$|R
5000|$|Bobick {{suffers from}} chronic {{traumatic}} encephalopathy. Originally diagnosed in 1997 after his arm injury, his progressive decline has been noteworthy in recent years. He {{was quoted in}} 2011 by the Morrison County Record saying [...] "I'm not sure I would have gone into boxing back then if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> all the effects of head trauma that I know today, but I don’t regret the experience, intense training and discipline I learned from the sport." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bin Laden {{stated that}} he had not been in contact with his father since leaving Afghanistan in 2000. [...] He said, [...] "The last time I saw my father was in 2000, 2001. I was in Saudi Arabia and felt a terrible sorrow for all the victims the September 11 attacks", [...] "My father has a kind heart", and [...] "I do not believe my father is dead, {{otherwise}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it; the world would have known it." [...] When asked whether he would tell the Americans if he found out where his father was living, he said with a smile, [...] "Actually, I would hide him. Because he is my father." ...|$|E
5000|$|With 2,987 hits, Rice has {{the most}} of any player not to reach 3,000. Rice later said, [...] "The {{truth of the matter is}} I did not even know how many hits I had. A couple of years after I quit, owner Clark Griffith told me about it, and asked me if I'd care to have a {{comeback}} with the Senators and pick up those 13 hits. But I was out of shape, and didn't want to go through all that would have been necessary to make the effort. Nowadays, with radio and television announcers spouting records every time a player comes to bat, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about my hits and probably would have stayed to make 3,000 of them." [...] In postseason play, Rice produced 19 hits and a [...]302 batting average.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>'ave</b> you <b>know</b> that I'm a gentleman, and what's more, I'm an Englishman. And I'm {{proud of}} it. You {{ought to be}} ashamed of yourself. I've never 'ad any one try and bribe me before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Messire," [...] said Sir Sagramore, [...] "I {{will tell}} you the whole story, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know</b> that it was through no disgrace but by mishap of battle that I am come to this pass." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his 2009 book, {{entitled}} Analytixz, Griff criticized his 1989 statement: [...] "to say the Jews {{are responsible}} for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>know</b> about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible... I'm not the best knower. Then, not only knowing that, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>know</b> who is at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct." [...] Griff also said that not only were his words taken out of context, but that the recording has never been released to the public for an unbiased listen.|$|R
