40|$|This paper uses Polycentric Planning, an {{off-shoot}} of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) {{framework to}} interrogate {{the appropriateness of}} construction technology in sand-digging and soil excavation in Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area, Ogun State. The paper found that the technology adopted in sand-digging and soil excavation {{for the purpose of}} road and housing constructions is inappropriate for clean technology. Thus, the processes of degradation of the communities studied have intensified in recent times due to uncontrolled urbanization. It was also found that the average <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>digging</b> in three sites is 6 meters; the average distance of sites distance to nearest building is 9 meters; the average distance to the nearest stream is 750 meters; the average distance to the nearest road is 18 meters; and the average area covered by the dug sites is 4. 6 hectares. The crude method of soil excavation is causing untold damages to private property and infrastructures such as roads, electricity poles, drainage, etc. Similarly, it was found that excavation activities have induced damages on the existing drainage pattern due to sediments discharge to adjacent water bodies with the implication of inducing flooding. Using Polycentric Planning and Poverty Reduction Strategy, this paper adopts an African Polycentric Sustainable Environment Model (APSEM) for restructuring decision making on environment to conserve and protect environmental resources. The model and the proposed new institutional mechanism would enable local people and professionals/practitioners in the built environment to have a robust dialogue with the local government officials in order to reposition urban councils to effectively manage urban environment and conserve natural resource...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, in {{the conventional}} system, {{the thickness of the}} optical window glass and the object beam's radius are set to be 3 and 5  mm, respectively. Under this circumstance, the LSD and the TIA are calculated to be 100  μm and 89.47 °, respectively, which means that the effective interference area cannot be optimally formed. In other words, the shearing distance of two object beams seems very small compared to the dig having a size of about 100 to 180  μm; thus, real and duplicated images cannot be separated. Even though the <b>depth</b> data <b>of</b> the <b>dig</b> is estimated to be about 2.52  μm from the mixed image, this value may not be valid data for the real <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dig.</b> Hence, the dig's surface area cannot be detected because two real and duplicate images have been partially overlapped to each other as shown in Figure  14 b. Thus, the conventional LSI system has a limitation in application to detection of relatively large defects since the EIA cannot be sufficiently formed for the interference of two object beams without duplicate images.|$|R

30|$|From a real image, the <b>depth</b> value <b>of</b> the <b>dig</b> is {{estimated}} to be 1.45  μm on the average, and its surface area is also measured to be about 180  μm[*]×[*] 100  μm. Here, it is found that there exists a 1.07  μm difference between two estimated <b>depth</b> data <b>of</b> the conventional and the proposed systems, but it does not mean anything because two real and duplicate images have been mixed up together. In other words, the real image has been heavily influenced by the duplicate image in the reconstructed process in the conventional LSI system. On the other hand, in the proposed method, only the real image has been reconstructed without the duplicate image; therefore, exact detection <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> and shape data <b>of</b> the <b>dig</b> can be possible even though the dimension <b>of</b> <b>dig</b> relatively looks large.|$|R
6000|$|M. Golberry {{describes}} Bambúk in gloomy and sombre colours. Its gold {{is distributed}} amongst low ranges of peeled and sterile hills. Probably this results from fires and disforesting. It {{occurs in the}} shape of spangles, grains, and pépites (nuggets), whose size increases with the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>digging.</b> In the Matakon mine the dust adhered to fragments of iron, emery, and lapis lazuli, from which it was easily detached and washed. The less valuable Semayla placer produced dust in a hard reddish loam, mixed with still more refractory materials; it was crushed in mortars with rude wooden dollies or with grain-pestles. The pits, six feet in diameter, reached a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> from ten to twelve yards, where they were stopped by a bed of hard reddish marle; this the Frenchman held to be the hanging wall of a much richer lode. The people used ladders, but they neglected to collar or brace the mouth, and the untimbered pit-sides often fell in; hence fatal accidents, attributed to the 'earth-spirits.' They held gold to be a capricious elf, and when a rich vein suddenly ran barren they cried out, 'There! he is off!' ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{material}} mechanics, theoretical mechanics and soil mechanics, the operating resistance model of machine-soil system was established. According to the model, influential factors on operating resistance {{can be divided}} into property parameters of soil, structural parameters <b>of</b> <b>digging</b> shovel and operating parameters. In order to obtain the influential laws of operating parameters and structural parameters <b>of</b> <b>digging</b> shovel on operating resistance, the model was calculated by changing the parameters. The calculating results showed that, operating resistance would increase non-linearly with the increase of penetrating angle and operating velocity. The larger penetrating angle and higher velocity, the greater increasing ratio of operating resistance.
