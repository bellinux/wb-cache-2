In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose.

5|$|Apollo 16 was {{the second}} of the Apollo type J missions, {{featuring}} the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, increased scientific capability, and lunar surface stays of three days. As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface, the last two missions (the other being Apollo 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties <b>in</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest <b>in</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> early history of the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Manasollasa or Abhilashitartha Chintamani by king Someshvara III (1129) was a Sanskrit work {{intended}} for all sections of society. This {{is an example}} of an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc. While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, it serves as a landmark <b>in</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> state of knowledge in those subjects at that time. Someshwara III also authored a biography of his famous father Vikramaditya VI called Vikraman-Kabhyudaya. The text is a historical prose narrative which also includes a graphic description of the geography and people of Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas, enormous stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians <b>in</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> {{architecture of}} the period.|$|E

Based on our review of the {{research}} literature published during this time span (in refereed journal articles, conference proceedings and edited books), we have jointly identified seven major threads of contributions as these relate to the early years of learning (pre-school and primary school) through to post-compulsory education and to the issue of mathematics teacher education for geometry. These themes are as follows: developments in and trends in the use of theories; advances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of spatial reasoning; the use and role of diagrams and gestures; advances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>the</b> role of technologies; advances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>the</b> teaching and learning of definitions; advances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>understanding</b> of <b>the</b> teaching and learning of the proving process; and, moving beyond traditional Euclidean approaches. Within each theme, we identify relevant research and also offer commentary on future directions...|$|R
5|$|Watson's basic working {{principle}} is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies <b>in</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E
5|$|Busch {{studied for}} nearly four years at Hanover, despite initial {{difficulties}} <b>in</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. According to Bush's nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination. His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to Düsseldorf in June 1851, where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes. Busch's parents had his tuition fees paid for one year, so in May 1852 he traveled to Antwerp to continue study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. He led his parents {{to believe that the}} Academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the opportunity to study old masters. At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers and Frans Hals. The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills. Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from typhus, he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.|$|E
