Instead of grades, evaluation in text seems to be more fair and precise in defining the quality of performance of those with special <b>educational</b> <b>need.</b> The distinct nature of the PE subjects presents a good opportunity to a continuous assessment so a quicker progress can be achieved. However the danger of accidence should be considered because of the increasing risk when special <b>educational</b> <b>need</b> children are involved in sport activities.

40|$|This article aims to {{interpret}} how different policies of priority education {{deal with the}} notions of “educational needs” and “educational inequalities. ” Indeed, it is the processes and mechanisms embedded in the deployment of such policies that ultimately model a category of <b>educational</b> <b>need</b> {{that goes beyond the}} conceptualization of educational inequality used to justify the policies themselves. The authors reach this conclusion by examining four European programs of priority education (PPE). Two basic tendencies are identified. On the one hand, recent deployment of the English and French initiatives seems to be altering the formulation of problems they are designed to address by enhancing in practice a decontextualized notion of individual <b>educational</b> <b>need</b> in which it is considered legitimate to intervene. On the other hand, the Catalan and Dutch programs, which theoretically address both territorial and nonformal educational inequalities, in fact apply prioritization schemes and interventions mainly based on school-based social measures...|$|R
