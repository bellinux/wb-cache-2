5|$|On October 26, 2014, Smith caught four {{passes for}} 51-yards and two {{touchdown}}s, as he helped Joe Flacco set the NFL {{record for the}} fastest time to record five touchdown passes (16 minutes and 3 seconds). The Ravens defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-17. The following week, against the Atlanta Falcons, Smith would score the game-sealing touchdown. With {{less than two minutes}} left in the game and facing a fourth down, Flacco threw a pass to Smith, and he caught <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a 39-yard score. Smith would finish the game with three receptions, 81 yards and the 39 yard touchdown, as the Ravens won of 29-7.|$|E
5|$|The Gators later {{drove to}} the 4-yard line before they were held on downs. After Dodd's punt to midfield, the Gators' {{engineered}} their final scoring drive. A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh to Van Sickel got the Gators out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was wide and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Yankees in the {{eleventh}} {{game of the}} season. It {{was the first of}} three road games the Browns were scheduled to play in a span of eight days. The Browns opened the scoring early in the first quarter with a screen pass from Graham to Motley, who ran 78 yards for a touchdown. An interception by Parseghian on the Yankees' next possession set up another Browns touchdown, a one-yard run by Edgar Jones. The Yankees responded with two touchdowns of their own in the second quarter. The first was a long pass from Pete Layden to Bruce Alford early in the period. On Cleveland's next possession, Graham threw a pass to John Yonakor, but as Yonakor was waiting for the ball to arrive, New York's Otto Schnellbacher jumped {{in front of him and}} made an interception. Schnellbacher had a clear shot at Cleveland's end zone and ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown that tied the game at 14 points. An interception by Yonakor later in the quarter set up a Groza field goal, and the Browns pulled away as halfback Bob Cowan ran for a touchdown and Groza added another field goal before halftime. Another touchdown by Motley in the third quarter put the Browns ahead by 20 points. The Yankees scored a final touchdown in the fourth quarter to cap a 45-yard drive, but the Browns won the game 34–21. Lavelli was hit in the eye early in the game and had to sit out. Tackle Chubby Grigg and Edgar Jones were also hurt in the game, adding to Cleveland's long list of injured players.|$|E

5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Buffalo Bisons in Buffalo, New York. Just over 30,000 people watched the game; while {{this was a}} lower total than the Browns' {{previous}} two games, it set a professional football attendance record in Buffalo. Playing in 80-degree heat, Browns quarterback Otto Graham threw two touchdowns {{in the first quarter}} to John Yonakor and Marion Motley. Cleveland scored for a third time in the first quarter when Cliff Lewis, substituting for Graham, pitched a lateral to Gaylon Smith, who ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown. After neither team scored {{in the second and third}} quarters, the Browns added a fourth touchdown on Chet Adams' fumble return. Al Dekdebrun, Buffalo's second-string quarterback, fumbled at the Bisons' 34-yard line and Adams picked it up and ran for a touchdown. The Bisons were held scoreless despite having more first downs than the Browns. The team played without its primary rushing threat, Steve Juzwik, who was sidelined with a pulled leg muscle.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} out until the fourth quarter, and only scored when Chicago Bears safety Todd Bell intercepted a Steve Young pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa Bay receiver Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called back on a holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa {{had good}} field {{position}} {{after a short}} 31-yard punt to start their first drive of the quarter. Their 4-play, 41-yard drive culminated with an eight-yard touchdown run by Green to cut the gap to 17-14. Iowa State went three-and-out on the ensuing drive and were forced to punt. Tulsa got the ball at their own 41-yard line and put together a 6-play, 59-yard drive that featured passes to Willie Carter, Thomas Roberson, and Keyarris Garrett for 19, 21, and 6 yards respectively {{as well as a}} 12-yard rush by Watts. These plays set up first and goal at the one-yard line. Alex Singleton lost a yard on first down, but ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a 2-yard touchdown on second down putting Tulsa in the lead 21-17, a lead they would not give up {{for the remainder of the}} game. The next two drives each ended in a punt. Iowa State took over at their 35-yard line with 6:10 remaining in the half. They drove down the field to the 16-yard line, but couldn't score and had to settle for a 34-yard field goal attempt by Arceo, which he missed. There was no scoring for the remainder of the half.|$|E

25|$|Browner's first interception, {{on third}} and 17 from the Vikings 32, {{led to a}} 73-yard drive by Minnesota that {{featured}} Wade Wilson's 34-yard completion to reserve receiver Jim Gustafson and was capped by running back Alfred Anderson's 7-yard touchdown run.

25|$|With {{both teams}} {{entering}} the game 5–5 {{and trying to}} become bowl-eligible, Carolina led 14–7 at the half in Clemson. Gamecock RB Brandon Bennett received the kick to start the third quarter, took a few steps, then turned and threw a backward pass {{to the other side}} of the field which was caught by DB Reggie Richardson who returned the ball 85 yards to the Tigers' 6-yard line. Bennett ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown on the next play, putting Carolina ahead 21–7 and the Gamecocks never looked back, going on to win the game 33–7 and clinching a bid to the Carquest Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Michigan added to its lead on 18-yard {{touchdown}} pass in which Chappuis rolled {{out to his}} right and threw across the field to quarterback Howard Yerges, who was open at the nine-yard line. Yerges caught the ball and ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown, giving Michigan a 28-0 lead. The Wolverines closed the game with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The touchdowns came on a one-yard run by Weisenberger, a 46-yard pass from Henry Fonde to Derricotte who was open at the 25-yard line and ran untouched down the right sideline, and a 29-yard pass from Yerges to Rifenburg. Brieske converted all seven PATs for Michigan.|$|E
25|$|The Wolverines {{defeated}} the Nittany Lions 27–25 on the game's final play to hand Penn State its {{first and only}} loss of the season. It would cap a wild fourth quarter where the two teams would combine for 39 points and four lead changes. Down 10–3 in the fourth, the Lions would quickly strike twice, the first would be a Michael Robinson two yard keeper set up by a Tony Hunt 61-yard run. On the Wolverines next drive, Alan Zemaitis would strip Michigan quarterback Chad Henne during the tackle and returned it 35yards for the score. Kicker Kevin Kelly would put Penn State up 18–10 after a picking up a bad snap on the extra point and running <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> the two-point conversion.|$|E

25|$|On Philadelphia's next drive, {{the referees}} made two suspect decisions. The {{first was a}} non-call on a very obvious {{facemask}} on Brian Westbrook {{that would have given}} the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the game}} {{appeared}} to be over. However, the Steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the Colts still had three timeouts remaining. But on Pittsburgh's first play, in which Bettis tried to punch <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> an insurance touchdown, he fumbled {{for the first time}} all season when linebacker Gary Brackett popped it from Bettis' hands with his helmet. Indianapolis defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and {{appeared to be}} on his way for an Indy touchdown that would have given the Colts the lead when Roethlisberger made a season saving tackle at the Colts' 42-yard line, spinning around and grabbing his ankle. Eventually, the Colts then advanced to the Pittsburgh 28-yard line, but Vanderjagt, who had been perfect at home in the playoffs, missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left, and the Steelers ran out the clock.|$|E

25|$|Navy {{scored a}} {{touchdown}} {{in the third quarter}} but they missed the potential game-tying extra point. It was the only score of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Navy's Chris Kuhar-Pitters collected a fumble at the Notre Dame 16 yard line and ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown. Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada rushed for the two-point conversion to take a 28–21 lead – their first of the game. Notre Dame tied the score with a touchdown. The game eventually went to overtime, {{with the aid of a}} questionable decision from Irish head coach Charlie Weis: With 45 seconds left in regulation, Notre Dame faced a fourth-and-8 on the Navy 24; instead of attempting a 41-yard field goal that could have won the game, Weis opted to go for the first down. The gamble backfired in spectacular fashion when Navy sacked quarterback Evan Sharpley, with Midshipmen linebacker Ram Vela literally leaping over a blocker to assist in the sack.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland handily {{beat the}} Steelers {{at home in}} their seventh game of the season. It was a {{breakout}} performance for Motley, who had 11 carries for 188 yards and two touchdown runs. A 61-yard return of the opening kickoff by Phelps set up the Browns' first touchdown, a short rush by Graham {{two and a half}} minutes into the first period. After stopping a pair of long Pittsburgh drives in the second quarter, Cleveland advanced to the Steelers' two-yard line but had to settle for a Groza field goal. Near the end of the half, Motley caught a pass from Graham and ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> another touchdown, putting Cleveland ahead 17–0. An interception by Gorgal on Pittsburgh's first drive of the third quarter led to Motley's second touchdown, a 69-yard run. Another interception by Jim Martin and a touchdown catch on the next drive by Phelps gave the Browns their fourth touchdown of the game and a commanding lead. Pittsburgh scored a touchdown on a two-play, 80-yard drive in the fourth quarter, but Cleveland added two more touchdowns {{at the end of the}} game to win 45–7.|$|E
