5000|$|The act {{of getting}} on a horse {{for the first time}} goes by many names, {{including}} backing, breaking, mounting, and simply riding. There are many techniques for introducing the young horse to a rider or to a <b>harness</b> and <b>cart</b> <b>for</b> driving, but the end goal of all methods is to have the horse calmly and quietly allow a rider on its back or behind it in a cart and to respond to basic commands to go forward, change gaits and speed, stop, turn and back up.|$|R

60|$|The first lecture says, or {{tries to}} say, that, life being very short, and the quiet hours of it few, {{we ought to}} waste none of them in reading valueless books; and that {{valuable}} books should, in a civilized country, be within the reach of every one, printed in excellent form, for a just price; but not in any vile, vulgar, or, by reason of smallness of type, physically injurious form, at a vile price. For we none of us need many books, and those which we need ought to be clearly printed, on the best paper, and strongly bound. And though we are, indeed, now, a wretched and poverty-struck nation, and hardly able to keep soul and body together, still, as no person in decent circumstances would put on his table confessedly bad wine, or bad meat, without being ashamed, so he need not have on his shelves ill-printed or loosely and wretchedly-stitched books; for though few can be rich, yet every man who honestly exerts himself may, I think, still provide, {{for himself and his}} family, good shoes, good gloves, strong <b>harness</b> <b>for</b> his <b>cart</b> or carriage horses, and stout leather binding for his books. And I would urge upon every young man, as the beginning of his due and wise provision for his household, to obtain as soon as he can, by the severest economy, a restricted, serviceable, and steadily--however slowly-- increasing, series of books for use through life; making his little library, of all the furniture in his room, the most studied and decorative piece; every volume having its assigned place, like a little statue in its niche, and one of the earliest and strictest lessons to the children of the house being how to turn the pages of their own literary possessions lightly and deliberately, with no chance of tearing or dog's ears.|$|R

60|$|The eloquence of a prose billet was {{necessarily}} {{resorted to}} {{in the absence of}} the heavenly muse, and the said billet was secretly intrusted to the care of Trotting Nelly. The same trusty emissary, when refreshed by her nap among the pease-straw, and about to <b>harness</b> her <b>cart</b> <b>for</b> her return to the seacoast, (in the course of which she was to pass the Aultoun,) received another card, written, as he had threatened, by Sir Bingo Binks himself, who had given himself this trouble to secure the settlement of the bet; conjecturing that a man with a fashionable exterior, who could throw twelve yards of line at a cast with such precision, might consider the invitation of Winterblossom as that of an old twaddler, and care as little for the good graces of an affected blue-stocking and her côterie, whose conversation, in Sir Bingo's mind, relished of nothing but of weak tea and bread and butter. Thus the happy Mr. Francis Tyrrel received, considerably to his surprise, no less than three invitations at once from the Well of St. Ronan's.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{adherence}} {{and persistence}} (continuous treatment with a prescribed medication) in HIV adult {{patients who received}} combination ART (cART) as a once-daily single-tablet regimen (STR) versus other administration schedules. Methods: A representative random sample of the French National Healthcare Insurance Database was used. Adherence and persistence were compared according to their administration schedules using x 2 and survival analyses. STRs were marketed in France in 2009 and the study period was selected to allow {{a sufficient number of}} patients with an STR and a relevant duration of follow-up. Results: During the period covered (2006 – 11), 362 HIV-positive adult antiretroviral-naive patients (566 lines of treatments) were selected. The mean rates of adherence were 89. 6 % for the STR (tenofovir/emtricitabine/ efavirenz; n 76), 86. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>cART</b> with. 1 pill once daily (n 242) and 77. 0 % <b>for</b> <b>cART</b> with. 1 daily intake (n 248; P, 0. 0001 versus STR). Kaplan–Meier estimations of persistence after 2 years of treatment were 79. 1 % for the STR, 53. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>cART</b> with. 1 pill once daily and 51. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>cART</b> with. 1 daily intake (P 0. 001; log-rank test). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. After excluding treatment sequences showing a switch from tenofovir/emtricitabine plus efavirenz to the similar STR, the rates of persistence were 80. 3 % for the STR (n 60), 77. 3 % <b>for</b> atazanavir-containing <b>cART</b> (n 96) and 68. 3 % for darunavir-containing cAR...|$|R
