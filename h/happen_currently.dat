40|$|Myocardial {{damage is}} known to occur {{relatively}} frequently in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, and {{although it is not}} often fatal it can have adverse effects, resulting in significantly longer patient stays. Thus, it is important for clinicians to be able to predict these events before they <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> there are no tests that can predict myocardial damage, only tests that can detect myocardial damage once it has happened. Additionally, cardiac monitoring that may indicate early abnormal cardiac changes in a patient is expensive. Consequently, it is desirable for doctors, and support systems, to detect myocardial damage from the standard parameters collected for ICU patients. In this study, we have developed a model to predict myocardial damage based on cardiovascular derangements occurring before the damage. This model was developed through a series of knowledge acquisition sessions with ICU clinicians. An initial evaluation indicated that the model could predict myocardial damage in 87. 5...|$|E
40|$|Predicting future {{values of}} Quality of Service (QoS) {{attributes}} {{can assist in}} the control of software intensive systems by preventing QoS violations before they <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> many approaches prefer Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for this task, and assume the QoS attributes’ behavior can be linearly modeled. However, the analysis of real QoS datasets shows that they are characterized by a highly dynamic and mostly nonlinear behavior {{to the extent that}} existing ARIMA models cannot guarantee accurate QoS forecasting, which can introduce crucial problems such as proactively triggering unrequired adaptations and thus leading to follow-up failures and increased costs. To address this limitation, we propose an automated forecasting approach that integrates linear and nonlinear time series models and automatically, without human intervention, selects and constructs the best suitable forecasting model to fit the QoS attributes’ dynamic behavior. Using real-world QoS datasets of 800 web services we evaluate the applicability, accuracy, and performance aspects of the proposed approach, and results show that the approach outperforms the popular existing ARIMA models and improves the forecasting accuracy by on average 35. 4 %...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNewcastle disease virus (NDV) {{belonging}} to the Paramyxovirinae subfamily {{is one of the}} most devastating pathogens in poultry. Although vaccines are widely applied to control the infection, outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) repeatedly <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> there are no alternative control measures available for ND. In the present study, we found that sulfated Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharide (sCVPS) were potent inhibitors of NDV in specific pathogen free chickens infected with a virulent strain. With sCVPS treatment, the survival rate increased by almost 20 % and virus titers in test organs, including brain, lung, spleen and thymus, were significantly decreased. The sCVPS also exhibited the ability to prevent viral transmission by reducing the amount of virus shed in saliva and feces. Higher concentrations of interferon α and γ in serum were detected in chickens treated with sCVPS, indicating that one of the antiviral mechanisms may be attributed to the property of immunoenhancement. Histopathological examination showed that sCVPS could alleviate the tissue lesions caused by NDV infection. These results suggest that sCVPS are expected to be a new alternative control measure for NDV infection and further studies could be carried out to evaluate the antiviral activity of sCVPS against other paramyxoviruses...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{increase}} in maritime traffic together with challenging navigation conditions and a vulnerable ecosystem has evoked calls for improving maritime safety in the Gulf of Finland, (the Baltic Sea). It is suggested that these improvements will {{be the result of}} adopting a regionally effective proactive approach to safety policy formulation and management. A proactive approach is grounded on a formal process of identifying, assessing and evaluating accident risks, and adjusting policies or management practices before accidents <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> maritime safety is globally regulated by internationally agreed prescriptive rules, which are usually revised in reaction to accidents. The proactive Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) is applied to risks common to a ship type or to a particular hazard, when deemed necessary, whereas regional FSA applications are rare. An extensive literature review was conducted in order to examine the opportunities for developing a framework for the GoF for handling regional risks at regional level. Best practices were sought from nuclear safety management and fisheries management, and from a particular case related to maritime risk management. A regional approach that sees maritime safety as a holistic system, and manages it by combining a scientific risk assessment with stakeholder input to identify risks and risk control options, and to evaluate risks is proposed. A regional risk governance framework can improve safety by focusing on actual regional risks, designing tailor-made safety measures to control them, enhancing a positive safety culture in the shipping industry, and by increasing trust among all involved...|$|E
40|$|The {{mosquito}} Aedes albopictus, {{indigenous to}} Southeast Asia and nearby islands, has spread almost worldwide during recent decades. We confirm {{the invasion of}} this mosquito, first reported in Yamagata city in northeast Honshu, Japan in 2000. Previously, only Ae. japonicus japonicus had been collected in this place, but 2 years later, the population of Ae. albopictus had increased, so more than 80 % {{of the total number}} of larval colonies there consisted of this species. In contrast to Yamagata’s new residential area, now infested by Ae. albopictus, the original mosquito remains in the city but its habitats are generally closer to the surrounding mountains, where the normalized difference vegetation index is higher. The factors affecting the distribution of both species in Yamagata city were studied using geographical information systems (GIS) based on data derived from field surveys, aerial photographs, satellite images and digital maps. The range of Aedes mosquito habitats was estimated and visualised on polygon maps and no significant differences were noted when the polygon area was calculated by GIS software in comparison with the satellite images. Although Ae. j. japonicus was expected to be rapidly overrun by Ae. albopictus, this did not <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> both species coexist; not only in separate sites, but also simultaneously in various water bodies, where larvae from both species have frequently been seen. However, the competitive relationship between these two Aedes species within a warming environment is an issue that should be closely monitored...|$|E

30|$|Coffee {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} export commodity of Vietnam {{with the}} export value accounts for 3 % of national GDP in 2014 and provides a livelihood for approximately 2.6 million people (Vietnam Customs 2015). Following Brazil, since 2000 Vietnam has continuously been the world’s second-largest exporter of coffee, typically to EU and US markets, which shows a positive outlook {{for the future of}} this sector (Marsh 2007). However, numerous challenges need to be overcome {{in order to make it}} <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> less than 10 % of Vietnamese coffee is grown sustainably, compared with 75 % in Latin America (Mistiaen 2012). With the increase in global market requirements, the competitiveness of Vietnamese coffee is being threatened. For example, people still use many unsustainable farming methods such as monocultures, burning of crop residue, poor fertility management, tillage, etc. which results in many catastrophic impacts on the environment – such as deforestation and soil degradation – have the potential to lead to a decrease in yields, increase in insect pests and diseases on crops (Schmitter et al. 2010). Many researches confirms that the rural poor dwellers are one of the most vulnerable residential group to environmental deterioration as their livelihoods mainly depend on natural resources (Dasgupta et al. 2003). A meta-analysis of (Rahmann 2011; Bennett and Franzel 2013) states that the level of biodiversity in sustainable farms (such as organic farms, fair-trade farms) is higher than conventional farms. Sustainable farming is cost-effective system that have significant impacts on poverty alleviation, sustainable development in under-developed nations around the world (Kilcher 2007). According to (Crowdera and Reganold 2015; Nemes 2009; Ramesh et al. 2010), sustainable farms provide farmers with higher economic profitability by 22 to 35 % compare to others thanks to higher yields and price premiums of sustainable products. Therefore, sustainability will need to be comprehensively addressed in coffee production to improve the uses of natural resources for human needs without damaging the environment (Nguyen and Yapwattanaphuna 2015). Also, sustainable approach enables farmers to use their knowledge and skills more effectively. However, the factors impact on farmers’ adoption to a new sustainable agricultural practice vary widely from farmers’ perception, the characteristics of the new practice to resource endowments, socio-economic status, demographic characteristics, and access to institutional services (Negatu and Parikh 1999). The government is aiming to reach 65 % of sustainable coffee production by 2018, which will help to preserve the environment, improve the living standards of the farmers and ensure a steady coffee supply for food processors (Mistiaen 2012).|$|E
