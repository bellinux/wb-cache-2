'When I'd go see Rush as a kid, I {{would wonder}} why Geddy Lee used one finger all the time. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{because it made}} it easier to play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E
6000|$|In fine, {{no other}} American writer ever had so slight a human basis for his work; no other ever labored more patiently or more carefully. The unending {{controversy}} over Poe commonly reduces itself to this deadlock: one reader asks, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{was worth a}} man's effort in the doing?" [...] and another answers, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was not cleverly, skillfully done?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh!' rejoined Ralph, 'I {{thought you}} did. Well! Handsome or not handsome, to {{this old man}} there comes a young fellow who casts all manner of fierce defiances in his teeth--gums I should rather say--and tells him in plain terms that his {{mistress}} hates him. What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for? Philanthropy's sake?' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem is}} with an object’s {{accidental}} intrinsic properties, such as shape and weight, which supervene on its parts. Humphrey could have the property of having six fingers on his left hand. How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> It can’t be true that Humphrey has both the property of having six fingers and five fingers on his left hand. What we might say {{is that he has}} five fingers at this world and six fingers at that world. But how should these modifiers be understood? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Came to see you!" [...] exclaimed her brother. [...] "What in {{the world}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for? You never {{told me that you}} were ailin'. Is it that sprain in your ankle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is [...] . {{he says he}} is himself," [...] asseverated Davy. [...] "He said it when {{he prayed}} in Sunday School last Sunday. He said he was a vile worm and a miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest 'niquity. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was so bad, Marilla? Did he kill anybody? Or steal the {{collection}} cents? I want to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" [...] demanded Peter indignantly. [...] "To {{show you}} one use {{he has for}} that handy tail," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "That {{is the way he}} gives warning to his friends {{whenever}} he discovers danger. Did you notice how he used his tail to aid him in swimming? He turns it almost on edge and uses it as a rudder. Those big, webbed hind feet are the paddles which drive him through the water. He can stay under water a long time--as much as five minutes. See, he has just come up now." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the plenitude of his resources, every {{obstacle}} {{seemed to}} vanish. [...] "There shall be no Alps," [...] he said; and {{he built his}} perfect roads, climbing by graded galleries their steepest precipices, until Italy was as open to Paris as any town in France. He laid his bones to, and wrought for his crown. Having decided {{what was to be}} <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> with might and main. He put out all his strength. He risked everything, and spared nothing, neither ammunition, nor money, nor troops, nor generals, nor himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, in the circumstances, might Gussie too, I should think. What {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> after <b>that?</b> London late at night--or {{even in the}} daytime, for that matter--is {{no place for a}} man in scarlet tights." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{historian}} sees {{another side}} of Irving's work. Should it be asked, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> had not been as well or better done before him?" [...] the first {{answer is that the}} importance of any man's work must be measured by the age in which he did it. A schoolboy now knows more about electricity than ever Franklin learned; but that does not detract from our wonder at Franklin's kite. So the work of Irving seems impressive when viewed against the gray literary dawn of a century ago. At that time America had done a mighty work for the world politically, but had added little of value to the world's literature. She read and treasured the best books; but she made no contribution to their number, and her literary impotence galled her sensitive spirit. As if to make up for her failure, the writers of the Knickerbocker, Charleston and other [...] "schools" [...] praised each other's work extravagantly; but no responsive echo came from overseas, where England's terse criticism of our literary effort was expressed in the scornful question, [...] "Who reads an American book?" ...|$|E

It is of very great value. The Indian gives one large salmon for one leaf of tobacco, and he chews the tobacco for a long time. It is the juice of the tobacco that is good. When it runs down his throat it makes him feel good inside. But the white man! When his mouth is full with the juice, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> <b>That</b> juice, that juice of great value, he spits {{it out in the}} snow and it is lost.

Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on {{the housekeeper}}'s, like a trap, as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> this, <b>that</b> we all stopped in our foolish contention.|$|R
5000|$|Graver {{also won}} favor with Yost for his versatility, playing at halfback, fullback, quarterback and end during the 1902 season. [...] Injuries {{required}} Yost to fill holes at the fullback and quarterback positions, and Graver was the player he called on. In {{response to a}} newspaper inquiry as to how Graver was adapting to being {{moved to a new}} position, Yost replied, [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> <b>That</b> boy does well any place you put him. He is little, but I rather guess if I stuck him in at guard he would hustle any one in the country to keep him from doing things." [...] At the end of the 1902 season, Graver was selected as an All-Western substitute for positions behind the line. [...] The Chicago Tribune in 1902 called Graver [...] "the best man on defense" [...] on the Michigan team.|$|E

50|$|Gunning’s focuses were on {{chemical}} kinetics and photochemistry. He {{did much}} research {{in these areas}} and published over 175 research papers on these areas of chemistry. He {{became president of the}} Chemical Institute of Canada in 1973 and remained there until 1974. He was active in provincial, municipal, and federal commissions and boards, one of them being the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority.Gunning became President of the University of Alberta in 1974. He was a strong president, introducing many innovative policies in science and administration. He also supported and promoted the interaction between academics, industry, and government in Canada. He also was an important role-player in research and development of Alberta’s vast oil and sand resources. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but he helped in developing Chem-Biomed Ltd and established the Edmonton Research and Development Park. Gunning received many awards in recognition of his vast achievements in the field of science and academia. He received the Chemical Institute of Canada Medal in 1967 and the Province of Alberta Achievement Award in 1971 as well as 1979. He also achieved six honorary degrees in total, and in 1979, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. On November 30, 2001, the University of Alberta’s Chemistry Building was renamed the Gunning/Lemieux Chemistry Centre in honour of Harry Gunning as well as Raymond Urgel Lemieux, who were considered the department’s two most distinguished chemists.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make up for our debt through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that our problem is not our personal sin, but original sin. [...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God’s love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (Jn 3:16).|$|R
6000|$|Variety is charming. No one laying {{claim to}} the {{smallest}} amount of that very uncommon attribute, common-sense, will venture to question the truth of that statement. Variety is so charming that men and women, boys and girls, are always, all of them, hunting after it.

Were any positive and short-sighted individual to deny this position, and sit down during the remainder of his life in a chair and look straight before him, in order to prove that he could live without variety, he would seek it in change of position.

50|$|Two {{villages in}} Thanjavur area are always at loggerheads {{with each other}} and it spills even to T20 cricket match between kids from both the villages. Arikki @ Arivazhagan (Vimal) is a wayward son of Lakshmi (Saranya Ponvannan) who is in awe at the same time fears him. Her husband Ramasamy (Ilavarasu) is away in Dubai and {{a large part of the}} money he sends home is taken away by Arikki using extortionist methods like {{threatening}} to break the TV set at home. He yet to pass his 12th standard spends his time in bars with his friends, teases girls and asks them to profess their love for him, and gets into brawls after conning others. He meets Maheshwari (Oviya) and wants her to declare her love for him, which she finally confesses. He abducts her and they eventually marry. Her brother Ilango (Thirumurugan) is a tough guy who has an axe to grind against Arikki and his gang, which leads to the twist in the climax. Ilango fuming with rage is out to slice him into pieces. But <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> And if <b>he</b> didn't, how <b>did</b> Arikki manage to avert that? All this is answered in an interesting climax that is pleasantly humorous.|$|R

Despite Brecht's extensive support for Communism, most authors agree that he really hadn't officially joined the party, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in his life, although it has also been claimed in the literature that he had joined in 1930.|$|R

Carrying top weight of 123 pounds, he started the 1/2 favorite and won by a neck from Conquest Two Step after taking the lead inside the final furlong. After the race, Smith said, [...] "This race proved what a great horse <b>he</b> is, just by <b>doing</b> what <b>he</b> <b>did...</b> <b>that</b> puts a big feather in his cap and puts him in front for Horse of the Year.
