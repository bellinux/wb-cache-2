60|$|This done, {{instead of}} {{returning}} {{the box to}} my pocket I passed the chain through the buttonhole of my cloak and let it dangle on my breast as an ornament.

Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age. 'Well?' said <b>I,</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> 'there's nothing in it.' ...|$|R

60|$|Being thus invited, I {{consented to}} spin them a yarn. The old gentleman settled {{himself in his}} chair, my mother {{smoothed}} her apron, folded her hands, and looked meekly into my face. Tom Lokins filled his pipe, stretched out his foot to poke the fire {{with the toe of}} his shoe, and began to smoke like a steam-engine; then <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and began my tale, and before I had done talking that night, I had told them all that I have told in this little book, almost word for word.|$|E

Probably the time seemed longer than it really was. Morton showed the strain, also. Other men looked drawn, haggard, waiting as if expecting a thunderbolt. Once in my roving gaze I caught Blandy's glinty eye on me. I didn't like the gleam. I said to myself I'd watch him if I {{had to do it}} {{out of the back of}} my head.

6000|$|There {{are moments}} in a chappie's life, don't you know, when Reason, so to speak, totters, as it were, on its bally throne. This {{was one of}} them.

I suppose, strictly speaking, I ought, at this juncture, to have <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and said in an audible tone, [...] "Harold, old top, I know where Ponsonby is." [...] But somehow I couldn't. Something seemed to keep the words back. I just stood there and said nothing.|$|R

60|$|Heart-high, I say, my rapier entered Pasquini's {{side on the}} right, {{but it did not}} emerge, on the left, for, well-nigh through him, it met a rib (oh, man-killing is butcher's work!) {{with such}} a will that the forcing overbalanced him, so that he fell part {{backward}} and part sidewise to the ground. And even as he fell, and ere he struck, with jerk and wrench <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> weapon of him.|$|R
60|$|I looked up. At {{the first}} glance I did not {{recognise}} the speaker; but then as <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> mind <b>I</b> {{saw it was}} Ercole Piacentini. What was he doing here? Then I remembered that {{it was on the}} road to Forli. I supposed he had received orders to leave Castello and {{was on his way to}} his old haunts. However, I did not want to speak to him; I bent down, and again clasped my head in my hands.|$|R

6000|$|As for the inn, yes, it {{was very}} bad. It had been quite good under the {{previous}} proprietors. But now--they shrugged their shoulders. The dirty-breast and the shawled girl were not the owners. They were merely conductors of the hotel: here a sarcastic curl of the lip. The owner {{was a man in}} the village--a young man. A week or two back, at Christmas time, there had been a roomful of men sitting drinking and roistering at this very table. When in had come the proprietor, mad-drunk, swinging a litre bottle round his head and yelling: [...] "Out! Out! Out, all of you! Out every one of you! I am proprietor here.

60|$|I {{found him}} {{at work on}} a picture, which I was able conscientiously to praise, dressed in his usual tweeds--plain, but pretty fresh, and {{standing}} out in disagreeable contrast to my own withered and degraded outfit. As we talked, he continued to shift his eyes watchfully between his handiwork and the fat model, who sat {{at the far end of}} the studio in a state of nature, with one arm gallantly arched above her head. My errand would have been difficult enough under the best of circumstances: placed between Myner, immersed in his art, and the white, fat, naked female in a ridiculous attitude, I found it quite impossible. Again and again I attempted to approach the point, again and again fell back on commendations of the picture; and it was not until the model had enjoyed an interval of repose, during which she took the conversation in her own hands and regaled us (in a soft, weak voice) with details as to her husband's prosperity, her sister's lamented decline from the paths of virtue, and the consequent wrath of her father, a peasant of stern principles, in the vicinity of Châlons on the Marne--it was not, I say, until after this was over, and I had once more <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> for the attack, and once more dropped aside into some commonplace about the picture, that Myner himself brought me suddenly and vigorously to the point.|$|R

Maybe it's because my mother freaked a bit (hi mom). Devils have been among the coolest for me since I got my hands on the 1st edition Monster Manual. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've had a fondness for Glasya since Monster Manual 2--what can I say, I like women with horns and tails." ...|$|R
