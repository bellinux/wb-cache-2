On February 22, before their 12th Anniversary Weekend TV taping, ROH announced a partnership with number one Japanese professional wrestling promotion, New Japan Pro Wrestling. The announcement included a promotional video and words from NJPW chairman Naoki Sugabayashi. ROH and NJPW held their first co-promoted show, <b>Global</b> <b>Wars,</b> <b>on</b> May 10 from the Ted Reeve Arena in Toronto, Canada. One week later from the sold-out Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, they held their second, War of the Worlds.|$|R

5|$|Operation Enduring Freedom is the {{official}} name used by the United States Government for its War in Afghanistan, together with three smaller military actions {{under the umbrella of}} its <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terrorism. The war began on October 7, 2001 with the response of the United States and United Kingdom to the September 11 attacks in New York City and Arlington, Virginia. In early 2005, Murphy was assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE as officer in charge of Alpha Platoon and deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2005, Brown, {{together}} with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee announced {{the creation of}} the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). Prior to the creation of MARSOC, the Marine Corps had not been involved in special operations, which were conducted by Army, Navy and Air Force units assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command. After the September 11 attacks, the Secretary of Defense had directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror. This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM. It was nearly three years later on February 24, 2006, when MARSOC was activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of an}} American unified special {{operations}} command had its origins {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Eagle Claw, the disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at the American embassy in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III, the retired Chief of Naval Operations, cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission. Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations, from the 1989 invasion of Panama to the ongoing <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS planners have {{played a significant role in}} the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror. Beginning in 2002, the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW). SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post-combat occupation.|$|E
5|$|Formed {{out of the}} Division Support Command of the 82nd Airborne Division, {{the brigade}} {{has a long history}} of {{supporting}} the 82nd in numerous contingencies throughout the world. The sustainment brigade supported the division in operations including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, Operation Power Pack and Operation Desert Storm. Recently, the brigade has seen multiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade's mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan came to an end when responsibility was handed to the 101st Sustainment Brigade during a ceremony at Bagram Airbase on 2 December 2010. For the first time since the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terror began in 2001, with the exception of Delta Detachment, 82nd Finance, all the elements of the 82nd Sustainment Brigade were home in Fort Bragg. Since then, the 82nd Sustainment Brigade has once again been called upon to assist in OEF Afghanistan by establishing and controlling CMRE operations. On 21 May 2015, the brigade realigned back under the 82nd Airborne Division and became the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The First World <b>War</b> was a <b>global</b> <b>war,</b> {{beginning}} <b>on</b> 28 July 1914, until 11 November 1918. Soon {{after the}} beginning of the war, there was an “epidemic” of neurological conversion symptoms. Soldiers on both sides started to present in large numbers with neurological symptoms, such as dizziness, tremor, paraplegia, tinnitus, amnesia, weakness, headache and mutism of psychosomatic origin. This condition was known as shell shock, or “war neurosis”. Because medically unexplained symptoms remain a major challenge, and considering the close relationship of symptoms described in shell shock with clinical neurology, we should study their history in order to improve future care...|$|R
5000|$|Pacifists {{have made}} some sharp criticisms. For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the Moravian peace tradition, [...] argues that the theme of [...] "sacrifice" [...] has fueled the rise of what she calls [...] "U.S. war culture." [...] The result is a {{diversion}} of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the <b>global</b> American <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terror. However, some Protestant denominations such as the Churches of Christ, have largely turned away from pacifism to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.|$|R
5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade mobilized {{in support}} of the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terrorism in 2003. It was {{commanded}} by Colonel Gregg F. Martin. As preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 130th Engineer Brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force in the theater. This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps' staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed the border to Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south. Coupled with the landings of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to the north, the operation would see the US Forces surround and destroy Iraqi forces in and around the capitol.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{itself has}} not seen a deployment, even though all subordinate units have been deployed for several support missions. The 96th CA Battalion deployed units {{in support of the}} Iraq War in mid-2007. The brigade also had troops deployed in support of special operations units in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan. The brigade suffered several casualties in Iraq, including two soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices. One of these soldiers, a Major, prompted the State of California to fly its flags at half staff. It also suffered several casualties which were rehabilitated through the new Wounded Warrior Project. The 98th Civil Affairs Battalion also had soldiers deployed to Iraq before its activation in 2008. Soldiers of this battalion also saw deployments to Africa as well as other areas in support of the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Terrorism.|$|E

30|$|The Anglo-American {{public has}} been socialized into the militarist {{conceptualization}} of many other abstract social and political issues through frequent exposure to the WAR metaphor {{as an expression of}} unwavering resolve (e.g., war against crime, war against inflation, <b>war</b> <b>on</b> cancer, <b>war</b> <b>on</b> poverty, <b>war</b> <b>on</b> drugs, <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>global</b> warming, <b>war</b> <b>on</b> human trafficking, to name just a few). As Semino (2008 : 100) observes, the use of the WAR metaphor “tends to dramatize the opposition between different participants in politics,” to “emphasize the gravity and urgency of the problem in question, and the seriousness of the effort that is being made to solve it.” The dramatic and emphatic effects of the WAR metaphor as well as the seriousness it implies are clearly advantageous for the construction and representation of the CCP’s viewpoint and stance on corruption in front of an international audience, and for persuading that audience.|$|R

At that point, no specific dates were announced and only the United States was named as a location. However, on February 25, ROH sent out a press release, announcing three co-produced events, as opposed to two shows in 2014, with War of the Worlds '15 taking place on May 13 in Philadelphia and <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> '15 <b>on</b> May 15 and 16 in Toronto, Canada. <b>On</b> March 7, <b>War</b> of the Worlds '15 was also expanded to a two-day event, taking place over May 12 and 13.

From a Latin American standpoint, it questions the traditional approach to a <b>global</b> matter: the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs. Researchers usually see this phenomenon in Latin America as reflecting US domination in the region. However, by identifying how and why the drug issue became a matter of security in Latin America and by specifying the collective countermeasures adopted, Latin American participation becomes more apparent in the construction of the international process that gave rise to the normative framework that holds up the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> Drugs: the 1988 Vienna Convention...|$|R
