5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> the heavy and light chains undergo {{a high rate}} of point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> their antibody chains.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic {{hedgehog}} (residue 25 – 198) {{was expressed}} in both yeast and animal cells. The yeast-derived NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog was less active by far than the animal cell-derived counterpart. The yeast-derived NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog lacked 10 amino acids from the NH 2 -terminus. This cleavage of the yeast-derived NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog might due to Kex 2. In contrast, a mutant yeast-derived NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog (Lys- 33 to Thr) retained its NH 2 -terminus and its activity was {{comparable to that}} of the animal cell-derived NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog. The NH 2 -terminal deleted NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog completely lost its activity, nevertheless it inhibited the alkaline phosphatase activity induced by the animal cell-derived NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that the NH 2 -terminal deleted NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog retains a receptor-binding ability and that the NH 2 -terminal peptide of the NH 2 -terminal <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> sonic hedgehog is necessary for its signal transduction...|$|R

5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> gp120 and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E
