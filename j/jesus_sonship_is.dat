40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of Christianity, the understanding of Christ’s sonship (filiatio) has played {{an essential role in}} soteriology. According to the Church Fathers and to the medieval theologians, the human person can become a son of God by the grace of adoption through the sonship of Christ. However, the German Dominican, Meister Eckhart (ca. 1260 - 1328), uses the theological concept “the Only-begotten Son,” which stands for the divine sonship of Christ himself, to describe the human condition and demonstrates the equality between Christ and the human person. This quite unusual understanding drew the attention of the Church authorities in his time, because it could be associated with the doctrines of heretics in the late Middle Ages who insisted on the perfect identity between Christ and the human person. In the end, Eckhart’s teaching including the understanding of the <b>sonship</b> <b>was</b> condemned by the papal bull In agro dominico (1329) together with his other teachings.

He worked towards mediating to them a new relationship with God, even {{to the point that they}} too could use [...] "Abba" [...] when addressing God in prayer. Yet, Jesus' consistent distinction between [...] "my" [...] Father and [...] "your" [...] Father showed that he was not inviting the disciples to share with him an identical relationship of <b>sonship.</b> He <b>was</b> apparently conscious of a qualitative distinction between his sonship and their <b>sonship</b> which <b>was</b> derived from and depended on his.

6000|$|The {{practice}} of adopting {{is not confined}} to childless couples. Others may find themselves in quite as unfortunate a predicament. A man may be the father of a large and thriving family and yet be as destitute patriarchally as if he had not a child to his name. His offspring may be of the wrong sex; they may all be girls. In this untoward event the father has something more on his hands than merely a houseful of daughters to dispose of. In addition to securing sons-in-law, he must, unless he would have his ancestral line become extinct, provide himself with a son. The simplest procedure in such a case is to combine relationships in a single individual, and the most self-evident person to select for the dual capacity is the husband of the eldest daughter. This is the course pursued. Some worthy young man is secured as spouse for the senior sister; he {{is at the same time}} formally taken in as a son by the family whose cognomen he assumes, and eventually becomes the head of the house. Strange to say, this vista of gradually unfolding honors does not seem to prove inviting. Perhaps the new-comer objects to marrying the whole family, a prejudice not without parallel elsewhere. Certainly the opportunity is not appreciated. Indeed, to [...] "go out as a son-in-law," [...] as the Japanese idiom hath it, is considered demeaning to the matrimonial domestic. Like other household help he wears too patently the badge of servitude. [...] "If you have three koku of rice to your name, don't do it," [...] is the advice of the local proverb--a proverb whose warning against marrying for money is the more suggestive for being launched in a land where marrying for love is beyond the pale of respectability. To barter one's name in this mercenary manner is looked upon as derogatory to one's self-respect, although, as we have seen, to part with it for any less direct remuneration is not attended with the slightest loss of personal prestige. As practically the unfortunate had none to lose in either event, it would seem to be a case of taking away from a man that which he hath not. So contumacious a thing is custom. It is indeed lucky that popular prejudice interposes some limit to this fictitious method of acquiring children. A trifling predilection for the real thing in <b>sonships</b> <b>is</b> absolutely vital, even to the continuance of the artificial variety. For if one generation ever went in exclusively for adoption, there would be no subsequent generation to adopt.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-standing {{debate on the}} Davidssohnfrage in the Gospel according to Mark (12 : 35 – 37). In contrast to the traditionsgeschichtliche paradigm set forth by Wrede (1907), it argues that Mark’s stance on Davidic <b>sonship</b> cannot <b>be</b> assessed properly by isolating the words “(Son of) David. ” Rather, the totality of Mark’s messiah language—what the narrative communicates about “Christ” (Χριστόϛ; Mark 1 : 1) —is relevant to how one assesses {{the issue of the}} Messiah’s ancestry. Justification for this paradigm shift is rooted in observations {{about the ways in which}} ancient authors communicate what they mean by the term “messiah. ” Careful attention to ancient discourse about “messiahs” reveals that the authors of these texts shared multiple conventions for communicating that “messiah” means “Davidic messiah,” because they shared an “encyclopedic competence” of the Jewish scriptures. This study situates Mark’s language about Christ within its particular socio-linguistic framework. Mark constructs his portrait of Christ via creative use of the Jewish scriptures developed through an unfolding narrative. The first half of the narrative depicts Christ as a charismatic “Davidic” Messiah, while the second half builds on this portrait, confirming the audience’s suspicion that Christ is indeed the descendent from the line of David promised within a certain strand of scriptural traditions. When the Davidssohnfrage is approached from within this narrative framework, it becomes highly implausible that the purpose of the question is to elicit a rejection of Davidic sonship. Rather, since Mark has already clearly communicated that Christ is David’s son, the Davidssohnfrage pressures the audience to integrate Davidic sonship with what Ps 110 implies about the Christ. In this respect, Mark’s deployment of the Davidssohnfrage is no different than Matthew’s or Luke’s...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to define}} the title 2 ̆ 2 Son of God 2 ̆ 2 as applied to Jesus Christ in the Synoptic Gospels. In the Old Testament the term 2 ̆ 2 son of God 2 ̆ 2 was variously applied to angels, Israel, Israelites, Davidic kings, and possibly to the Messiah. In intertestamental Judaism the term was used mainly with reference to Israel and its righteous people, and is never specifically applied to the Messiah. In Hellenistic literature the title was sometimes given to pagan kings, emperors, and certain heroes. None of these occurrences can form the background for the Synoptic use of the title. In the Synoptic Gospels Jesus uses only two titles of Himself: Son and Son of Man. With the title 2 ̆ 2 Son 2 ̆ 2 Jesus related Himself closely to God the Father in a unique and exclusive sense, particularly in such passages as Matthew 11 : 27 and Mark 12 : 6. Jesus always addresses God in prayer as 2 ̆ 2 Abba, 2 ̆ 2 a term never addressed to God by contemporary Palestinian Jews. At His trial Jesus publicly and clearly accepts the full title 2 ̆ 2 Son of God 2 ̆ 2 for Himself while claiming exclusive association with God, highlighted by a resulting charge of blasphemy. Matthew, Mark, and Luke each emphasize Jesus 2 ̆ 7 s sonship as divinity rather than simple messiahship. Normally beings with supernatural insight designate Jesus as the Son of God: Gabriel, Satan, demons, Peter, and the heavenly voice at His baptism and Transfiguration. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 sonship requires a supernatural revelation and announcement. Even a pagan Roman centurion confesses Jesus 2 ̆ 7 sonship through the divine revelation of the cross. The key revelation occurs at Jesus 2 ̆ 7 baptism, where {{the perspective of the}} Father is given. In virtually every reference to Jesus 2 ̆ 7 <b>sonship,</b> it <b>is</b> either His supernatural origin, His unique relationship to the Father, or His claim to equality with God that is highlighted. The title may thus be defined as expressing that unique attribute of Jesus Christ by which He exclusively and ontologically shares the divine nature and character of His heavenly Father, revealing God to man as no other can do, and carrying out perfectly God 2 ̆ 7 s purposes as Messiah, Servant, and eternal Sovereign...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} long debates in {{academic}} circles {{as to what}} constitutes the “heart” of Pauline theology. The traditional view, according to Fee (1994 : 11), is the one fostered by the Reformers and perpetuated by generations of Protestants, that “justification by faith” {{is the key to}} Paul’s theology. This view emphasises Christ’s historical act of redemption and its appropriation by the believer through faith. The inadequacy of such a view should be apparent to anyone carefully reading Paul’s letters. Not only does it focus on one metaphor of salvation to the exclusion of others, but, such a focus fails to throw the net broadly enough to capture all of Paul’s theological concerns. It would therefore, seem impossible to understand Pauline theology, without firstly beginning with salvation in Christ, and further to this, with eschatology and the Holy Spirit as the essential framework. It is within this framework that the process of sonship and adoption as related to the new covenant are unveiled to the believer. Without denying the presence of other determining factors, Christology, and eschatology especially, shape the framework of Paul’s pneumatology. One cannot doubt that the death and resurrection of Christ, in their eschatological significance, control Paul’s teaching on the work of the Spirit within the lives of believers. It could be said that the Spirit stands near the centre of things for Paul, as part of the fundamental core of his understanding of the Gospel. It is within this theological framework of the Spirit that Paul expresses his key ideas concerning the new covenant and sonship. One might say then, that membership in God’s family, is defined in terms of the Spirit. “You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, assuming that the Spirit of God does indeed dwell in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person does not belong to Him” (Rom 8 : 9). One could say that in eschatological terms, the Spirit of God {{is the beginning of the}} process of salvation, which will culminate in the believer taking possession of his inheritance in the future age. It could be stated as a function of the Spirit in the believer’s present that is only meaningful in relation to the future. Not only does the indwelling Spirit serve as the divine pledge of a future bodily resurrection, but guarantees it. To give the reader further ideas as to what drives this thesis, the following urgencies are spelt out: • Crucial to the experience of the Spirit, was the early Church’s self-understanding as “thoroughly eschatological” in the “already/not yet” sense. • At the heart of this new understanding was their perception of themselves as the newly constituted people of God. The goal of salvation in Christ, the core of Pauline theology, was that God should create “a people for his name”. • Although persons’ individually become members of the family of God, the goal is not to simply prepare them for heaven, but to create a people, who by the power of the Spirit, live out the life of the future (the life of God Himself) in this present age. One final point needs to be clarified before one embarks on the enterprise of writing a theology of Paul as it relates to the title of this thesis. In the movement and dialogue of Paul’s theologising, his letter to the Romans is a relatively fixed feature (Dunn, 1998 : 25). It was written to a Church that was not his own founding. It was written at the end of a major phase of Paul’s missionary work (Rom 15 : 18 - 24), which included most of the other undisputed letters. It was written under probably the most congenial circumstances of his mission, with time for careful reflection and composition and, above all, it was clearly intended to set out and defend his own mature understanding of the Gospel (Rom 1 : 16 - 17) as he had thus far proclaimed it. In short, Romans is still far removed from a dogmatic or systematic treatise on theology, but it nevertheless is the most sustained and reflective statement of Paul’s theology by Paul himself. Romans provides Christians with an example of the way Paul himself chose to order the sequence of themes in his theology. If one wishes to grasp at (as attempted in this thesis) and dialogue with the mature theology of Paul, one cannot do better than to take Romans as a kind of template on which to construct one’s own statement of Paul’s theology. A theology of Paul that sets out to describe and discuss the Holy Spirit and <b>sonship,</b> <b>is</b> surely headed in the right direction, if one constantly references Romans as prompter and plumb-line throughout.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{so-called}} divinity of Jesus Christ, an important issue in face of the risen importance of dialogue between christians en muslims, en {{also because of the}} diffuse images of divinity in western society. In that context the widespread prejudice that Jesus’ divinity is an invention of some Greekminded theologians needs constant revision. There are several possibilities to enquire the meaning of Jesus’ divinity’. I choose the following question as leading for my investigation: how to think about the relationship between the Eternal Son and the historical Jesus. That question suits to the theology of two theologians I analyse: Ulrich Dalferth (born in 1948) and Wolfhart Pannenberg (born in 1928). And it also exemplifies the much felt clash between tradition and modernity, between the Christ of dogma and the human being Jesus of Nazareth as presented by modern exegesis. After determining a central question, I create a path of questions to reach an answer. First, as an introduction, I ask for the interpretation Dalferth en Pannenberg give of the christological dogma of the church. The second question is what explanation Dalferth en Pannenberg give to the confession that Jesus is ‘Son of God’. The third question is what they think about the notion of the ‘eternal Son’, what they say about the subjectivity and divinity of the Son as a person of the trinity. My fourth question is pointed at the meaning they give to ‘incarnation’ (which in traditional christology is the connection between Jesus and the eternal Son). Fifth question is whether they ultimately speak about one or about two subjects: are Jesus Christ and the Eternal Son one and the same? Sixth and last step is the now following answer to the central question. Dalferth en Pannenberg both give an extensive re-examination of the christological dogma, and the historical christology before and after the dogma. The have a different vision on the key problems concerning the dogma. Dalferth criticizes the focus on Jesus, and alleges that the ‘divine nature’ must point to God who acts in en through Jesus. For Pannenberg, the focus on Jesus is all right, but he thinks the relationship between God and man in Jesus’ person has not been thought well in classical christology. The fundamental problem for him is the connection between incarnation and the birth of Jesus, that led to the presupposition that the relationship between God and man in Jesus is constituted independent of his concrete life as a human being. Dalferth en Pannenberg both assert that the Jesus’ resurrection has fundamental importance for his being the Son of God, though for different reasons. Dalferth states Jesus’ cross en resurrection have their ultimate meaning in their revealing of Gods acting. Through cross en resurrection Gods identifies with Jesus’ proclamation, and also gives an ultimate interpretation of it: He is love. Even in death He did not leave Jesus, and in the resurrection He lets Jesus participate in his own divine life. So God identifies himself for eternity through this living Jesus. Dalferths analysis of the development of the christological image ‘Son of God’ in the New Testament is meant to show that this development is an unfolding of the meaning of this action of God through Jesus’ cross en resurrection. In Dalferths conception it is in this way implied that Jesus’ <b>Sonship</b> <b>is</b> a relationship between Jesus and God. That’s also a fundamental idea in Pannenberg’s christology, be it in a different way. Dalferth gives a strong accent on Gods initiative in this relationship, whereas Pannenberg has a greater place for the mutuality in the relationship between God and Jesus. This difference is grounded in a different view on the Sonship of Jesus: in Pannenberg’s view Jesus is the Son of God because he fulfils the destiny of man. In distinguishing himself from God, as a creature from the Creator, Jesus’ life as a human life can be totally connected to the life of God. This leads to our following question: the meaning of ‘trinity’, especially the meaning of the Son for Gods identity. For Pannenberg the total connection of Jesus’ human life with God has its definitive base in the resurrection. And the resurrection also has its significance for Gods own life: through resurrecting Jesus from the dead He explains that the relation of Sonship belongs to his eternal identity. This means the Son also precedes the historical life of Jesus, and we must speak about the eternal Son of God. For Dalferth the <b>Sonship</b> of <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> also decisive for God’s identity, but in another way. He says God identifies with the person of Jesus in that He binds his own being to this person to reveal his essence. This essence is to be described as creative love, which is near even into death. This love also implies that God’s relationship to Jesus and to all other creatures has its base in God’s essence, but Gods essence cannot be interpreted as divine persons in mutual relationships (as Pannenberg does). The notion of pre-existence does say something about the soteriological meaning of God’s acting in en through Jesus Christ. The notion of incarnation also has a secondary place in Dalferths theological conception. It is an image that explains some of the implications of Jesus’ resurrection, namely the integration of his life in God’s life. Dalferth asserts this points to God giving room to creation in his own uncreated life, ands so reveals the great nearness of God to our reality. For Pannenberg incarnation is about a person of God’s being, the eternal Son, assuming human life. He asserts that the totality of Jesus’ life and person is the incarnation of the eternal Son. Jesus’ human person and life is the medium for the appearance of the eternal Son in human history. Next I come to my fifth question, namely the relationship of Jesus as a subject to God (the Son) as a subject. Dalferth stresses that Jesus’ subjectivity is grounded in God’s activity, and has an important role in that greater context. Through Jesus’ proclamation we can understand the meaning of the cross and the resurrection, and trough Jesus’ cross en resurrection God gives a definitive revelation of his being. The activity of the resurrected Jesus is a not very pronounced element in Dalferth’s theology, all stress is on God’s activity. Pannenberg also gives the human being Jesus {{an important role in the}} acting of God. But he sees in that activity of Jesus the acting of an incarnated divine subject: the eternal Son. It seems the eternal Son is a greater subject than Jesus, according to Pannenberg. This especially comes true in his thoughts about Jesus’ suffering, when he speaks about the eternal Son as acting while Jesus is passive. Having answered the preceding questions, an answer to the central question can be formulated. It turns out that Dalferth doesn’t speak about an eternal divine Son, but is giving the person of Jesus Christ a crucial place in God’s identity. This fundamental relationship between God en the person of Jesus is characterized by the words ‘identification’ and ‘incorporation’. By raising Jesus from the dead, God identifies with Jesus’ proclamation, and so identifies himself as love. God binds his own identity to the most extreme situation of mankind, namely the Godforsaken death. And he ‘incorporates’ Jesus’ life in his own divine life, and through Jesus reveals that He is near to all reality. Pannenberg sees an indirect identity between the eternal Son and Jesus. In the concrete historical relationship between Jesus and God the Father we learn to know that Jesus’ history and person is the medium of appearance in human history for the eternal Son. After the analysis and comparision of Dalferth and Pannenberg, I try to develop my own view. In many points I mainly agree with Pannenberg. Important points of agreement are: thinking the <b>Sonship</b> of <b>Jesus</b> as a mutual relationship between Jesus and the Father, and the conclusion the Sonship must belong to the eternal identity of God, so that there must be spoken of different persons in God. This makes it possible to speak about the incarnation of the eternal Son in the history and person of Jesus. I disagree with Pannenberg the way he thinks the incarnation. I claim the incarnation can be defended better when the relationship between Father and Son is understood without general qualifications, except that it is a relationship of love, whereby the goal is focussed at the Kingdom of God. Pannenberg gives to much qualifications to both the man Jesus and the eternal Son: the man Jesus has to fulfil the general structure of a human being, the eternal Son is bound to the infinity of God. When the only condition for the <b>Sonship,</b> both of <b>Jesus</b> and of the eternal Son, is the loving relationship to and from God the Father, then the unity of Jesus and the eternal Son can be thought more fully. Which attributes Jesus has, as ‘God’ or as ‘man’, can’t be said in abstraction from the concrete relationship between Son and Father as told in the gospels. In the end, I come to the proposal that it’s hardly possible to discern what belongs to Jesus ‘divine nature’ and what to his ‘human nature’. The four qualifications whereby Chalcedon speaks about the relationship between divine and human nature are pointing to an indescribable fact: that God (the Son) became a human being. So I think Jesus is divine, because He is one of the subjects of the eternal divine life. This doesn’t mean the ‘divine nature’ is something of Jesus own person, it exists in his relationship to the Father through the Spirit. In this way I avoid the classical christological trap Dalferth rightly discerns, of focussing too much on Jesus on his own. Simultaneously I claim Dalferths position can be strengthened when he would speak about personal relationships in the being of God. When this is strictly bound to Jesus’ person, and is soberly described, then an implausible mythological and metaphysical figure doesn’t have to appear on the scene...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} give an {{exposition}} {{of the development of}} theology at the Stellenbosch Kweekskool from 1859 until 1919, a period that coincided with the formative years of Afrikaner nationalism. John Murray (1826 - 1882) was nurtured in evangelical Calvinism but received his theological training in 'moderate' Utrecht. As Calvinist he emphasized salvation by grace and Christian obedience, as evangelical, union with Christ, and as kenoticist he emphasized the relevance of the humanity of Christ. N. J. Hofmeyr (1827 - 1909) was converted under an evangelical Lutheran and received his training in Utrecht, in the heyday of Dutch ethical and German mediating theology. He was fascinated by the historical Jesus. In his view, the 'religion of Jesus' was not the moralistic one imagined by the modernists, but an experience of sonship, continually challenged by severe temptations. The central theme of his theology was the huiothesia, the <b>sonship</b> of <b>Jesus</b> being the prototype of our <b>sonship.</b> As he <b>was</b> the spiritual father of many generations of Stellenbosch students, his Christocentric emphasis and his doctrine of huiothesia {{played an important role in}} the development of NGK spirituality. Other themes in Hofmeyr's theology bore the marks of mediating theology: The idea that the conscience is the voice of God, the 'natural' compatibility between the human and the divine, the importance of experience in the theological enterprise and the idea that grace must accommodate itself to nature. J. I. Marais (1848 - 1919) and P. J. G. de Vos (1842 - 1931), who received part of their training in Scotland, were more conservative in theology than Hofmeyr. By the turn of the century De Vos has fully accepted scholastic Calvinism and premillenniaIism; Marais accepted premillennialism around 1914. The experiences of the Anglo-Boer War precipitated the close relationship between the Afrikaner and the NGK, and the lack of a strong doctrine of the church in Stellenbosch theology added to the blurring of distinctions between church and people. The national church of the Scots and Dutch traditions became the volkskerk of the Afrikaner. Important biblical dimensions of Murray and Hofmeyr's theology were neglected after Hofmeyr's death. The conviction that God revealed himself completely in the human Christ was weakened by fundamentalism and the tendency to see God's will in the history of the volk. Their eschatology - which expected great success for the gospel - was replaced by premillennialism, which expected only limited success for missions before the parousia. Hofmeyr's social gospel, which was applied to the problem of the 'poor whites', was gradually replaced by a negative view of the social relevance of the gospel, especially in racial matters. This gradual change of theological direction involved a growing sympathy with fundamentalism and Kuyperianism, but did not consist in a full revival of reformation theolog...|$|R

Temeljeći svoj govor na evanđeoskim izvješćima, iznosi argumente u prilog tvrdnji da razna događanja vezana uz Isusa neizravno govore o njegovu božanskom identitetu i sinovstvu. Tako, analiziranjem Isusova propovijedanja i poučavanja, uspoređivanjem Isusa sa starozavjetnim prorocima, preko njegova ponašanja prema Zakonu, hramu i nekim grupama ljudi, odnosno prema »javnim grešnicima«, upućuje na neke događaje i na njegove izričaje koji implicitno govore o Isusovu božanstvu. Jednako tako, Isusov odnos prema Bogu, kojega on naziva Abba, te neki njegovi »ja« - izričaji također aludiraju na njegovo božansko sinovstvo. Uzimajući sve to u obzir, dolazi se do zaključka da - iako Kristov pashalni događaj, odnosno njegovo uskrsnuće jesu i ostaju glavni temelji vjere koji konačno otkrivaju osobu Isusa Krista - i predpashalna događanja imaju veliku važnost za kristološko razmišljanje, jer također otkrivaju - implicitno — i Isusov božanski identitet. The {{author of}} this article {{examines}} the theme of implicit (indirect) Christology. Basing his presentation on Gospel accounts, he delivers his arguments in favour of the various events associated with the Jesus of Nazareth which indirectly speak of his divine identity and sonship. To begin with, the article examines the most common aspect of the preresurrected Christ; his preaching and teaching. Even though it seemed to many that Jesus was one of many iterant preachers and teachers, or that he was just another prophet, the content, method and originality of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 words and expressions indirectly lead to a conclusion of his divinity. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 behaviour towards Jewish Law, the temple and certain segments of the population, in others words, the »public sinners«, also implicitly awakens faith of him as the Son of God. Namely, with many of his expressions and gestures Jesus gives the impression that he is »above« the Law and temple, or that he brings and declares a new law with which he desires to lead all people to God. Equally so, his behaviour towards people, especially towards the weak and the sinful to whom he forgives sin, indirectly supports that he is God, in other words, the Son of God who has »authority tο forgive sins» (Mk 2 : 10). Therefore, Jesus 2 ̆ 7 behaviour towards fundamental Jewish institutions and his call for conversion and his forgiveness of sins prior to the Paschal event represents a solid Christological foundation on which faith in Jesus Christ is built. The same applies of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 relationship towards God, whom he calls Abba, in a way that no one of the Jewish faithful would have called him. That expression, which translated means Dad, reveals an original and intimate (»family«) relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. It reveals Jesus 2 ̆ 7 divine sonship and his consciousness of that <b>sonship.</b> Also included <b>are</b> some of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 »I« sayings (»I tell you«, »I command you«, »I am [...] . «) which indirectly leads to the conclusion that divine authority is expressed by the one who uses it. In other words, it recalls the revelation of the names of Yahweh from the Old Testament (cf. Ex 3 : 14; Jn 8 : 12, 57 - 58). The conclusion is that even though Christ 2 ̆ 7 s Paschal event and his Resurrection are and remain the principle foundations of faith, which eventually reveal the person of Jesus Christ, the pre-Paschal events have a great importance for Christological reflection, for they also implicitly reveal Jesus 2 ̆ 7 divine identity...|$|R
