60|$|And issuing <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> {{and taking}} {{me by the}} arm like an old acquaintance, he {{led me to the}} bar of the hotel.|$|E
60|$|An {{ordinary}} breech-loading, {{double-barrelled gun}} was produced <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and after some bargaining a trade {{was made on}} the basis of eight dollars for the weapon and sixty cartridges.|$|E
60|$|<b>From</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bare <b>counter</b> {{he went on}} {{smiling at}} us, his head held between his hands. Air. Air. But whether that meant a long or a short absence it was {{difficult}} to say. The night was very close, certainly.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{mentioned}} his name, and his having promised to call, on the solicitation of Mr Chivery. About something relating to Miss Dorrit, he believed. Mrs Chivery at once laid aside her work, rose up <b>from</b> her seat <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and deploringly shook her head.|$|R
5000|$|Drucker's is {{an old-fashioned}} small town general store, the kind where the grocer {{retrieves}} many of <b>the</b> items <b>from</b> shelves <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Sam Drucker sells food and household goods, {{and at times}} sells such oddities as nail polish that's also a bathtub sealant and dehydrated chickens: [...] "Just add water and bones, and let it sit for a couple hours." [...] Customers are allowed to shop on credit, although Drucker frequently (and exasperatedly) reminds them of their outstanding bills. Drucker's Store {{is the closest thing}} Hooterville has to a social club. The locals often come in to chit-chat, or to play checkers, or to rant and rave about community issues. And, on election day, they cast their votes at Drucker's. Exterior shots of the store show a sign that says [...] "Sam Drucker's General Store", but everyone (including Sam Drucker) mostly calls the store either [...] "Drucker's Store" [...] or just [...] "Drucker's".|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} touched {{his hat and}} obeyed. A few yards down the street Pamela found her destination, and entered a gloomy little shop. A slatternly woman looked at her curiously <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
60|$|So Matt walked <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> {{toward the}} door, {{but before he}} could reach it one of the men saw him and spoke to his companion, and both hurried up the street and around the nearest corner.|$|E
60|$|The {{senior partner}} of the firm needed no second call for assistance. Without {{hesitation}} he flung the overcoat on a packing case, and rushing up to Matt's assailant, caught him by the collar and dragged him <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of retailing, all {{products}} generally were fetched by an assistant <b>from</b> shelves <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> merchant's <b>counter</b> while customers waited in front of <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> and indicated <b>the</b> items they wanted. Also, most foods and merchandise did not come in individually wrapped consumer-sized packages, so an assistant had to measure out and wrap the precise amount desired by the consumer. This also offered opportunities for social interaction: many regarded this style of shopping as [...] "a social occasion" [...] and would often [...] "pause for conversations with the staff or other customers." [...] These practices were by nature very labor-intensive and therefore also quite expensive. The shopping process was slow, as the number of customers who could be attended to at one time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store.|$|R
60|$|From {{this bed}} Captain Cuttle daily rose thenceforth, and clapped on his glazed hat {{at six o'clock}} in the morning, with the solitary air of Crusoe {{finishing}} his toilet with his goat-skin cap; and although his fears of a visitation from the savage tribe, MacStinger, were somewhat cooled, as similar apprehensions {{on the part of}} that lone mariner used to be by the lapse of a long interval without any symptoms of the cannibals, he still observed a regular routine of defensive operations, and never encountered a bonnet without previous survey from his castle of retreat. In the meantime (during which he received no call from Mr Toots, who wrote to say he was out of town) his own voice began to have a strange sound in his ears; and he acquired such habits of profound meditation from much polishing and stowing away of the stock, and <b>from</b> much sitting <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> reading, or looking out of window, that the red rim made on his forehead by the hard glazed hat, sometimes ached again with excess of reflection.|$|R
6000|$|The {{barrier that}} divided the little post-and-telegraph-office {{from the grocery}} was a frail {{structure}} of wood and wire; but the social, the professional separation was a gulf that fortune, by a stroke quite remarkable, had spared her the necessity of contributing at all publicly to bridge. When Mr. Cocker's young men stepped over <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> other <b>counter</b> to change a five-pound note--and Mr. Cocker's situation, with {{the cream of the}} [...] "Court Guide" [...] and the dearest furnished apartments, Simpkin's, Ladle's, Thrupp's, just round the corner, was so select that his place was quite pervaded by the crisp rustle of these emblems--she pushed out the sovereigns as if the applicant were no more to her than one of the momentary, the practically featureless, appearances in the great procession; and this perhaps all the more from the very fact of the connexion (only recognised outside indeed) to which she had lent herself with ridiculous inconsequence. She recognised the others the less because she had at last so unreservedly, so irredeemably, recognised Mr. Mudge. However that might be, she was a little ashamed of having to admit to herself that Mr. Mudge's removal to a higher sphere--to a more commanding position, that is, though to a much lower neighbourhood--would have been described still better as a luxury than as the mere simplification, the corrected awkwardness, that she contented herself with calling it. He had at any rate ceased to be all day long in her eyes, and this left something a little fresh for them to rest on of a Sunday. During the three months of his happy survival at Cocker's after her consent to their engagement she had often asked herself what it was marriage would be able to add to a familiarity that seemed already to have scraped the platter so clean. Opposite there, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> of which his superior stature, his whiter apron, his more clustering curls and more present, too present, h's had been {{for a couple of years}} the principal ornament, he had moved to and fro before her as on the small sanded floor of their contracted future. She was conscious now of the improvement of not having to take her present and her future at once. They were about as much as she could manage when taken separate.|$|R
60|$|Instead of replying, Matt {{tried to}} push the man out <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> The young {{auctioneer}} thought {{that if he could}} get him out near the door he would then be able to summon assistance and have the tipsy individual taken away.|$|E
6000|$|The kind-faced {{young man}} brought <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> a {{beautiful}} brochure illustrated {{with photographs of}} Phoebus Apollo in what were described as [...] "American Beauty Garments--neat, natty, nobby, new." [...] The center pages faithfully catalogued the ties, shirts, cuff-links, spats, boots, hats, to wear with evening clothes, morning clothes, riding clothes, tennis costumes, polite mourning.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{me a good}} turn," [...] he said, [...] "and you're a man. You've the pluck--that's what I like. You knew nothing, {{you were}} as green and ignorant {{as a young man}} <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> of a country shop, but, my God! you'd got the right stuff, and I meant getting even with you if I could. You'll leave here with me to-morrow, and in three weeks we sail." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bernstein {{learned how}} to take {{pictures}} from a friend, Benny Friedman, in exchange for teaching him {{how to play the}} harmonica. It did not take Bernstein long to join the Brooklyn Camera Club, his first interaction with others with his interest in photography. However, he found their approach to photography far [...] "too pedagogical." [...] He sought out Sid Grossman and the Photo League in 1940. “Sid helped me find out exactly what sort of work I wanted to do.” Even more than at the Brooklyn Camera Club, Bernstein had the opportunity to meet other, like-minded photographers who gravitated to their own neighborhoods, the people and places they knew best, to find their subject matter. This approach served him well. As far as he was concerned, “...there's as much variety in my own back yard as there is in a thousand miles of travel.” For the next sixty years, Lou Bernstein continued to photograph in a few selected locations, all within the confines of New York City, returning to them time after time, in search of something better than he had done before. Bernstein maintained his relationship with the Photo League, and in particular with Sid Grossman over the years. Even after Grossman resigned from the League, Bernstein continued to attend classes in his teacher's home.Unwilling to turn “professional,” i.e., make his living from paid assignments, yet feeling the need to become more involved in the photographic community, Bernstein began working in the darkroom department at Peerless Camera, then one of the largest photographic supply emporiums in NYC. [...] He worked there from 1945 to 1958 and later at Willoughby's (when the two competitive store merged) until his retirement in 1973. <b>From</b> his perch <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> Bernstein got to meet hundreds of photographers, from rank beginners to recognized masters like Edward Steichen, W. Eugene Smith, and Ernst Haas. His position gave him the opportunity to keep abreast of the latest technical developments and to pass on what he had learned. Customers came to him for service and advise, from what to buy to where to find a job in a photo lab. Without knowing it, Bernstein was laying the groundwork for his later career as a teacher and critic.|$|R

6000|$|The girl {{turned the}} book down {{to keep the}} place; then she took the note, and opened a small drawer, in which she fumbled for some moments. Closing the drawer, she {{rose to her feet}} and waved the note over the curtain to her right. [...] "Haven't any change, eh?" [...] said the man, coming <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and putting on his hat. [...] "As the boy's not here, I'll step out and get it." ...|$|E
60|$|She stopped, flushing. There {{were moments}} when she hated Cynthia. These {{occurred}} {{for the most}} part when the latter, as now, stirred her to an exhibition of honest feeling which she looked on as rather unbecoming. Mrs Ford had spent twenty years trying to forget that her husband had married her <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> of a general store in an Illinois village, and these lapses into the uncultivated genuineness of her girlhood made her uncomfortable.|$|E
60|$|Thus in {{the late}} wars between England and France, how was our army full of {{excellent}} officers, who went from the shop, and <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> into the camp, and who distinguished themselves there by their merit and gallant behaviour. And several such came to command regiments, and even to be general officers, and to gain as much reputation in the service as any; as Colonel Pierce, Wood, Richards, and several others that might be named.|$|E

60|$|The young man's {{blood was}} stirred. Mademoiselle Violet stood {{to him for}} the whole {{wonderful}} world of romance, into which he had peered dimly <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> of an Islington emporium. Her low voice--so strange to his ears after the shrill chatter of the young ladies of his acquaintance--the mystery of her coming and going, all went to give color to the single dream of his unimaginative life. Apart from her, he was a somewhat vulgar, entirely commonplace young man, of saving habits, and with some aptitude for business, in a small way. He had been {{well on his way}} to becoming a small but successful shopkeeper, thereby realizing the only ideals which had yet presented themselves to him, when Madame Violet had unconsciously intervened. Of what might become of him now he had no clear conception of himself.|$|E
60|$|Here {{the third}} figure, {{which had been}} leaning listlessly against the shelves, putting aside {{the arm of a}} swaying {{overcoat}} that seemed to be emptily embracing him, walked slowly <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> to the door, examined its fastenings, and gazed at the prospect. He was the owner of the store, and the view was a familiar one,--a long stretch of treeless waste before him meeting an equal stretch of dreary sky above, and night hovering somewhere between the two. This was indicated by splashes of darker shadow as if washed in with india ink, and a lighter low-lying streak {{that might have been the}} horizon, but was not. To the right, on a line with the front door of the store, were several scattered, widely dispersed objects, that, although vague in outline, were rigid enough in angles to suggest sheds or barns, but certainly not trees.|$|E

There he sat--this tall, fair chap {{who had been in the}} place so long--with his big pocket-book on the table in front of him, and even from where I was I could see that there was a great pile of bank-notes sticking out from it. All of a sudden he looks up and sees Mr. Morrison a-watching him and me <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Back he whisks the pocket-book into his pocket, calls me for my bill, gives me two mouldy pennies for a tip, buttons up his coat and walks out." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{scene was}} one {{which was not}} creditable to the shop of English tradesmen in the nineteenth century. The young men and girls had come round <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> but they {{made no attempt to}} {{separate}} the combatants. Mr. Jones was not loved among them, and the chance of war seemed to run very much in favour of the lady. One discreet youth had gone out in quest of a policeman, but he was not successful in his search till he had walked half a mile from the door. Mr. Jones was at last nearly smothered in the encounter, for the great weight and ample drapery of Mrs. Morony were beginning to tell upon him. When she got his back against the counter, it was as though a feather bed was upon him. In the meantime the unfortunate mantle had fared badly between them, and was now not worth the purchase-money which, but ten minutes since, had been so eagerly tendered for it.|$|E
6000|$|... 109. And {{it is very}} {{necessary}} that we should distinguish this essentially Cockney literature, developed only in the London suburbs, and feeding the demand of the rows of similar brick houses, which branch in devouring cancer round every manufacturing town,--from the really romantic literature of France. Georges Sand is often immoral; but she is always beautiful, and in the characteristic novel I have named, [...] "Le Péché de Mons. Antoine," [...] the five principal characters, the old Cavalier Marquis,--the Carpenter,--M. de Chateaubrun,--Gilberte,--and the really passionate and generous lover, are all as heroic and radiantly ideal as Scott's Colonel Mannering, Catherine Seyton, and Roland Graeme; while the landscape is rich and true with the emotion of years of life passed in glens of Norman granite and beside bays of Italian sea. But in the English Cockney school, which consummates itself in George Eliot, the personages are picked up <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> {{and out of the}} gutter; and the landscape, by excursion train to Gravesend, with return ticket for the City-road.|$|E

[...] "High politics becomes too much like a game of chess, hedged all around with etiquette and precedent. It's human life we want to save, Julian. People don't stop to realise the horrible tragedy of even one man's death--one man with his little circle of relatives and friends. In the game of war one forgets. Human beings--men from the toiler's bench, the carpenter's bench, <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> from the land, from the mine--don khaki, become soldiers, and there seems something different about them. So many human lives gone every day; just soldiers, just the toll we have to pay for a slight advance or a costly retreat. And, my God, every one of them, underneath their khaki, is a human being! The politicians don't grasp it, Julian. That's our justification. The day that armistice is signed, several hundred lives at least--perhaps, thousands--will be saved; for several hundred women the sun will continue to shine. Parents, sweethearts, children--all of them--think what they will be spared!" ...|$|E
