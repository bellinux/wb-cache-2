The spatialization of reproduced audio is highly dependent on the recording technique, the rendering method, and the loudspeaker configuration.

In this paper, we investigate the issues of spatialization techniques for object-based audio production and introduce the Spatial Audio Design Spaces framework (SpADS), which describes the spatial manipulation of object-based audio.

30|$|However, {{rather than}} solely focus upon the reverberant BSS problem, this study {{extended}} {{it to be}} inclusive of an additional source of observational error: environmental noise, which was modeled as spatially diffuse noise {{by a number of}} independent sources. Recordings in real-world conditions were also considered, with the publicly available benchmark data of the international SiSEC 2010 included in evaluations. It was proposed that due to the documented robustness of the FCM in mask estimation for reverberant BSS, the extension to the noisy reverberant case would demonstrate similar abilities. Detailed evaluations confirmed this hypothesis, with noteworthy separation performance using a range of performance metrics in both simulated and real-world conditions reported. A decline in performance was noted when real-world evaluations were considered, and this is attributed to the change in sensor and <b>speaker</b> <b>configuration</b> as well as the undesired effects of spatial aliasing.|$|R

5000|$|The early {{models were}} called [...] "Brownface" [...] {{because of the}} dark brown color used on the control panel.

The output was 50 watts at 8 ohm into a single 12 inch speaker, with a [...] "Tone Ring" [...] baffle in the speaker cabinet. In early 1961, model 6G6-A was introduced with a solid state rectifier replacing the GZ34, and two 12 inch speakers with a conventional baffle in a slightly larger cabinet (wired in parallel) with a 4 ohm output. In 1962, model 6G6-B was introduced, which incorporated circuit changes but used the same <b>speaker</b> <b>configuration.</b> In 1963 smooth Blonde Tolex covering was used instead of the early rough texture cover, and a light tan grill cloth.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{configurations}} of guitar amplifiers: combination ("combo") amplifiers, which include an amplifier {{and one or}} more speakers in a wooden cabinet, and the standalone amplifier (often called a [...] "head" [...] or [...] "amp head"), which does not include a speaker, but passes the amplified signal via a speaker cable {{to one or more}} external speaker cabinets.

5000|$|CMSS-3D Virtual (Stereo Xpand): When the Creative Control Panel {{is set to}} 2/2.1 or 4/4.1 speakers, {{this setting}} creates virtual 3D {{positional}} audio similar to CMSS-3DHeadphone.

Note that this is not available (including MacroFX and ElevationFilter) when using 5.1 or more speakers. In these cases, 3D audio sources are mapped to speakers by manipulating the relative volume levels for the different speaker positions. Hardware accelerated 3D-audio is still handled as positional audio but translated using the more complex binaural algorithms. Note that more recent driver versions force the synchronisation between Windows <b>Speakers</b> <b>configuration</b> and the X-Fi control panel when this was previously optional so unlike CMSS-3D Headphone some multi-channel applications will not make use of the technology.|$|R

The AC30/4 also carried over the AC15's preamplifier circuit, which included the EF86 pentode in its [...] "Normal" [...] channel. Vox initially offered a 1×12" [...] version but subsequently introduced the 2×12" [...] AC30 Twin, which solved the volume problem at larger venues.

5000|$|Typical <b>speaker</b> <b>configurations</b> {{are eight}} spaced on a circle by 45&deg; (oriented with first speaker 0&deg; or at 22.5&deg;), or the {{vertices}} of a cube {{to create a}} double quadraphonic set-up with elevation [...] In reference to his own work, Karlheinz Stockhausen made a distinction between these two forms, reserving the term [...] "octophonic" [...] for a cube configuration, as found in his Oktophonie and the electronic music for scene 2 and the Farewell of Mittwoch aus Licht, and using the expression [...] "eight-channel sound" [...] for the circular arrangement, as used in Sirius, Unsichtbare Chöre, or Hours 13 to 21 of the Klang cycle ( [...] ; [...] ).

40|$|The {{trend in}} media {{consumption}} towards streaming and portability offers new {{challenges and opportunities}} for signal processing in audio and acoustics. The most significant embodiment of this trend is that most music consumption now happens on-the-go which has recently led to an explosion in headphone sales and small portable speakers. In particular, premium headphones offer a gateway for a younger generation to experience high quality sound. Additionally, through technologies incorporating head-related transfer functions headphones can also offer unique new experiences in gaming, augmented reality, and surround sound listening. Home audio has also seen a transition to smaller sound systems {{in the form of}} sound bars. This <b>speaker</b> <b>configuration</b> offers many exciting challenges for surround sound reproduction which has traditionally used five speakers surrounding the listener. Furthermore, modern home entertainment systems offer more than just content delivery; users now expect wireless and connected smart devices with video conferencing, gaming, and other interactive capabilities.

5000|$|The {{first task}} was to create the {{illusion}} of sound [...] "moving" [...] across neighboring speakers. It was found that by placing two speakers roughly 20 feet apart it was possible to produce a [...] "moving" [...] sound, but the effect could not be achieved through simple volume control. The problem was solved with a three-circuit differential junction network named the [...] "pan pot" [...] (panoramic potentiometer), that allowed sound to progressively travel using constant fades with a left, center and right <b>speaker</b> <b>configuration.</b> The second issue was dynamic range, the difference in volume between the loudest and quietest sounds. The dynamic range of typical film soundtracks at the time was limited to a poor signal-to-noise ratio of about 40 dB. This was tackled by increasing the volume during loud passages and reducing it during quiet ones, to which the dynamic range would increase. A tone-operated gain adjusting device, or [...] "Togad," [...] was built that varied the volume of the replayed sound under the control of a tone of varying amplitude. This device was the predecessor of the automated mix-down systems found in modern recording studios.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{variations}} in tolex and grill cloth color, {{the design of the}} Concert Amp as it appeared in the first phase (1960s) was largely consistent. The <b>speaker</b> <b>configuration</b> remained 4-10" [...] speakers usually made by either Jensen or Oxford (for the earlier models) as opposed to Utah or CTS (for the later models). The Concert joined the Fender Twin Amp, and Fender Vibrasonic as the only models with the more robust and expensive [...] "large-iron" [...] output transformers. Over this period, the Concert offered vibrato, bass and treble controls delivering approximately 40 watts of power. There is some variation within the circuit itself corresponding with the model updates for the Concert starting with the 5G12 (late 1959, early 1960) and continuing with the 6G12 (in late 1960, early 1961) and the 6G12-A by 1962 into 1963. The next year the Concert transitioned to the blackface circuit, labeled AB763. The most significant of these updates occurred between the 5G12 which had only 5 preamp tubes and the 6G12 which added another tube for a more pronounced vibrato and more clean headroom. Ironically, the earlier distortion point of the 5G12 was seen by the design team as a design flaw but has become desirable over the decades that followed.|$|R
5000|$|Often what is {{referred}} to as a [...] "guitar amp" [...] is in fact a combo amplifier: a cabinet with speakers and a built-in amplifier. Combo amplifiers may be referred to by their <b>speaker</b> cabinet <b>configuration</b> plus the word [...] "combo", so that [...] "4x10 combo" [...] means a guitar amplifier built into a 4x10" [...] speaker cabinet. Since the popular configurations are limited in variety, cabinet configurations are often written abbreviated without ambiguity: For example, 4x10" [...] may be written 410, and 112 refers to a single cabinet housing a 12" [...] speaker.|$|R
40|$|Currently, the ITU {{standard}} {{surround sound}} speaker arrangement {{is based on}} an irregular 5 speaker array. However, this may change to an irregular 7 speaker array (as is now the standard on computer hardware) or more in the future. The Ambisonic system, pioneered by Micheal Gerzon, among others, in the late 1960 ’s, is very well suited to situations where the end system <b>speaker</b> <b>configuration</b> is not fixed in terms of number or position while also offering a simple way (via energy and velocity vector analysis) of quantifying the performance of such systems. However, while the derivation of the decoders is well documented for regular speaker arrangements [1], optimising the decoders for irregular layouts is not a simple task, where optimisation requires the solution of a set of non linear simultaneous equations, complicated further by the fact that multiple solutions are possible [2]. Craven [3] extended the system to use higher order circular harmonics and presented a 4 th order Ambisonic decoder (9 input channels), although the derivation method used was not presented. In this paper a semi-automated decoder optimisation system using heuristic methods will be presented that will be shown to be robust enough to generate higher order Ambisonic decoders based on the energy and velocity vector parameters. This method is then analytically compared to Craven’s decoder using both energy/velocity vector and head related transfer function based methods...|$|R
