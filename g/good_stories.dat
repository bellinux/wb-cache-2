5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish <b>good</b> <b>stories.</b> In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Ernest Hemingway, another writer {{influenced}} by Chekhov, was more grudging: [...] "Chekhov wrote about six <b>good</b> <b>stories.</b> But {{he was an}} amateur writer." [...] And Vladimir Nabokov criticised Chekhov's [...] "medley of dreadful prosaisms, ready-made epithets, repetitions." [...] But he also declared The Lady with the Dog [...] "one of the greatest stories ever written" [...] in its depiction of a problematic relationship, and described Chekhov as writing [...] "the way one person relates to another {{the most important things}} in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice." ...|$|E

Within a few months, a dozen titles had been issued, including some now-rare one-shots like Thrills of the Jungle and Love and War Stories. With the issue of February 1930, another gang pulp, Racketeer Stories, was introduced. The violence and lawlessness of the two gang pulps provoked outrage. Hersey was threatened with prosecution {{in the state of}} New York. The crisis passed, and the gang pulps remained the mainstay of Hersey's chain into 1932.

500|$|White {{worked hard}} to make the {{magazine}} successful, introducing artwork from artists who had made their names in comics, and working with new authors such as Gordon Eklund. [...] His budget for fiction was low, but he was occasionally able to find <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> from well-known writers which had been rejected by the other markets. [...] Circulation continued to decline and in 1978 Cohen sold out his half of the business to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. [...] White resigned shortly afterwards, and was replaced by Elinor Mavor, but within two years Bernhard decided to close down Fantastic, merging it with Amazing, which had always had slightly higher circulation.|$|E
500|$|From its beginning, the Sunday Expresss {{campaign}} {{drew the}} attention of other papers. Some backed Douglas, including the Sunday Chronicle, The People and Truth. The Daily News and Westminster Gazette ran a review that, without commenting on Douglas's action, said the novel [...] "present as a martyr {{a woman in the}} grip of a vice". Most of the British press defended The Well. The Nation suggested that the Sunday Express had only started its campaign because it was August, the journalistic silly season when <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> are scarce. Country Life and Lady's Pictorial both ran positive reviews. Arnold Dawson of the Daily Herald, a Labour newspaper, called Douglas a [...] "stunt journalist"; he said no one would give the book to a child, no child would want to read it, and any who did would find nothing harmful. Dawson also printed a scathing condemnation of the Home Office by H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw and started a counter-campaign that helped Hall obtain statements of support from the National Union of Railwaymen and the South Wales Miners' Federation.|$|E

Originally an episode Cole had written for the radio show, it was adapted from the script for the magazine by Laurence D. Smith.

Haywood, both from 1906; and [...] "The Death-Trap", by George Daulton, which had originally appeared in 1908. [...] The reprints were <b>good</b> <b>stories,</b> {{in the opinion of}} Mike Ashley, and they often had science fiction themes: Curtis's story involved the transplant of a man's brain into the body of a prehistoric monster. [...] Despite the relatively high quality of the material, the stories were not action-oriented enough to have pleased a typical pulp magazine reader of the era.|$|E

500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] is just going to be the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. <b>Good</b> <b>stories,</b> you don't know where they're going to end."

500|$|As a {{condition}} of his release at Leipzig, he agreed {{not to participate in}} combat against France. [...] Subsequent to his release, Merveldt was appointed commanding general of Moravia, and lived in Brno, where he received in January 1814 the instructions to proceed to London as an envoy extraordinaire to the Court of St. James's, replacing Baron Wessembourg. He arrived in London in early March, and met the Prince Regent at Carlton House on 7March 1814, where he ceremoniously presented his ambassadorial credentials. He was well-received in Britain, and became a notable personage, invited to many social events; he told <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> about the wars and the various people he had encountered, which made him popular in social circles. [...] His comings and goings were widely reported in the society columns: For example, on 4July 1814, he attended a lecture by the Abb√© Secard, and was listed among the distinguished persons present. When he died in 1815, the British government proposed to bury him at Westminster Abbey. However, his widow took into account his last wishes and had the remains sent to Germany. He was buried in the crypt of the Michaelis chappel in Lembeck Castle where his grave still exists.|$|E
500|$|The Infected, a core {{concept of}} the game, were {{inspired}} by {{a segment of the}} BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the {{concept of the}} fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus; Straley attributed this to the team's focus on the characters, as opposed to the virus. They preferred to explain the events through subtext, rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection. Straley compared the subtext included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite (2013). He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry, which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry. [...] "I've seen enough <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> in books and film. Now I want to see them in video games," [...] said Straley. The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance. Throughout development, the team assured everyone that the Infected were strictly different from zombies.|$|E

500|$|When Future was relaunched {{in early}} 1950, the sf {{magazine}} field {{was not particularly}} crowded, and Lowndes was able to attract moderately <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> from writers who were either well-known or on their {{way up in the}} field. [...] The first issue included stories by James Blish, Lester del Rey and Murray Leinster; other authors featured in the early issues included Fritz Leiber, Judith Merril, H. Beam Piper, and L. Sprague de Camp. [...] Some of the better-known stories Lowndes published in the early 1950s were [...] "And There Was Light" [...] by del Rey, [...] "If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth" [...] by Arthur C. Clarke, and [...] "Liberation of Earth" [...] by William Tenn, which Damon Knight described as [...] "the funniest story [...] ever written". [...] He also bought work by some of the women writers active in the 1950s, including several early stories by Carol Emshwiller. [...] Lowndes knew many successful writers in the field, and was able to call on them for stories, but the expanding sf magazine market of the mid-1950s meant that the best material was spread thinly. [...] To attract readers, Lowndes established a friendly and personal style for the magazine, with letter columns and departments aimed at science fiction fans. [...] Blish, writing as William Atheling, Jr., commented in 1953 that Lowndes was doing a [...] "surprisingly good job" [...] with Future, despite the low rates and the slow payment to authors.|$|E
500|$|His son, Peter O'Malley, {{described}} his management style as follows: [...] "As president, {{the way he}} ran the business, he believed in stability and very little turnover. It was {{the strength of the}} organization. The management team worked as well as the team on the field." [...] This is evidenced in many ways, including the long tenure of both Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda as Dodgers managers and Vin Scully, the broadcast voice of the Dodgers. Alston was repeatedly rehired to consecutive one-year contracts from 1954‚Äì1976 until he retired. Then Lasorda, who had been a long-time employee in as a coach and minor league baseball manager, took over as manager for another 20 years. Scully has been the voice of the Dodgers since the O'Malley family acquired the team. In addition, the infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell and third baseman Ron Cey was the longest-running intact infield in major league history. Furthermore, O'Malley is said to have kept Bowie Kuhn in office as the Commissioner of Baseball until O'Malley's death. [...] O'Malley rewarded loyal employee Bavasi by allowing the San Diego Padres franchise to establish an expansion team with Bavasi as President in Southern California. Alston said O'Malley convinced him that when he signed his first one-year contract it could be a lifetime job by pointing out that [...] "signing one-year contracts can mean a lifetime job, if you keep signing enough of them." [...] Although O'Malley had <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> of loyalty with some employees, there were several stories of O'Malley's frugality.|$|E

In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn‚Äôt like what they were doing with Dot‚Äì she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‚ÄòNo, this just won‚Äôt do‚Äô. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

500|$|McNeile's early works, the {{war stories}} {{published}} before 1919, are either [...] "plot-driven adventure narrative", {{such as the}} short stories [...] "The Song of the Bayonet" [...] and [...] "Private Meyrick, Company Idiot", or [...] "atmospheric vignette", such as [...] "The Land of Topsy Turvy" [...] and [...] "The Human Touch". McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work. The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having [...] "little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clich√©d and often repetitive"; Richard Usborne agreed, adding that the female characters were [...] "cardboard" [...] and that McNeile was [...] "wonderfully forgetful" [...] about characters dead in one book and alive in the next. In [...] the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies [...] the central character [...] as [...] "a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama". The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot {{be considered to be}} unique, credible or well-rounded, his books [...] "make no claim to literary excellence", and are instead, [...] "good, solid thrillers". Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> that were flawed but well told. Meyer classifies the non-war stories as middlebrow, with [...] "sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England". His early novels, particularly Bull-Dog Drummond and The Black Gang, were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories. The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile [...] "mastered the tricks of his trade".|$|E
500|$|Robert Weinberg, in {{his history}} of Weird Tales, agrees with Ashley {{that the quality of}} Baird's issues was poor, but {{comments}} that some <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> were published: [...] "it was just that the percentage of such stories was dismally small". [...] Weinberg singles out [...] "A Square of Canvas" [...] by Rud, and [...] "Beyond the Door" [...] by Paul Suter as [...] "exceptional"; both appeared in the April 1923 issue. [...] Weinberg also regards [...] "The Floor Above" [...] by M. L. Humphries and [...] "Penelope" [...] by Vincent Starrett, both from the May 1923 issue, and [...] "Lucifer" [...] by John Swain, from the November 1923 issue, as memorable, and comments that [...] "The Rats in the Walls", in the March 1924 issue, was one of Lovecraft's finest stories. [...] It is unclear whether Baird or Henneberger was responsible for buying Lovecraft's stories; in one of Lovecraft's letters he makes it clear that Baird was keen to acquire his stories, but Henneberger has said that he overrode Baird and that Baird did not like Lovecraft's writing. [...] It was Henneberger who came up with another idea involving Lovecraft: Henneberger contacted Harry Houdini and made arrangements to have Lovecraft ghost-write a story for him using a plot supplied by Houdini. [...] The story, [...] "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs", appeared under Houdini's name in the May/June/July 1924 issue, though it was nearly lost‚ÄîLovecraft left the typed manuscript on the train he took to New York to get married, and as a result spent much of his wedding day retyping the manuscript from the longhand copy he still had.|$|E
500|$|Stanley Schmidt was an {{assistant}} professor of physics when he became editor of Analog, and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. [...] He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected [...] "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales‚Äîhumorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. [...] Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled [...] "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by G. Harry Stine and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. [...] The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. [...] This continuity led to criticisms within the field, Bruce Sterling writing in 1984 that the magazine [...] "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It is a situation screaming for reform. [...] Analog no longer permits itself to be read." [...] The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it, commenting in 1985: [...] "I reserve Analog for the kind of science fiction I've described here: <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> about people with problems in which some piece of plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".|$|E

500|$|A first plenum of the Central Committee also elects {{heads of}} departments, bureaus, central leading groups and other {{institutions}} to pursue its work during a term (a [...] "term" [...] being the period elapsing between national congresses, usually five years). The General Office is the party's [...] "nerve centre", in charge of day-to-day administrative work, including communications, protocol, and setting agendas for meetings. The CPC currently has four main central departments: the Organization Department, responsible for overseeing provincial appointments and vetting cadres for future appointments, the Publicity Department (formerly [...] "Propaganda Department"), which oversees the media and formulates the party line to the media, the International Department, functioning as the party's [...] "foreign affairs ministry" [...] with other parties, and the United Front Work Department, which oversees work with the country's non-Communist parties and other mass organizations.

500|$|A {{majority}} of the stories in Fantastic Adventures came from {{a small group of}} writers who often wrote under house names. The main members of the group were William P. McGivern, David Wright O'Brien, Don Wilcox, Chester S. Geier, Rog Phillips, Leroy Yerxa, Robert Moore Williams, Robert Bloch and Berkeley Livingston. Most of this material was of little lasting value, in Ashley's opinion, but Palmer was often able to get <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> from outside this group: August Derleth sold several stories to Palmer, for example. Ray Bradbury also sold a story to Fantastic Adventures"Tomorrow and Tomorrow", which appeared in 1947, was his only appearance in the magazine, but Ashley regards it as [...] "among the best stories [...] published in the 1940s". An early contributor was Nelson S. Bond, whose story [...] "The Judging of the Priestess" [...] appeared in the April 1940 issue. This was the second in a highly regarded series of three stories about a priestess in the future, after civilization has collapsed; the first and third in the series appeared in Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories respectively. Bond also wrote a humorous short story called [...] "The Amazing Invention of Wilberforce Weems", which appeared in the September 1939 issue and described the consequences of a potion that allowed the instant absorption of knowledge from any book. Palmer encouraged his stable of writers to follow up with more whimsical ideas, and the resulting offbeat stories gave Fantastic Adventures a reputation for light-hearted and entertaining fantasy. These stories often had absurd names; early examples include [...] "The Quandary of Quantus Quaggle", [...] "Sidney, the Screwloose Robot" [...] (both by McGivern), and [...] "The Weird Doom of Floyd Scrilch", by Robert Blochone of his series of stories about Lefty Feep, almost all of which appeared in Fantastic Adventures between 1942 and 1945. Robert Moore Williams contributed two sequels to his successful Jongor of Lost Land: The Return of Jongor appeared in 1944, and Jongor Fights Back in 1951.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} covering manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} media have praised and criticized the character. Tasha Robinson from SciFi.com remarked [...] "Kenshin's schizoid personal conflict between his ruthless-killer side and his country-bumpkin" [...] side was a perfect way to develop <b>good</b> <b>stories</b> {{which was one of}} the factors that made the series popular. Marco Oliveier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabat≈ç symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors. Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment highly praised Kenshin's characterization in the manga due to his seriousness as well how he intends to tell his friends his feelings contrasting some episodes from the anime where Kenshin is more comical. Lavey also highly praised the fight between Kenshin and Saito Hajime in the manga's seventh volume and Kenshin's killing intent displayed against his rival. Similarly, his first fight against Saito in the anime adaptation earned high praise by Anime News Network writer Mark A. Grey considering one of the best ones from the series. Entertainment Weekly found comical how whenever Kenshin is not fighting he is doing the laundry or cleans the dojo which brings a light tone that appealed the writer. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews website criticized Kenshin's super deformed appearance in comedy scenes claiming it does not suit the context of the character or the series. Mania.com remarks that Kenshin has a [...] "smartass" [...] attitude in a review of volume 8; while they noted that is a common attitude in the anime that makes him look out-of-character.
