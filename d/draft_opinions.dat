50|$|The justice {{writing the}} opinion {{for the court}} will produce and {{circulate}} a <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> to the other justices. Each justice's law clerks {{may be involved in}} this phase. In modern Supreme Court history only a few justices, such as former Justice Antonin Scalia, have regularly written their own first drafts. Once the <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> has been reviewed, the remaining Justices may recommend changes to the opinion. Whether these changes are accommodated depends on the legal philosophy of the drafters as well as on how strong a majority the opinion garnered at conference. A justice may instead simply join the opinion at that point without comment.|$|R

5000|$|According to Justice Liu, when a case {{is granted}} review, the Chief Justice assigns {{the case to}} a justice, who, after the parties finish briefing, then prepares a <b>draft</b> <b>opinion.</b> [...] Each justice writes a {{preliminary}} response to the <b>draft</b> <b>opinion,</b> and if the assigned justice is in the minority, she may ask the Chief Justice to reassign the case to someone in the majority. [...] The Court then hears oral arguments and, immediately afterwards, meet alone to vote. [...] The California Constitution requires suspension of the justices’ salaries if the Court fails to then file a decision within 90 days. The Court issues unanimous opinions in 77% of cases, compared to 43% by the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|R

50|$|Under {{the common}} law, {{judicial}} opinions themselves have legal effect through {{the rule of}} stare decisis.

This way, they can <b>draft</b> <b>opinions</b> fast and quickly dispose {{of the vast majority}} of cases, without worrying that they are accidentally making bad law. About 7% of their opinions are ultimately selected for publication and become part of California law.|$|E

5000|$|During {{its first}} half-century of operation, the Court {{struggled}} {{to keep up with}} its soaring caseload and very frequently fell behind, until the California Courts of Appeal were created in 1904. [...] This resulted in provisions in the 1879 Constitution forcing the Court to decide all cases in writing with reasons given (to get rid of minor cases, it had often given summary dispositions with no reasons given) and requiring California judges to certify in writing every month that no matter submitted for consideration had been outstanding for more than 90 days, or else they will not be paid. [...] To comply with the latter provision, the Court does not schedule oral argument until the justices have already studied the briefs, formulated their respective positions, and circulated <b>draft</b> <b>opinions.</b> Then, after the matter is formally [...] "argued and submitted", the justices can polish and release their opinions well before reaching the 90-day deadline. This differs sharply from the practice in all other federal and state appellate courts, where judges can schedule oral argument not long after written briefing is finished, but then may take months (or even a year) after oral argument to release opinions.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} of the justices' views during the circulation of <b>draft</b> <b>opinions</b> can change {{the outcome of the}} case; an opinion that begins as a majority opinion can become a dissenting opinion, and vice versa. At the conference for Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Justice Kennedy is said to have initially voted with Chief Justice Rehnquist, but then changed his mind, feeling unable to join Rehnquist's draft opinion. While working for the Justice Department, present-day Chief Justice John Roberts—a former Rehnquist law clerk—wrote an analysis of Wallace v. Jaffree in which he indicated his belief (based on the length and structure) that Rehnquist's dissent had started out as an opinion for the court, but lost its majority; similar speculation is often heard of Justice O'Connor's dissent in Kelo v. New London. Justice Kennedy is known within the Court for changing his mind subsequent to the conference, and Justice Thomas is known for having the tendency to lose a majority. Justices may change sides at any time prior to the handing down of the Court's opinion. Generally, the Court's decision is the opinion which a majority (five or more) of justices have joined. In rare instances, the Court will issue a plurality opinion in which four or fewer Justices agree on one opinion, but the others are so fractured that they cannot agree on a position. In this circumstance, in order to determine what the decision is lawyers and judges will analyze the opinions to determine on which points a majority agrees. An example of a case decided by a plurality opinion is Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{sequential}} bargaining {{model of a}} collegial court, analogous to Baron and Ferejohn’s sequential bargaining model of a legislature.

Case location and dispositional voting split the Court into two groups, a dispositional majority and a dispositional minority; bargaining over opinion content occurs only among those judges in the dispositional majority. Within that group, an assignment advantage arises endogenously in the model. Conditional on assignment, policies are often non-median, both within the Court as a whole and within High appellate courts like the US Supreme Court simultaneously dispose of cases an...|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on two habeas corpus cases of ongoing importance, Frank v. Magnum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915), and Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923). In both cases, {{defendants}} who had been sentenced to death in Southern state courtrooms surrounded by hostile mobs brought habeas corpus petitions to the federal courts, and pressed due process claims upon the Supreme Court. But the outcomes were entirely different. The Court refused {{to intervene in the}} first case (which resulted in the lynching of an innocent Jew), but granted relief in the second (which resulted in the release of innocent Blacks) - asserting all the while that there was no inconsistency between the two decisions. Both cases arose out of significant national events (the Leo Frank murder trial in one instance, and massive race riots in Elaine County, Arkansas, in the other), and continue to be the subject of conflicting interpretations by those who support broad habeas review (who argue that Moore overruled Frank) and those who oppose it (who argue that the cases are consistent). My own, rather novel, position is that the cases are consistent but support broad habeas corpus review. This conclusion is based on numerous primary sources, such as <b>draft</b> <b>opinions</b> and Justices 2 ̆ 7 papers, whose publication will, I hope, serve to enrich the ongoing debate over these cases by scholars in both law and history...|$|E
40|$|Federal appellate judges {{no longer}} have the time to hear {{argument}} and <b>draft</b> <b>opinions</b> in all of their cases. The average annual filing per active judgeship now stands at 330 filed cases per year — more than four times what it was sixty years ago. In response, judges have adopted case management strategies that effectively involve spending significantly less time on certain classes of cases than on others. Various scholars have decried this state of affairs, suggesting that the courts have created a “bifurcated” system of justice with “separate and unequal tracks. ” These reformers propose altering the relevant constraints of the courts, primarily by increasing the number of judges or decreasing the judiciary’s caseload. These approaches, however, have not gained political traction thus far and seem unlikely to in the foreseeable future. This Article takes a realist approach and argues that we should recognize judicial attention for what it is — a scarce resource — and assess whether there is evidence that the courts are allocating that resource improperly. Loosely borrowing the framework of resource allocation from the political science and economics literatures, this Article considers how to apply the concepts of inputs and outputs to the work of the federal appellate courts, suggesting judicial attention as the input and a combination of error correction and law development as the output. It then makes the preliminary case that the courts’ case management techniques in fact largely comport with an output-maximization approach, while still limiting inequality of outputs across cases. This Article concludes that the courts’ overall strategy nevertheless presents opportunities for enhancement. It suggests several improvements, focusing on the review structure of cases that receive the least amount of judicial attention, to help ensure that all federal cases receive an appropriate form of appellate review...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{discussion}} on the economic reform, in the early 80 s, opinions were heard postulating creation of a consultative organ attached to the Seym. On 26 March 1982 Seym passed a resolution to establish the Social Economic Council attached to the seym of the Polish People’s Republic. Establishing the Council as a consultative and advisory body is an institutional development {{of the idea of}} public consultation, included in art. 86 of the Constitution of the Polish People’s Republic. The Council is composed of not more than 150 members, appointed by the Seym from among persons who are not members of parliament. Its internal organs are: the Chairman, the Presiding Board and standing committees. The Chairman {{is also a member of}} parliament, where he is a member of the Senior Convention. The work of the Council is conducted by the Presiding Board and its Chairman. The standing committees are internal temporary organs occasionally appointed to consider <b>draft</b> <b>opinions.</b> The Social Economic Council considers matters committed for opinion by the Seym, its Presiding Board or Seym committees. The Council may also take up actions on its own initiative but in practice it rarely does so. The Presiding Board of the Seym coordinates actions of the Council and the committees, and determines the procedure and terms of considering particular matters by the Council. The activity of the Council substantially contributes to the legislative process. The Social Economic Council, established in 1982, is to act on the at present binding rules until the end of the present term of the Seym, i. e. to 31 August 1985. When evaluating the effects of its activity, it should be hoped that the future Seyms will also accept assistance of that organ.

When the Brown decision was handed down, a full court was present, to emphasize the unanimity of the decision. Robert H.
