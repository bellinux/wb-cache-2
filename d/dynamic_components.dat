5|$|In June 1962, Bell Helicopter {{presented}} a new helicopter design to Army officials, {{in the hopes}} of soliciting funding for further development. The D-255 Iroquois Warrior was envisioned as a purpose-built attack aircraft based on the UH-1B airframe and <b>dynamic</b> <b>components,</b> with a nose-mounted ball turret, a belly-mounted gun pod, and stub wings for mounting rockets or SS.10 anti-tank missiles.|$|E
25|$|In response, Bell {{built the}} Model 533 from a YH-40-BF, {{one of the}} six {{preproduction}} UH-1s. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> of the YH-40 were updated with components designed for the UH-1B. The research for the contract was split into two phases; phase one would be to determine the benefits of an overall reduction in drag, phase two would determine the benefits of auxiliary thrust.|$|E
25|$|Between Hughes and Schweizer, and {{including}} foreign-licensed production civil and military training aircraft, nearly 3,000 {{units of the}} Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. Schweizer continued to develop the Model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the Schweizer 330. Further developing the <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> to take greater advantage {{of the power of}} the turbine engine led to the development of the Schweizer S-333.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{particle}} filter for {{the estimation of}} a partially observed Markov chain that has a non <b>dynamic</b> <b>component.</b> Such systems arise when we include unknown parameters or when we decompose non ergodic systems to their ergodic classes. Our main assumption is {{that the value of}} the non <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> determines the limiting distribution of the observation process. In such cases, {{we do not want to}} resample the particles that correspond to the non <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> of the Markov chain. Instead, we take a weighted average of particle filters corresponding to different values of the non <b>dynamic</b> <b>component.</b> The computation of the weights is based on entropy and the number of particles corresponding to each particle filter is proportional to the weights...|$|R
50|$|The data {{obtained}} {{in this fashion}} permits the computation of total soil resistance, which includes both static and viscous <b>components.</b> The <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> is computed {{as the product of}} the pile velocity times the damping factor (a soil parameter related to soil grain size). The static component is the total soil resistance minus the <b>dynamic</b> <b>component).</b>|$|R

25|$|The U.S. Army's LHX {{program began}} in the early 1980s, proposing two {{helicopter}} designs with a high percentage of commonality of <b>dynamic</b> <b>components.</b> One was a light utility version ("LHX-U") for assault and tactical movement of troops and supplies, the other was a light scout/attack version ("LHX-SCAT") to complement the growing development of the AH-64 Apache. As the program was developed, the light utility version was dropped and focus was placed on the light attack reconnaissance version, which eventually became the RAH-66 Comanche.|$|E
25|$|Between Hughes and Schweizer, and {{including}} foreign-licensed production civil and military training aircraft, nearly 3,000 {{copies of the}} Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. That {{would have been the}} end of the story, but Schweizer continued to develop the model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the model 330m, and then further developed the <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> to take greater advantage of the power of the turbine engine; this led to the development of the Model 333.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} both the RON, and the competing Hiller ROE were too heavy and too difficult to fly and abandoned the project. The United States Navy, however, had noticed the compact size and high load-carrying capacity of the RON, and in 1960 awarded a contract to Gyrodyne to produce a radio-controlled drone version of the Rotorcycle, {{to be used as}} an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform. Using the <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> of the RON, this was eventually developed as the Gyrodyne QH-50.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-nine ambulant {{children}} (22 with hemiplegia, 17 with diplegia) with spastic {{cerebral palsy}} receiving isolated gastrocnemius muscle injection with botulinum toxin A were studied prospectively. The children {{had a mean}} age of 6 years(range 3 to 13 years). Measurement of gastrocnemius muscle length was used to estimate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> of each child’s spasticity and to quantify the response. There was a strong correlation between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> of spasticity before injection and the corresponding magnitude of the response after injection. Children undergoing repeated injections showed similar correlations. A strong correlation was found between the duration of response and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>component.</b> Children with hemiplegia showed twice the duration for a given <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> compared with those with diplegia when injected with the same total dose per unit body weight. Long-term lengthening did not occur for the cohort, although some patients showed a response at a 12 -month follow-up. By delaying shortening, the injections may have a role in delaying the need for surgery. Injections were well tolerated with few side effects...|$|R
25|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> {{that vary}} in {{concentration}} on kinetochores during mitosis include the molecular motors CENP-E and dynein (as {{well as their}} target components ZW10 and ROD), and the spindle checkpoint proteins (such as Mad1, Mad2, BubR1 and Cdc20). These proteins assemble on the kinetochore in high concentration in absence of microtubules; however, the higher the number of MTs anchored to the kinetochore, the lower the concentration of these proteins. At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels disminish about 3 to 4x as compared to free kinetochores, whereas dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 levels are reduced >10-100x.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> {{include the}} engine, {{transmission}}, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|The Bell 505 is a [...] "clean sheet" [...] design, {{but will}} use some <b>dynamic</b> <b>components,</b> {{such as the}} rotor system, of the Bell 206L-4. The {{airframe}} is constructed of metal and composites, and has a 22-square-foot (2.04 m²) flat floor and an 18-cubic-foot (0.51 m³) luggage bay. The Turbomeca Arrius 2R will be utilized as the type's engine with a dual-channel FADEC and a 3,000-hour Time-between-overhaul. The 505 cockpit will be equipped with the Garmin G1000H glass avionics suite. It is prepared for extras like a cargo hook.|$|E
40|$|We {{measure the}} {{velocity}} {{dependence of the}} capillary pressure, ΔPc(v), between two fluids in a porous medium. At zero velocity, the interface is pinned, and a critical ΔPc must be achieved before the interface moves. For nonzero velocities, there is an additional <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> to ΔPc, which scales as v 1 / 2 when a wetting fluid displaces a nonwetting fluid. We suggest that this <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> of ΔPc can stabilize viscous fingers, and obtain excellent agreement with experiment...|$|R
30|$|The vehicle’s {{vertical}} {{axle loads}} {{are composed of}} a static and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>component.</b> The static component follows from {{the distribution of the}} vehicle weight over the vehicle axles. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> is induced by the road unevenness that subjects the vehicle to vertical oscillations. It depends on road unevenness, vehicle’s characteristics and vehicle’s speed. When the vehicle speed is low, as compared to the wave velocities in the soil, the contribution of the static component to the free field vibrations is negligible.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a novel architecture, called DCUP (<b>Dynamic</b> <b>Component</b> Updating), {{which allows for}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> {{updating}} at run time (components are frameworks of objects). The following key problems of <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> updating are addressed: (1) making an update of a component fully transparent {{to the rest of}} the application, (2) transition of state from the old to the new version of a component, (3) transition of references which cross the component boundary (in both directions), (4) dynamic communication with a component provider. In DCUP these problems are addressed by a small set of abstractions with a clear separation of their functionality. In contrast with the usual believe that it is difficult to map abstraction supporting component based programming to concrete computer systems, the abstractions proposed by DCUP are very easy to map to the Java and CORBA programming environments...|$|R
2500|$|The key work of Constructivism was Vladimir Tatlin's {{proposal}} for the Monument to the Third International (Tatlin's Tower) (1919–20) which combined a machine aesthetic with <b>dynamic</b> <b>components</b> celebrating technology such as searchlights and projection screens. Gabo publicly criticized Tatlin's design saying, [...] "Either create functional houses and bridges or create pure art, not both." [...] This had already caused a major controversy in the Moscow group in 1920 when Gabo and Pevsner's Realistic Manifesto asserted a spiritual core for the movement. This was opposed to the utilitarian and adaptable version of Constructivism held by Tatlin and Rodchenko. Tatlin's work was immediately hailed by artists in Germany as a revolution in art: a 1920 photograph shows George Grosz and John Heartfield holding a placard saying 'Art is Dead – Long Live Tatlin's Machine Art', while the designs for the tower were published in Bruno Taut's magazine Fruhlicht. The tower was never built, however, {{due to a lack}} of money following the revolution.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is {{improvement}} of numerical cavitation models for simulation of an effect of cavitation stabilization of fluid mass flow. The methods of {{development of a new}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> for a numerical model of cavitation mass transfer is presented in the paper. Application of the new method resulted in a new <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> for numerical model of cavitation mass transfer, which takes into account fluid viscosity in Reley-Plesset equation. Relying on the methods being considered fundamentally new hydroautomatic devices such as cavitation mass flow stabilizers and flow dividers could be designed. The new <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> has become the basis for the new numerical model of cavitation mass transfer. The effect of cavitation stabilization of fluid mass flow was simulated by this <b>dynamic</b> <b>component.</b> The numerical model was verified by experimental researches of the effect of cavitation stabilization of fluid mass flow in a jet element “pipe-pipe”. The results of simulation showed that the new numerical model of cavitation mass transfer can simulate the jet pipes with the difference between results of simulation and experiment not exceeding 2, 5 % and visualizing a cavitation zone more adequate.

40|$|To {{deal with}} changes of {{capitalized}} seignorage due to EMU, we supply the still missing capital-theoretical framework. We show that seignorage pooling of EMU {{is composed of}} two <b>components,</b> a <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> and a static <b>component.</b> By its <b>dynamic</b> <b>component</b> the pool provides insurance against seignorage losses from changes of national shares in the European market for monetary base, while the static component is reflecting a prob-lematic pool-bias. The seignorage model is then applied to simulate EMU-changes of capitalized seignorage in two scenarios. Estimates {{of changes in the}} literature are evaluated. Finally, recent (Dec. 6, 2001) decisions by the ECB with regard to seignorage-pooling are evaluated. ...|$|R
