5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E

5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E

25|$|An athlete {{can produce}} about 300 to 400 watts of {{mechanical}} power <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> so (1/3 kWh/1/2hp), but adults of good average fitness average between 50 and 150 watts {{for an hour}} of vigorous exercise (1/10 kWh). A healthy laborer may sustain an average output of about 75 watts for some eight hours (½ Kwh). Pedal power is therefore most suitable for fairly short tasks with modest power demand.|$|E

25|$|Whale {{meat and}} blubber are Faroese delicacies. Well into the 20th century, meat and blubber {{from the pilot}} whale was used to feed people {{for long periods of}} time. Everybody got a share, as is the custom to this day. The meat and blubber can be stored and {{prepared}} in a variety of ways, in Faroese it is called Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is boiled or served as steaks. A pilot whale steak is called in Faroese: grindabúffur. Whale meat with blubber and potatoes in their skins are put into a saucepan with salt and then boiled <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> so. Slivers of the blubber are also a popular accompaniment to dried fish.|$|E
25|$|Suvla and Anzac {{were to be}} {{evacuated}} in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as William Scurry's self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure. At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire. The final British troops departed from Lancashire Landing around 04:00 on 8 January 1916. The Newfoundland Regiment was chosen {{to be a part}} of the rearguard, finally withdrawing from Gallipoli on 9 January 1916.|$|E

25|$|Pulleine {{only made}} one {{change to the}} {{original}} disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> so until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting some casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini–Henry rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the Royal Artillery forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.|$|E
25|$|Outside the Northeast Corridor and {{stretches}} of track in Southern California and Michigan, most Amtrak trains run on tracks {{owned and operated}} by privately owned freight railroads. Freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to Amtrak trains. Some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations, allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track. The railroads' dispatching practices were investigated in 2008, resulting in stricter laws about train priority. Subsequently, Amtrak's overall on-time performance went up from 74.7% in fiscal 2008 to 84.7% in 2009, with long-distance trains and others outside the NEC seeing the greatest benefit. The Missouri River Runner jumped from 11% to 95%, becoming one of Amtrak's best performers. The Texas Eagle went from 22.4% to 96.7%, and the California Zephyr, with a 5% on-time record in 2008, went up to 78.3%. This improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn, resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988, meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against {{the base of the}} male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

Chevalier later remarked that Webber and Serra [...] "... needed absolute control of the space and light they worked with– something they could never achieve by shutting down a busy Delft street <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> two." [...] Only a few exterior shots were filmed in Delft.|$|E
500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, {{and if you go}} there <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> two, reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E
500|$|King George was {{extremely}} devoted to Octavius, who {{was too young}} to cause the kinds of trouble that his elder brothers were by the year of his birth. The king was affectionate and indulgent with his young children, and strove to attend their birthday parties and other events organized for their merriment; on one occasion a friend witnessed a happy domestic scene that involved George [...] "carrying about in his arms by turns Sophia and the last prince, Octavius." [...] Another witness wrote George and Charlotte [...] "have their Children always playing about them the whole time"; during most evenings the children were brought to their parents between 6 and 7 O'clock to play <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> two.
