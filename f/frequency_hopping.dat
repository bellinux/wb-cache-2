40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFrequency hopped signals {{are widely used}} in various communication applications for their inherent security features. The demand, by civilian and governmental agencies, to intercept communication signals is increasing. The interception task can be summarized by detecting the signal's presence in additive noise, classifying the modulation type, estimating the control parameters, decoding the data, and decrypting the information content. This work addresses the merging of wavelet and correlation concepts to detect, classify and estimate the parameters of <b>frequency</b> <b>hopped</b> signals. We address the interception problem in two ways. The first approach {{is based on a}} visual inspection of the wavelet surfaces generated from the instantaneous correlation function of the communication signal and leads to hop start/stop times estimates. In the second approach, we apply an energy-based processing scheme to estimate the hop start and stop times, the hop scale pattern, and the <b>hop</b> <b>frequency.</b> Results show that <b>frequency</b> <b>hopped</b> signals can be identified at an SNR of 3 dB or 6 dB using visual inspection or an automated scheme, respectively[URL] Egyptian Arm...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a novel design {{scheme for}} radar signal is proposed. It {{is based on}} a {{modification}} of Costas codes design by increasing the frequency separation of <b>frequency</b> <b>hops</b> beyond the orthogonality condition. Indeed, Costas codes are well known for their good range-doppler properties. Their orthogonality condition states that frequency separation between <b>frequency</b> <b>hops</b> should be at most equal to the inverse of bit duration of the code. Increasing frequency separation beyond this condition leads to the appearance of grating lobes near the main temporal lobe of the autocorrelation function. This paper proposes overcoming this problem using sub-pulse coding. The originality of the proposed approach consists in choosing for Costas sub-pulses other Costas codes instead of constant frequency ones in order to lower autocorrelation grating lobes that would normally appear when the orthogonality condition is not satisfied. In this paper, we show that under some conditions on Costas signal parameters in the sub-pulse, good elimination of grating lobes is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Demodulation and {{decoding}} for <b>frequency</b> <b>hop</b> {{spread spectrum}} multiple access (FH/SSMA) systems has been traditionally conducted by conventional single user (non-collaborative) demodulation and error-correcting or erasure-correcting decoding techniques. In this paper, we study the demodulation and decoding aspects of collab-orative multi-user reception for FH/SSMA and propose methods which improve {{the capacity of}} the system. Since hits from one or two other signals are the most likely events in FH/SSMA, the joint demodulation of two or of three received signals is performed based on likelihood ratio tests. Iterative decoding is used after the demod-ulation. Results are derived for both synchronous and asynchronous <b>frequency</b> <b>hop</b> systems. MFSK modulation with noncoherent demodulation and Reed-Solomon codes with hard-decisions minimum distance decoding are used. The performance of the proposed multi-user detector in AWGN and at Raleigh fading channels is evaluated.
