25|$|David Burke (Ed Begley) is {{a former}} {{policeman}} who was ruined when he refused to cooperate with state crime investigators. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> hard-bitten, racist, ex-con Earl Slater (Robert Ryan) to help him rob an upstate bank, promising him $50,000 if the robbery is successful.

25|$|Canada's Public Safety Minister, Stockwell Day, {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> the RCMP {{for a review}} on Taser use and that a report is being prepared, and pointed out that several {{investigations}} of the incident are already underway. Liberal Public Safety Critic Ujjal Dosanjh said that what was needed was an independent body to conduct a national and public review of the issue, which would lead to national guidelines for Taser use by law enforcement officers. BC NDP Public Safety Critic and Port Coquitlam MLA Mike Farnworth called for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate the incident, citing concerns of police investigating themselves.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, it was {{announced}} that Wright would be lodging an appeal against both his convictions and the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff, claiming (amongst other things) that the trial should not have been held in Ipswich and that the evidence against him constituted insufficient proof of guilt. He was reported to have written to the court of appeal [...] "All five women were stripped naked of clothing/jewellery/phones/bags and no evidence was found in my house or car." [...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> for a new solicitor.|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{had been}} at first {{slightly}} in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication {{a few weeks later}} with his Fantasie, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano, [...] "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: [...] "For some time now he has been peering over my shoulder, and for the second time <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" [...] Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought [...] "rather too eccentric".|$|E
2500|$|Yepikhodov – a clerk. The Gayev's estate clerk {{is another}} source of comedy. He is unfortunate and clumsy in the extreme, earning him the {{insulting}} nickname [...] "Twenty-Two Calamities" [...] (the nickname varies between translations) mostly invoked by Yasha. He considers himself {{to be in love}} with Dunyasha, whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> to marry him.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{conviction}} of Liam Adams, the Attorney General of Northern Ireland, John Larkin, {{has been asked to}} review a 2011 decision not to prosecute Gerry Adams over an allegation that he withheld information in connection with the case. The request for the review has been made by Northern Ireland's Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory. A statement from the DPP read: [...] "The Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory QC, recognises that there has been considerable public interest surrounding the decision not to prosecute Mr. Gerry Adams in October 2011 in relation to an allegation that he withheld information in connection with the Liam Adams case. While the director has confidence in the evidential decision taken by the PPS prior to his appointment, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> the Attorney General to independently review the matter.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the NBC sketch series Saturday Night Live {{featured}} {{a parody of}} MacGyver called [...] "MacGruber" [...] with Will Forte as the title character. The intros for these skits featured scenes from the MacGyver series. MacGruber and cohorts are always locked in a control room of some type with a bomb set to go off in 15–20 seconds. MacGruber has his co-stars hand him components to defuse the device, but something inevitably {{gets in the way}} (either situational, because MacGruber himself interferes, or because no one wants to touch what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> for) and the bomb detonates. In the March 7, 2009 installment of the [...] "MacGruber" [...] sketches, it was revealed that MacGyver is MacGruber's long-lost father. In 2010 the character was featured in its own R-rated spinoff movie, entitled MacGruber; the film was released by Rogue Pictures.|$|E
2500|$|Max {{teaches the}} {{children}} how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain {{that he is not}} doing it as Maria did. He tells them that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with him about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that it is inevitable ("No Way to Stop It"). When he refuses to compromise, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be [...] "An Ordinary Couple". As they marry, the nuns reprise [...] "Maria" [...] against the wedding processional.|$|E

60|$|The major laughed. He {{saw that}} the lad a little resented the joking tone in which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--Mr. Greystock. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> me. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> {{me to be}} his wife. I {{thought he}} loved me. I hoped he did, at least. Oh dear, I did so hope it! And he does!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> that General Blunt {{shall not}} take persons charged with civil crimes {{out of the}} hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be hung; and I think he is right in this also. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> that General Ewing's {{department}} be extended to include all Kansas; and I have not determined whether this is right or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> {{everyone}} {{he has become}} friendly with, but they all declare that no white man has ever {{been seen in the}} country before." ...|$|E
60|$|The captain's {{report was}} soon given in. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> the man {{if he wanted}} a berth in a ship just going to sail for England, one of the crew having fallen sick at the last moment. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> refused, as <b>he</b> belonged to a boat just about to sail for Bergen op Zoom, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> nodded towards a large decked boat riding in the river. Fearing to excite suspicion, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> no further question, but had turned to another man {{standing}} near, {{and asked him if}} he would make the voyage.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} him. However, it doesn't matter. But {{why does}} the fact that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> Ruth on his yacht excite you? Are you nervous about the sea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{letter from}} Mynheer Van Voorden {{to ask me}} to {{accompany}} him to Flanders, whither he is about to sail. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> Edgar too, and his father has consented." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why can't you?" [...] demanded Bostil, {{straightening}} {{up with a}} {{glint in}} his big eyes. It {{was the first time}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> Slone that.|$|R
