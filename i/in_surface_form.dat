40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} vowel harmony in Yawelmani and its interaction with vowel epenthesis and lowering, within the non -derivational, constraint -based model of Optimal Domains Theory (ODT). Kisseberth's (1969) analysis of the Yawelmani system, formulated within classical generative phonology, demonstrates an opaque rule interaction among the rules governing vocalic phonology, and was taken as an important piece of evidence for the notion of rule ordering in generative theory. The challenge in providing a non -derivational analysis of Yawelmani lies in accounting for conditions on vowel harmony which factor in phonological structure that is "inserted" <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form,</b> as well as structure that is "deleted" from underlying form. This paper presents a restricted means of bringing together information from underlying and surface representations in a theoretical framework that eschews intermediate representations, {{through the use of}} abstract (ie., unrealized) feature-domain structure.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{morphological}} and morphosyntactic characteristics of hand configurations in signs, particularly in Nederlandse Gebarentaal (NGT). The literature on sign languages in general acknowledges that hand configurations can function as morphemes, more specifically as classifiers, in {{a subset of}} signs: verbs expressing the motion, location, and existence of referents (VELMs). These verbs are considered the output of productive sign formation processes. In contrast, other signs in which similar hand configurations appear (iconic or motivated signs) have been considered to be lexicalized signs, not involving productive processes. This research report shows that meaningful hand configurations have (at least) two very different functions in the grammar of NGT (and presumably in other sign languages, too). First, they are agreement markers on VELMs, and hence are functional elements. Second, they are roots in motivated signs, and thus lexical elements. The latter signs are analysed as root compounds and are formed from various roots by productive processes. The similarities <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form</b> and differences in morphosyntactic characteristics observed in comparison of VELMs and root compounds are attributed to their different structures and to the sign language interface between grammar and phonetic for...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to the {{deflection}} of {{tool and}} workpiece induced by cutting force, {{there is a}} high complexity associated with the prediction of surface form errors in peripheral milling of thin-walled workpieces. Based on the systematic study of in-cutting chip, this paper proposes a new efficient iterative algorithm named flexible iterative algorithm (FIAL) ， which is suitable for surface form errors prediction in peripheral milling of low rigid thin-walled workpiece. In FIAL, an iterative scheme for calculations of tool/workpiece (TW) deflections are developed by considering the former convergence cutting position, and in the scheme a new important variable Δ is proposed for the calculation of radial cutting depth which never been considered before. Based on FIAL and the analytical study of in-cutting chip, a double iterative algorithm (DIAL) is brought forwarded to calculate the positions and magnitude of the maximum surface form errors, which always take the peak point include in each iterative step. Comparisons of the form errors and cutting forces obtained numerically and experimentally confirm the validity of the proposed algorithms and simulation procedure. The experimental and analytical results have shown that FIAL is faster in the iteration convergent speed and more accurate than the rigid iterative algorithm <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form</b> errors prediction, and DIAL is proved to be valid in the maximum errors prediction...|$|E

40|$|Like {{many other}} spoken and signed languages, German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS) {{displays}} variation <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form</b> of the plural marker. This allomorphy is phonologically conditioned, triggered by particular phonological {{properties of the}} lexical sign to which the plural marker attaches (Pfau and Steinbach 2005, 2006). Since the overt realization of this marker is licensed to a small set of nouns in the language with the proper phonological properties, the majority of lexical signs are left bare, or zero-marked, when the simple plural is formed (2005, 2006). According to Pfau and Steinbach (2005), {{there are a number}} of what they call “alternative pluralization strategies” available in DGS as a repair for this underspecification in the simple plural, including classifier constructions, spatial localization, and number phrases. These constructions are available for use with any lexical sign, regardless of whether the canonical plural marker can be overtly realized with that noun. When used in conjunction with a zero-marked plural, they argue, these constructions serve as alternative means for expressing a plurality of referents. I propose that a new morpheme for plural marking is entering into the language and that it is drawn from the classifier system already available in DGS. This new morpheme attaches only to nouns with phonological features blocking the realization of the canonical plural in some way. For this reason, I conclude signers are beginning to use the classifier-based morpheme as a repair for this underspecification...|$|E
40|$|Derivational {{morphological}} processes {{allow us}} to create new words (e. g. punish (V) to noun (N) punishment) from base forms. The number of steps from the basic units to derived words often varies (e. g., nationality : two-steps) and {{there is evidence that}} complex derivations cause more brain activity than simple ones (Meinzer, Lahiri, Flaisch, Hannemann, & Eulitz, 2009). However, all studies to date have investigated derivational processes in which morphological complexity is related to a change <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form.</b> It is therefore unclear whether the effects reported are attributable to underlying morphological complexity or to the processing of multiple surface morphemes. Here we report the first study to investigate morphological processing where derivational steps are not overtly marked (e. g., bridge -N> bridge -V) i. e., zero-derivation (Aronoff, 1980). We compared the processing of one-step (soaking -V) and two-step (bridging -V bridge -N) derivations together with monomorphemic control words (grumble) in an fMRI experiment. Participants were presented with derived forms of words (soaking, bridging) in a lexical decision task. Although the surface derived - ing forms can be contextually participles, gerunds, or even nouns, they are all derived from verbs since the suffix - ing can only be attached to verb roots. Crucially, the verb root is the basic form for the one-step words, whereas for the two-step words the verb root is zero derived from a basic noun. Significantly increased brain activity was observed for complex (one-step and two-step) versus simple (zero-step) forms in regions involved in morphological processing, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Critically, activation was also more pronounced for two-step compared to one-step forms. Since both types of derived words have the same surface structure, our findings suggest that morphological processing is based on underlying morphological complexity, independent of overt affixation. This study is the first to provide evidence for the processing of zero derivation, and demonstrates that morphological processing cannot be reduced to surface form-based segmentation.

Instruction to recognize gist or verbatim information was a between-subjects factor. Experiment 1 investigated sentence recognition and misrecognition of inferences for spatial and linear sentences. Subjects exhibited both verbatim memory for the presented premises and gist intrusion for sentences that differed <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form</b> but shared the same gist. Relationships between presented premises and their inferences were independent when subjects interrogated verbatim traces to answer memory questions, and gist traces to answer reasoning (inference) questions. Subjects used gist to verify sentences in the meaning condition, and dependencies between premises and inferences were largely positively dependent. Overall, Experiment 1 replicated Reyna and Kiernan's (in press) findings with children, suggesting that adults do not qualitatively differ from children in the processing of verbatim and gist representations. Experiment 1 's results rule out a constructivist account of memory (e. g., Bransford and Franks, 1971). Experiment 2 investigated recognition of inflected (e. g., past tense and plural) verb and noun word pairs, and misrecognition of analogous pairs. Results were similar to Experiment 1 as subjects used verbatim traces for verification in the memory condition. When processing for patterns, however, some subjects appeared to use a phonological rule, whereas others appeared to use a semantic rule. Experiment 3 investigated recognition of interpretations of novel Literal and Perceptual metaphors. Results were largely similar to those of Experiments 1 and 2. However, negative dependencies were found between presented metaphors and their interpretations in the memory condition, supporting the principle of discrepancy detection (e. g., Loftus, 1979). Evidence disconfirmed stage models of metaphor interpretation in which literal precedes figurative interpretation. Results were explained by two models of interpretation depending on metaphor type (Literal or Perceptual). Individual differences in gist versus verbatim processing were found in adults across the three experiments...|$|E

A remarkable (though inconspicuous) property of these constraint families is their symmetry: MAX-IO and DEP-IO are one another’s mirror images, and the formulation of IDENT-IO requires the commensurability of underlying <b>form</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>form,</b> that is, <b>in</b> order that the underlying and the surface element can be assessed as identical or not, they should have a common basis for comparison, which means that they should be expressed {{in the same kind of}} units.

40|$|Present-day Dutch has a vestigial partitive genitive {{morpheme}}. Adjectives {{take the}} genitive -s morpheme {{when they are}} used as a dependent of a quantifier (Haeseryn et al. 1997 : 863; Broekhuis 2013 : 420 - 426). This is illustrated in (1). The construction comes in two variants: either with an overt -s suffix, or without the suffix. (1) iets bijzonder(-s) something special-GEN ‘something special’ While the two variants do not show any observable semantic difference, Pijpops & Van de Velde (2014) applied mixed-model logistic regression {{and found that the}} expression of the -s is probabilistically determined by a number of factors. While overall, the [+s] variant is more frequent, the [-s] variant is also fairly common, and is more likely to occur (i) in informal registers, (ii) in low-frequency phrases, and (iii) in the south of the language area (Belgium). There also is a strong main effect for the [-s] variant for adjectives that occurred in superficially similar non-partitive constructions. This is illustrated in (2) and (3) : though similar <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form,</b> the contexts makes clear that (2) is not a partitive construction. The absence of the -s morpheme then spills over to genuine partitives like (3) (see Pijpops & Van de Velde, forthc. for extensive explanation on what they call ‘constructional contamination’). (2) iets verkeerd geïnterpreteerd [something]NP [[wrongly]AdvP interpreted] (3) iets verkeerd gegeten [something wrong]NP eaten This suggests that, in line with exemplar-based theories of language, prior use of constructions leaves a (context-rich) trail {{in the mind of the}} language users. In this talk, we want to see whether the same effect also occurs with regard to the regional variable. Can the regional provenance of the lexemes inserted in a construction exert an influence on the morphological realisation of the target construction, even if the construction is used by language users with a different regiolectal background? In our study southern speakers have a stronger tendency to drop the genitive -s, but less so when they are using ‘northern’ lexemes, and vice versa. This effect holds even if the regional provenance of the lexemes is subtle, and unlikely to be a shibboleth of a regionally recognisable type of speech. Furthermore, we see that while the analogical pull of lexemes with a regional profile is felt everywhere in the language area, the effect is more blurry in cities near the border of the two regions and more clear in the core areas. This finding shows that not only the language-internal context of prior instances is stored in memory, but the ‘language-external’, lectal context as well. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) via deep {{syntactic}} transfer {{employs a}} three-stage architecture, (i) parse source language (SL) input, (ii) transfer SL deep syntactic structure {{to the target}} language (TL), and (iii) generate a TL translation. The deep syntactic transfer architecture achieves {{a high level of}} language pair independence compared to other Machine Translation (MT) approaches, as translation is carried out at the more language independent deep syntactic representation. TL word order can be generated independently of SL word order and therefore no reordering model between source and target words is required. In addition, words in dependency relations are adjacent in the deep syntactic structure, allowing the extraction of more general transfer rules, compared to other rules/phrases extracted from the surface form corpus, as such words are often distant <b>in</b> <b>surface</b> <b>form</b> strings, as well as allowing the use of a TL deep syntax language model, which models a deeper notion of fluency than a string-based language model and may lead to better lexical choice. The deep syntactic representation also contains words in lemma form with morpho-syntactic information, and this enables new inflections of lemmas not observed in bilingual training data, that are out of coverage for other SMT approaches, to fall within coverage of deep syntactic transfer. In this thesis, we adapt existing methods already successful in Phrase-Based SMT (PB-SMT) to deep syntactic transfer as well as presenting new methods of our own. We present a new definition for consistent deep syntax transfer rules, inspired by the definition for a consistent phrase in PB-SMT, and we extract all rules consistent with the node alignment, as smaller rules provide high coverage of unseen data, while larger rules provide more fluent combinations of TL words. Since large numbers of consistent transfer rules exist per sentence pair, we also provide an efficient method of extracting rules as well as an efficient method of storing them. We also present a deep syntax translation model, as in other SMT approaches, we use a log-linear combination of features functions, and include a translation model computed from relative frequencies of transfer rules, lexical weighting, as well as a deep syntax language model and string-based language model. In addition, we describe methods of carrying out transfer decoding, the search for TL deep syntactic structures, and how we efficiently integrate a deep syntax trigram language model to decoding, as well as methods of translating morpho-syntactic information separately from lemmas, using an adaptation of Factored Models. Finally, we include an experimental evaluation, in which we compare MT output for different configurations of our SMT via deep syntactic transfer system. We investigate various methods of word alignment, methods of translating morpho-syntactic information, limits on transfer rule size, different beam sizes during transfer decoding, generating from different sized lists of TL decoder output structures, as well as deterministic versus non-deterministic generation. We also include an evaluation of the deep syntax language model in isolation to the MT system and compare it to a string-based language model. Finally, we compare the performance and types of translations our system produces with a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system and although the deep syntax system in general currently under-performs, it does achieve state-of-the-art performance for translation of a specific syntactic construction, the compound noun, and for translations within coverage of the TL precision grammar used for generation.
