5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, <b>kings</b> <b>and</b> exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on <b>kings</b> <b>and</b> exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Bavetta was one {{of three}} referees for the Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the <b>Kings</b> <b>and</b> the Lakers.

The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game.

40|$|A Man for All Seasons, a play by Robert Bolt {{tries to}} reveal the life of Sir Thomas More, one of the famous chancellors {{in the history of}} England and a true catholic. In this thesis, I analyze the main character's loyalty to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> to his faith. That is why I am curious to find out how Sir Thomas More is loyal to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> to his faith and what are the {{consequences}} of Sir Thomas More's loyalty. The purpose of my thesis is to reveal Sir Thomas More's loyalty to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> his faith and its consequences. In order to analyze it I use literary approach which is the theory of characterization and conflict as the literary devices. In the end of my analysis, I find out that the main character keeps his loyalty to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> to his faith because he is the <b>king?s</b> chancellor <b>and</b> a good catholic since it is his duty and obligation to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> to his faith. He has to accept the death penalty as a final consequence of his loyalty to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> his faith. As a conclusion, his loyalty to his <b>king</b> <b>and</b> his faith has helped him to teach others for keeping their own conscience...|$|R
5|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{additional}} {{arms were}} attributed to {{a large number of}} saints, <b>kings</b> <b>and</b> popes, especially those from the 11th and 12th centuries. Pope Innocent IV (1243–1254) is the first pope whose personal coat of arms is known with certainty (Pastoreau 1997a, 283–284). By the end of the 17th century, the use of attributed arms became more restrained (Neubecker, 224).|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, <b>kings</b> <b>and</b> bishops, and purple parchment was rarely used for writing.

In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, but was not included.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy.

50|$|A <b>king</b> <b>and</b> one knight is not {{sufficient}} material to checkmate an opposing lone king (see Two knights endgame). A <b>king</b> <b>and</b> two knights can checkmate a lone king but it cannot be forced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{different}} {{geometry of}} the square and circular boards creates considerable differences in endgame theory: {{three of the four}} [...] "basic checkmates" [...] on a square board (those with <b>king</b> <b>and</b> rook, <b>king</b> <b>and</b> two bishops or <b>king,</b> bishop <b>and</b> knight against a lone king) rely on forcing the defending king into the corner of the board, and thus are impossible on a circular board since it doesn't have corners. The [...] "basic mates" [...] in circular chess are thus those with <b>king</b> <b>and</b> queen, <b>king,</b> rook <b>and</b> minor piece or <b>king</b> <b>and</b> three minor pieces against a lone king. The greater tendency towards drawn endgames often results in the defender playing on in a position which would be considered cause for resignation on a square board. In one particular endgame, however, the circular board favours the attacker: with <b>king</b> <b>and</b> pawn against <b>king,</b> there is no stalemate defence and thus, unless the defending king can capture the pawn before it can be either promoted or defended, this endgame is always a win. So most rules are as in orthodox chess.|$|R

Examples include Wulfhere, Cynewulf, Ceonwulf, Wulfheard, Earnwulf, Wulfmǣr, Wulfstān and Æthelwulf. Wolf-related names were also common among pre-Christian Germanic warriors: Wolfhroc (Wolf-Frock), Wolfhetan (Wolf Hide), Isangrim (Grey Mask), Scrutolf (Garb Wolf), Wolfgang (Wolf Gait) and Wolfdregil (Wolf Runner).|$|E
