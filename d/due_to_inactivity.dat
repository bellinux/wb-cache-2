5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a clinch early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief flurry of punches and landing a knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw a flurry of punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai Clinch before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle.

25|$|On September 17, 2011, Morales won the WBC Light Welterweight Championship with a {{win over}} un-rated Pablo Cesar Cano. The title had been vacant after {{previous}} champion Timothy Bradley's status had contentiously been changed to Champ in Recess <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>inactivity.</b> Many including experts and commentators saw the title won by Morales as a paper championship. Following Morales' win, he would be rated No.7 on Ring Magazine's light welterweight ratings, with all other title holders and highly rated contenders ranked above him. Morales became the first Mexican-born boxer in history to win world titles in four different weight classes.|$|E

The title remained inactive until 1993.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{spent the}} next 5 minutes working on body strikes from closed guard. The referee then decided to return the fight to stand up <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>inactivity.</b> This {{decision}} by the referee is seen as controversial by some commentators, such as Dave Meltzer. Jackson has also voiced his displeasure for the stand-up. Sam Caplan, an MMA journalist, added that the Pride referees were employees of the promotion, and Jackson was victim of several [...] "hasty" [...] stand-ups from the officials. Whether he was referring specifically to the fights against Silva is unknown. Shortly following the stand-up, Silva secured a Muay Thai Clinch and landed approximately 20 knee strikes to Jackson's face and several soccer kicks to the head before the referee called a stop to the contest. Silva was declared the winner by Technical Knockout at 6:28 of the 1st round and the Pride 2003 Middleweight Grand Prix Champion.|$|E

He was an honorary member of the Board of Governors of Hebrew University for over ten years prior to June 2010, when the University announced he had been dropped from the Board <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>inactivity</b> [...] "for a decade or more". In April 2010, Jerusalem lawyer David Schonberg had requested Goldstone be removed from the Board because of the UN report on Gaza. A University spokesperson stated that removing inactive members was a routine procedure, that other inactive members had also been removed, and that Goldstone's removal had [...] "nothing to do with his Report about Gaza".|$|E
2500|$|Chris de Burgh had an {{across-the-board}} {{success with}} the ballad [...] "The Lady in Red" [...] in late 1986; the single became a number one hit in the UK (number three in America) and its accompanying album, Into the Light, reached number two in the UK (number 25 in the U.S.). That Christmas season, a re-release of de Burgh's 1976 Christmas song [...] "A Spaceman Came Travelling" [...] became a Top 40 hit in the UK. Flying Colours, his follow-up to Into the Light, entered the British charts at number one upon its 1988 release, yet it {{failed to make the}} American charts. De Burgh never hit the US charts again and his commercial fortunes began to slide slightly in Britain in the early 1990s, yet he retained a following around the world. This is mainly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>inactivity</b> of his previous recording label A Records UK division in the U.S.|$|E

2500|$|Lashley faced Chad Griggs at [...] on August 21, 2010. Lashley {{came out}} {{shooting}} the takedown, and ground and pounding. Lashley dominated at first, but Griggs caught {{him with a}} series of uppercuts on one of the takedowns in the first round, opening a gash under the left corner of Lashley's left eye. [...] Lashely had trouble keeping Griggs from striking him, even though he had dominate control over him on the ground, but Griggs was still finding openings on the bottom. Lashley was able to continue in the second round, continuing takedowns and ground and pound. Lashley eventually passed to mount halfway through the second round and unloaded many good punches on Griggs while maintaining control. Referee Jon Schorle then asked the fighters to stand up <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>inactivity,</b> despite Lashley being in full mount at the time. [...] Lashley later complained to the referee about the cut under his eye, and with 33 seconds left in the second round, referee Jon Schorle asked the ringside doctor to inspect the cut. [...] However, with Lashley deciding to continue fighting, controversy was created when referee Jon Schorle did not put Lashley back in the mount position as he was when the fight was originally stopped. Griggs then sprawled out of a desperate takedown by Lashley near the end of round two and hammer-fisted Lashley's eye that was already cut until the round ended. The ring doctor then stopped the fight, resulting in Lashley losing {{at the end of the}} second round by TKO. Backstage after the fight, Lashley was taken off on a stretcher due to dehydration. Following the fight it was discovered that Lashley was suffering from mono and was subsequently unable to train for four months.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} speaker {{tracking}} in robot audition for human-robot interaction. Using only acoustic signals, speaker tracking in enclosed spaces {{is subject to}} missing detections and spurious clutter measurements <b>due</b> <b>to</b> speech <b>inactivity,</b> reverberation and interference. Furthermore, many acoustic localization approaches estimate speaker direction, hence providing bearing-only measurements without range information. This paper presents a probability hypothesis density (PHD) tracker that augments the bearing-only speaker directions of arrival with a cloud of range hypotheses at speaker initiation and propagates the random variates through time. Furthermore, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their formulation PHD filters explicitly model, and hence provide robustness against, clutter and missing detections. The approach is verified using experimental results...|$|R

50|$|M. scandinavica {{does not}} use multiple-carbon {{substrates}} as sources of carbon and energy. It uses the ribulose monophosphate pathway to incorporate methane and methanol into its biosynthetic metabolism. Following incorporation of the methane molecule, the organism uses an incomplete TCA cycle to generate reducing power for other portions of central metabolism. The TCA cycle is incomplete <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>inactivity</b> of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme.M. scandinavica also uses ammonia and nitrate as nitrogen sources. These precursor metabolites are incorporated via the glutamate cycle and reductive amination of pyruvate.
