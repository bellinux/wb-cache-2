5|$|In September 1896, Cornell’s {{president}} Jacob Gould Schurman prevailed {{upon the}} Board of Trustees to extend {{an offer to}} Nathaniel Schmidt. The situation at Colgate’s Divinity School had deteriorated. Schmidt’s unorthodox theology generated discomfort within that college. From 1886 {{to the arrival of}} Professor Nathaniel Schmidt in 1896, Cornell’s Library maintained its support for the acquisition of Near Eastern materials. Taking over as Cornell President, Jacob Gould Schurman decided Cornell needed a chair of Hebrew language. In 1896, Schurman persuaded Henry W. Sage to finance a professor of Semitic Languages and Literatures for AY1896-97 and AY 1897-98. He knew the University could secure Schmidt at a bargain. Schmidt’s unorthodox theological views made his stay at Colgate Divinity School untenable. Schmidt gained the respect of the Cornell community. Noted for his personal and scholarly integrity, he was soon shielded by sympathetic administrators. Schmidt served Cornell for thirty-six years, carrying a high teaching load in addition to this extensive research. He taught an elementary course in Hebrew each year. Advanced Hebrew covered the leading writers of the Old Testament and some parts of the Mishnaic and other Talmudic literature in three years. <b>General</b> <b>linguistics</b> students were advised to begin their study of Semitic languages with Arabic, also offered each year. Aramaic and Egyptian alternated with Assyrian and Ethiopic. The Semitic Seminary, given one term each year, was dedicated to epigraphical studies.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the regular subjects {{there are also a}} couple of special subjects. The first one is called almen sprogforståelse which teaches a student <b>general</b> <b>linguistics</b> and gives the student the ability to analyze sentences. In {{addition to}} the general part of that subject there is also a Latin part which aims to give the student a very basic understanding of a Latin language.

25|$|Returning {{to teach}} high school after his German stint, {{he became a}} {{professor}} at the literature faculty in Iași in 1893, retaining the post until his death. He was initially a substitute professor in the newly created department, rising to full professor in 1896. A Neogrammarian, he taught courses {{on the history of the}} Romanian language, <b>general</b> <b>linguistics,</b> Vulgar Latin, the physiology of the human voice and the origin of the Romanians. The initiator of an original theory of linguistics, this was developed and augmented by his student Gheorghe Ivănescu. His books, studies and articles total some 4000 pages, while his course materials number another 1500. The latter, in which he traced the history of the Romanian language, complemented his published work. It was where he tested new ideas and drafted outlines for the full-length Originea românilor.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{foundation}} of the LSA, a number of other similar societies existed including the American Philological Society and the Modern Language Association, and with the publication of Sapir's Language and Saussure's Course in <b>General</b> <b>Linguistics</b> in 1921 and 1922, the field of linguistics began to take shape as an independent discipline. Though an international discipline, the founders of the LSA had a growing feeling of an American linguistics different from the traditional European topics and methodologies popular at the time. One of the founding members, Leonard Bloomfield, explained the need for and establishment of the society so that the science of language, similar to but separate from other sciences, could build a [...] "professional consciousness.|$|E

500|$|The LSA holds a four-week {{biennial}} Linguistic Institute in {{the summer}} which includes talks and coursework on various aspects of linguistics. Considered by the membership {{to be one of}} the most important services of the LSA, the Institute has helped influence the development of the field through promotion of new directions such as psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. Each Institute features a number of endowed Chairs named after prominent linguists: [...] the Sapir chair in <b>general</b> <b>linguistics,</b> [...] the Collitz Chair in historical linguistics, and since 2005, the Ken Hale chair in linguistic fieldwork and the preservation of endangered languages. The newest endowed professorship is named after the late LSA President Charles Fillmore. The LSA also endows a series of student fellowships, named after prominent linguists and family members. These include fellowships named for Ken Hale, James McCawley, Ivan Sag, and Julia Bloch. The Bloch fellow also serves a simultaneous appointment to the LSA's Executive Committee and as the Chair of its Student Committee. As of 2017, the LSA is planning for two additional fellowships, the first named after Charles Fillmore, and the second named after Yuki Koroda.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Dacoromania {{appeared}} from 1921 to 1948, in eleven enormous volumes totaling some 9,000 pages. The magazine contained studies, articles, notes and reviews, mainly on linguistics (lexicology, dialectology, linguistic geography, language history, onomastics, <b>general</b> <b>linguistics,</b> grammar, phonetics and phonology) and philology, {{as well as}} research on history and literary criticism, cultural history and folklore. Each edition included a bibliography that systematically recorded writings on linguistics, philology, folklore, ethnography and literature, connected to Romanian language, culture and literature, both domestically and abroad. Three generations of scholars worked on the magazine, with most articles presented at weekly meetings. Pușcariu, in an obituary for Nicolae Drăganu, commented on these sessions' usefulness, noting how the members would benefit from constructive criticism, [...] "sometimes pointed, mainly intelligent, but never bitter, for the critical spirit never originated from a pleasure to destroy, but from a desire to complete, while the joy in another's discovery was always greater than the temptation to persist in a mistake".|$|E
