500|$|After Point du Sable {{sold his}} {{property}} in Chicago {{he moved to}} St. Charles, Missouri, where he was commissioned by the colonial governor to operate a ferry across the Missouri River. He died in 1818, and was buried in St. Charles, in an unmarked grave in St. Charles Borromeo Cemetery. His entry in the parish burial register does not mention his origins, parents, or relatives, it simply describes him as negre (French for black). The St. Charles Borromeo Cemetery was moved twice in the 19th century, and oral tradition and records of the Archdiocese of St. Louis suggested that Point du Sable's remains were also moved. On October 12, 1968, the Illinois Sesquicentennial Commission erected a granite marker at the site believed to be Point du Sable's grave in the third St. Charles Borromeo Cemetery.

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>Penetrating</b> <b>Radars</b> (GPRs) {{are very}} {{promising}} sensors for landmines detection {{as they are}} capable of detecting landmines with low metal contents. GPRs deliver so-called Bscan data which are, roughly, vertical slice images of the ground. However, due to the high dielectric permittivity contrast at the air-ground interface, a strong response is recorded at early time by GPRs. This response is the main component of the so-called clutter noise and it blurs the responses of landmines buried at shallow depths. The landmine detection task is therefore quite difficult. This paper proposes a new method for automated detection and localization of buried objects from Bscan records. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for online abrupt change detection is implemented and proves to be efficient in detecting buried landmines from Bscan data. The proposed procedure performance is evaluated using simulated and real data...|$|R
