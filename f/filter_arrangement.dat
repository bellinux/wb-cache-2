40|$|This paper {{reports on}} MEMS filters based on coupled {{resonator}} arrays designed using internal mechanical and electrical phase inversion principles. Four types of <b>filter</b> <b>arrangements</b> are described and their experimental validation using electrically and mechanically coupled silicon microfabricated resonators is presented. The internal phase inversion mechanisms are classified into four different categories {{based on the}} inversion principle {{and the nature of}} the coupling. The effects of capacitive parasitics on filter characteristics can be addressed by combining coupling mechanisms with phase inversion techniques without using external electrical phase inverter circuits. Filter metrics such as in-band ripple and minimum bandwidth are quantified and compared to previously reported results for silicon microresonators. The internal phase inversion mechanism enhances the design domain for MEMS resonator based filters. While, this paper discusses only a subset of resonator topologies, the principle can be extended to filters based on other resonator topologies as well. The techniques described here have applicability not only to the design of filters but also to the more effective interfacing to resonators in the presence of relatively large capacitive feedthrough parasitics...|$|R

All such equipments are interconnected with network cable wiring system unless few remote operating equipments exist. On the other hand, building electrical wiring system is also laid throughout the building. In this context, it may have opportunity to interfere unwanted electrical noise to the data and voice systems hence malfunction or giving flaw data outputs. Electrical noise cause for an abnormal humming sound of the voice signals and thereby degrade the quality of sound systems. Such interference can happen due to both radiated and conductive electrical noise. One of major reasons for the conducted noise is, operation of switched mode power supplies hence lead to create of earth loops that should eliminate at the design and installation stages. Analysis of electrical noise in the system and design filtering systems need to be practiced, when noise issues are raised after the commissioning of electrical installations. It is required to do analyzing of electrical noise in the building in order to come across comprehensive conclusion for root cause for the disturbances. In doing so, harmonic levels, noise in the live wires, noise through the earth wire and earth loop possibilities are investigated. The most important part is to identify major frequency components filter those from the system. Different type of <b>filter</b> <b>arrangements</b> can be used to evaluate its performances against the noise level of the site. Similarly, installation guide lines can be followed prior to the site erection and that is the very effective method to avoid unnecessary noise induced in sensitive equipments. Though general <b>filter</b> <b>arrangements</b> eliminate noise, some frequency ranges need to be filtered separately, according to the site conditions. Since calculated L and C values can’t be exactly found out, next closet practical values were chosen thereby cutoff frequency is slightly shifted. Simulation results, for common mode noise filtering indicate, 106 Hz to 107 Hz minimal variation of cutoff frequency and 0. 03 variation in damping factor. Earth leakage currents drastically reduced with increasing of the earth line choke and that is possible way to control common mode noise. Introducing separate earth cables instead of single copper tape in the vertical busbar trunking system, is the elimination method of the earth loops between floors at far apart in the high rise building. Besides, it is required to use same earth termination point for the camera and the display system of the CCTV system in high rise buildings...|$|R
50|$|Escaping liquids {{creates an}} {{acoustic}} signal as they {{passes through a}} hole in the pipe. Acoustic sensors affixed to the outside of the pipeline create a baseline acoustic “fingerprint” of the line from the internal noise of the pipeline in its undamaged state. When a leak occurs, a resulting low frequency acoustic signal is detected and analysed. Deviations from the baseline “fingerprint” signal an alarm.Now sensors are having better arrangement with frequency band selection, time delay range selection etc. This makes the graphs more distinct and easy to analyse.There are other ways to detect leakage. Ground geo-phones with <b>filter</b> <b>arrangement</b> are very useful to pinpoint the leakage location. It saves the excavation cost. The water jet in the soil hits the inner wall of soil or concrete. This will create a feeble noise. This noise will decay while coming up on the surface. But the maximum sound can be picked up only over the leakage position. Amplifiers and filter helps to get clear noise. Some types of gases entered into the pipe line will create a range of sounds when leaving the pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Digital cameras use {{photosensitive}} electronics, either {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, {{consisting of a}} large number of single sensor elements, each of which records a measured intensity level. In most digital cameras, the sensor array is covered with a patterned color filter mosaic having red, green, and blue regions in the Bayer <b>filter</b> <b>arrangement,</b> so that each sensor element can record the intensity of a single primary color of light. The camera interpolates the color information of neighboring sensor elements, through a process called demosaicing, to create the final image. These sensor elements are often called [...] "pixels", even though they only record 1 channel (only red, or green, or blue) of the final color image. Thus, two of the three color channels for each sensor must be interpolated and a so-called N-megapixel camera that produces an N-megapixel image provides only one-third of the information that an image of the same size could get from a scanner. Thus, certain color contrasts may look fuzzier than others, depending on the allocation of the primary colors (green has twice as many elements as red or blue in the Bayer arrangement).|$|E

30|$|The wavelet {{transform}} (WT)-based JPEG 2000 {{is a standard}} for the compression of digital images that uses a separable lifting structure in which a multidimensional image signal is transformed separately along its horizontal and vertical dimensions. A non-separable three-dimensional (3 D) structure is used to minimize the number of lifting steps in existing methods and can reduce the delay between input and output as each process is implemented by cascading in lifting calculation. This structure reduces rounding noise {{and the number of}} steps of the lifting scheme in the transform. The non-separable 3 D structure in the 5 / 3 -type transform for lossless coding reduces rounding noise, but it increases in the 9 / 7 -type transform for lossy coding in the structure. A combination of 2 D and 3 D non-separable structures for 4 D integer WT has been proposed to solve this problem, but the original <b>filter</b> <b>arrangements</b> need to be preserved to reduce rounding noise. Therefore, in this study, a non-separable 2 D structure for the integer implementation of a 4 D quadruple lifting WT with a 9 / 7 filter is proposed. The proposed {{wavelet transform}} has the same output signal as the conventional separable structure except for the rounding noise. As the order of the original lifting scheme is preserved, rounding noise in pixels of the decoded image can be significantly reduced, and the upper bounds of quality and lossy decoded 4 D medical images can be improved.|$|R
