40|$|In a 4 -year period 45 {{patients}} were admitted to our gastroenterological u nit with acute infective colitis. The endemic pathogens {{responsible for the}} colitis were Yersinia enterocolitica (46 %), Campylobacter fetus jejuni (20 %), common Salmonellae (13 %), less virulent strains of Shigella (9 %), Entamoeba hystolytica (7 %) and Cytomegalovirus (4 %). These microorganisms caused very severe disease in 18 % of the patients, who were mostly predisposed. While Salmonella- and amoebic colitis always mimicked ulcerative colitis {{by the presence of}} diffuse lesions, the other pathogens caused focal colitis, thus necessitating differential diagnosis vis a vis Crohn's colitis. Two patients (4 %) died of complications, while 93 % of the {{patients were}} cured by proper antimicrobial therapy.

DESIGN [...] Retrospective study of subgroup of patients from cohort followed up {{till the end of}} 1986. SETTING [...] Outpatient clinic for children with urinary tract infections. PATIENTS [...] 51 Girls aged under 15 with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria. INTERVENTIONS [...] Before 1982 <b>intercurrent</b> <b>infections</b> (mostly tonsillitis or otitis) were treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin; after 1982 erythromycin treatment was preferred. END POINTS [...] Change of bacterial strain in urinary tract and symptomatic recurrences of disease. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Bacteria identified by serotype and electrophoretic type and compared before and after antibiotic treatment. Bacteriuria eradicated and replaced by new strains in most patients treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin, leading to symptomatic recurrences in about 15 %. Conversely, patients given erythromycin rarely showed change in bacteriuria and none suffered symptomatic recurrence. CONCLUSIONS [...] In girls with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria the use of phenoxymethylpenicillin for <b>intercurrent</b> <b>infections</b> may lead to a change of urinary bacteria and leave them at substantial risk of acute pyelonephritis.

40|$|During {{the course}} of an {{experiment}} previously reported (1), it was noted that rabbits exposed to ultra-violet radiation under certain conditions {{did not appear to be}} in as good physical condition as animals living in an environment from which all light was excluded and were more susceptible to <b>intercurrent</b> <b>infections.</b> With these facts in mind, the experiment was repeated with a view to determining the influence of ultra-violet irradiation on body weight, the chemical composition of the blood, and susceptibility to <b>intercurrent</b> <b>infections</b> of normal and syphilitic animals and on the reaction to syphilitic infection. The present paper will be limited to a report of the results obtained for body weight and susceptibility to <b>intercurrent</b> <b>infections.</b> Material and Methods In the experiment to be reported, 60 male rabbits between 6 and 8 months of age were used. The animals were divided into 6 comparable groups of 10 each, and from the beginning of the experiment on November 27, 1928, until June 15, 1929, these animals were kept in a room from which all light was excluded. They were caged separately, and fed the routine diet of hay, oats, and cabbage. The temperature of the dark room was satisfactorily maintained at 70 ° to 75 °F. and the humidity varied with that of the outside air. The animals were weighed at weekly intervals. Beginning December 5, 1928, 30 animals, listed as Groups II, IV, and VI were exposed for an hour each day to the unfiltered radiations of a quartz-mercury arc lamp (80 volts, 4. 2 amperes) at a distance of 4. 5 meters. The doors of the cages were open to permit free access of light but no depilatory measures were used and at no time throughout the experiment could there be detected evidence of derma° 253 254 ULTRA-VIOLET RADIATION OF RABBITS tiffs, conjunctivitis, or any other inflammatory process which might be attributed to the action of ultra-violet radiation.
