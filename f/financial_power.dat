5|$|The county number, {{extent and}} {{authority}} have varied significantly, reflecting: {{changes in the}} monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and political changes through several centuries. In the 13th and 14th century, the Croatian nobility grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a legislative framework, while military and <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with county administration in this period included the Roman Catholic Church and the free royal cities, and separately the cities of Dalmatia. After Croatia became a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, when La Follette {{went back}} to Washington, D.C., the American economy had changed due to an {{increasing}} number of mergers that consolidated <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> in fewer hands. Senators Nelson Aldrich and John C. Spooner were widely seen as representing the interests of these fiscal elite. Journalist David Graham Phillips wrote a series of articles decrying corruption and subservience to corporate interests within the body entitled Treason of the Senate.|$|E

After having changed the policies and opened the market, Vietnam was finally able to earn foreign exchange within these years and hence gain <b>financial</b> <b>power.</b> The domestic economy grew rapidly. Nowadays, irrigated agriculture is by far the largest water user and although the country is developing very fast, agriculture which is predicted to grow moderately remains to be an important employer in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The {{consolidation}} of the British East India Company's rule in the Indian subcontinent during the 18th century brought about socio-economic changes {{which led to the}} rise of an Indian middle class and steadily eroded pre-colonial socio-religious institutions and barriers. The emerging economic and <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> of Indian business-owners and merchants and the professional class brought them increasingly into conflict with the British Raj. A rising political consciousness among the native Indian social elite (including lawyers, doctors, university graduates, government officials and similar groups) spawned an Indian identity and fed a growing nationalist sentiment in India in the last decades of the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Catiline {{was born}} in 108 BC {{to one of the}} oldest patrician {{families}} in Rome, gens Sergia. Although his family was of consular heritage, they were then declining in both social and financial fortunes. Virgil later gave the family an ancestor, Sergestus, who had come with Aeneas to Italy, presumably because they were notably ancient; but they had not been prominent for centuries. The last Sergius to be consul had been Gnaeus Sergius Fidenas Coxo in 380 BC. Later, these factors would dramatically shape Catiline's ambitions and goals as he would desire above all else to restore the political heritage of his family along with its <b>financial</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} World War I, Great Britain {{was heavily}} indebted to the United States, {{allowing}} the USA to largely displace it as the world's number-one <b>financial</b> <b>power.</b> The United States, however, was reluctant to assume Great Britain's leadership role, partly due to isolationist influences and a focus on domestic concerns. In contrast to Great Britain in the previous era, capital exports from the US were not countercyclical. They expanded rapidly with the United States's {{economic growth in the}} 20s up to 1928, but then almost completely halted as the US economy began slowing in that year. As the Great Depression intensified in 1930, financial institutions were hit hard along with trade; in 1930 alone, 1345 US banks collapsed.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 University of London Act saw the {{university}} {{defined as a}} federation of self-governing colleges, starting the process of decentralisation {{that would lead to}} a marked transference of academic and <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> in this period from the central authorities in Senate House to the individual colleges. In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporate in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited {{the main body of the}} college with the corporation formed in 1829. One of the largest shifts in power of this period came in 1993, when HEFCE switched from funding the University of London, which then allocated money to the colleges, to funding the colleges directly and them paying a contribution to the University.|$|E
25|$|After Epstein's {{death on}} 27 August 1967, Lennon and McCartney sought to renegotiate their {{publishing}} deal with James. In 1968 they invited James {{for a meeting}} at Apple Records; filming the encounter and acting brusquely towards him. As a result, already-cool relations between James and the individual Beatles became even cooler. Early in 1969, James and Silver abruptly sold their shares in Northern Songs to ATV Music for £1,525,000, giving Lennon and McCartney no notice or the chance to buy them out. Lennon learned of the sale from a morning newspaper during his honeymoon with Yoko Ono, and immediately called McCartney. Lennon and McCartney attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company but their bid, part {{of a long and}} acrimonious fight, ultimately failed. The <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> of Lew Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV Music.

25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the reign of}} two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, {{it is understandable that}} pagans simply did not embrace Julian's idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian's public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian’s attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion with some of the same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity. For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> who organized festivals and helped pay for them. Yet Julian’s attempt to impose moral strictness on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism’s system of tradition.|$|E
25|$|Numerous known abolitionists lived, worked, and worshipped in {{downtown}} Brooklyn, from Henry Ward Beecher, who auctioned slaves into {{freedom from the}} pulpit of Plymouth Church, to Nathan Egelston, {{a leader of the}} African and Foreign Antislavery Society, who also preached at Bridge Street AME and lived on Duffield Street. His fellow Duffield Street residents, Thomas and Harriet Truesdell were leading members of the Abolitionist movement. Mr. Truesdell was {{a founding member of the}} Providence Anti-slavery Society before moving to Brooklyn in 1851. Harriet Truesdell was also very active in the movement, organizing an antislavery convention in Pennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia. The Tuesdell's lived at 227 Duffield Street. Another prominent Brooklyn-based abolitionist was Rev. Joshua Leavitt, trained as a lawyer at Yale who stopped practicing law in order to attend Yale Divinity School, and subsequently edited the abolitionist newspaper The Emancipator and campaigned against slavery, as well as advocating other social reforms. In 1841, Leavitt published his The <b>Financial</b> <b>Power</b> of Slavery, which argued that the South was draining the national economy due to its reliance on slavery.|$|E

The emerging economic and <b>financial</b> <b>power</b> of Indian business-owners and merchants and the professional class brought them increasingly into conflict with the British Raj. A rising political consciousness among the native Indian social elite (including lawyers, doctors, university graduates, government officials and similar groups) spawned an Indian identity and fed a growing nationalist sentiment in India in the last decades of the nineteenth century. The creation in 1885 of the Indian National Congress in India by the political reformer A.O. Hume intensified the process by providing an important platform from which demands could be made for political liberalisation, increased autonomy, and social reform. The leaders of the Congress advocated dialogue and debate with the Raj administration to achieve their political goals. Distinct from these moderate voices (or loyalists) who did not preach or support violence was the nationalist movement, which grew particularly strong, radical and violent in Bengal and in Punjab. Notable but smaller movements also appeared in Maharashtra, Madras and other areas across the south.|$|E
