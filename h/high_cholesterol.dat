5|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{isolated}} high LDL and clinical criteria (which differ by country), genetic testing for LDL receptor mutations and ApoB mutations can be performed. Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80% of cases; those without a mutation often have higher triglyceride levels and may in fact have other causes for their <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> such as combined hyperlipidemia due to metabolic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{is used in}} {{traditional}} medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful {{in the treatment of}} high blood pressure, <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, cystitis, digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases. For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally silver birch is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol</b> can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E

We addressed the mechanism by which <b>high</b> dietary <b>cholesterol</b> could be detrimental to periodontal health in a rat model. Feeding a high-cholesterol diet augmented the effects of bacterial pathogens and their products (e. g., lipopolysaccharide and proteases) on production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in fibroblasts. <b>High</b> dietary <b>cholesterol</b> also increased mitochondrial 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine in the periodontal tissues.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of red pepper seeds powder on lipid metabolism in rats fed <b>high</b> fatㆍhigh <b>cholesterol</b> diet. Rats were divided into five experimental groups: normal diet group, <b>high</b> fatㆍhigh <b>cholesterol</b> diet group, <b>high</b> fatㆍhigh <b>cholesterol</b> diet with 5 % red pepper seeds powder supple-mented group (SA group), <b>high</b> fatㆍhigh <b>cholesterol</b> diet with 10 % red pepper seeds powder supplemented group (SB group) and <b>high</b> fatㆍhigh <b>cholesterol</b> diet with 15 % red peeper seeds powder supplemented group (SC group). The serum triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol contents, and LDL-cholesterol and atherogenic index (AI) of the red pepper seed powder supplemented groups were significantly decreased compared to the HF group. The serum HDL-cholesterol contents of the red pepper seed powder supplemented groups were increased compared to the HF group. However, there was no significant difference in the serum HDL-cholesterol among all experimental groups. The hepatic TG and cholesterol contents of the red pepper seed powder supplemented groups were sig-nificantly decreased compared to the HF group. The fecal total cholesterol and triglyceride contents of the red pepper seeds powder supplemented groups were significantly increased compared to the HF group. These results suggest that supplementation of red pepper seed powder may have a pronounced impact on markers of lipid metabo-lism in serum and liver of rats fed <b>high</b> fatㆍhigh <b>cholesterol</b> diets...|$|R

5|$|The Norwegian {{physician}} Dr C. Müller first associated {{the physical}} signs, <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels and autosomal dominant inheritance in 1938. In the early 1970s and 1980s, the genetic cause for FH {{was described by}} Dr Joseph L. Goldstein and Dr Michael S. Brown of Dallas, Texas. Initially, they found increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase, but studies showed that this did not explain the very abnormal cholesterol levels in people with FH. The focus shifted to the binding of LDL to its receptor, and effects of impaired binding on metabolism; this {{proved to be the}} underlying mechanism for FH. Subsequently, numerous mutations in the protein were directly identified by sequencing. They later won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of the LDL receptor and its impact on lipoprotein metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have {{become an integral part}} of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as <b>high</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels and heart disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Plasma {{triglyceride}} and <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> {{levels are}} inversely correlated {{and both are}} genetically related. Two correlated traits may be influenced both by shared and unshared genes. The power to detect unshared trait-specific genes may be increased by incorporating correlated traits as covariates. The power to localize the shared genes may be improved by bivariate analysis. Univariate genome scans were carried out on triglyceride (<b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol)</b> with and without using <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> (triglyceride) as a covariate, and bivariate linkage analysis on triglyceride and <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol</b> using the 330 Framingham pedigrees of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 13 data. The results of five genome scans were compared to determine the chromosomal regions which may harbor the genes influencing variation specific to triglycerides, specific to <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol,</b> or the covariation of both triglyceride and <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol.</b> Results The results of our five genome scans identified some chromosomal regions with possible quantitative trait loci (QTL) that may specifically influence one trait, such as the regions on chromosome 1 (at 1 cM near marker 280 we 5), on <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol,</b> or control the covariation of both traits, such as the regions on chromosome 7 (at 169 cM near marker GATA 30 D 09), chromosome 12 (at 3 cM near marker GATA 4 H 03), chromosome 20 (at 49 cM near marker GATA 29 F 06), chromosome 2 (at 146 cM near marker GATA 8 H 05), and chromosome 6 (at 148 cM near marker GATA 184 A 08) on triglyceride and <b>high</b> density lipoprotein <b>cholesterol.</b> The one on chromosome 6 had a LOD score of 3. 1 with the bivariate linkage analysis.
