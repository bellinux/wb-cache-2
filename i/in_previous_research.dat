Cultivating methods have several disadvantages. Culture-based methods are known to underestimate environmental microbial diversity, {{based on the fact}} that only a small percentage of microbes can be cultivated in the laboratory. This underestimation is likely to be signified for the quantification of bioaerosol, since colony counts of airborne microbes are typically quite different from direct counts. Culture-based methods also need relatively long incubation times (over 24 hours) and are labor-intensive. Consequently, culture-based methods are no longer suitable for effective and rapid identification and quantification of bioaerosol, and non-culture based methods, such as immunoassays, molecular biological tests, and optical, and electrical methods, have been developing over the past few decades.|$|E
