40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three essays that investigate the momentum effect and the short-run predictability in currency carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits.</b> The first essay investigates whether tail risks of momentum strategies make them unattractive within the context of prospect utility. Momentum returns have strongly asymmetric tail risks and that asymmetric tail risk is precisely what makes momentum strategies unattractive. This study is the first to document the undesirable tail risk characteristics of momentum returns. The second essay uncovers economically significant predictability in carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from shorting the low-yielding currencies. The monthly world equity index return, monthly changes in currency volatility and monthly changes in equity volatility predict carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from the short leg two months later, while monthly changes in commodity prices, monthly changes in currency volatility and monthly changes in equity volatility predict carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from the long leg three months later. Investors could have used the discovered leg-specific predictability to time the market and improve their trading outcomes, instead of staying fully invested or predicting carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from both legs with a single model. Evidence from two tests conducted in this essay points towards the gradual information diffusion model as the most likely explanation for the discovered predictability, while timevarying risk premia do not seem to explain this effect. The last essay examines return predictability among carry trades, stocks and commodities in a dynamic vector autoregression setting. The predictive effect goes from commodities to stock, from stocks to low-yielding currencies and from commodities to high-yielding currencies. Variables in these markets are more strongly correlated in the high-risk regime than in the low-risk regime. Drops in the world equity index (commodity prices), but not rises, predict decreases in carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from low-yielding (high-yielding) currencies. Increases in currency volatility, but not decreases, predict drops in carry <b>trade</b> <b>profits</b> from low-yielding currencies. The in- sample asymmetric effects also exist out-of-sample, but these asymmetric prediction models do not consistently deliver better forecasts than symmetric models...|$|R
40|$|Objective of {{the study}} is to further {{investigate}} pairs trading strategy on the U. S. equity markets and the possible explanations for the strategy profits. The main contribution {{of the study}} to the existing literature is to provide a thorough empirical study of pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> and to examine the unexplored link between pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> and short-term return reversals. In addition, this thesis studies pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> in different market conditions and the exposure of the pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> to known market risk factors. The data used in the empirical study comprises of daily stock market return data for the S&P 500 equity index constituents from December 1967 to December 2009. The data set is extracted from Center for Research in Security Price (CRSP) database, consisting of observations for 10824 days and 1331 unique S&P 500 constituents. The main findings of the thesis show that the pairs trading strategy yields markedly higher risk adjusted returns compared to the S&P 500 benchmark index, which are comparable in size to the earlier studies on the topic. According to the return analysis, the strategy on average yields small but positive returns for majority of the periods, but the returns are at least to some extent driven by small number of high return periods. I also find that pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> persist over time, contrary to earlier studies, and profits to be dependent on the overall market conditions. Although the returns show some time variation, the returns persist also to this day. The pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> are highly exposed to funding liquidity risk as well as overall equity market volatility, which imply that arbitrageurs are constrained to enforce relative pricing discrepancies. The exposure the overall market conditions might prove trading according to the pairs trading strategy difficult in practice. The main finding and largest contribution to the previous literature is that pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> are independent of short-term reversals and therefore independent of liquidity provision. The <b>profits</b> from pairs <b>trading</b> are statistically highly significant and are not explained by the relevant factors included in the factor model. I find pairs <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> to have a statistically significant negative correlation with market excess return and Fama/French Small Minus Big factor and positively correlated with medium-term momentum profits. So far, pairs trading remains as a unique anomaly, unexplained by the academic finance community...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} robust {{tests of}} market efficiency using statistical arbitrage which circumvent the joint-hypotheses dilemma confounding the traditional literature. Hogan, Jarrow, Teo and Warachka (2004) identify statistical arbitrage opportunities in momentum and value strategies. However, their results {{are sensitive to}} the assumption that expected incremental <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> are constant. We demonstrate that this empirical discrepancy results from a lack of statistical power in their Bonferroni test procedure. To resolve the disparity, we propose a Min-t test statistic for trading strategies with time-varying expected profits. This procedure is then extended to examine autocorrelated and non-normal <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> innovations. According to the Min-t statistic, conclusions regarding market efficiency are consistent across various <b>trading</b> <b>profit</b> assumptions. Furthermore, a robust methodology to determine a trading strategy’s convergence rate to arbitrage is provided. Overall, our results confirm the appropriateness of statistical arbitrage as a test of market efficiency. ...|$|R

30|$|The recent trade {{literature}} has been increasingly focusing on trade in value added as against <b>gross</b> <b>trade</b> provided in official trade statistics. Foster-McGregor et al. [1], OECD-WTO [2] with {{the fragmentation of}} production processes across borders and the intensification of interconnectedness within supply chains, notably in East Asia, the importance of trade in intermediates has increased significantly in both goods and services trade. Hayakawa [3], Meng et al. [4], Miroudot et al. [5] official statistics on <b>gross</b> <b>trade</b> such as customs-clearance statistics include both final products and intermediates. The picture given by <b>gross</b> <b>trade</b> can be quite different from that by trade in value added; since in today’s production networks in East Asia, {{it is possible that}} the same intermediate goods and services are recorded many times as they go through customs. Value added generated by both domestic and foreign final demand, on the other hand, is more closely related with wages and employment, corporate profits, tax revenues, and finally national income. Data on gross exports and imports, however, are no less useful than before because they are indispensable to understand the technological structure of the cross-border production processes.|$|R
40|$|Roughly speaking, {{statistical}} arbitrage {{is a long}} horizon trading {{strategy that}} generates a riskless profit. The concept of statistical arbitrage is motivated by numerous empirical studies that construct <b>trading</b> strategies to <b>profit</b> from persistent anomalies. However, we demonstrate by example that positive expected <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> are not sufficient to reject market efficiency. Instead, this paper provides a methodology to test for statistical arbitrage whose existence is incompatible with market efficiency. Furthermore, statistical arbitrage circumvents the traditional joint hypothesis dilemma of traditional tests for market efficiency because its definition is independent of any equilibrium model. Instead, we replace a particular equilibrium model with a stochastic process that describes the dynamics of <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> generated by <b>trading</b> strategies. The assumed stochastic process may be verified with a secondary goodness-of-fit test. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} CEO <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> in their company’s stock {{and the quality of}} the CEO in running the company. The analysis of the paper distinguishes between two possible hypotheses that describe the relation between CEO <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> and firm performance. A negative relation is expected if CEOs use their access to important nonpublic information to enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders. In this case better CEO trading is associated with higher levels of agency costs and reduced company performance. An alternative view is that a positive relation between CEO <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> and firm performance is expected because both types of decisions require an understanding of how the economic environment affects the firm. In this latter case, CEO <b>trading</b> <b>profits</b> is associated with managerial talent. The empirical results of the paper show that on average CEOs trade well. It is found that 70 % of the time CEO trade better than the average investor. More importantly, this paper finds that CEOs who trade in their firm’s stock better than their industry’s peers demonstrate superior performance in running their firms. In further support to the association between managerial talent and timing ability, those CEOs with better ability to time their trades have a higher level of compensation, are employed by companies that demonstrate good corporate governance, and head their respective firms for longer periods. This is consistent with a notion that the quality of both trading and managerial decisions depends on the CEO’s ability to infer how the economic environment affects the firm...|$|R
