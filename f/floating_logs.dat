5|$|Mating {{occurs on}} dry land, but the females {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back up the beach. The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land. Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts can be a very significant part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E

25|$|The {{next several}} years saw two {{developments}} that made the Susquehanna boom and the sawmills associated with it feasible. The first was the development of reliable means of transportation, with {{the completion of the}} West Susquehanna Branch of the Pennsylvania Canal to Williamsport in 1834 and opening of the first railroad in 1839. These allowed finished wood products to be taken to markets year-round, instead of just <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> and rafts down the river during Spring and high water. The second was the gradual development and acceptance of steam engines to power sawmills, allowing large mills to operate without water-power.|$|E

25|$|Peter Herdic {{moved to}} Williamsport in 1853, {{which was then}} a small village of 1,700 people {{surrounded}} by vast stands of virgin hemlock, white pine and various hardwoods. The lumber industry had existed in Lycoming County since the first Europeans arrived prior to the American Revolution, {{but it did not}} become the land-changing and eco-system altering industry until Peter Herdic and men like him arrived on the scene in the mid-19th century. The lumber era began in force in 1846 when the Susquehanna Boom, a series of cribs for holding and storing <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> on the West Branch Susquehanna River was built under the leadership of James Perkins. Herdic was able to use his business sense, leadership abilities, and according to some questionable business tactics to rapidly acquire wealth by buying and selling several tracts of timber and several sawmills. He used his gains to purchase several tracts of land in Williamsport, more sawmills, and eventually the Susquehanna Boom.|$|E
25|$|The park {{takes its}} name from William Parker, who leased lumbering rights from John Otto. Parker built a splash dam on Laurel Run {{at the site of the}} present lake. Lumbering began as early as 1794 in Clearfield County, {{harvesting}} the white pine and hemlock which covered the mountainsides. The tall white pines fetched a high price in Baltimore for use as masts. Logs were floated all the way to Baltimore by way of the Susquehanna River. Logging picked up in force during the 1850s when the Susquehanna Boom was built across the West Branch Susquehanna River at Williamsport. The boom stopped the <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> for sorting and cutting at the sawmills. Later, railroads and roads were built by the lumber companies to harvest and distribute the timber. The railroads replaced the floating of the logs down the creeks and into the West Branch. The lumber boom era was not to last, and soon all the trees were gone. Once the trees disappeared, the people were soon to follow. The lumbermen left behind a barren landscape that was devastated by erosion, flooding and wildfires for twenty years. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought the thousands of acres of deforested and burned land. The state began the massive project of reforesting the land. The young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps led the reforestation effort. They also built miles of road, many bridges, cleared streams and built the facilities at Parker Dam State Park.|$|E
500|$|Cornwell {{and brother}} John Jacob were s and {{shareholders}} of the South Branch Boom and Lumber Company following {{the issue of}} its incorporation [...] on May 1, 1901. Its principal office was located in Romney, West Virginia. The company constructed a log boom on the South Branch Potomac River to collect and contain <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> timbered from nearby forests. They were also corporators and shareholders of the Potomac White Sand Company of Green Spring, West Virginia, following the issue of its incorporation charter on May 10, 1902. This company engaged in the mining, preparation, manufacturing, and distribution of sand and other extracted minerals.|$|E

500|$|A Lock Haven log boom, {{smaller than}} but {{otherwise}} {{similar to the}} Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport, was constructed in 1849. Large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the Dunnstown Dam, named for a settlement on the shore opposite Lock Haven. The piers, about [...] from one another, stretched in {{a line from the}} dam to a point [...] upriver. Connected by timbers shackled together with iron yokes and rings, the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced <b>floating</b> <b>logs.</b> Workers called boom rats sorted the captured logs, branded like cattle, for delivery to sawmills and other owners. Lock Haven became the lumber center of Clinton County and the site of many businesses related to forest products.|$|E

2500|$|Springer had {{developed}} a pattern of approaching and rubbing against boats, creating {{a high risk of}} being hit by a vessel in the busy area or capsizing a small boat. One local Seattle-based group, Project SeaWolf Coastal Protection, led by whale advocate Michael Kundu, Seattle media personality Bob McLaughlin, and Robert Wood of the American Cetacean Society, began regularly observing and tracking the calf on the water, and documented a number of orca-boat interactions, including potentially dangerous interactions with private boats and a Washington State ferry. Her attraction to boats and <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> was attributed to needing social interaction and touch. Dr. John Ford observed later that, [...] "She didn't have whales to associate with down there, so boats sort of became a replacement for that for social reasons." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, a {{cell phone}} video {{captured}} two dark shapes in the water. A suggested {{explanation is that the}} video shows two logs. Radford analyzed the video for Discovery News and concluded that “The video quality is poor and the camera is shaky, but {{a closer look at the}} 30-second video reveals that, instead of one long object, there are actually two shorter ones, and they seem to be floating next to each other at slightly different angles. There are no humps, nor head, nor form; only two long, darkish, more or less straight forms that appear to be a few dozen feet long. In short, they look a lot like <b>floating</b> <b>logs,</b> which would not be surprising since Lake Okanagan has tens of thousands of logs harvested by the timber industry floating just under the lake's surface." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} part of the 19th century, logging was the {{principal}} commercial activity in the area. It produced as much as 50 million board feet (120,000 m³) of lumber annually. Workers <b>floated</b> <b>logs</b> downriver on the Delaware to markets in Easton or Trenton.|$|R

60|$|On Rancocus Island, however, Bigelow {{had made}} a very ingenious canal, that was of vast service in <b>floating</b> <b>logs</b> to the mill.

50|$|A splash dam was a {{temporary}} wooden dam used {{to raise the}} water level in streams to <b>float</b> <b>logs</b> downstream to sawmills.
