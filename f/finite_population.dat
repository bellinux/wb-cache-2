In {{the first part of}} this paper we investigate the phenomenon of drift reversal in <b>finite</b> <b>populations,</b> taking into account that drift is a local quantity in strategy space. Secondly, we study a simple imitation dynamics, and show that it can lead to fixation at internal mixed-strategy fixed points even in <b>finite</b> <b>populations.</b> Imitation in infinite populations is adequately described by conventional replicator dynamics, and these equations are known to have internal fixed points. Internal absorption in <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> on the other hand is a novel dynamic phenomenon.

40|$|We study {{evolutionary}} game {{dynamics in}} <b>finite</b> <b>populations.</b> We analyze an evolutionary process, {{which we call}} pairwise comparison, for which we adopt the ubiquitous Fermi distribution function from statistical mechanics. The inverse temperature in this process controls the intensity of selection, leading to a unified framework for evolutionary dynamics at all intensities of selection, from random drift to imitation dynamics. We derive a simple closed formula that determines the feasibility of cooperation in <b>finite</b> <b>populations,</b> whenever cooperation is modeled in terms of any symmetric two-person game. In contrast with previous results, the present formula is valid at all intensities of selection and for any initial condition. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of cooperators in <b>finite</b> <b>populations,</b> and study the interplay between intensity of selection and the remnants of interior fixed points in infinite populations, {{as a function of}} a given initial number of cooperators, showing how this interplay strongly affects the approach to fixation of a given trait in <b>finite</b> <b>populations,</b> leading to counterintuitive results at different intensities of selection...|$|R

40|$|Any {{mechanism}} of language acquisition can only learn a restricted set of grammars. The human brain contains {{a mechanism for}} language acquisition which can learn a restricted set of grammars. The theoryof this restricted set is universal grammar (UG). UG has to be sufficiently specific to induce linguistic coherence in a population. This phenomenon is known as "coherence threshold". Previously, we have calculated the coherence threshold for deterministic dynamics and infinitely large populations. Here, we extend the framework to stochastic processes and <b>finite</b> <b>populations.</b> If there is selection for communicative function (selective language dynamics), then the analytic results for infinite populations are excellent approximations for finite populations; as expected, <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> need a slightlyhigher accuracyof language acquisition to maintain coherence.

40|$|In {{stochastic}} dynamical systems, different {{concepts of}} stability {{can be obtained}} in different limits. A particularly interesting example is evolutionary game theory, which is traditionally based on infinite populations, where strict Nash equilibria correspond to stable fixed points that are always evolutionarily stable. However, in <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> stochastic effects can drive the system away from strict Nash equilibria, which {{gives rise to a}} new concept for evolutionary stability. The conventional and the new stability concepts may apparently contradict each other leading to conflicting predictions in large yet <b>finite</b> <b>populations.</b> We show that the two concepts can be derived from the frequency dependent Moran process in different limits.

40|$|A strong {{assumption}} made {{in evolutionary}} game theory (EGT) [7] {{is that the}} evolving population is infinitely large. Recent simulations by Fogel, et al, [3, 4, 5] show that <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> produce behavior that, at best, deviate with statistical significance from the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) predicted by EGT.

By paying particular attention to the operation of the selection mechanisms used by Fogel, et al, we are able to account for the divergence between ESS predictions (based on infinite populations) and results observed in our own finite-population simulations.

We thus conclude that the dynamics of EGT, and particularly ESSs, can indeed apply to finite-population systems. 1 Intro [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{sampling}} <b>ﬁnite</b> <b>populations,</b> several resampling schemes {{have been}} proposed. The common {{starting point is}} that, despite its excellent asymptotic properties, Efron’s original bootstrap only works for i. i. d. data. This condition is not met in sampling <b>ﬁnite</b> <b>populations,</b> because of the dependence among units due to the sampling design. Hence, adaptations are needed {{to account for the}} non i. i. d. nature of data. Different versions of the standard bootstrap algorithm have been proposed in the literature. A new class of resampling procedures for <b>ﬁnite</b> <b>populations</b> is deﬁned. Such a class appears to provide a uniﬁed framework that allows for encompassing other resampling algorithms already proposed. Its main theoretical justiﬁcation is based on asymptotic, large sample arguments: the probability distribution of the original statistic and its approximation based on resampling converge to the same limit. Technically speaking, it is shown that a “ﬁnite population version” of the empirical process and its “resampled form” weakly converge to the same limiting Gaussian process. In a sense, this justiﬁcation is similar to those given for classical bootstrap...|$|R

In this paper, we show that this approach can also be made to work in <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> and we assume here that the population has a homogeneous structure, such as an island model. We demonstrate that, under the assumption that genetic effects are small and additive, the resulting formulation of inclusive fitness is equivalent to other significant measures of selection in <b>finite</b> <b>populations,</b> including the change in average allele frequency and fixation probability.

40|$|Recombination can impede {{ecological}} speciation with {{gene flow}} by mixing locally adapted genotypes with maladapted migrant genotypes from a divergent population. In such a scenario, suppression of recombination can be selectively favoured. However, in <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> evolving {{under the influence}} of random genetic drift, recombination can also facilitate adaptation by reducing Hill-Robertson interference between loci under selection. In this case, increased recombination rates can be favoured. Although these two major effects on recombination have been studied individually, their joint effect on ecological speciation with gene flow remains unexplored. Using a mathematical model, we investigated the evolution of recombination rates in two <b>finite</b> <b>populations</b> that exchange migrants while adapting to contrasting environments. Our results indicate a two-step dynamic where increased recombination is first favoured (in response to the Hill-Robertson effect), and then disfavoured, as the cost of recombining locally with maladapted migrant genotypes increases over time (the maladaptive gene flow effect). In larger populations, a stronger initial benefit for recombination was observed, whereas high migration rates intensify the long-term cost of recombination. These dynamics may have important implications for our understanding of the conditions that facilitate incipient speciation with gene flow and the evolution of recombination in <b>finite</b> <b>populations...</b>|$|R
