2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{residents}} {{are coming up}} with plans {{to get into the}} castle and steal Excalibur, but Zelena already <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> in, having studied the place, on the condition that her powers were restored. As Regina, Hook, David, and Robin sneak their way into the castle, Regina asked Mary Margaret to watch Zelena, with her cuff still on. At the same time, Arthur had other plans for {{the residents}}, as he showed Guinevere a potion that melts anything that it touches. It also turns out that Zelena had double crossed her fellow Storybrookers by tricking Mary Margaret with fake contractions, before knocking her out and tying her up. When they reached the Round Table, Regina freezes Arthur, and they are ready to take the sword from Arthur, only to discover that Zelena was working with Arthur and tethered Merlin to Excalibur, which now bears an inscription of his name. (This spell introduced Dark Magic into Merlin's body.) Despite David's pleas, Arthur uses the sword to summon Merlin. As Merlin and Emma are returning to Camelot, Emma discovers that Merlin is missing, even as he appears in front of Arthur. Arthur forces Merlin to disarm the others, but Merlin informs him that Emma had passed her test, and that he had what he needed to unite Excalibur. However, Arthur refuses to give Merlin the sword, in hopes of obtaining more glory, before ordering Merlin to make the [...] "intruders" [...] disappear.|$|E

60|$|Manawyddan {{the prince}} {{and his friend}} Pryderi were wanderers, for the brother of Manawyddan had been slain, and his throne taken from him. Very sorrowful was Manawyddan, but Pryderi was stout of heart, and bade him be of good cheer, as he <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out of his trouble.|$|E
60|$|Lee Rundle {{suggested}} that we rig out a camping outfit, hire a surveyor to run out the line from the Spanish mission, and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in Fort Worth. But, without being highly educated, I <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to save time and expense.|$|E
60|$|Already Mrs Verloc {{was regretting}} her words. They had sounded more unkind than she meant them to be. They had also the unwisdom of {{unnecessary}} things. In fact, {{she had not}} meant them at all. It {{was a sort of}} phrase that is suggested by the demon of perverse inspiration. But she <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to make it as if it had not been.|$|E

60|$|But Midas <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to {{make them}} far more precious, {{according}} to his way of thinking, than roses had ever been before. So he took great pains in going from bush to bush, and exercised his magic touch most indefatigably; until every individual flower and bud, and even the worms {{at the heart of}} some of them, were changed to gold. By the time this good work was completed, King Midas was summoned to breakfast; and as the morning air had given him an excellent appetite, he made haste back to the palace.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Draw your blades!' cried Eurymachus to the others; 'draw your blades, {{and hold}} up the tables as shields against this man's arrows. Have at him, and drive him from the doorway.' He drew his own sword, and leaped on Ulysses with a cry, but the swift arrow pierced his breast, and he fell and died. Then Amphinomus rushed towards Ulysses, but Telemachus sent his spear from behind through his shoulders. He could not draw forth the spear, but he ran to his father, and said, 'Let me bring shields, spears, and helmets from the inner chamber, for us, and for the swineherd and cowherd.' 'Go!' said Ulysses, and Telemachus ran through a narrow doorway, down a gallery to the secret chamber, and brought four shields, four helmets, and eight spears, and the men armed themselves, while Ulysses kept {{shooting}} down the wooers. When his arrows were spent he armed himself, protected by the other three. But the goatherd, Melanthius, <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of reaching the armoury, and he climbed up, and brought twelve helmets, spears, and shields to the wooers.|$|E
60|$|The Negro assented with a grunt. He had {{no desire}} to follow this strange white man who was afraid at night; he had less to remain at the tender mercies of the Big Bwana's lusty warriors, between whom and his people there was long-standing blood feud; and he was more than delighted, into the bargain, for a {{legitimate}} excuse for deserting his much hated Swede master. He <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to the north and his own country that the white men did not know--a short cut across an arid plateau where lay water holes of which the white hunters and explorers that had passed from time to time the fringe of the dry country had never dreamed. He might even elude the Big Bwana should he follow them, and with this thought uppermost in his mind he gathered the remnants of Malbihn's safari into a semblance of order and moved off toward the north. And toward the southwest the black boy led the Hon. Morison Baynes into the jungles.|$|E

50|$|Arthur and Edward near Lydbrook {{was also}} known as Waterloo. (NCB) The pit had a Cornish pumping engine until the early 1860s. In 1949 the pit was flooded by an inrush {{of water from the}} old East Slade Pit but one miner <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out through old {{workings}} and led his four colleagues to safety at Pludds Colliery.|$|E
50|$|Purgatori {{was born}} in Egypt around 1390 BC, {{and raised in the}} city of Alexandria. Her {{parentage}} is unknown, save that she has the blood of the Fallen Angels in her veins. Her human name is Sakkara, and she was part of the team of slaves that built the burial tomb for Queen Ostraca. Sakkara's job was to grind corn all day under the desert sun, and she was constantly whipped by the brutish male guards. Amongst the slaves was a foreigner, an old man of Celtic origin who told Sakkara he <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to escape slavery and achieve immortality.|$|E
5000|$|Paul Sumner {{created the}} Upper Deck concept in 1987. He worked in {{printing}} sales {{and came up}} with the idea for a premium card. When he heard about card counterfeiting, he realized that he <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to protect cards. He had studied holograms in college and had used them in printing his company's brochures. He hired Robert Young Pelton to design and produce a prototype. Pelton designed and produced the cards for Upper Decks first three-year rise. Pelton's agencies, Pelton & Associates and Digital Artists, were replaced by Chiat/Day. Paul Sumner resigned with the understanding that he would be known as the [...] "Co-Founder of Upper Deck", something that the company's owner and CEO, Richard McWilliam, recognized until McWilliam's death in 2013, of unknown causes.|$|E

50|$|A {{king and}} queen had no children, which grieved the queen greatly. To {{alleviate}} the queen's loneliness, they adopted a girl to raise as their own. One day, when the queen saw her adopted daughter playing with a beggar girl, she scolded her adopted daughter and tried to drive the other girl off. However, the beggar girl mentioned that her mother <b>knows</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for the queen to become pregnant.|$|R

50|$|The report {{indicates}} that they greatly misjudged {{the proportions of}} the gorge. On the one hand, they estimated that the canyon was about three to four leagues wide (13-16 km, 8-10 mi), which is quite accurate. At the same time, however, {{they believed that the}} river, which they could see from above, was only 2 m (6 ft) wide (in reality it is about a hundred times wider). Being in dire need of water, and wanting to cross the giant obstacle, the soldiers started searching for a way down to the canyon floor that would be passable for them along with their horses. After three full days, they still had not been successful, and it is speculated that the Hopi, who probably <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> down to the canyon floor, were reluctant to lead them there.|$|E
5000|$|When {{some women}} were hired to examine her, they found he was right; the women {{claimed that they}} had never seen any woman with a mark like that before, and that they {{certainly}} did not have such a mark on their breasts. She was again exposed to the ordeal by water, and this time, she did not pass; when she was brought up from the water, she immediately said that if she had just been able to prepare herself, she <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to pass the test and would have passed it. Håkan ordered her head to be shaved, as was done in Germany with witches, and was then allowed to torture her. She never admitted being a witch despite the torture, but eventually she admitted to having used arsenic to murder her first husband. It was said that she gave this admission without having been asked.|$|E
