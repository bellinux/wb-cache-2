5|$|In December 2005, the USAF {{announced}} that the F-22 had achieved <b>Initial</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Capability</b> (IOC). During Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in June 2006, in simulated combat exercises 12 F-22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses. In the exercises, the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat, with neither loss being an F-22. During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007, 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties. Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s, 6–8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout. No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures; a single F-22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force. F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance.|$|E

40|$|Summit was to {{find ways}} of better {{integrating}} software engineering into the systems engineering and acquisition process. Concurrently, a National Research Council study was addressing the problem of better integrating human factors into the systems engineering and acquisition process. This paper presents a model that emerged from these and related efforts that shows promise of improving these integrations. This model, called the Incremental Commitment Model (ICM), organizes systems engineering and acquisition processes in ways that better accommodate the different strengths and difficulties of hardware, software, and human factors engineering approaches. It also provides points at which they can synchronize and stabilize, and at which their risks of going forward can be better assessed and fitted into a risk-driven stakeholder resource commitment process.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodology behind the GPS End-To-End System Test and Evaluation, where the Global Positioning System is evaluated to determine each segment’s error contribution. The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), recommended in its 2005 Annual Report to Congress that GPS III testing include a system test {{of all three}} segments under realistic operational conditions.

40|$|Devices for lifting, {{translating}} {{and precisely}} placing payloads {{are critical for}} efficient Earth-based construction operations. Both recent and past {{studies have demonstrated that}} devices with similar functionality will be needed to support lunar outpost operations. Although several designs have been developed for Earth based applications, these devices lack unique design characteristics necessary for transport to and use on the harsh lunar surface. These design characteristics include: a) lightweight components, b) compact packaging for launch, c) automated deployment, d) simple in-field reconfiguration and repair, and e) support for tele-operated or automated operations. Also, because the cost to transport mass to the lunar surface is very high, the number of devices that can be dedicated to surface operations will be limited. Thus, in contrast to Earth-based construction, where many single-purpose devices dominate a construction site, a lunar outpost will require a limited number of versatile devices that provide <b>operational</b> benefit from <b>initial</b> construction through sustained operations. The first generation test-bed of a new high performance device, the Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LSMS) has been designed, built and field tested. The LSMS has many unique features resulting in a mass efficient solution to payload handling on the lunar surface. Typically, the LSMS device mass is estimated at approximately 3 % of the mass of the heaviest payload lifted at the tip, or 1. 8 % of the mass of the heaviest mass lifted at the elbow or mid-span of the boom for a high performance variant incorporating advanced structural components. <b>Initial</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the LSMS were successfully demonstrated during field tests at Moses Lake, Washington using a tele-operated approach. Joint angle sensors have been developed for the LSMS to improve operator situational awareness. These same sensors provide the necessary information to support fully automated operations, greatly expanding the operational versatility of the LSMS. This paper develops the equations describing the forward and inverse relation between LSMS joint angles and Cartesian coordinates of the LSMS tip. These equations allow a variety of schemes to be used to maneuver the LSMS to optimize the maneuver. One such scheme will be described in detail that eliminates undesirable swinging of the payload at the conclusion of a maneuver, even when the payload is suspended from a passive rigid link. The swinging is undesirable when performing precision maneuvers, such as aligning an object for mating or positioning a camera. Use of the equations described here enables automated control of the LSMS greatly improving its operational versatility...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to explore}} the effect of supply chain {{integration}} (SCI) on <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Using data collected from 201 Malaysian small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) and rigorous structural equation modeling methods, a total of one main effect and four sub-effects were hypothesized and tested. All the proposed hypotheses {{were found to be}} significant, suggesting positive relationships between SCI and <b>operational</b> <b>capability,</b> as well as between sub-constructs of SCI and <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Overall, the findings are particularly important for SMMs owing to resource paucity and the need to draw upon SCI in order to ensure a sustainable <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Recommendations for how to improve <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> are provided accordingly...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between supply chain practices and business performance {{has been widely}} investigated by many academics and practitioners; however, the relationship is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the relevance of several prominent theories in strategic management for explaining the mediating role of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in the {{relationship between}} supply chain practices and business performance. The resource-based view of the firm and neo-institutional theory are reviewed for their applicability to relate supply chain practices and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in explaining sustained business performance. Supply chain practices are insufficient to drive business performance. Firms need to be able simultaneously to increase efficiency through supply chain practices and to be innovative through <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Specifically, <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> is forwarded as a key firm-specific capability that can result in significant and long-term improvement in organisational sustainability. <b>Operational</b> <b>capability</b> can serve as a critical mediating factor that better transmits the ambitions of supply chain practices onto business performance. As such, this paper provides a conceptual support to urge further research to empirically evaluate the relationship between supply chain practices, <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> and business performance...|$|R
40|$|Based on the resource-based view of {{the firm}} (RBV) and the resource/capability {{perspective}} of innovation, this study explores the independent and complementary effects of two types of innovation capability (namely product development <b>capability</b> and <b>operational</b> <b>capability)</b> on market performance {{in a sample of}} 2971 Chinese industrial firms. Product development <b>capability</b> and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> have different degrees of firm specificity in terms of the technological complexity of underlying resources. We further explore industry dynamism as an important moderating effect on the relationship between different types of innovation capability and market performance. Our findings suggest that,in the Chinese firms surveyed, both product development and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in innovation positively contribute to market performance. The effect of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> is notably stronger than that of product development capability. We also confirm the complementary effect of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> with product development capability in enhancing market performance. Our findings further suggest that product development capability tends to have a stronger effect on market performance when the level of industry dynamism is low, while the impact of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> on market performance is stronger in industries with a relatively high level of dynamism...|$|R

40|$|Location {{systems are}} seen as a {{promising}} technology for tracking people and objects to improve efficiency and quality in the healthcare domain. To increase the chances of success when introducing this new technology there are certain <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> that need to be understood. The purpose of this Thesis is to explore how these <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> can be assessed by experiment. The thesis proposes a method for describing the <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a location system using a two-dimensional matrix of purposes of location systems in the healthcare domain, as found in literature. Using this matrix it is possible to assess and predict the requirements for a location system based on a classification of the purpose of the installation. Conversely it is possible to use the same matrix to find purposes that can be solved with a given location system. Using the Sonitor Indoor Positioning System it was also demonstrated how the <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a location system could be found through a series of small low cost and low effort experiments. In conclusion three dimensions relating to <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> were identified: granularity, resolution, and concurrency. Granularity and concurrency were shown to be successfully assessed through experiment, while resolution was found analytically. We also found a method to predict the impact of infrastructure size on the <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> of the location system based on the same small experiments. </p...|$|R
