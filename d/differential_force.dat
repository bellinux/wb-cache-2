These so-called tidal forces cause strains on both bodies and may distort them or even, in extreme cases, break one or the other apart.

5000|$|The force {{measurement}} system {{is an important}} part of the Lorentz force velocimetry. With high resolution {{force measurement}} system makes the measurement of even lower conductivity possible.Up to date has the force measurement system continually being developed. At first the pendulum-like setups was used (Figure 5). One of the experimental facilities consists of two high power (410 mT) magnets made of NdFeB suspended by thin wires on both side of channel thereby creating magnetic field perpendicular to the fluid flow, here deflection is measured by interferometer system,. The second setup consists of state-of-art weighting balance system (Figure 6) from which is being hanged optimized magnets on the base of Halbach array system. While the total mass of both magnet systems are equal (1 kg), this system induces 3 times higher system response due to arrangement of individual elements in the array and it's interaction with predefined fluid profile. Here use of very sensitive force measuring devices is desirable, since flow velocity is being converted from the very tiny detected Lorentz Force. This force in combination with unavoidable dead weight [...] of the magnet (...) is around [...] After that, the method of <b>differential</b> <b>force</b> measurement was developed. With this method two balance were used, one with magnet and the other is with same-weight-dummy. In this way the influence of environment would be reduced. Recently, it have been reported that the flow measurements by this method is possible for saltwater flows whose electrical conductivity is as small as 0.06 S/m (range of electrical conductivity of the regular water from tap).|$|E
40|$|A {{mass flow}} sensor for bulk flow {{measurements}} is designed. The sensor consists of a curved chute and the force executed by the flow on the chute is a measure for the force. By properly selecting the projection angle of the force, i. e. {{the direction in which}} the force is measured, the sensor can be made almost independent of the friction coefficient of the bulk. The selection of the projection angle involves an optimisation problem. To carry out the optimisation, a physical model of the <b>differential</b> <b>force</b> is derived. The <b>differential</b> <b>force</b> is the force executed on the chute by an infinitesimal mass. Based on the model of the <b>differential</b> <b>force,</b> a starting value for the optimisation process is computed. After the optimisation the influence of friction on the measurement is less than 0. 5 % per 0. 1 change of the friction coefficient. For some installation conditions, the effect of friction on the force measurement can be completely eliminated. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

Basic properties of the instability without shear are first recalled. Differential rotation is modeled in the shearing sheet approximation, classical in the theory of spiral density waves. The action of differential rotation is reduced to two different effects (i) a linear time-dependence of the radial wavenumber, and (ii) a radial <b>differential</b> <b>force.</b> We present both exact numerical solutions, and approximate analytical ones based on the WKB approximation in the limit of weak differential rotation.

We support our theoretical achievements by several numerical examples, highlighting the potential application of the derived analytic properties.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{universal}} experiment {{to measure the}} <b>differential</b> Casimir <b>force</b> between a Au-coated sphere and two halves of a structured plate covered with a P-doped Si overlayer. The concentration of free charge carriers in the overlayer is chosen slightly below the critical one, f or which the phase transition from dielectric to metal occurs. One ha f of the structured plate is insulating, while its second half is made of gold. For the former we consider two different structures, one consisting of bulk high-resistivity Si and the other of a layer of silica followed by bulk high-resistivity Si. The <b>differential</b> Casimir <b>force</b> is computed within the Lifshitz theory using four approaches that have been proposed in the literature {{to account for the}} role of free charge carriers in metallic and dielectric materials interacting with quantum fluctuations. According to these approaches, Au at low frequencies is described by either the Drude or the plasma model, whereas the free charge carriers in dielectric materials at room temperature are either taken into account or disregarded.
