50|$|The IBM PC {{graphics}} hardware in {{text mode}} uses 16 bits per character. It supports {{a variety of}} configurations, but in its default mode under DOS {{they are used to}} give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages (Code page 437 by default), 16 foreground colors, eight background colors, and a <b>flash</b> <b>option.</b> Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as ANSI art. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the Windows ANSI code page) have largely replaced DOS based ones.|$|E
50|$|Classes {{in studio}} and {{location}} lighting expose students to daylight, tungsten, quartz and electronic <b>flash</b> <b>options.</b> Additionally, understanding additive and subtractive lighting tools, light modifiers, and grip gear are essential. By using lighting and studio techniques from other classes, students capture images either as an original digital file or scan film which then {{allows them to}} work in Photoshop, the industry standard, to craft a finished image.|$|R
50|$|DECserver 708This {{model was}} {{designed}} to replace the DECserver 700-08 and was introduced in 2003. It connects devices (such as printers, terminals, PCs, and modems) to local area networks (LANs). The DECserver 708 is Ethernet-based and supports 10BaseT Ethernet directly, and ThinWire Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 through an adapter. It supports Flash RAM capability and other nonvolatile forms of memory. The memory capability is factory installed. The Flash RAM is optional. The DECserver 708 can download the software image from the network or from the <b>Flash</b> RAM <b>option</b> if installed. The <b>Flash</b> RAM <b>option</b> allows for a boot/power up without having to download the image through the network. The DECserver 708 supports up to 4 MB of memory.|$|R

50|$|LPC2000 is {{a series}} based on a 1.8-volt ARM7TDMI-S core {{operating}} at up to 80 MHz together {{with a variety of}} peripherals including serial interfaces, 10-bit ADC/DAC, timers, capture compare, PWM, USB interface, and external bus <b>options.</b> <b>Flash</b> memory ranges from 32 kB to 512 kB; RAM ranges from 4 kB to 96 kB.|$|R
40|$|Malelane’s boiler {{blow-down}} flash, which was previously rejected to atmosphere, is now recovered into the turbo-alternator exhaust steam range {{and used for}} process heating duty. Various <b>flash</b> vapour recovery <b>options</b> have been evaluated for operability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The design considerations for the blow-down vessel and the valve and piping configuration, which resulted from a Hazop Study, are explained. The recovery of 1. 6 tons per hour of boiler blowdown flash equates to R 260 000 per annum in coal savings...|$|R
40|$|Performance data {{of media}} on helical scan tape systems (4 and 8 mm) is {{presented}} and {{various types of}} media are compared. All measurements were performed on a standard MediaLogic model ML 4500 Tape Evaluator System with a <b>Flash</b> Converter <b>option</b> for time based measurements. The 8 mm tapes are tested on an Exabyte 8200 drive and 4 mm tapes on an Archive Python drive; in both cases, the head transformer is directly connected to a Media Logic Read/Write circuit and test electronics. The drive functions only as a tape transport and its data recover circuits are not used. Signal to Noise, PW 50, Peak Shift and Wear Test data is {{used to compare the}} performance of MP (metal particle), BaFe, and metal evaporate (ME). ME tape is the clear winner in magnetic performance but its susceptibility to wear and corrosion, make it less than ideal for data storage...|$|R
2500|$|On July 20, 2011, Apple {{released}} updates to the 11.6" [...] and 13.3" [...] {{models of}} the MacBook Air, which also became Apple's entry-level laptops due to lowered prices and the discontinuation of the white MacBook around the same time. The mid-2011 MacBook Airs were powered by the new Sandy Bridge 1.6 or 1.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, or 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processors, that came with an Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor, and with a backlit keyboard, two USB 2.0 ports, FaceTime camera, a standard of 2 GB of RAM (configurable up to 4 GB), Thunderbolt which shares function with Mini DisplayPort and Bluetooth was upgraded to v4.0. Maximum SSD <b>flash</b> memory storage <b>options</b> were increased up to 256 GB. [...] Both 11" [...] and 13" [...] models had an analog audio output/headphone minijack (that also supports an iPhone/iPod touch headset with microphone), but only the 13" [...] model had an integrated SDXC-capable SD Card slot. These models use a less expensive [...] "Eagle Ridge" [...] Thunderbolt controller that provides two Thunderbolt channels (2 × 10 Gbit/s bidirectional), compared to the MacBook Pro which uses a [...] "Light Ridge" [...] controller that provides four Thunderbolt channels (4 × 10 Gbit/s bidirectional). A USB ethernet adapter was immediately available upon release and a Thunderbolt-to-Firewire 800 adapter became available in mid-year 2012.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the player}} clicks {{on a person}} to whom they wish to speak, a list of {{conversation}} topics appear on screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the inventory in any way they wish. A {{major part of the}} gameplay is examining documents, which have a separate section in the inventory screen, presenting the player with numerous options. For example, the player can organise the documents in two ways; by title or by the order in which they were found. Players can also [...] "flag" [...] documents so as to relate them to particular clues, and can then examine all documents related to any one particular clue together, without having to navigate through non-related documents. The documents screen also includes a [...] "compare" [...] view for examining different copies of the same pictures to find differences between them, and all documents can be examined in more detail with a magnifying glass. The game also includes complete copies of the Bible and Bram Stoker's Dracula, and each text has a [...] "random page" [...] option, which opens the book at a random passage. If done at certain times in the game, the random option can present clues to the player as to how to proceed (when this is the case, the [...] "random page" [...] <b>option</b> <b>flashes).</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{application}} note discusses how AES- 128 encryption {{can be implemented}} with Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! family of 8 -bit microcontrollers. The AES- 128 standard is an encryp-tion solution that has been developed to satisfy many rapidly-evolving security concerns that have arisen within the computer and embedded chip industries. This standard employs 128 -bit block data transfer and a 128 -bit key to cipher and decipher plain data. The AES algorithm was implemented {{in compliance with the}} NIST FIPS 197 that governs how data is transferred via advanced encryption methods. Implementing the AES- 128 standard with Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! XP MCUs offers high-speed performance when undergoing a encryption/decryption process, resulting in a 1. 8909 ms cipher rate and a 2. 604 ms decipher rate. The source code consumes a maximum of 2. 5 KB of MCU memory. Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! XP MCU also offers high level of protection from unauthorized attempts to read or write to the embedded code within Flash program memory. Users can select <b>option</b> bits for <b>Flash</b> Read Protect, Flash Write Protect, or both. The <b>Flash</b> Read Pro-tect <b>option</b> bit disables external user read access to Flash Program Memory; the Flash Write Protect bit disables external user access to program this Flash program memory. These features allows all encryption and decryption code to be fully secured. There are two source code files associated with this {{application note}}. AN 0338 -SC 01. zip contains a full representation of the AES routines described herein. In AN 0338 -SC 02. zip, some lines of code in the main. c file have been commented out to facilitate testing cipher and decipher times and memory usage when a terminal emulation program is not being used. All source code has been tested with version 5. 0. 0 of ZDS II for Z 8 Encore! XP MCUs; both of these. zip files are available for download from the Zilog website. Subse-quent releases of ZDS II may require you to modify the code supplied with this application note...|$|R
