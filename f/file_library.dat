Since version 11, RealPlayer SP has gained Flash Video support, DVD, SVCD, VCD burning (120-minute) and video recording (DRM is supported).|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, the {{recovery}} process went quicker than most expected. Sections of the site began restoration on May 26, and as of May 28, most of the site has been recovered to its original form, but the <b>file</b> <b>library</b> and some links are still being repaired. The cost of {{the recovery}} of the site is about $25,000 to pay for new servers and experts who will recover the files. Most of that cost has been funded through Avsim's donation system and advertisers. Limited service was restored after Memorial Day, 2009. The <b>file</b> <b>library</b> was then tentatively scheduled for reactivation {{in the first week of}} June, 2009 following file investigation, debugging and recompilation.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compressed}} <b>file</b> <b>library</b> (CFL) {{is designed}} {{to work as a}} virtual file system for programs, especially for video games. By compressing various game resources into one file, it is able to lower the number of file accesses. The resources can also be encrypted in the CFL.|$|E
50|$|SSP {{provides}} for two different data objects called <b>files</b> and <b>libraries.</b> <b>Files</b> contain records, almost always with a fixed record length. Libraries contain programs which can reference and access these files. SSP contained more than 60 different commands that allowed operators to create, delete, copy, edit/change, and secure <b>files</b> and <b>libraries.</b>|$|R

50|$|Usage of the GameArena <b>file</b> <b>library,</b> gaming servers and booking service were freely {{available}} to anyone, but provided specific advantages to Telstra customers such as preference in downloads and unmetered usage, {{as well as}} various bonuses in competitions.

5000|$|UniquE RAR <b>File</b> <b>Library</b> (unrarlib), {{an older}} {{version of the}} unrar source {{was the basis for}} an {{obsolete}} free software unarchiving library called [...] "unrarlib", licensed under the GPL. It could only decompress archives created by RAR versions prior to 2.9; archives created by RAR 2.9 and later use different formats not supported by this library. The original development team ended work on this library in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Text {{articles}} {{are displayed in}} a flat, rather than tree-based, listing. Stored {{articles are}} retrieved using a scheme based on user-defined keywords. This type of keyword-based system {{was based on the}} keyword systems used by common research databases of the 1990s, such as Knowledge Index and CompuServe's <b>file</b> <b>library,</b> and is similar to the keywords Index for a MS Help file. In recent Internet usage, such keywords are now often referred to as metadata [...] "tags". Articles are filtered using various criteria, including keywords, dates, and attachments.|$|E

50|$|SSP {{provides}} for two different data objects called <b>files</b> and <b>libraries.</b> <b>Files</b> contain records, almost always with a fixed record length. Libraries contain programs which can reference and access these files. SSP contained more than 80 different commands that allowed operators to create, delete, copy, edit/change, and secure <b>files</b> and <b>libraries.</b> Early in the System/36 development cycle, this was seriously improved {{to incorporate the}} folder object, which can have tremendous size, numerous extents, and contain subfolders.|$|R
50|$|A gradual {{recovery}} of the site took place over several days. The servers were replaced, the email addresses and forums were recovered on May 26, and the front page and {{other elements of the}} site on May 28. On the 28th it was also announced on the front page that approximately 90% of the <b>file</b> <b>library</b> would be recoverable, and that all Flight Simulator X and Flight Simulator 9 files were intact. The library was brought back online, with more than 95% of the original content, as of July 26.|$|E

50|$|The SECEDIT RESOURCE {{procedure}} {{was used to}} establish security ratings for <b>file,</b> <b>library,</b> folder, and group objects. Access levels of O (Owner), C (Change), U (Update), R (Read), E (Execute) or N (None) could be granted for a user to a particular resource. A group object {{was a sort of}} holding company that owned one or more lower objects. For example, granting access to the group ACCOUNTG made it easier to establish access to all of the accounting files. Group objects could also reference group files; the group UB referenced UB.OLD, UB.NEW, UB.01, or any filename with the embedded period.|$|E
25|$|Some {{general purpose}} Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that {{were given to}} those who paid extra money, {{uploaded}} useful files or knew the SysOp personally.

5000|$|AVSIM {{is a free}} to join nonprofit flight {{simulation}} {{social networking}} service that focuses heavily on Microsoft Flight Simulator, X-Plane, and Prepar3D. It features a community forum, <b>file</b> <b>library,</b> and product reviews. The website is maintained {{by a group of}} volunteers and bandwidth and equipment is paid for by donations and advertising. It is one of the world's largest flight simulation websites and provides users access to information and addons for the flight simulator series of games. On May 12, 2009 the website was attacked by a hacker which resulted in a catastrophic loss of data. [...] AVSIM was able to fully recover from the hack with the help of IT support from around the world.|$|E
50|$|However their {{aggressive}} {{growth was}} also expensive, {{and forced the}} company into receivership in August 1990, with a sizable debt primarily owed to Bell Canada. A group of private investors then purchased the system and restarted the company. By 1991 Jud had left the company. He was briefly involved {{with the formation of}} Toronto Free-Net before eventually leaving the industry. In 1992, CRS changed its name to CRS Online and added another BBS system aimed at online chat, which PCBoard did not support very well, at least in large multi-machine installations. In late 1994, CRS introduced a Windows-based Internet access service called Frontier that incorporated standard Internet functions including email, news and gopher, as well as access to its large <b>file</b> <b>library.</b>|$|E
50|$|The initial {{concept for}} AVSIM was the {{provision}} of articles and capture images of the flight simulation genre, collated into HTML format as a monthly magazine and packaged into a zip file. This was then made available for download among the major library servers on the Internet, including the <b>file</b> <b>library</b> system run and maintained at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, which was {{becoming one of the}} first major file libraries for flight simulation. The first issue was uploaded to the university and elsewhere on 1 March 1997. With the growth of the flight simulation community, the magazine moved into a continuously updated website in April 1997. The site began listing news items from the flight simulation industry in 1999, and has been doing so ever since.|$|E
