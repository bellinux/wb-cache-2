Basic norms of <b>fairness</b> <b>in</b> the conduct of {{disciplinary}} proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake, where there is an express duty on an association {{to make a decision}} only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her.|$|E

Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of <b>fairness</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of <b>fairness,</b> <b>in</b> which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E

40|$|Certain social {{preference}} {{models have}} been proposed to explain <b>fairness</b> behavior <b>in</b> experimental games. Existing bodies of research on evolutionary games, however, explain the evolution of fairness merely through the self-interest agents. This paper attempts to analyze the ultimatum game's evolution on complex networks when a number of agents display social preference. Agents' social preference is modeled <b>in</b> three forms: <b>fairness</b> consideration or maintaining a minimum acceptable money level, inequality aversion, and social welfare preference. Different from other spatial ultimatum game models, the model in this study assumes that agents have incomplete information on other agents' strategies, so the agents need to learn and develop their own strategies in this unknown environment. Genetic Algorithm Learning Classifier System algorithm is employed to address the agents' learning issue. Simulation results reveal that raising the minimum acceptable level or including <b>fairness</b> consideration <b>in</b> a game does not always promote <b>fairness</b> level <b>in</b> ultimatum games in a complex network. If the minimum acceptable money level is high and not all agents possess a social preference, the fairness level attained may be considerably lower. However, the inequality aversion social preference has negligible effect {{on the results of}} evolutionary ultimatum games in a complex network. Social welfare preference promotes the <b>fairness</b> level <b>in</b> the ultimatum game. This paper demonstrates that agents' social preference {{is an important factor in}} the spatial ultimatum game, and different social preferences create different effects on <b>fairness</b> emergence <b>in</b> the spatial ultimatum game.

40|$|Fairness {{preferences}} fundamentally affect individual {{behavior and}} {{play an important}} role in shaping social and political institutions. However, people differ both with respect to what they view as fair and with respect to how much weight they attach to <b>fairness</b> considerations. <b>In</b> this paper, we study the role of family background in explaining these heterogeneities <b>in</b> <b>fairness</b> preferences. <b>In</b> particular, we examine how socioeconomic background relates to fairness views and to how people make trade-offs between fairness and self-interest. To study this we conducted an economic experiment with a representative sample of 14 - 15 year-olds and matched the experimental data to administrative data on parental income and education. The participants made two distributive choices in the experiment. The first choice was to distribute money between themselves and another participant in a situation where there was no difference in merit. The second choice was to distribute money between two other participants with unequal merits. Our main finding is that there is a systematic difference <b>in</b> <b>fairness</b> view between children from low socioceconomic status (SES) families and the rest of the participants; more than 50 percent of the participants from low SES families are egalitarians, whereas only about 20 percent in the rest of the sample hold this <b>fairness</b> view. <b>In</b> contrast, we find no significant difference in the weight attached to fairness between children from different socioeconomic groups...|$|R
