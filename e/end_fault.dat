Many papers present solutions to distributing a traditionally monolithic service across a cluster of nodes. While the redundant nature of a cluster provides back <b>end</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance, these implementations are mostly limited by a single point of failure in the front end node of the system. Moreover, the most significant road block in building front <b>end</b> <b>fault</b> tolerant cluster servers {{lies in the fact that}} one single IP address must be advertised for the service. If the host that is assigned to that IP address fails, then a new host with that same IP address must be introduced into the system immediately. We present a mechanism, called IP Substitution, by which a failed primary front end node is immediately replaced with a new primary front end node, without a disruption in service...|$|E

Based on bus impedance matrix, establish fault distance distribution function adapted to {{all kind of}} asymmetric shorted fault in insulated neutral system. Combine the voltage sag data measured at substation to determine the most possible fault point through data matching and analysis. The method can implement fault location for all kind of asymmetric shorted fault and doesn’t need much iterative procedure. Also, it is applicable to complicated systems with multi-branch and is quite robust to load variations.

30|$|Although {{filtering}} {{removes the}} dependency of peak dv/dt {{on the location}} of the fault, this does not affect the protection scheme: only the attenuation of voltage transients by the di/dt limiting inductors is important for fault discrimination. This is because it is not required to discriminate between the close up faults and the far end faults on the same line. Initial investigations showed that 8  kHz bandwidth is sufficient to capture the maximum |dv/dt| for a far <b>end</b> <b>fault</b> on the shortest cable/overhead line in the test grid considered. The band limited voltage signal is then sampled at 32  kHz (sampling interval 31.25  μs > simulation time step 10  μs) and digitized with 12 -bit ADC to make sure difference between peak dv/dt before and after the sampling remains less than 5 %. ROCOV or dv/dt is digitally calculated between two time steps.|$|E
30|$|For validating the {{appropriateness}} of any protection scheme, {{it is very important}} to check for near <b>end</b> or close-in <b>faults</b> because when a fault occurs very close to a relay, the voltage at the relay location will be small or even zero. The impedance measured by the relay will be indeterminate. Thus the conventional impedance based relays may not operate for close-in or near <b>end</b> <b>faults.</b> The proposed protection technique has been tested for close-in fault cases.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a {{positive}} sequence current based directional relaying method is proposed for CCVT secondary transient during SPT condition. The method computes the fundamental components of fault and prefault current using least square technique. Then phase angle difference of fault and prefault positive sequence current is calculated for fault directional estimation. The positive sequence current based methods have although limitation for high resistance far <b>end</b> <b>fault,</b> and load change situation but during such situation CCVT transient is not possible. So, once the CCVT transient {{at the secondary}} side is detected, the proposed method can be applied as a stand-alone protection scheme to avoid any nuisance directional relay operation. The presence of AFSC and PFSC, higher system SIR value, fault type, fault location, fault resistance, and fault inception angle have negligible impact {{on the performance of}} proposed method. The proposed method is 100 % efficient for CCVT subsidence transient condition as based only current information. Results demonstrate the promise of the proposed method.|$|E
30|$|Table  3 {{summarizes}} {{the performance of}} the proposed protection scheme for different fault cases, occurring {{at the far end of}} the line from the relaying point with varying fault locations. It is evident from the Table  3 that the maximum response time for all the considered remote <b>end</b> <b>fault</b> cases is 12.495  ms, with maximum error in fault location of 0.66  %. The performance of proposed protection scheme was tested up to 67.9  km i.e. 99.9  % of the line length and it has been found that the proposed protection algorithm is able to detect/classify and locate all types of shunt faults with detection and classification accuracy of 100  %. Thus proposed scheme allows the protection engineers to increase the reach setting up to 99.9  % of total line length i.e. greater portion of line length can be protected and can be used as an independent relaying tool or as a back-up in the absence of communication link (failure of link).|$|E

Additional influencing factors are the impact of different execution environments as well as human operation or configuration errors.

40|$|Abstract—Directional {{over current}} relays (DOCR) are {{commonly}} used in power system protection as a primary protection in distribution and sub-transmission electrical systems and as a secondary protection in transmission systems. Coordination of protective relays is necessary to obtain selective tripping. In this paper, an approach for efficiency reduction of DOCRs nonlinear optimum coordination (OC) is proposed. This was achieved by modifying the objective function and relaxing several constraints depending on the four constraints classification, non-valid, redundant, pre-obtained and valid constraints. According to this classification, the far <b>end</b> <b>fault</b> effect on the objective function and constraints, and in consequently on relay operating time, was studied. The study was carried out, firstly by {{taking into account the}} near-end and far-end faults in DOCRs coordination problem formulation; and then faults very close to the primary relays (nearend faults). The optimal coordination (OC) was achieved by simultaneously optimizing all variables (TDS and Ip) in nonlinear environment by using of Genetic algorithm nonlinear programming techniques. The results application of the above two approaches on 6 -bus and 26 -bus system verify that the far-end faults consideration on OC problem formulation don’t lose the optimality.

30|$|There were {{different}} approaches {{adopted in the}} literature for formulation of fitness function for relay coordination studies. The overall objective of all approaches is to maintain the desired coordination time margin between primary and corresponding backup relays and tripping of minimum relays. In [115], the fitness function is formulated as summation of operating time of all primary relays in the distribution systems and while in [37], it is formulated as minimization of total operating time of all primary relays for near end and far <b>end</b> <b>faults.</b> In [28], the fitness function is also defined minimization of operating time of primary relay as well as backup relays. However, few researcher proposed the fitness function as minimisation of time dial setting [33] of primary relays. In all above fitness function formulation techniques, it is observed that, relay coordination problem becomes highly nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. The fast optimization algorithms can be effectively applied for for solving the relay coordination problems.|$|R

30|$|The major {{advantage}} of the proposed algorithm {{is that it can}} detect and classify faults with high accuracy and speed as demonstrated in this paper. Apart from being able to distinguish between the transient event and persistent fault, another {{advantage of}} the proposed technique is that the system remains protected even when one of the PMU fails. This is because the fault detection and faulted line identification is based on the presence of negative sequence voltage in the system and lowest positive sequence bus voltage. When PMU present at one <b>end</b> of the <b>faulted</b> line fails, the PMU at the other <b>end</b> of <b>fault</b> line will still record the presence of negative sequence voltages and will have lower bus voltage than the other buses in the system. Hence, the loss or damage of a PMU does not jeopardize the power system, which is an important feature. The proposed fault location algorithm utilizes PMU measurements from both <b>ends</b> of the <b>faulted</b> line and is shown to be more accurate than other impedance-based techniques. These features are additional advantages for PMU placement at all the buses in the network.|$|R

30|$|For {{obtaining the}} {{complete}} fault {{information on the}} transmission line, a fault location technique has been presented which does not require any additional information beyond the synchrophasor measurements that are utilized for fault detection and classification. Fault location techniques proposed in earlier works [16 – 18] employ sophisticated algorithms to locate a fault. The most commonly used fault location techniques are impedance-based fault location methods. Single-ended impedance-based fault location algorithm techniques have several disadvantages [29]. They only work when the fault voltages and currents recorded by the PMU correspond to the faulted line. They also provide inaccurate results {{in the presence of}} tapped lines or three terminal lines. This situation necessitates the need for double <b>ended</b> <b>fault</b> location algorithms which are highly accurate but need measurements from both ends of the line. This can only be achieved when PMUs are present in all the buses. Hence, the proposed scheme takes advantage of data available from each bus of the system to enable accurate fault location. The voltage and current phasors at the two buses in the faulted branch (termed hereafter as Bus a and Bus b) are taken. From these phasor quantities, the positive sequence components of the voltage and current phasors are extracted. Here, the positive sequence components are used because they are non-zero for all types of faults (zero sequence components do not exist for non-ground faults and negative sequence components do not exist for symmetrical faults).|$|R
