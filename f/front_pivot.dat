5000|$|For the Weissach axle, the <b>front</b> <b>pivot</b> bushing of the {{trailing}} arm {{is replaced by}} a short link. In this arrangement, when the vehicle decelerates and the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] back, the result is toe in. This adds to stability and thus, reduces oversteer.|$|E
50|$|The main cradle {{frame was}} carried on {{adjustable}} pivots. The <b>front</b> <b>pivot</b> was a spherical type, {{located on the}} front engine unit's frame between the driving and trailing coupled wheels, while the rear pivot was a flat oil-bath type, located on the rear engine unit's frame over the driving wheels. Each engine unit’s frames were formed of two continuous bars, 33 ft long and extending from the buffer beams at the outer ends to the cross-beams over the Bissel wheels at the inner ends. The front engine unit was equipped with steam as well as vacuum brake gear, while the hind unit was equipped with steam brake gear and handbrake gear.|$|E

5000|$|Many pioneers {{initially}} {{followed the}} Wrights' lead. For example, the Santos-Dumont 14-bis aeroplane of 1906 had no [...] "tail", but a box kite-like {{set of control}} surfaces in the <b>front,</b> <b>pivoting</b> on a universal joint on the fuselage's extreme nose, making it capable of incorporating both yaw and pitch control. The Fabre Hydravion of 1910 was the first floatplane to fly and had a foreplane.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{tremendous}} costs, {{the first}} locomotive, bearing factory number 1 {{and the name}} BORSIG, was finished in 1840. This locomotive had an interior frame, a two-axle <b>front</b> <b>pivoted</b> bogie and an extra dead axle behind the only drive axle. On 21 July 1840, Borsig let it compete against a Stephenson-built locomotive on the Berlin-Jüterbog railroad. The Borsig locomotive won by 10 minutes, proving {{that in spite of}} the lack of experience, Germans could build locomotives that were at least as good as the British models, and so the import of locomotives and engineers was no longer necessary. After this victory, the number of orders rose quickly. A further six machines of this type were sold to the Berlin-Stettiner Eisenbahn and the Oberschlesische Eisenbahn in 1842.|$|R
5000|$|This {{style of}} rifle {{is made by}} {{combining}} an AR-15 upper receiver with an AR-15 lower receiver {{which has not been}} banned by specific name, and which has a fixed, non-detachable 10-round (maximum, anything above 10 is a felony) magazine. In such a configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a telescoping stock, pistol grip, and flash hider may be present. While formerly prohibited under the now-expired federal assault weapon ban of 1994-2004, the presence of a bayonet lug is not prohibited by California state law and can be present on firearms without violation. However, the magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the rifle the shooter must either [...] "top load" [...] or use a tool to release the magazine lock (such as the tip of a bullet in [...] "bullet button" [...] equipped rifles). To top-load, the shooter pulls the rear takedown pin, hinges the upper receiver on the <b>front</b> <b>pivot</b> pin, and loads the now exposed magazine. Alternatively, several [...] "magazine lock" [...] devices are available which replace the magazine release button with an inset pin that requires the use of a special tool to release the magazine, thereby, disallowing a readily [...] "detachable magazine", to be compliant with California state firearms law.|$|E
40|$|This Master of Science thesis report {{describes}} {{the development process}} which aims to create a concept for a new off-road electric wheelchair for Permobil, {{with a focus on}} the vehicle-to-ground interface. It was performed between January and July 2015 as part of the Master Degree program, Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. Everyone does not have the ability to walk or transport themselves by their own means at trails or rough terrain due to injuries or other kinds of disabilities. The project aims to investigate how a solution should be designed in order to suffice the needs of these kinds of users. In order to achieve the goals, a series of research questions was determined, one of which read: How does the vehicle-to-ground interface affect the traction of the vehicle and the comfort of the user?The theoretical framework presents research findings necessary to reach the aim of this project and focuses on topics such as modularity, terrain types, off-road capability, vehicle dynamics and comfort. The overall development process in this project used a method called Pulse Model. The first stage of the project was market research with a primary focus on Permobil’s X 850 model, which was put through several tests. The main problems found were that its lack of lateral stability, low ground clearance, and overall harsh and bumpy ride comfort. The idea generation included both the use of LEGO® Technic bricks, the catalogue method and function prototypes, which resulted in a multitude of different suspension systems. A concept with front and rear trailing arms were chosen for further development and a full-scale prototype was fabricated and tested, which provided important feedback for the final concept. The prototype enabled a set of key aspects that should be considered when designing an off-road wheelchair. These were a ground clearance of at least 200 mm, four wheel drive, 50 / 50 weight distribution, 360 degree rear wheel steering, a <b>front</b> <b>pivot</b> bar suspension system and active lateral stability system in the rear which makes it able to maintain a level seat while traversing side slopes. In this project it was demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} design an off-road electric wheelchair which enables people with disabilities to move around more freely and independently in tough terrain. It is also possible achieve this on Permobil’s new modular chassis, which will reduce both manufacturing, stock and production costs for the products overall life cycle.

50|$|The Drift Sight {{was mounted}} {{to the side}} of the {{aircraft}} using two brackets at the front and back of the sights. The forward bracket had a pivot point, and the rear a screw jack that rotated the entire sighting system up or down around the <b>front</b> bracket's <b>pivot.</b> This allowed fine adjustment of the levelling of the sight during flight to account for changes in trim; after making these adjustments the system was locked in position using wingnuts. This mounting system was common among early British bombsights, notably the Equal Distance Sight that led to the Drift Sight.|$|R

50|$|A Dirtsurfer is {{composed}} of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. Footstraps are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6398237 where the <b>front</b> wheel <b>pivots</b> from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control.Another feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed.|$|R
50|$|In this variation, the wrestler first applies a <b>front</b> facelock, before <b>pivoting</b> 180 {{degrees to}} bring {{themselves}} into the three-quarter facelock position and dropping down to a sitting position, forcing the opponent's jaw to drop down {{on the shoulder of}} the attacking wrestler. Jeff and Rebecca Hardy use the variant, also called the Twist of Fate, along with the better known cutter variation.|$|R

50|$|A <b>pivoting</b> <b>front</b> axle changes a carriage’s {{base from}} a {{rectangle}} to a triangle because the wheel {{on the inside}} of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as Ackerman Steering. Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.|$|R
50|$|Six {{hardened}} steel wood screws passing through slightly oversize holes just in <b>front</b> of the <b>pivot</b> point stopped the bridge from being pulled towards the neck {{end of the}} guitar. The upper portion of the screws is smooth, not threaded. These six screws are often mistakenly assumed to be the pivot point rather than the hidden knife edge. This design works, {{in spite of the}} friction caused by the edges of the six holes sliding up and down the screw shafts when vibrato is applied.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{approach}} for simulating and controlling a hu-man character that is riding a bicycle. The two main components {{of our system}} are offline learning and online simulation. We sim-ulate the bicycle and the rider as an articulated rigid body system. The rider is controlled by a policy that is optimized through of-fline learning. We apply policy search to learn the optimal policies, which are parameterized with splines or neural networks for dif-ferent bicycle maneuvers. We use Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topology (NEAT) to optimize both the parametrization and the pa-rameters of our policies. The learned controllers are robust enough to withstand large perturbations and allow interactive user control. The rider not only learns to steer and to balance in normal riding sit-uations, but also learns to perform {{a wide variety of}} stunts, includ-ing wheelie, endo, bunny hop, <b>front</b> wheel <b>pivot</b> and back hop...|$|R

50|$|Fender skirts are {{implemented}} for both aesthetic and aerodynamic reasons. Rather than air flowing into and being {{trapped in the}} rear wheel well, it flows smoothly over the bodywork. They are generally detachable to allow for tire changes and installation of snow chains. Automakers have also experimented with front wheel fender skirts, as on the 1950-1954 Nash Rambler, but with success limited {{by the fact that}} the <b>front</b> wheels must <b>pivot</b> for steering, extending out from the side of the vehicle slightly. In GM parts accessories books, fender skirts are known as fender shields.|$|R
50|$|The barbette {{carriages}} {{were designed}} to fire over a parapet and {{could be used in}} either permanent or temporary fortifications. The <b>front</b> pintle carriage <b>pivoted</b> at the <b>front</b> of the chassis. This made the gun mount more compact and allowed the gun and detachment to be better protected by embrasures and traverses. The center pintle carriage gave the gun a 360° traverse and was stronger for guns firing at high angles because the pintle, the strongest part of the carriage, would have been under the breech when the gun was fired at high angles.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the tenure}} of the USRA, 30 of these {{articulated}} steam locomotives were built. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) and Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (W&LE) ordered the USRA 2-6-6-2 Mallet. The first Mallet was delivered to the W&LE in 1919 for $71,966.94. Later, the Nickel Plate Road (NKP) leased them from the W&LE, renumbering them for use on its rails. The independently <b>pivoted</b> <b>front</b> engine allowed it to negotiate branch lines and tight curves while hauling larger consists than its smaller cousins in the USRA series.|$|R

50|$|A compass was {{standard}} equipment on all Wagoneers while seat belts were optional. Warn hubs were utilized to engage or disengage front wheels and drive train while in two-wheel drive mode. A four-wheel-drive {{independent front suspension}} was $135 extra replacing the standard Dana 27AF solid front axle, and this option was supposed to offer the Wagoneer more car-like handling and ride. This was a single <b>pivot</b> <b>front</b> axle design that allowed the differential to swing with curb-side half while short upper A-arms tie into torsion bars at their inner pivot points and the axles are located fore and aft by control links.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the 18th century that {{steering}} systems were truly improved. Erasmus Darwin was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England. Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage. First, the front wheels were turned by a <b>pivoting</b> <b>front</b> axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road. Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.|$|R
