50|$|A <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> is a {{collection}} of software modules which allow users to send and receive fax messages directly from their desktop from email and/or document workflow applications. A <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> is equipped with either a hardware-based fax card or a software emulator, based on the T.38 protocol to send faxes over Internet Protocol (IP). Users are able to communicate with the <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> either on a Local Area Network (LAN) or over the Internet. Organizations tend to use a <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> to benefit from both an operational cost perspective (i.e., phone lines, supplies, maintenance) and a human resource perspective (i.e., travel to and from the fax machine, as well as prolonged waiting periods at the physical device). A <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> permits organizations to maintain an audit trail of all of the fax transactions, hence enables compliancy with legislations and mandates, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). An argument can also be made that because faxing via fax servers is a paperless solution, it innately allows organizations in their goal to be environment-friendly, by reducing their overall carbon footprint.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} Internet fax {{providers}} operating <b>fax</b> <b>servers</b> {{as a commercial}} public service. Subscribers can interact with the servers using methods similar to those available for standard <b>fax</b> <b>servers,</b> and would be assigned a dedicated fax number {{for as long as}} they maintain their subscription. Fees are normally charged on a flat monthly rate, with a limit on the number of fax pages sent and/or received.|$|R

40|$|The Internet's {{use as a}} faxing medium {{allows users}} across continents to {{communicate}} without incurring {{the high costs of}} long-distance phone rates. Geographically dispersed servers connected to local Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN) circumvent the use of international lines by using the Internet instead. This paper proposes an integrated Internet faxing environment, known as FaxPortal, to support different modes of Internet faxing including the use of email, the World Wide Web, and conventional fax devices. FaxPortal's architecture comprises two <b>servers,</b> namely, the <b>Faxing</b> and <b>Fax</b> Receiving <b>Servers.</b> The <b>Faxing</b> <b>Server</b> accepts and converts fax messages into fax-image files for transmission over the Internet. The <b>Fax</b> Receiving <b>Server</b> receives these files and sends them to fax devices over the PSTN. Additionally, FaxPortal has adopted a scheme with three different transportation classes to simplify the support for global fax coverage. 1. INTRODUCTION Fax messages are usually capt [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{alternative}} to a physical fax machine is {{to make use of}} computer software which allows people to send and receive faxes using their own computers, utilizing <b>fax</b> <b>servers</b> and unified messaging. A virtual (email) fax can be printed out and then signed and scanned back to computer before being emailed. Also the sender can attach a digital signature to the document file.|$|R
50|$|In many {{corporate}} environments, freestanding {{fax machines}} {{have been replaced}} by <b>fax</b> <b>servers</b> and other computerized systems capable of receiving and storing incoming faxes electronically, and then routing them to users on paper or via an email (which may be secured). Such systems have the advantage of reducing costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound analog phone lines needed by an office.|$|R
50|$|Recognizing the {{opportunity}} to combine facsimile communications with computer applications, S.K. Ho left Wang Laboratories to found Biscom, Inc., and thus he launched the <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> industry. Early application of Biscom’s <b>fax</b> <b>server,</b> the FAXCOM Server, applied print output from mainframe applications to an electronic form, and merged this into a single TIFF document which could be delivered electronically via fax. This was a vast improvement over earlier processes in which the mainframe data would be printed to paper forms, and then mailed or sent via paper fax machine.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively {{the term}} <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a program that enables a computer to send and receive fax messages, set of software running on a server computer which is equipped {{with one or more}} fax-capable modems (or dedicated fax boards) attached to telephone lines or, more recently, software modem emulators which use T.38 ("Fax over IP") technology to transmit the signal over an IP network. Its function is to accept documents from users, convert them into faxes, and transmit them, as well as to receive fax calls and either store the incoming documents or pass them on to users. Users may communicate with the server in several ways, through either a local network or the Internet. In a big organization with heavy fax traffic, the computer hosting the <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> may be dedicated to that function, in which case the computer itself may also be known as a <b>fax</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{e-mail message}} (with {{optional}} attachments) {{can be sent}} to a special e-mail address; the <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> monitoring that address converts all such messages into fax format and transmits them.|$|E
50|$|An {{integrated}} fax {{program is}} {{a complete set of}} faxing software which operates on a single computer which is equipped with a fax-capable modem connected to a telephone line. Its user interfaces may be similar to those used to communicate with <b>fax</b> <b>servers,</b> except that since the entire operation takes place on the user's computer the user may be made more aware of the progress of the transmission. Integrated fax programs are aimed at consumers and small organizations, and may sometimes be bundled with the computer's operating system.|$|R
50|$|A {{telephony}} {{system based}} on host media processing (HMP) is one that uses a general-purpose computer to process a telephony call’s media stream rather than using digital signal processors (DSPs) to perform the task. When telephony call streams started to be digitized for time-division-multiplexed (TDM) transport, processing of the media stream, to enhance it in some way, became common. For example, digital echo cancellers were added to long-haul circuits, and transport channels were shaped to improve modem performance. Then, in the mid-‘80s, computer-based systems that implemented messaging, for example, used DSPs to compress the audio for storage, and <b>fax</b> <b>servers</b> used DSPs to implement fax modems.|$|R
40|$|CDE {{operates}} in a networked, client/server environment. This {{article describes the}} services and configuration files provided in CDE to support client/server remote execution. CDE Networking Services The CDE networking model includes four primary services: Desktop display services. These services consist of the X 11 display server, keyboard and pointing devices, and limited auxiliary processing, such as window management and audio services. Session services. Session servers provide login and authentication, session management, and desktop services such as file manager, style manager, and action invocation. Application services. Application servers provide both terminal and GUI-based applications. When an application is located and running on a system other than the session server, {{it is said to}} be a remote application, and the system running the application is the application server. File services. File servers store the data that applications produce and manipulate. The primary way that application servers, file servers, and session servers share data in CDE 1. 0 is through the remote file system (RFS) mechanisms, as offered by the DCE Distributed File Service (DFS), 1 the Andrew File System (AFS), and the Network File System (NFS). There may be other system services available in the distributed desktop environment, such as font, printing, and <b>fax</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Argonne Chemical Management System (CMS) is {{comprised}} of several applications and the Infrastructure Modules. The Infrastructure Modules, which provide the integrated computing software foundation, include a security processor, common tables, reporting framework, utilities, and other facilities common to applications processing chemical information. The MSDS Sheets were scanned and the images stored for automated faxing to the requester. User searches are accomplished based on ``search`` data keyed into the Oracle Tables; the desired MSDS is subsequently faxed. The system has been designed as an ``open`` system and is totally portable. During development and production the CMS has operated in VAX, VMS, Sun Unix, and Hewlett-Packard HP-UX environments. The only restrictions are that the MSDS <b>Faxing</b> <b>Server</b> must operate under Unix and the bar code scanning processes are accomplished using a portable PC. The current system consists of 20 Oracle Tables, over 350 columns of data, 25 Standard reports, 45 screens, {{and a number of}} utilities. With the Oracle RDBMS the computing platform may be sized to the volume of data and processing activity. The Laboratory`s implementation is on an HP 9000 Model H 50 with 256 megabytes of memory, 32 concurrent users, and 8 gigabytes of disk storage that is primarily for the MSDS images...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Business-to-business (B 2 B) {{market of}} {{information}} processing {{devices such as}} printers, copier, <b>fax,</b> database <b>servers,</b> data storage arrays and laptops is growing seamlessly and rapidly, especially in developing country. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system {{can be the most}} promising system for information technology (IT) asset management because of its well-developed level of technology, worldwide standards and its lower price than other wireless protocol such as WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth and so forth. However, RFID system for IT asset management in B 2 B environment is limited by several constraints. So, Surface Acoustic Wave based RFID at 2. 4 GHz and UHF passive RFID at 900 MHz are discussed as a candidate of it. By analyzing objective data, estimating their future performance, and measuring the readability of SAW RFID system in the standard office, we concluded that the most hopeful candidate for B 2 B information processing device asset management is Surface Acoustic Wave technology based RFID because of its batteryless passive RFID characteristic, relatively long readable range and its potential, and inherent sensor capability and its expandability as well.

50|$|Sam Leffler, {{while working}} at Silicon Graphics (SGI), wrote a <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> for SGI's IRIX servers called FlexFAX and {{released}} {{it to the public}} in June 1991. Leffler and others worked for several years on FlexFAX, adding new features and porting the software to new platforms. In April 1995 FlexFAX was renamed HylaFAX with the 3.0pl0 release to avoid potential trademark issues.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{voice over}} IP (VoIP) vendors have used one central, {{remotely}} located <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> {{as a means}} of offering Internet fax service to their clients. In theory, standards such as T.38 should have allowed VoIP subscribers to keep their existing fax equipment working locally; in practice, T.38 at the subscriber's site offers no benefit if the upstream provider is least-cost routing to gateways that don't support T.38 and cannot reliably send or receive fax/modem traffic. A <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> at a central location, connected directly to public switched telephone network (PSTN) T-carrier primary rate interface lines and using direct inward dial to identify the intended addressee can convert an incoming fax to an electronic document (such as [...]tif or [...]pdf) for web or e-mail delivery. The fax traffic never passes through the VoIP infrastructure as a dial-up modem call and therefore arrives reliably even if T.38 is not properly supported at some points in the network.|$|E
50|$|DID {{service is}} also used by fax servers. A {{telephone}} line is terminated at a telephone interface (fax modem) of a computer that runs <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> software. A set of digits of the assigned phone numbers are used to identify {{the recipient of the}} fax. This allows many recipients to have an individual fax number, even though there is only one fax machine available.|$|E
50|$|A fax is sent via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to the <b>fax</b> <b>server,</b> which {{receives}} the fax and converts it into PDF or TIFF format, {{according to the}} instructions of the user. The processed file is then transmitted to the Web server, which sends it as an email containing the fax as an attached file, and sometimes sends a message reporting delivery to a mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|The user {{connects to}} the {{supplier}} Web site, specifies the receiving fax number, and uploads the document to send. The document is usually converted to PDF or TIFF format and sent by the Web server to the <b>fax</b> <b>server,</b> which then transmits it to the receiving fax machine via the telephone network. The sender usually receives confirmation that transmission was successful, either in the web interface or by email.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{scenario}} where T.38 is used is - T.38 Fax relay - where a T.30 {{fax device}} sends a fax over PSTN to a T.38 Fax gateway which converts or encapsulates the T.30 protocol into T.38 data stream. This is then sent either to a T.38 enabled end point such as fax machine or <b>fax</b> <b>server</b> or another T.38 Gateway that converts {{it back to}} PSTN PCM or analog signal and terminates the fax on a T.30 device.|$|E
