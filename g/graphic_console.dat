5000|$|During this time, another design idea called EvStack {{also added}} to the flamewar. EvStack was a pretty much {{complete}} redesign of the input and output subsystem that allowed for events (thus the [...] "Ev") to flow through a [...] "Stack" [...] of modules that can be configured to manipulate them. EvStack {{is a very powerful}} concept, allowing e.g. to have two keyboards attached to the same machine, one operating a text <b>console</b> on one <b>graphics</b> adapter and one operating a <b>graphics</b> <b>console</b> on the other (as was demonstrated on the Linux-Kongreß ´97) and even allows for having different keyboard layouts on different virtual consoles or attaching keyboards via network. However this came at the price of a huge patch to the input subsystem which did not seem acceptable. The modern Linux input event system allows programs (e.g. Xorg) to receive keyboard events other than through the console keyboard, allowing multiseat operation.|$|R

50|$|IBM coined {{this term}} for the 7030 (Stretch), revived it {{for the design of}} the System/360, and {{continues}} to use it in those environments today. In the System/360 processors, an IPL is initiated by the computer operator by selecting the three hexadecimal digit device address (CUU; C=I/O Channel address, UU=Control unit and Device address) followed by pressing the LOAD button. On most System/370 and some later systems, the functions of the switches and the LOAD button are simulated using selectable areas on the screen of a <b>graphics</b> <b>console,</b> often an IBM 2250-like device or an IBM 3270-like device. For example, on the System/370 Model 158, the keyboard sequence 0-7-X (zero, seven and X, in that order) results in an IPL from the device address which was keyed into the input area. The Amdahl 470V/6 and related CPUs supported four hexadecimal digits on those CPUs which had the optional second channel unit installed, for a total of 32 channels. Later, IBM would also support more than 16 channels.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a comprehensive experimental {{evaluation of a}} two-handed free-form surface editor called THRED, which uses a pair of Polhemus 3 D trackers with added buttons in a complementary two-handed style. On top of the underlying free-form surface editor application was built two other user interfaces that provide reasonable competition for the two-handed style. The second interface uses one button-enhanced 3 D tracker in the dominant hand, with the non-dominant hand selecting commands from the keyboard. The third style is a mouse-based interface that is a simplified clone of the Alias modeler. This user study evaluates these interfaces in terms of pain and fatigue. The results show that experienced minimal pain and fatigue with THRED, an a par with that experienced in the mouse-based interface, but there was statistically significant fatigue {{in the use of}} the One-Handed interface. The pain and fatigue surveys clearly indicate that THRED and the Mouse-Based interface yield low discomfort, which contradicts the established wisdom that bat-based interfaces are likely to be painful or fatiguing to use. users prefer it to the alternatives already in place. The work reported here evaluates the pain and fatigue potential for a new Two-Handed 3 D tracker-based editor called THRED (for Two-Handed Refining EDitor [12]). THRED is a “fish tank ” system in which the user sits in front of a <b>graphics</b> <b>console</b> (figure 1) that has a screen, keyboard, mouse, and two Polhemus magnetic 3 D position and orientation trackers with three added buttons per tracker. It is a simple quadrilateral-based free-form surface editor in which users can select and move one or more vertices to create the desired surface. The polygonal surface is composed entirely of a rectangular mesh of vertices, with each vertex tessellated with a pair of triangles. THRED continually animates the 3 D object being created, and the user holds a magnetic sensor (Bat (figure 2)) in each hand, pressing the bat buttons to manipulate the surface...|$|R

40|$|Recently in {{this column}} 1, we {{presented}} {{a vision of the}} future of computer graphics technology. The rapid improvement of rendering capacity and fidelity led us to search for the next bottleneck in the development of compelling virtual worlds.

This intelligence can stem from computer-generated autonomy, or from other human participants. In the months since the previous column, these trends have become even more pronounced. Mi-crosoft demonstrated prototypes of their entry into the console gaming market, the XBox (xbox. com), which claims polygon throughput of 300 million per second.

Back on the PC, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, three of the first massively popular 3D first-person shooter games, were released by id Software to critical and popular acclaim during this decade using a rendering engine innovated primarily by John Carmack.
