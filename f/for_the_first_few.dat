5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{days after}} hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small {{enough for the}} young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days, {{the newborn}} is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs {{the support of}} its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, {{forced out of the}} group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} of his {{government}} in January 1227, although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales.

Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
