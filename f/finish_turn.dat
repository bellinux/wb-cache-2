In this paper, the {{influence}} of different machining methods (including rough <b>turning,</b> <b>finish</b> <b>turning,</b> and longitudinal polishing after <b>finish</b> <b>turning)</b> on rotating bending fatigue properties of TC 21 which belonged to a new ultra high strength titanium alloy was studied. The influence of machining methods on surface integrity of TC 21 titanium alloy was measured by using surface profile measurement, scanning electron microscopy, metallography microscope, micro-hardness instrument and X-ray diffraction residual stress analyzer. And fatigue fractography of specimens was further investigated. Then the mechanism of fatigue resistance which was affected by machining surface integrity was discussed. The {{results indicated that the}} fatigue life of <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> and longitudinal polishing after <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> was increased 3. 96 times and 17. 34 times compared with rough turning, respectively. The machining surface integrity had important influence on fatigue property of TC 21 titanium alloy, which caused by the differences of surface roughness and texture as the dominant factors, and then the variation in surface micro-hardness, metallographic microstructure and the surface residual stress were not the main factors on three above-mentioned machining methods.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an assessment of}} the machinability of a nickel-based alloy Inconel 718 using a <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> operation with carbide coated and uncoated tools having fine and medium grain size substrates, and the same tool geometry (a round tool shape geometry with a 0 ° rake angle and 7 ° clearance angle). In addition, orthogonal machining tests were carried out to generate experimental data for future identification of the constitutive laws of Inconel 718 (its behavior under high stress, strains, strain rates, and temperatures). The <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> of this alloy was evaluated in terms of tool life, tool wear mechanisms, cutting forces, surface roughness, and chip formation process. The cutting speed range evaluated was from 50 to 100 m/min, and the feed range was from 0. 075 to 0. 125 mm/rev. Throughout the machining tests, the depth of cut was kept constant and equal to 0. 25 mm. Tungsten carbide uncoated tool having fine grain size (< 1 μm), strong and sharp cutting edges were found to be the most suitable tool material and tool geometry for the <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> of Inconel 718 at a cutting speed of 50 m/min, and, moreover, yielded the best tool life of 53 minutes. When <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> at a cutting speed of 75 m/min, a single layer PVD (TiAlN= 3 μm) carbide tool yielded the best tool life of 12 minutes. At a cutting speed of 100 m/min, triple layer CVD coated tools (TiCN/Al 2 O 3 /TiN= 15 μm) produced the best performance, yielding an 8 minutes of tool life. During the machining tests, the common wear mechanisms of the three different tools were adhesion, abrasion, and diffusion. Flank wear was the dominant tool failure mode of all three tools. The analysis of chip morphology showed that no phase transformation existed even though the material was deformed. The increase of micro-hardness was confirmed by micro-hardness measurements on chips, as compared to the initial micro-hardness of the material (Inconel 718). Cutting forces for all the different tools were relatively low (< 300 N) when the cutting edge was new.

Phase 1 of the experimental work comprised evaluating the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 6 Mo when employing carbide tooling with respect to tool life, wear behaviour, workpiece surface integrity and cutting forces. The machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 6 Mo using PCBN tooling was evaluated in Phase 2 experiments. It was shown that even with the use of high pressure jet cooling, carbide and low content PCBN grade inserts were unsuitable for high-speed (~ 200 m/min) <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> of titanium alloys. Phase 3 research evaluated the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 6 Mo and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V when employing PCD tooling with respect to tool life, wear behaviour, workpiece surface integrity and cutting forces. Benchmark tests producing response surface models were developed using conventional low pressure fluid supply and were found to be suitable for the prediction of tool life, surface roughness and cutting force within the range of parameters studied. The PCD inserts significantly outperformed both carbide (by a factor > 24) and PCBN (by a factor > 12) tools in high-speed <b>finish</b> <b>turning,</b> although the performance varied depending on the PCD structure, edge geometry, period of engagement, undeformed chip thickness and jet fluid parameters...|$|R

40|$|Noteworthy {{results have}} been {{obtained}} in the turning and drilling of hardened high-strength steels using tungsten carbide based cutting tools. In a <b>finish</b> <b>turning</b> process, it was seen that surface roughness and tool flank wear followed very different trends against cutting time. The suggested explanation for this behaviour is that the profile cut into the workpiece surface {{is determined by the}} tool's cutting edge profile. It is shown that the profile appearing on the cut surface changes rapidly over time, so the profile of the tool cutting edge should also be changing rapidly. Workpiece material adhered onto the cutting tool, which is also known as a built-up edge, is a phenomenon which could explain the observations made. In terms of tool damage modes, workpiece material adhesion is believed to have contributed to tool wear in examples provided from <b>finish</b> <b>turning,</b> thread turning and drilling.
