500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "I desire no other epitaph … than the statement that <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> medical students in the wards, as I regard this as {{by far the most}} useful and important work I have been called upon to do."

2500|$|Buell {{was part}} of the first class of Harvard College Professorships in 1998, a now-annual award [...] "created to {{recognize}} those especially dedicated to undergraduate teaching" [...] at Harvard University. The award comes with [...] "support to aid the recipient's professional development {{in the form of a}} semester of paid leave, or commensurate summer pay, or an equivalent fund to support their scholarly work." [...] Said Buell, [...] "To be recognized publicly for what one considers inherently most important in one's professional life is by no means to be taken for granted, and I am very grateful...Never during my eight years at Harvard have <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> an undergraduate course that I didn't enjoy teaching." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the Eastern Fathers {{were aware}} that the {{procession}} of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son was taught in the West, they did not generally regard it as heretical. According to Sergei Bulgakov [...] "a whole series of Western writers, including popes who are venerated as saints by the Eastern church, confess the procession of the Holy Spirit also from the Son; and {{it is even more}} striking that there is virtually no disagreement with this theory." [...] In 447, Leo <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> it in a letter to a Spanish bishop and an anti-Priscillianist council held the same year proclaimed it. The argument was taken a crucial step further in 867 by the affirmation in the East that the Holy Spirit proceeds not merely [...] "from the Father" [...] but [...] "from the Father alone".|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, {{he played}} a small part in the film Walker, {{directed}} by Alex Cox, as a character named [...] "Faucet" [...] and wrote and performed on the film's soundtrack. [...] He starred in another Cox film that same year called Straight to Hell, as the character Simms. Straight to Hell also featured London-Irish folk/punk band the Pogues, both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist Philip Chevron, who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: [...] "When I was sick in late 1987, <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon {{and he was on}} tour in the USA as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped {{to the top of the}} guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage." [...] This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.|$|E
2500|$|In another article, Fitzpatrick told of {{his work}} with a student who had been [...] "horribly crippled" [...] from birth. [...] The student asked to be excused from the {{compulsory}} gymnasium work, claiming it would be [...] "utterly impossible" [...] for him to participate. The student had never walked a step, his legs were twisted out of shape, {{and he could not}} control his head and neck. Fitzpatrick denied the request and promised the young man: [...] "I will teach you to walk." [...] Fitzpatrick invented exercises to strengthen every part of the student's body, until eventually the student could walk on his own. Fitzpatrick recalled:"Day after day <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> him. [...] I showed him how to step and helped him with my hands to take steps. The first two steps he took alone were followed by tears of joy. Of course, he'll never be able to walk as an able-bodied man, but he learned to discard his shuffle. ... This is but an instance of gymnasium work's benefits. If people realized the value of physical culture, we would be a splendidly developed race of men and women." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that years earlier, after Emperor Taizong ordered Li Jing to teach Hou strategies, Hou {{reported}} to Emperor Taizong, [...] "Li Jing is about to commit treason." [...] When Emperor Taizong asked him why, Hou responded, [...] "Li Jing only teaches me basic principles and does not teach me the best strategies, keeping them for himself." [...] When Emperor Taizong asked Li Jing about this, Li Jing responded, [...] "This is proof that Hou Junji will commit treason. [...] China is secure right now, and the empire is united. [...] What <b>I</b> <b>taught</b> him is sufficient to use against barbarians. [...] If not for treasonous purposes, why would Hou want to learn all of the strategies?" [...] At one point, Li Daozong also spoke to Emperor Taizong, stating, [...] "Hou Junji has too much ambition and too little talent. [...] He overvalued his achievements and found it shameful to be lower in position than Fang Xuanling and Li Jing. [...] Even though he serves as a minister, he finds the position insufficient. [...] I believe one day he will create a disturbance." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Hou Junji is very talented and capable of serving in any position. [...] It is not that I am unwilling {{to give him the}} highest post; it is just that it is not yet his turn. [...] How can I distrust him and believe that he will commit treason?" [...] After Hou was put to death, Emperor Taizong apologized to Li Daozong.|$|E
