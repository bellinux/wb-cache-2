25|$|At this point, Momentum {{gained a}} new boss when Theodore Shackley {{transferred}} {{in as the}} CIA's Chief of Station in Laos. Shackley is credited with stating that Momentum was run like a country store, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> {{to turn it into}} a supermarket. An ad hoc U.S. Air Force unit called the Raven Forward Air Controllers was founded to direct the swelling tide of airpower being unleashed in support of the Hmong and other irregulars. Rather than continuing to craft a strategy to defend Laos, the new emphasis in the war became the support of the combat in South Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|At {{one point}} in the proceedings, Smith {{attempted}} to press a point he was making, by quoting from a signal sent to British ships. Lord Mersey queried which message this was, and it transpired that the message in question existed in the version of evidence given to Smith by the Board of Trade Solicitor, Sir Ellis Cunliffe, but not in versions given to others. Cunliffe explained the discrepancy by saying that different versions of the papers had been prepared for use, depending whether the enquiry had been in camera or not, but the message quoted appeared never to have existed. Lord Mersey observed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to get at the truth, and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the rebellion, Cornwallis came to believe that British policy toward Ireland was flawed, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> as Lord Lieutenant to promote measures that would benefit the entire population. [...] This view brought him into conflict with both the Protestant elites in the Irish parliament, and the political establishment in London, even though he was in agreement with the latter that Ireland should be united with Great Britain.|$|E
500|$|As War Secretary, Benjamin was {{responsible}} for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> with Davis looking over his shoulder, to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. [...] Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a [...] "defensive war" [...] strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the North, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis {{came to realize that}} his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. [...] Varina Davis wrote, [...] "It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. [...] It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason." ...|$|E

2500|$|From the Channel Nine {{commentary}} box, Tony Greig {{went as far}} as to {{say that}} Wessels [...] "went through a period when his temperament was totally against everything that one-day cricket stood for." [...] Wessels pointed out that he fulfilled the anchor role in the side and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to bat throughout an innings. Former Australian captain and teammate Kim Hughes, had publicly supported Wessels on this fact, saying: [...] "Kepler hits so many boundaries that he is always going to score enough runs and, even in one-day cricket, you need someone who can anchor the innings. He's the bloke I want in that role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born as Lance Taylor (falsey {{assumed as}} Kevin Donovan) to Jamaican and Barbadian immigrants, Bambaataa {{grew up in}} The Bronx River Projects, with an activist mother and uncle. As a child, he was exposed to the black liberation movement, and {{witnessed}} debates between his mother and uncle regarding the conflicting ideologies in the movement. He was exposed to his mother's extensive and eclectic record collection. Gangs in the area became the law, clearing their [...] of drug dealers, assisting with community health programs and both fighting and partying to keep members and turf. Bambaataa [...] {{was a member of}} the Black Spades. He quickly rose to the position of warlord of one of the divisions. As warlord, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to build ranks and expand the turf of the young Spades. He was not afraid to cross turfs to forge relationships with other gang members, and with other gangs. As a result, the Spades became the biggest gang in the city in terms of both membership and turf.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was another}} member of the {{expedition}} whose presence conforms still less to this hypothesis: the Veedor ("Overseer" [...] or [...] "Supervisor") Bernardino Íñiguez. This public office had functions that we would now call fiscal and administrative. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to count the treasure gathered by the expeditions, in metals and precious stones, in order to assure the correct allotment of the quinto real [...] the [...] "royal fifth": 20% of all treasure gained in the conquests was destined for the Spanish royal treasury, a fiscal norm that originated in the Reconquista, the re-conquest of Spain from the Muslims [...] and of other legal requisites, such as reading to the Indians, before attacking them, a declaration of intentions and a warning, to legalize the aggression in the face of possible future investigations. (Cortés was especially scrupulous with this formal requirement, useless when one lacked interpreters who could translate the message to the Indians). If the expedition went to Guanajes to kidnap Indians, the Veedors presence would have been downright inconvenient for them. Although, on the other hand, according to Bernal, Íñiguez was nothing but a soldier who carried out the role of veedor, his being so designated in advance indicates that there was at least some thought of the possibility of exploration.|$|E

2500|$|Barruels third volume {{addresses}} the antisocial conspiracy {{that was the}} objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne {{paved the way for the}} conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were [...] "all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were [...] "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" [...] and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework.|$|E
