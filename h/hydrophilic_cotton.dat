40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{fabrication}} of cotton fabrics with single-faced superhydrophobicity using a simple foam finishing process. Unlike most commonly reported superhydrophobic fabrics, the fabrics developed in this study exhibit asymmetric wettability on their two faces: one face showing superhydrophobic behavior (highly nonwetting or water-repellent characteristics) and the other face retaining the inherent <b>hydrophilic</b> nature of <b>cotton.</b> The superhydrophobic face exhibits a low contact angle hysteresis of θa/ θr = 151 / 144 (θa, advancing contact angle; θr, receding contact angle), which enables water drops to roll off the surface easily so as to endow the surface with well-known self-cleaning properties. The untreated hydrophilic face preserves its water-absorbing capability, resulting in 44 % of the water-absorbing capacity {{compared to that of}} the original cotton samples with both sides untreated (hydrophilic). The single-faced superhydrophobic fabrics also retain moisture transmissibility that is as good as that of the original untreated cotton fabrics. They also show robust washing fastness with the chemical cross-linking process of hydrophobic fluoropolymer to fabric fibers. Fabric materials with such asymmetric or gradient wettability will be of great use in many applications such as unidirectional liquid transporting, moisture management, microfluidic systems, desalination of seawater, flow management in fuel cells, and water/oil separation.

40|$|This thesis {{concerned}} {{the development of}} hydrophilic polysiloxan based softeners with strong adhesive properties. Functionalized polysiloxanes were designed and examined concerning their structure-response relationship on cotton and polyester fabrics. To ensure strong adhesive properties of the polysiloxanes two different binding concepts were investigated: first with covalent bonds and second with multiple hydrogen bonds. For the covalent binding concept in a first step comb-shaped PDMS-PEG were synthesized via hydrosilylation with poly(methyl hydrogen-stat-dimethyl siloxane) and poly(ethylene glycol) -monoallyl ether. Afterwards the hydroxy terminated PDMS-PEGs were functionalized with isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane as binding moiety. Good adhesive properties were obtained with the customized polysiloxanes on cotton fabrics. Especially polysiloxanes with a high density of binding groups (PDMS-PEG 87 / 12 - 17 und 23 / 4 - 17) showed improved adhesive bond strength with triethoxysilane. The polysiloxane layer on the fabric was between 4 - 9 nm and increased with rising hydrophobicity of the polysiloxanes. Based on high polymer chain flexibility and only minor intermolecular interactions the polysiloxanes improved the soft handle of cotton fabric. The PDMS-PEGs with big polymer chain loops (100 / 4 - 7, 100 / 4. - 17, 91 / 8 - 7, 91 /- 8 - 17 und 87 / 12 - 7) enhanced the soft handle significantly compared to the raw fabric. In particular the deformability of the fabrics, determined by the inner softness of a yarn, {{was influenced by the}} polysiloxanes. The hydrophilic properties of treated fabrics were measured by absorbance and rising properties of water. With higher HLB value of the polysiloxanes the hydrophilic properties of the treated fabrics increased. After the application of the polysiloxanes with a portion up to 60 vol% PDMS (23 / 4 - 7, 23 / 4 - 17, 30 / 9 - 10 und 87 / 12 - 17) the <b>hydrophilic</b> properties of <b>cotton</b> fabric was not diminished. Systematically varying polysiloxane properties such as the molecular weight, the density and length of hydrophilic sidechains yielded in PDMS-PEG 87 / 12 - 17, a polysiloxane featuring good soft handle together with adequate hydrophilic properties. The second binding concept, adhesion by hydrogen bonds, stands out due to their broad field of binding applications on various surfaces. Two different comb shaped polysiloxanes were prepared either with the coupler phenylchloroformiate or epoxy as terminal groups. Subsequently, the end groups of these starting compounds were functionalized with 2 -(1 -aminoethyl) imidazolidinone, the final binding group. The epoxide based synthesis proofed to be faster and more efficient. The functional polysiloxane formed a stable layer of about 5 nm on polyester fabric. In particular the polysiloxane 87 / 12 with a high density of binding groups was evenly applied to polyester fabric with an excellent permanence. The adhesive properties of PDMS-PEG 91 / 8 - 6 - 4 were improved with imidazolidinone functionalization compared to the previously hydroxyl functionalized polysiloxanes. Via the epoxide strategy prepared polysiloxanes showed with and without imidazolidinone comparably adhesive properties. Maybe the interactions between epoxides and fabric were sufficient for permanent adherence. The soft handle of polyester fabrics was significantly improved by applying imidazolidinone functionalized polysiloxanes such as polysiloxane 100 / 4, 91 / 8, 87 / 12 and 23 / 4. As observed for cotton the fabrics were easier to deform in accordance with softer handle. The application of imidazolidinone functionalized polysiloxanes did not lead to higher hydrophobicity of polyester fabrics. A high density of imidazolidinone (D:Dx < 4 : 1) rather enhanced the hydrophilicity. More than 40 vol% PEG (30 / 9 - 10 and 78 / 6 / 4) improved the hydrophilicity even further. Concluding the hydrogen bond based concept, the imidazolidinon functionalized polysiloxane 87 / 12 stood out by an even application and good durability on polyester fabric. The results of hydrophilicity and soft handle were comparably well for imidazolidinon functionalized polysiloxanes prepared via the epoxide route. To further increase the hydrophilicity a combination of PEG- and epoxy functional side chains is imaginable, where the epoxy functional chains are modified with the binding group. First experiments with such a polysiloxane 78 / 6 / 4 showed very good hydrophilic properties on polyester fabrics...|$|R

Atualmente, há necessidade de serem desenvolvidas técnicas que possibilitem a produção massal de genótipos melhorados e a cultura de tecidos oferece esta possibilidade. Plantas obtidas {{in vitro}}, a partir de sementes, possuem duas características importantes: a juvenilidade e a variabilidade existente em lotes de sementes. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar métodos de escolha de lotes de sementes, a partir de suas características de sanidade e vigor; otimizar a germinação e pré-estabelecer esta espécie florestal in vitro. Sementes de três lotes obtidas com a empresa Klabin, oriundas de pomares clonais de sementes, denominados Celucat (1 Geração), Igaras (1 Geração) e Igaras (2 Geração) foram submetidas a testes de sanidade através da técnica do papel filtro; e análises de vigor, baseadas no desempenho de plântulas, em que se avaliaram as variáveis: sementes mortas, sementes duras, plântulas anormais, plântulas normais fracas e plântulas normais fortes. Dessa última, foi efetuada a análise do comprimento (cm), peso fresco (g) e peso seco (g). Para a desinfestação foram testados seis tratamentos compostos de três combinações entre tempos de desinfestação e concentração de NaOCl, além da presença ou ausência de luz durante os primeiros dias do experimento. As sementes foram inoculadas em meio MS (MURASHIGE e SKOOG, 1962) Testou-se também a germinação das sementes em substratos alternativos como papel filtro, amido e amido combinado com ágar em um primeiro momento e, {{posterior}}mente, a germinação em substrato de meio de sais minerais MS, contendo carvão ativado; e meio MS líquido, tendo como solidificante vermiculita. Os substratos papel filtro, algodão hidrófilo e ágar-água foram avaliados quanto ao subsídio hídrico que fornecem para as sementes. Como tratamentos pré-germinativos, foram realizados experimentos com diferentes tempos de embebição e germinação com ou sem desinfestação em algodão hidrófilo. Avaliou-se também o estabelecimento in vitro a partir de nós cotiledonares em meio MS, WPM (LLOYD e McCOWN, 1981) e MS reduzido à metade da concentração de sais. Os testes de sanidade foram eficientes na discriminação dos lotes, sendo os fungos mais representativos para esta finalidade pertencentes aos gêneros Fusarium, Penicillium e Trichoderma. Da mesma forma, as variáveis de vigor: plântulas anormais, plântulas normais fortes e comprimento, peso seco e peso fresco de plântulas normais fortes, permitiram a estratificação dos lotes. A desinfestação em NaOCl a 3 % durante 5 minutos e a 4 % durante 3 minutos demonstraram os melhores resultados, porém, NaOCl apresentou toxidez às sementes, inibindo a germinação. Os meios de cultivo com diferentes substratos não apresentaram diferenças significativas para a germinação das sementes. Através da análise da absorção de água em diferentes substratos, foi possível estabelecer as curvas de embebição e comparar substratos quanto ao fornecimento hídrico. A embebição das sementes por 72 horas e posterior inoculação em algodão hidrófilo, sem prévia desinfestação, foi eficiente na germinação. Foi possível estabelecer, in vitro, plantas de Pinus taeda L., porém, as análises estatísticas não demonstraram diferenças entre os meios testados para tal finalidade. Pinus taeda L. {{is among the}} more planted forest species in Brazil due its desirable characteristics of production and industrial quality. Currently, it has been necessary to be developed techniques that make possible the massal production of improved genotypes and the tissue culture techniques offer this possibility. Gotten plants in vitro from seeds possess two important characteristics: the youthfully and the existing variability in lots of seeds. The objective of this work was to evaluate methods of choice of lots of seeds from its characteristics of health and vigor; to optimize the germination and to establish this forest species in vitro. Seeds of three lots supplied by the Klabin Company, deriving of clone orchards of called seeds Celucat (1 st Generation), Igaras (1 st Generation) and Igaras (2 nd Generation) were submitted the sanitary tests through the technique blotter-test; and analyses of vigor based {{in the performance of}} seedling evaluated the variables: hard seeds dead seeds, abnormal seedling, weak normal seedling and heavy normal seedling. Of this last one, it was effected the analysis of the length (cm), fresh weight (g) and dry weight (g). For disinfestations, six treatments had been tested, that were composites of three combinations of disinfestations times and concentration of NaOCl, beyond presence or absence light during first days of the experiment. The seeds were germinated in MS medium (MURASHIGE e SKOOG, 1962). The germination of the seeds in alternative substrata of paper was also tested like filter paper, starch and starch combined with agar at a first moment and, later, the germination in substratum of medium MS with activated charcoal and liquid medium MS having vermiculite as gelling agent. The substrata filter paper, <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>cotton</b> and agarwater had been evaluated how much to the water subsidy that they supply the seeds. As treatment pre-germinative, it was carried through experiments with different times of soak and germination in <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>cotton.</b> The establishment was also evaluated in vitro from node cotyledonar in media MS, WPM (LLOYD e McCOWN, 1981) and reduced MS to the half of the concentration of mineral salts. The health tests had been efficient in the discrimination of the lots, has been more representative the genera Fusarium, Penicillium and Trichoderma. In the same way, variable of the vigor: abnormal seedling, heavy normal seedling and length, dry weight and fresh weight of heavy normal seedling had allowed the stratification of the lots. The disinfestations in 3 % NaOCl during 5 minutes and 4 % during 3 minutes had demonstrated the best ones performances; however, NaOCl presented toxic to the seeds, inhibiting the germination. The media with different substrata had not presented significant differences for the germination of the seeds. Through the analysis of the water absorption in different substrata it was possible to establish the soak curves and to compare substrata in relation to water suply. The soak for 72 hours of the seeds and posterior inoculation in <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>cotton</b> was efficient in the germination of seeds.

H 577 P ITC 2017 Liu 28 {{unnumbered}} pages, 137 pages :color illustrationsWith the advancements in both nanotechnology and micro-fabrication techniques, {{the development}} of superhydrophobic surface (SHS) enters a new era which highlights the significance of multifunctionality, tunable surface property, and smart response. Novel multifunctional SHS may accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously in real-field applications while tunable surface property can effectively induce smart responses on the SHS, which further benefit the functional optimization, life cycle, and prompt the total system efficiency of SHS. Based on the {{clear understanding of the}} application requirement and the material property, function-led design of SHS can be realized so that high performance SHS are achieved with reduced cost and optimized functions. In order to fabricate SHS with highly interactive interfacial dynamics, graphene, one of the thinnest among the existing materials, was chosen and applied to the flexible textile fabrics. Extremely strong bonding was observed between graphene and the fibers, and the thin sheets of graphene were also observed to tightly wrap according to the surface profiles of the fibers. Surprisingly, the <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>cotton</b> fabric became hydrophobic with a graphene loading of only 0. 5 wt%. By further upgrading the monolayer graphene coating on the fabric, a nanofilm of titania (TiO₂) was subsequently applied onto the graphene surface which created a hierarchical surface structure showing superhydrophobicity. As a result of the photoactivity of TiO₂, UV-triggered superhydrophilic conversion can be readily achieved on this novel SHS. Enhanced control over the conversion rate and the wettability were also achieved due to the interfacial charge transfer interaction between TiO₂ and graphene. Tunable adhesion, spreading, and transport of water droplets can be realized on the as-obtained hierarchical graphene-TiO₂ (GT) SHS, which can further transform the GT-SHS into a versatile platform for micro-droplet/fluid manipulation. Multiple functions of application significance, i. e. directional water transport, micro-droplet storage and transfer, self-cleaning and gas sensing, are readily demonstrated on GT-SHS; exceptional oil/water separation performance is also shown by the membrane based on GT-SHS. Therefore, potent potential in the sweat and moisture management of quick-dry garment, micro-volume droplet storage, and oily water treatment can be anticipated for the novel stimuli-responsive GT-SHS. To speak further, being perceived as an essential bridging step between the fundamental research and practical application, the function-led design criterion can be envisaged as the new guiding code for the research and development of SHS.
