50|$|In January 2013, the Pillbug was {{announced}} {{as a possible}} <b>expansion</b> <b>piece,</b> and {{has been added to}} the game. It was designed as a defensive piece, to counteract the other two offensive expansions and to give the second player a bit of an advantage. The Pillbug moves exactly like a Queen. In addition, the Pillbug has the special ability, in lieu of moving, to pick up and move another bug of either color. When doing so, the Pillbug picks up an adjacent piece and places it into a different, unoccupied space adjacent to itself. This special ability may, for example, be used to rescue a friendly Queen {{on the verge of being}} surrounded. The Pillbug may not move a bug which was just currently moved by one's opponent in the immediately preceding turn. All standard rules apply to the Pillbug. The Mosquito adapts to both the movement and special power of the Pillbug.|$|E

50|$|The orchestral <b>expansion</b> of the <b>piece</b> is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones (two tenor trombones {{and bass}} trombone), tuba, timpani, three percussionists, and strings.|$|R
40|$|Subject {{of my work}} is the Beuronese art and its {{relation}} to the liturgy. The first part concerns generally the beuronese confederation, its foundation, historical development and <b>expansion.</b> The <b>piece</b> draws the creation and the basic solutions of the confederation, coming of the Beuron Art School as an individual style, and presents the most important beuronese performers. The study also surveys the main works of the Beuron Art School and evaluates the School's influence on the main art streams of the period. The work then tries to describe and clarify the relationship between the beuronese conception of sacral art and liturgy using examples of the two most important Prague beuronese monasteries. For this purpose it analyses so called beuronese "Gesamtkunstwerk", using knowledge of the Christian iconography...|$|R
50|$|Shrink-fitting is a {{technique}} in which an interference fit is achieved by a relative size change after assembly. This is usually achieved by heating or cooling one component before assembly and allowing it {{to return to the}} ambient temperature after assembly, employing the phenomenon of thermal expansion to make a joint. For example, the thermal <b>expansion</b> of a <b>piece</b> of a metallic drainpipe allows a builder to fit the cooler piece to it. As the adjoined pieces reach the same temperature, the joint becomes strained and stronger.|$|R
25|$|Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: {{its high}} {{moisture}} content leads to poor <b>expansion</b> and chewy <b>pieces</b> of popcorn. Kernels {{with a high}} moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally {{in the range of}} 14–15% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop at all will decline.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{isostatic}} pressing method has been successfully applied for the prodn. of refractories and tableware. This method {{may be used for}} the prodn. of practically all shapes of plates, and also for more complex non-sym. pieces. This procedure leads to a rapid <b>expansion</b> of the <b>piece</b> after pressing, possibly resulting in damage. To avoid this problem, binding agents are added to the bodies which are capable of combating the expansion phenomenon. The effects of three types of poly(vinyl alc.) (varying mol. wt.), added in three different quantities, and poly(vinyl acetate) on this expansion phenomenon in the isostatic pressing of plates were examd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{characteristic}} of plate rolling {{process and the}} on-line applications, the non-homogeneous wear and thermal expansion of rollers, the elastic recovery and thermal <b>expansion</b> of work <b>pieces,</b> the variation of oil film thickness and the zero point deviation, which influence the precision of gap setting model, are analyzed. Based {{on the results of}} analysis, a high-precision gap setting model is proposed, and a zero point correction method is developed, in order to avoid overshoot, damp coefficient, which is affected by the thickness of work piece and zero point deviation are considered, is introduced. On-line applications indicate that the gap setting model improves the precision of gap setting and laid a good foundation of further improvement of thickness accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We present {{here the}} {{application}} of the computational tool CmapTools, which allows us to create our own concept maps, including multimedia elements to clarify or exemplify concepts. From different pieces of information about traditional festivities we have created a concept model depicted in a main concept map to which some other secondary maps are subordinated. Surfing through the information is very easy –from each concept we can select a menu of icons which correspond to different types of elements (texts, images, graphics, videos, other concept maps, web pages, etc.). This concept model has the advantage of being totally open and subject to continuous modifications and <b>expansions</b> because new <b>pieces</b> of information can be added to the concepts in the map at any time. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{deuteron}} formation in intermediate heavy ion reactions is approached within the strong coupling BCS theory {{assuming that the}} final stage of the reaction can be described as an adiabatic <b>expansion</b> of a <b>piece</b> of nuclear matter. Since the gap equation in the 3 S 1 - 3 D 1 channel goes over into the deuteron Schrödinger equation in the low density limit, a smooth transition from the superfluid Cooper pair phase to a Bose deuteron gas is found. For a fixed entropy ranging from 0. 5 to 2 units per particle the deuteron fraction, the chemical potential and temperature are reported as a function of density. For densities down to ρ= 0. 1 fm- 3 and lower, the deuteron-to-nucleon ratio rapidly increases from a density threshold strongly depending on the entropy. Decreasing further the density this ratio tends logarithmically to one. The possible relevance of these results for heavy ion collisions and the shortcomings of the present approach are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Finding Lloris {{details the}} {{inception}} {{and development of}} the script Lloris: A play in one act by Colin Hart, along with plans for the future development and <b>expansion</b> of the <b>piece.</b> The drafts that appear here are representative of three different stages of development: an early drafting of the title character alongside a few test scenes; a fully-realized rough draft that follows a complete narrative arc; and the latest iteration which addresses several of the major problems in the script while providing insights as to what else will be revised, added or fixed in future drafts. The play itself follows the journey of man in his late twenties as he befriends an elderly woman who checks herself into the nursing home where he works. Lloris uses this relationship to investigate, relive, and move beyond the memories of his past, while working through the struggles that face him in the present. Written using a non-linear combination of realism and anti¬realistic theatricality, Lloris explores the cyclical connections between music, beauty, sexuality, loss, and the growth that comes from letting go.

40|$|The Big Bang 13. 7 {{billion years}} ago started the <b>expansion</b> of our <b>piece</b> of the universe, and {{portions}} of it stopped expanding and made stars, galaxies, planets, and people. I summarize {{the history of the}} universe, and explain how humans have learned about its size, its expansion, and its constituents. The COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) mission measured the remnant heat radiation from the Big Bang, showed that its color (spectrum) matches the predictions perfectly, and discovered hot and cold spots in the radiation that reveal the primordial density variations that enabled us to exist. My current project, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), is the planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and will extend its scientific discoveries to ever greater distances and ever closer to the Big Bang itself. Its infrared capabilities enable it to see inside dust clouds to study the formation of stars and planets, and it may reveal the atmospheric properties of planets around other stars. Planned for launch in 2013, it is an international project led by NASA along with the European and Canadian Space Agencies...|$|R
