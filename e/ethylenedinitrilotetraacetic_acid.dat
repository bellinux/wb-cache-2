40|$|Numerous {{laboratory}} and field {{studies have shown}} that the chemical form (i. e., speciation) of many metals and radionuclides is affected by the presence of naturally occurring organic matter (OM) and its degradation products. The effects of OM (e. g., wood products) on the speciation and, therefore, the mobility of Am, Bk, Cf, Cm, Cs, Ni, NpO{sub 2 }, Rb, Sr. UO{sub 2 }, and Zr were estimated through use of geochemical and groundwater flow modeling. Due to the complex mixture nature of naturally occurring OM, the OM system was simplified through use of surrogate compounds (citric acid and <b>ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA)) to estimate effects of OM on radionuclide mobility. Using this approach, OM was found to have no effect on the inventory limits for Cs, NpO{sub 2 }, Rb and Zr. The inventory limits for the isotopes of Am, Bk, Cf, Cm, Ni, Pd, PuO{sub 2 }, Sr, and UO{sub 2 } calculated in the presence of OM decreased over a range of 26 percent for U- 233 to 48 percent for Pu- 240.

40|$|Aim: The study aims {{to develop}} a simple, rapid and {{economical}} normal phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) method for identification and quantification of 5, 7 -dichloroquinolin- 8 -ol and 5 -chloroquinolin- 8 -ol, two active ingredients of halquinol, an antimicrobial agent. Materials and Methods: The analysis was performed on silica gel 60 TLC plates pre-washed with disodium <b>ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> disodium salt (Na 2 EDTA) solution with methanol-ethyl acetate-iso-propyl alcohol-ammonia solution [8 : 20 : 1 : 0. 6 (v/v) ] as the mobile phase. Detection and quantification was performed densitometrically at 247 nm. Results: Responses of both 5, 7 -dichloroquinolin- 8 -ol and 5 -chloroquinolin- 8 -ol were linear functions of concentration {{in the range of}} 300 - 800 ng. The intraday precision and intermediate precision of the method for 5, 7 -dichloroquinolin- 8 -ol and 5 -chloroquinolin- 8 -ol was determined and it was found to be precise. Conclusion: The TLC method developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of 5, 7 -dichloroquinolin- 8 -ol and 5 -chloroquinolin- 8 -ol was found to be simple and economical. Therefore, it can be used in routine quality control analysis of halquinol in bulk drug powder and halquinol bolus...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} Cd on tolerance and antioxidant activities of castor, two different castor (Ricinus communis L.) cultivars (Zibo No. 5 and Zibo No. 8) were used for a hydroponic experiment (0, 1 and 2 mg/L Cd) and a pot experiment using Cd-contaminated soil (34 mg/kg) {{with the addition of}} <b>ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA). The results indicated that there were {{significant differences between the two}} cultivars with respect to Cd uptake in shoots (113 - 248 mg/kg for Zibo No. 5 and 130 - 288 mg/kg Zibo No. 8), biomass tolerance indexes (64. 9 %- 74. 6 % for Zibo No. 5 and 80. 1 %- 90. 9 % for Zibo No. 8) in the hydroponic experiment and survival rates (0 % for Zibo No. 5 and 100 % for Zibo No. 8) determined by the addition of EDTA in the pot experiment, suggesting that Zibo No. 8 has higher tolerance than Zibo No. 5. Moreover, the castor cultivars have low bioconcentration factors (4. 80 % for Zibo No. 5 and 5. 43 % for Zibo No. 8) and low translocation factors (< 1 %). Consequently, Zibo No. 8 can participate in Cd phytostabilization in highly Cd-polluted areas. The results indicated that glutathione (GSH) as a non-enzymatic antioxidant, and antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), were cultivar- and dose-dependent. The higher tolerance of Zibo No. 8 compared with Zibo No. 5 can be attributed to the higher GSH levels in the root and higher GPX activity in the leaf.

40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential {{channel of}} the ankyrin-binding repeat subfamily, TRPA 1, is a Ca 2 +-permeable non-selective cation channel that depolarizes the plasma membrane and causes Ca 2 + influx. A typical feature of TRPA 1 is its rapid desensitization following activation by agonists such as mustard oil (MO), cinnamaldehyde, {{and a high}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. In whole-cell recordings on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing TRPA 1, desensitization was delayed when phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PIP 2) was supplemented via the patch pipette, whereas the PIP 2 scavenger neomycin accelerated desensitization. Preincubation with the PI- 4 kinase inhibitor wortmannin reduced both constitutive TRPA 1 channels activity and the response to MO. Run down was also accelerated by high intracellular Mg 2 + concentrations, whereas chelating intracellular Mg 2 + with 10 mM <b>ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (EDTA) increased the basal channel activity. In inside-out patches, we observed a rapid run down of TRPA 1 activity, which could be prevented by application of diC 8 -PIP 2 or 2 mM Mg-ATP but not Na 2 -ATP to the cytosolic side of the excised patches. In isolated trigeminal ganglion neurons, preincubation with wortmannin resulted in inhibition of endogenous TRPA 1 activation by MO. Taken together, our data indicate that PIP 2 modulates TRPA 1, albeit {{to a lesser extent}} than other known PIP 2 -dependent TRP channels, and that tools modifying the plasma membrane PIP 2 content often have direct effects on this channel. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|The plaque-derived gram-negative {{microorganism}} Y 4 {{identified as}} a member of the genus Actinobacillus, was tested for a soluble cytotoxic factor(s). Sonication or incubation of viable Y 4 microorganisms in distilled water or normal human serum resulted in liberation of a soluble material which was cytotoxic in vitro for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The Y 4 soluble sonic extract was also cytotoxic to human peripheral blood monocytes. However, human lymphocytes, platelets, and fibroblasts, as well as rabbit, rat, and mouse leukocytes and chicken embryo fibroblasts, were not killed by exposure to the Y 4 sonic extract. No hemolytic activity was detected in the Y 4 sonic extract. No hemolytic activity was detected in the Y 4 sonic extract. Consequently, the factor(s) in the Y 4 sonic extract was referred to as Y 4 leukotoxin. The Y 4 leukotoxin was inactive at 4 degrees C, heat sensitive (56 degrees C, 30 min), and inactivated by proteases. The cytotoxic effect of Y 4 leukotoxin on PMNs was dose, time, and temperature dependent. The leukotoxin did not bind to viable PMNs at 4 degrees C but did bind to dead PMN membrane components at both 4 and 37 degrees C. The addition of bovine serum albumin (51 mg/ml) to PMN-Y 4 leukotoxin cultures inhibited the release of lactate dehydrogenase from the PMNs, but did not prevent the death of the cells as indicated by electron microscopy. Lysosomal markers were released in parallel to the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase from Y 4 leukotoxin-treated PMNs. The addition of 0. 02 M <b>ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> to these cultures inhibited release of lysosomal markers but enhanced the release of lactate dehydrogenase. These results suggested that a soluble leukotoxin with specificity for only human PMNs and monocytes can be liberated from viable Y 4. What role this leukotoxin plays in the pathogenicity of the Y 4 microorganism is not yet known. However, this leukotoxin is one of the first materials from a plaque-derived microorganism with a potential role in the pathogenesis of juvenile periodontitis...|$|E
