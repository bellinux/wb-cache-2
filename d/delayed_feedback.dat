On the other hand, time delay effects may destroy this behavior. Here, {{we consider the}} stabilization problem for second-order evolution equations with memory and intermittent <b>delay</b> <b>feedback.</b> We show that, under suitable assumptions involving the <b>delay</b> <b>feedback</b> coefficient and the memory kernel, asymptotic or exponential stability are still preserved.

40|$|Monitoring {{the sensory}} {{consequences}} of articulatory movements supports speaking. For example, <b>delaying</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> of a speaker's voice disrupts speech production. Also, {{there is evidence}} that this disruption may be decreased by immediate visual feedback, i. e., seeing one's own articulatory movements. It is, however, unknown whether <b>delayed</b> visual <b>feedback</b> affects speech production in fluent speakers. Here, the effects of delayed auditory and visual feedback on speech fluency (i. e., speech rate and errors), vocal control (i. e., intensity and pitch), and speech rhythm were investigated. Participants received delayed (by 200 [*]ms) or immediate auditory feedback, while repeating sentences. Moreover, they received either no visual feedback, immediate visual <b>feedback,</b> or <b>delayed</b> visual <b>feedback</b> (by 200, 400, and 600 [*]ms). <b>Delayed</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> affected fluency, vocal control, and rhythm. Immediate visual feedback had no effect on any of the speech measures when it was combined with <b>delayed</b> auditory <b>feedback.</b> <b>Delayed</b> visual <b>feedback</b> did, however, affect speech fluency when it was combined with <b>delayed</b> auditory <b>feedback.</b> In sum, the findings show that <b>delayed</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> disrupts fluency, vocal control, and rhythm and that <b>delayed</b> visual <b>feedback</b> can strengthen the disruptive effect of <b>delayed</b> auditory <b>feedback</b> on fluency...|$|R

A chaotic current of a deterministic inertia ratchet system is controlled to a regular current by stabilizing unstable periodic orbits embedded in a chaotic attractor of the unperturbed system. By selecting an unstable periodic orbit, which has a desired transport property, and stabilizing it via the extended <b>delay</b> <b>feedback</b> method, we can control transport properties of the deterministic inertia ratchet system.

30|$|As {{compared}} with the former method, a chaotic model with distributed <b>delay</b> <b>feedback</b> is more general than that with discrete <b>delay</b> <b>feedback</b> [3 – 5], because the distributed delay becomes a discrete delay when the delay kernel is a delta function at a certain time. The distributed delay has found widespread applications in many fields such as neural network [8, 10], complicated real models [9], the modeling of aggregative processes involving the flow of entities with random transit times through a given process [20], and so on. Therefore, it is of considerable significance to propose distributed delays as control input to control the chaotic system.|$|R
