5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, residents of the <b>Donbass</b> were generally in favour of stronger ties with Russia, in contrast to the rest of Ukraine. A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal Ukraine and economic autonomy for <b>Donbass.</b> This was followed by a 1994 consultative referendum on various constitutional questions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent Ukraine. These questions included whether Russian should be enshrined as an official language of Ukraine, whether Russian should be the language of administration in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, whether Ukraine should federalise, and whether Ukraine should have closer ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: Ukraine remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the <b>Donbass</b> gained no autonomy.|$|E
5|$|A planned Vigilant Eagle 2014 was {{suspended}} due to {{tensions between the}} United States and Canada on one side, and the Russian Federation on the other, over the War in <b>Donbass.</b> The exercise would have involved, for the first time, the Japan Air Self Defense Force. According to American and Canadian officials, the exercises were canceled at their initiative.|$|E
5|$|According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 57.2% of the {{population}} of the <b>Donbass</b> was ethnic Ukrainian, 38.5% was ethnic Russian, and 4.3% belonged to other ethnic groups, mainly Greeks (1.1%) and Belarusians (0.9%). 72.8% of {{the population}} reported that their native language was Russian, whilst 26.1% reported that it was Ukrainian. Other languages, spoken mainly by minority ethnic groups, accounted for 1.1% {{of the population}}. Amongst these groups, only the Roma were reported as not using Russian in daily life, citing Romani instead.|$|E
5|$|After January 1943 {{as part of}} the Southern Front, {{that became}} the 4th Ukrainian Front on 20 October 1943, the 51st Army took part in the Rostov, <b>Donbass</b> (August–September 1943), Melitopol (September–November 1943) and the 1944 Crimean {{offensive}} operation. On 1 April 1944, 51st Army included the 1st Guards Rifle Corps (33rd Guards, 91st and 346th Rifle Divisions), 10th Rifle Corps (216th, 257th, and 279th Rifle Divisions), 63rd Rifle Corps (263rd, 267th, and 417th Rifle Divisions), the 77th Rifle Division, the 78th Fortified Region, artillery, armor and other support units. During these operations, the 51st Army's attacks trapped the German XXIX. Armeekorps against the Sea of Azov.|$|E
5|$|Four {{weeks into}} the campaign, the Germans {{realized}} they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies and General Bock quickly {{came to the conclusion}} that not only had the Red Army offered stiff opposition, but German difficulties were also due to the logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. He now believed he could defeat the Soviet state by economic means, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the <b>Donbass</b> and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north.|$|E
5|$|Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was {{intended}} as the main Soviet offensive for 1943. Its aim was to destroy the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South. After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front, during Operation Citadel, the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit, delaying {{the start of the}} offensive until 3 August. Diversionary attacks, launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the <b>Donbass,</b> drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main blow. The offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South. They drove through the German positions, making broad and deep penetrations. By 5 August, the Soviets had liberated Belgorod.|$|E
5|$|The {{heavy losses}} {{sustained}} by the Heer (army) since the opening of Operation Barbarossa had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery. Units were in total 470,000 men understrength. For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943 {{the burden of the}} offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and holding ground on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions. In view of the exposed position of Army Group South, Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive. He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a move across the Donets River toward the Dnieper. In February, he proposed waiting for this offensive to develop and then delivering a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks. Hitler, concerned about the political implications of taking a defensive stance, and preoccupied with holding the <b>Donbass,</b> rejected this plan. On 10 March, Manstein presented an alternative plan whereby the German forces would pinch off the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided.|$|E
25|$|By early August 2014, {{at least}} 730,000 had fled {{fighting}} in the <b>Donbass</b> and left for Russia. This number, much larger than earlier estimates, was given by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The number of internal refugees rose to 117,000. By the start of September, after a sharp escalation {{over the course of}} August, the number of people displaced from <b>Donbass</b> within Ukraine more than doubled to 260,000. The number of refugees that fled from <b>Donbass</b> to Russia rose to 814,000. Despite two months of a shaky ceasefire established by the Minsk Protocol, the number of refugees displaced from <b>Donbass</b> in Ukraine escalated sharply to 466,829 in mid November.|$|E
