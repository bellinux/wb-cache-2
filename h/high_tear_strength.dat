5000|$|A non-rigid armored vessel (#27) was {{designed}} that would withstand {{the rigors of}} most landings and preserve the air sample of approximately [...] It consisted of three nested cylinders of flexible materials that, from the outside to the inside, were: a tough outer layer of plasticized nylon; an intermediate layer of woven nylon with very <b>high</b> <b>tear</b> <b>strength,</b> and; an innermost cylinder of polyethylene film that {{would serve as a}} gas barrier for the air sample. At takeoff the armored vessel hung in a deflated form around the steel cable (#27) and below an open parachute (#23) that would provide braking of the system descent if the rate exceeded about 2000 feet per minute. Launching of this complex balloon system required special handling techniques, and the entire process was referred to as a platform launch, a novel concept developed by Harold E. Froehlich, principal engineer of the Balloons and Meteorological System Group. In this form of launching the load train, nearly 300 ft in length, was laid out on a ground cloth-covered runway with the lowest part of the load train in the upwind direction. The uppermost part of the system, the top of the lifting balloon, would be in the downwind direction. A heavy platform was positioned at a point toward the top of the lifting balloon, and the balloon material would pass over the platform and be securely held in place by a large horizontal padded roller about four feet in length. The helium inflation tube was located in the upper portion of the lifting balloon so that the helium source would inflate the section of the balloon beyond the platform. Since the system would be ascending to 80000 ft in altitude, only about 3% of the maximum balloon volume was filled with helium. The inflation took place by metering in an amount of helium lifting gas that would equal the gross weight of the system plus typically about 5% of ‘free lift’ to ensure that the system would ascend at an appropriate rate at the launching. Launching was initiated by releasing the padded roller on the launch platform. The ascending balloon would then sequentially pick up {{the lower part of the}} lifting balloon, the deployed parachute and armored vessel, the uninflated envelope, and lastly the heavy insulated bag containing the controller, blower, instruments, telemetering equipment and power supply. There were variations of this procedure that evolved to facilitate the launching. For example, the heavy instrument bag and blower assembly was eventually mounted on the front of a vehicle that drove under the balloon system as it ascended during launching, and the bag was released from the vehicle using small explosive devices. [...] Grab Bag flights were typically launched early in the morning and recovered during daylight hours of that same day. The ascent time to 80000 ft was usually about three hours. As the balloon system approached the ceiling altitude, the excess lift (referred to as [...] "free lift") that drove the system upward on launching filled out a duct system of the lifting balloon, and helium was automatically vented from the lifting balloon and slowed the ascent. As this process continued, the balloon system slowly ascended to the ceiling altitude and was in equilibrium, the lift of the helium balloon just balancing the total weight of the system. If this process took place as designed, about thirty minutes were needed to assure that the system was stable at the ceiling altitude of 80000 ft. If the system instruments indicated that the altitude was not changing, the blower attached to the sample envelope balloon at the base of the system was initiated by the controller. The effect of turning on the blower was almost immediately evident in the appearance of the sample balloon. Viewing the system through a tracking telescope clearly showed the sample envelope beginning to fill out. The sample gathering process typically required of the order of an hour or so to be completed, the appearance of the system then being of two balloons, one immediately on top of the other. The blower was then turned off by the controller and a valve closed that sealed the sample envelope from the outside. The autopilot was then activated by the controller, releasing helium from the lifting balloon (#116) and initiating a descent of the entire system. In practice, the descent of the system did not become apparent for of the order of an hour after the autopilot was activated. This was because the sample balloon, now containing a large volume of air, would generate lift with any descent due to adiabatic heating of the sample air in the isothermal stratosphere. It could require an hour or two to establish a nominal descent rate of the system. The descent to altitudes of the order of 15000 ft could take of the order of two to three hours. At this point the axial fan (#29) was automatically initiated to transfer air in the sample balloon into the armored vessel. This transfer was usually completed before the system reached an altitude of 4 or 5 thousand feet and a valve in the armored vessel valve just above the axial fan (#25) was sealed by the controller. As the system continued to descend and touched down, explosive cutters fired to release the lifting balloon from the lower part of the system and the armored vessel fell the short remaining distance, perhaps fifty feet, to the ground. Usually the recovery crew was at the landing site and immediately began the process of transferring the air sample from the armored vessel into high-pressure bottles for transfer to another laboratory for analyses. A series of six test flights were carried out in the Grab Bag development program in which various system elements were examined. The seventh flight would be the first attempt to capture the first air sample at 80000 ft in the Minneapolis area in mid-August 1953. The six test flights carried out tests of various system components, and included: tests and further development of the launching procedure for this complex system; an evaluation of the system controller; adequacy of the power supply and the autopilot function; a study of the blower function at altitude to evaluate both its function and the volume of air delivered into the sample balloon as compared to the laboratory results; evaluation of the process in which the axial fan transferred the air sample from the sample balloon into the armored vessel and the vessel was sealed; and in each case, further development of logistics for system launching and recovery.|$|E

The trees were from the same full-sib family and were 12 years old. No relationship between site, and wood density and fibre dimensions could be inferred because the differences between trees within a site were found to be greater than the differences between sites. All of the trees were pulped by the sulphate process: when constant digestion conditions with 18 % active alkali were used, the yield of pulp from individual trees was from 41. 3 to 44. 9 %.

40|$|Variation in wood density, {{tracheid}} length, resin content, and {{incidence of}} compression wood in radiata pine are documented and discussed {{with respect to}} their potential influence on pulp and paper manufacture. In general terms, each of the properties mentioned tends to decrease southwards within New Zealand. Tree average wood density, for instance, drops 20 % from Auckland to Canterbury Conservancies (455 to 380 kg/m 8). This decrease will result in increased handling costs and wood consumption per tonne of pulp produced, and reduced chemical pulp digester yields. For paper quality, variations in tear index as a consequence of wood property changes are predicted to be substantial. Thus regional wood resource qualities need to be matched with those paper and paperboard products which can be most effectively manufactured from them.

40|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers (LSRs) {{have been}} shown to possess very favorable properties as dielectric electroactive polymers due to their very high breakdown strengths (up to 170 V/μm) combined with their fast response, relatively <b>high</b> <b>tear</b> <b>strength,</b> acceptable Young’s modulus as well as they can be filled with permittivity enhancing fillers. However, LSRs possess large viscosity, especially when additional fillers are added. Therefore both mixing and coating of the required thin films become difficult. The solution so far has been to use solvent to dilute the reaction mixture in order both to ensure better particle dispersion as well as allowing for film formation properties. We show that the mechanical properties of the films as well as the electrical breakdown strength can be affected, and that the control of the amount of solvent throughout the coating process is essential for solvent borne processes. Another problem encountered when adding solvent to the highly filled reaction mixture is the loss of tension in the material upon large deformations. These losses are shown to be irreversible and happen within the first large-strain cycle...|$|E

Silicone rubbers are the materials of choice, however it is widely accepted that these materials do not possess ideal properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the properties of a range of commercially available silicone rubber maxillofacial materials and make recommendations for improvements. Methods. Specimens of five commonly used maxillofacial materials were prepared in dental flasks according manufacturers instructions. Tear strength, tensile strength, percentage elongation, hardness, water absorption and water contact angles were determined for each material. Results. The tear strength of Factor II, Cosmesil HC and Nusil were all comparable and significantly higher than Cosmesil St and Prestige (p, 0. 001). Nusil had a significantly higher tensile strength and elongation in comparison to the other materials (p, 0. 001) and Cosmesil St and Cosmesil HC were significantly harder (p, 0. 001). Factor II was significantly less wetted and Prestige and Cosmsesil St had a significantly higher water absorption in comparison to the other materials. Conclusions. None of the commercially available silicone rubber materials possessed ideal properties for use as a maxillofacial prosthetic material.

Rubber particle size had substantial effect on mechanical strength in case of HRJ- 10518 based blends while no remarkable influence was found in case of octene-based counterparts. Calendaring pressure could be minimized without any adverse effect. Non-vulcanized rubber was utilized to enhance tear strength but its effect was off-set by the degradation of interfacial surface at high temperature.

Developing synthetic materials with these properties {{is a significant}} challenge. Hydrogel composites made from high stiffness fabrics is a strategy to develop such unique materials; however, the ability to produce these materials has proven difficult, since common hydrogels swell in water and interact poorly with solid components, limiting the transfer of force from the fabric to the hydrogel matrix. In this work, for the first time, we successfully produce extraordinarily tough hydrogel composites by strategically selecting a recently developed tough hydrogel that de-swells in water. The new composites, consisting of polyampholyte hydrogels and glass fiber woven fabrics, exhibit extremely high effective toughness (250 000 J m(- 2)), <b>high</b> <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> (similar to 65 N mm(- 1)), high tensile modulus (606 MPa), and low bending modulus (4. 7 MPa).

Importantly, the mechanical properties of these composites greatly outperform the properties of either individual component.

40|$|The {{effects of}} wood age (internodes from apex, growth ring number from the pith) on the {{papermaking}} properties of kraft pulp from radiata pine are discussed.

Similarly in 18 -year-old thinnings, the 15 th internode pulps had <b>higher</b> <b>tear</b> index than the pulps from 10 th or 5 th internodes.

In studies of 5 -ring-group material numbered from the pith {{it was found that}} the outer wood pulps from mature trees had <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> 3 times that of pulp from growth rings 1 - 5; the inner wood pulps formed sheets of higher density than pulps from outer wood, since the fibres were more readily collapsed.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. Due to the {{opportunity}} for afforestation in South Africa being severely limited, extensive research is being carried out on obtaining more wood per given area, improving the quality and value of the wood and on gaining {{a better understanding of}} how wood properties influence the characteristics of the pulp it produces. The last mentioned is the main focus of this study. If the variations in pulp, due to variations in wood properties, are better understood, then the existing fibre resource could be more efficiently managed and utilised to maximise its value. The main objective of this study was to determine how variation in physical and chemical properties, from the existing P. patula resource drives variation in pulp strength properties. It is well known that differences in tree age and site index lead to major sources of variation of various wood properties. These two easily measured variables were used in this study to capture a significant amount of variation in the wood of the aforementioned genus that enters a mill. Samples were obtained from two extremes in site quality, as measured by site index, (viz. good and poor sites) and three age ranges (viz. 9 - 10 years, 13 - 14 years and 20 - 21 years) from the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Wood chips from each of the six sites were pulped for various lengths of time, using the Kraft pulping method and under the same pulping conditions. A wide range of anatomical and chemical properties of wood and pulp were measured to characterise these samples as extensively as possible. All pulp samples were beaten in a PFI mill, at four different levels. The freeness values of the beaten samples were measured. The physical properties measured on handsheets made from the pulp included sheet density, burst index, tear index, tensile index, tensile energy absorbed, stretch and zero-span tensile strength. Regression models were developed to quantify the impact of the measured variables on each of the strength properties. Principal component analysis was performed on the wood characteristics measured and indicated that tree age is a more critical source of variation in wood properties than site index. The predictions of whole tree wood properties from the properties measured at breast height were excellent. Pulping studies showed that pulp yield, at kappa 20 - 30, increased with tree age. Wood cellulose proved to be a very good predictor of pulp yield. Xylose and mannose appeared to be most resistant to degradation during pulping. The low yield pulps were easier to refine than those with high yield. This has important implications when considering high yield pulping processes. With regard to pulp strength, the younger material could not achieve the high tear strengths obtained by the older material. However, the tear strengths achieved by these younger sites were comparable with, if not higher than, that obtained by hardwood species. The implications of this is that younger P. patula trees could be used for grades of paper where very <b>high</b> <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> is not essential, but tensile is (e. g. tissue paper) and that older material can be better used for the purpose of providing the <b>high</b> <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> needed by certain paper grades (e. g. linerboard and sackkraft). The maximum tensile strength achieved by the younger material was higher than that of the older material. When compared at constant freeness or sheet density, longer cooking times had a deleterious effect on strength properties. Strong predictions of pulp strength from basic wood properties were obtained when strength results were compared at constant freeness and sheet density. Because of the great influence of fibre morphology and chemistry on refining rates and on the resultant strength properties, the results of the study suggest that fibres of greatly different chemical and anatomical characteristics should not be refined together, if beating energy and pulp strength are to be optimised. However, further work is required to evaluate if the separation of fibre resources, to improve pulp quality, would be economically viable...|$|E

These composites combine the elastic behavior of rubbers with strength and stiffness of fibers. Reinforcement with short fibers offers additional features such as design flexibility, <b>high</b> modulus, <b>tear</b> <b>strength,</b> etc. The degree of reinforcement depends on parameters such as: {{the nature of the}} rubber matrix, the type of fibers, the concentration and orientation of fibers, fiber to rubber adhesion (generation of a strong interface), fiber length and aspect ratio of the fibers. In this research aramid fibers have been chosen because of their significantly higher modulus and strength, compared to other commercial fibers. Compounds based on NR and EPDM are prepared. Short aramid fibers with different kinds of surface treatments, standard finish and RFL-coating result in different rubber-fiber interfaces.

The effects of curing systems (i. e., sulfur and peroxide) on morphological, rheological, thermal and mechanical properties were studied. It is found that the sulfur cured TPVs show <b>higher</b> tensile <b>strength,</b> <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation at break than those cured with the DCP systems. The rheological analysis indicates that TPVs cured with DCP system show lower apparent shear viscosity than those with sulfur system.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{defatted}} rice bran (DRB) as a filler for natural rubbervulcanisate on its cure characteristics, mechanical properties and morphology wereinvestigated. The properties of the DRB-filled vulcanisate were also compared with clayfilledand CaCO 3 -filled vulcanisates. At similar loading level (50 parts per hundred ofrubber), DRB-filled vulcanisate gave the shortest cure time. Clay-filled vulcanisateshowed <b>highest</b> tensile and <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> followed by DRB-filled vulcanisate. However,CaCO 3 -filled vulcanisate gave highest rebound resilience while DRB-filled vulcanisateexhibited highest modulus, hardness and abrasion resistance. Scanning electronmicrographs revealed that the morphology of clay-filled vulcanisate was morehomogenous than that of DRB-filled and CaCO 3 -filled vulcanisates. According to theseobservations, DRB can potentially {{be used as a}} cheap and more environment-friendlynatural filler when an improvement in mechanical properties was not so critical...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flexible {{polyurethane}} (PU) foams {{were prepared}} by replacing commercial petroleum-based polyether polyol with palm oil-based polyol up to 50 wt%. Palm oil was converted to polyol by transesterification reaction with glycerol using calcium oxide as a catalyst. PU foams were then prepared from reaction between mixtures of palm oil-based polyol and petrochemical polyols with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) using water as blowing agent. The morphology and physical-mechanical properties including apparent density, indentation hardness, compressive deflection coefficient or support factor, tensile <b>strength,</b> and <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> of the prepared foams were characterized and {{compared to those}} of reference foam prepared using only conventional petrochemical polyols. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the cellular structures of all the prepared foams were semi-open and the cell size decreased with higher amount of palm oil-based polyol. The apparent densities and the compressive deflection coefficient of the PU foams increased with the increasing amount of palm oil-based polyol, while the indentation hardness showed the opposite tendency. Furthermore, the obtained foam modified with palm oil-based polyol of 20 wt % {{were found to have}} the <b>highest</b> tensile and <b>tear</b> <b>strengths...</b>|$|R

One of the main features related to this class of composites is their hysteretic properties which are of great importance especially in dynamic applications such as tire treads. In this research, short aramid fibers with different kinds of surface treatments: Standard finish and resorcinol formaldehyde latex (RFL) -coating, have been applied in two different carbon black filled rubber compounds based on natural rubber (NR) and ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM). The dynamic properties of the compounds have been measured as influenced by the different kinds of fiber treatments on rubber-fiber interaction.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure for products to be manufactured in part or entirely from renewable materials {{and for the}} energy consumption over {{the life cycle of}} products to be minimised. In the case of products based on rubber, NR and polymers based on NR can help to meet these challenges. With its very uniform microstructure, NR has very low hysteresis and undergoes strain crystallisation, leading to very high tensile strength and resistance to tearing and abrasion. The <b>high</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>tear</b> resistance and resilience are suited to many engineering applications. Because of its low heat build-up and good green <b>strength,</b> tack, <b>tear</b> <b>strength</b> and adhesion to brassed-steel cord, large amounts of NR are used in tyres, especially in larger tyres where NR dominates. NR latex provides high strength in unfilled thin-walled products, such as condoms and gloves. Epoxidation of NR raises increases the polarity of the polymer and the glass transition temperature, while the ability to strain crystallise is retained up to about 50 % epoxidation. ENR interacts strongly with silica, without the need for coupling agents. Because of thes...|$|R
