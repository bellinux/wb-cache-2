50|$|The park {{consists}} of two sections, {{on either side of}} Twofold Bay and the town of Eden. The smaller northern section is bounded on its western border by the Princes Highway. The geology of this section is mainly sedimentary rock (ironstone and clay) laid down in the Paleogene, with some quartzite outcrops. The main attraction for tourists is the Pinnacles, a multicoloured <b>erosion</b> <b>gully</b> with white sands overlaying rusty red clay. The southern section coastline is metamorphic and Devonian in age, with some heavily folded sections at Red Point, near Boyd's tower.|$|E
50|$|The hominin skull was {{discovered}} by Asahmed Humet, {{a member of the}} Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project; he found the recently resurfaced fossil in a small <b>erosion</b> <b>gully</b> that empties into the Gawis river drainage basin in the Afar Region, some 300 miles northeast of Addis Ababa. The skull is a nearly complete cranium of what is believed to be a Middle Pleistocene human ancestor. While different from a modern human, the braincase, upper face and jaw of the cranium have unmistakable anatomical evidence that belong to human ancestry. The discovery was reported by Sileshi Semaw, director of the Gona Project at the Stone Age Institute. Semaw noted the skull fossil could be a transitional form that fills a gap in human evolutionary origins; he described its appearance as intermediate between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionGully erosion is {{the process}} by which running water cuts new {{unstable}} channels into erodible soil and weathered rock. It causes severe land degradation, and is a major source of sediment and associated nutrients to river systems and ultimately to coastal waters or inland basins. In northern Australia there is widespread <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> into unconfined alluvial deposits on active floodplains and terraces (relict floodplains) – here defined as alluvial <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> 4. Alluvial <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> scarps are locally known as “breakaways” by pastoralists (Figure 1). Until this recent TRaCK research, alluvial <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> in northern Australia was poorly documented scientifically and is substantially different from colluvial or hillslope gullying in south‐eastern or northern Australia...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> {{represents}} an important process of land degradation, {{only a few}} studies in the Czechia have quantified the <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> rate yet. Because of the complex and nonlinear dynamics, the estimation of the <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> rate requires a long term and technically difficult research. However, a recent methodological approach in dendrogeomorphology allows to reconstruct a gully development and assess <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> rate. Based on geodetic survey, a detailed mapping of four gullies in the Polomené Mountains was carried out. Subsequently, the <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> rate was evaluated by the analysis of 73 exposed roots of broadleaved trees. The first erosion episode was detected in 1981, however, most of the roots were exposed in the last 15 years. Gullies have been forming non-continuously showing median erosion rates between 10. 0 to 13. 4 mm/year. Even though topographic parameters and land use changes in drainage basin area may affect the intensity of erosion, most of the erosion episodes have been probably triggered by extreme rainfall events. This study exemplifies that intesive <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> may occur even on forest soils. Vegetation cover influences a morphology of gully slopes, but its ability to prevent intensive <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> is limited.

40|$|The Soil and Water Conservation Project in the Xihanshui River Basin {{started in}} the late 1980 s, and climatology, {{hydrology}} and sediment yield data from 1983 to 2005 have been collected for this thesis research, {{in order to be}} able to identify the trends in climate, and the effect of their interacting outcomes with the Soil and Water Conservation Project. Three scenario years based on the rainfall data were identified, to be used in SEDNET modelling; a dry year (1997), a wet year (1984), and an average year (2000). The four main sediment production processes: hillslope erosion, bank <b>erosion,</b> <b>gully</b> erosion and mass movement are discussed, as well as the floodplain deposition. All of these are the prerequisites for defining the element (subcatchment) sediment budgets in order to run SEDNET. SEDNET has also been used to examine alternative practices for targeting soil conservation initiatives, and a variety of tests is undertaken to assess the optimal strategy for selecting subcatchments for treating hillslope <b>erosion,</b> <b>gully</b> erosion and bank erosion in order to reduce sediment supply and yield. The progress of soil and water conservation in the Xihanshui River Basin since the 1980 s has had a significant beneficial impact in lowering rates of sediment production and sediment yield. The use of a spatially-distributed modelling strategy allows identification of the relative effects of land cover changes and climate as controls of sediment yield, and provides a framework for guiding the implementation of conservation policy. There are some limitations to the SEDNET methodology, such as its steady state assumption, the lack of flexibility in its hydrological routines, and the lack of sub-models for some processes; however, this detailed application shows its considerable potential in sediment modelling for a large catchment.

40|$|Network of gullies can {{increase}} above 300 % during about 80 years (Swanson et all., 1989). More often {{the rate of}} <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> is 0, 2 - 0, 8 m/year (Martinez-Casasnovas, 2003). The analyze of precipitation, valley morphology and sites where erosion occurs can be use to building the local erosion models. The models allow estimate future <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> and very often we can estimate local thresholds to erosion occurs. One of the main factors conditioning <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> is the quantity and intensity of precipitation. In wet periods <b>gully</b> <b>erosion</b> may occur several times faster. However, studies conducted in Canada prove that natural processes associated with climatic fluctuations are insufficient to cause gully initiation, but may contribute to ongoing gully expansion. According to (Stankowianski, 2003) gullies are formed during periods of extensive forest clearance and expansion of farmland, but the triggering mechanism of gullying are extreme rainfall events.

30|$|The {{most likely}} {{explanation}} for these inconsistencies {{is that we}} did not account for fuel moisture nor measure wind during burns at a scale useful for these spatial analyses. Fuel moisture and wind changes during burns likely introduced additional layers of spatial variation onto the patterns of pre-burn fuel loads. For example, Robichaud and Miller (1999) found that fuel consumption in a Douglas fir/lodgepole pine forest varied according to both pre-burn duff thickness and duff moisture content. Fuel moisture and relative humidity differences may explain why the central section of Plot 6 burned at lower temperatures despite having high loading of 1 – 1000 hour fuels and standing biomass. This section was located in a moist <b>erosion</b> <b>gully</b> that had a larger hardwood component and was more shaded {{than the rest of the}} plot. While measuring fuel moisture across small spatial scales could be easily incorporated into future studies, the costs of developing a technique to measure wind speed and direction (at the time of flaming front passage) at more than 100 spatially referenced points over a landscape scale would be prohibitive.|$|E
