2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a {{wonderful}} perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
60|$|He stalked solemnly ahead, and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> {{along the}} corridor.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> with bulging {{eyes as he}} tottered {{off into}} the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "You stop here," [...] Colebrook said, briefly, flinging his bridle to Doolittle to hold. [...] "Doctor and <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him.</b> Thick bush. Knows {{the ways}} of it. Revolvers ready!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Amory de Catinat, the heretic and Huguenot," [...] {{cried the}} monk. [...] "I have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> up the St. Lawrence, and <b>I</b> have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> up the Richelieu, and <b>I</b> would have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to the world's end if I could but {{bring him back}} with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Finale: <b>I</b> Will <b>Follow</b> <b>Him</b> ('Chariot')" [...] — Deloris & The Sisters ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> reluctantly, for I {{liked his}} manner less and less; but I had {{scarcely}} an alternative.|$|E
60|$|And he went out, striding on {{with his}} cocked hat and his great cane, and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> {{down into}} his office. He closed the door, and set his hat down upon the desk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not follow}} Matai Shang to kill him, though the God of mine own planet knows that my hands itch to be at his throat. <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him,</b> Thuvan Dihn, because with him are two prisoners--my wife, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and your daughter, Thuvia of Ptarth.|$|R
6000|$|... "God kept it. And I have it; here!" [...] and {{she pressed}} her hands tight over her bosom. [...] "And here I must keep it till I give it into his hands, if <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> round the world!" [...] And as she spoke her eyes shone in the lamplight, with an unearthly {{brilliance}} which made Mary shudder.|$|R
25|$|Margaret Battavio (Little Peggy March) (1948-), American pop singer. Her song <b>I</b> Will <b>Follow</b> <b>Him</b> {{was number}} one in April 1963.|$|R
60|$|It seemed rank lunacy, but the {{argument}} of those twenty pounds would overcome many objections. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to his room.|$|E
60|$|But he had disappeared. So <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him,</b> and {{we entered}} by the front. Robina was {{standing}} by the table, peeling potatoes.|$|E
6000|$|Alhadra. This night your {{chieftain}} armed himself, [...] And hurried from me. But <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> [...] At distance, till I saw him enter--there! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish {{to ask her}} whither {{this man}} has gone. He is my enemy, and <b>I</b> would <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> as <b>I</b> have already <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> far. He has done worse by me and mine than by this poor girl even. Grant my request, father, that I {{may be able to}} work my vengeance on him, and with mine the Church's also.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Do {{you like}} Braham’s singing. The little Jew has bewitched me. <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> like {{as the boys}} follow Tom the Piper. He cures me of melancholy as David cured Saul Braham’s singing when it is impassion’d is finer than Mrs. Siddons or Mr. Kemble's acting & {{when it is not}} impassion'd it [...] as good as hearing a person of fine sense talking. The brave little Jew! ...|$|R
60|$|Jerry was right, and <b>I</b> meekly <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to the commodore's cabin, {{where we}} saw Darius hob-nobbing with Joshua Barney {{as if they}} were two old cronies.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> downstairs {{into the}} smoke-room. We seated {{ourselves}} upon a luxurious divan, and the Count {{immediately began to}} talk about his son.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him,</b> dodging {{between the}} houses, {{and when we}} had got off the line he took me by the two {{shoulders}} from behind.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} door for him, and, taking up his brick again, he entered, and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> in. There was a deal of talk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no,' petulantly {{returned}} the boy. 'What am I {{that he should}} notice me? It is M. de Ribaumont whom <b>I</b> <b>follow,</b> not <b>him</b> or his cause.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> from the room, but she stopped me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will remain}} on the old homestead--at least for a time. If things improve we may induce father to return; if not, <b>I</b> will <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> into the wilderness." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{repeated}} the wink upon a smaller scale. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> into the drawing-room, {{still in the}} dark as to his exact political position.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg pardon, monsieur," [...] said I, as <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to {{his private}} sitting-room, [...] "for having {{returned}} so late--it {{was not my}} fault." ...|$|E
60|$|The sound woke {{me as if}} {{from some}} terrible dream, and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> still {{in a sort of}} stupor up to the smoking room.|$|E
60|$|And {{in a while}} out of that {{numerous}} company stepped one whom by his primrose {{face and}} mien I took to be Mounsieur Mustardseed, and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> after <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> do <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> in that business, I {{tell you}} what you've got to do," [...] {{announced}} the shipowner's son. [...] "Some time you've both {{got to take a}} nice big cruise with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{writer and}} essayist Charles Lamb is effusive, if patronising, about Braham {{in a letter}} of 1808:Do you like Braham’s singing.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> down a bye street; {{he opened}} a door with his own key; and the next instant I was {{sheltered}} under Mr. Mannion's roof.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> {{into his}} room, {{and he began}} putting on his gown, and {{touching}} himself up before a little glass he had, hanging inside a closet door.|$|E
60|$|The speech had a {{sinister}} sound, but <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> none the less into the house. The man-servant, Austin, like a wooden image, {{closed the door}} behind us.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>I</b> {{rose and}} <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> {{out into the}} open courtyard, much marvelling what might be toward.|$|R
60|$|As I {{turned to}} {{discover}} {{the cause of his}} act he continued to pull me steadily in the opposite direction, nor would he desist until I had turned about and indicated that <b>I</b> would <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> voluntarily.|$|R
