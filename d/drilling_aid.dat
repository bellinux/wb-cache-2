50|$|Saturated {{sodium formate}} {{solutions}} (as well as mixtures of other alkali metal formates such as potassium and cesium formate) {{are used as}} important <b>drilling</b> and stabilizing <b>aids</b> in gas and oil exploration because of their relatively high density. By mixing the corresponding saturated alkali metal formate solutions any densities between 1,0 and 2,3 g/cm3 can be set. The saturated solutions are biocidal and long-term stable against microbial degradation. Diluted, on the other hand, they are fast and completely biodegradable. As alkali metal formates as <b>drilling</b> <b>aids</b> make it unnecessary to add solid fillers to increase the density (such as barytes) and the formate solutions can be recovered and recycled at the drilling site, formates represent an important advance in exploration technology.|$|R

50|$|The full-twisting layout is {{a complex}} skill and {{requires}} professional coaching. The standing twist is a <b>drill</b> to <b>aid</b> with body awareness. Practicing this skill requires a perfect alignment of the body along the long axis. The long axis is an imaginary line running {{through the center of}} the body from head to toe. The purpose of the skill is to practice landing exactly how you started; arms over your head, feet together, and your body tightened and straight. Practicing the standing twist helps you gain awareness in the air. This awareness prevents you from getting directionally lost in the air. It is recommended to start with a half twist, and then progress to a full twist.|$|R

50|$|Total losses can be regained through {{conventional}} use {{of increased}} viscosity and additives, or {{through use of}} unconventional methods such as pumping of large organic particles (like kenaf), paper and large mica flakes with a high viscosity fluid. If total losses occur and circulation cannot be regained, several options are available, depending on the operational requirements and depth being drilled in relation to desired production geological zones. Continuing drilling while pumping drilling fluid is one option, though continued drilling while pumping water is less costly and more often used. Sometimes the cuttings from continued <b>drilling</b> will <b>aid</b> in reducing leaks or stop losses altogether. A third option is to cement the zone where the losses occurred, and to drill through the cement and continue drilling the well. This third option is very often the most cost effective if severe losses occur, as lost circulation sometimes cannot be controlled with other methods.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{conclude}} whether giving students answers to addition facts during timed <b>drills</b> would <b>aid</b> in automaticity of known facts, and show {{an increase in the}} number of problems students were able to solve cOlTectly. This study compared two thirdgrade math classes.

What leaming activities do students do at home that might help them learn their math facts? Does weekly practice in school, coupled with practice at home, aid in retention? A student and parent survey were administered and examples of tests are included. A student survey asked children to think about strategies used to help them study math facts, and the purpose of the parent survey was to find out how often their child studied and whether or not a child received assistance in studying facts at home. The 3 researcher found that students in both math classes showed an increase in math fact retention. There was not a significant improvement in math fact retention found when comparing the results between the control math group and experimental group. The automaticity of both groups increased, as well as their speed, but not significantly in the amount of time the research was conducted. ...|$|R
40|$|Stuck pipe is {{a common}} problem with {{tremendous}} impact on drilling efficiency and costs in the oil industry.

One may also place different fluids around the stick area and use a drilling jar. However, in cases where common solutions don't work, then the cutoff is the last resort.

50|$|Sonic tools, {{such as the}} Baker Hughes XMAC-F1, {{consist of}} {{multiple}} piezoelectric transducers and receivers mounted on the tool body at fixed distances. The transmitters generate a pattern of sound waves at varying operating frequencies into the down hole formation. The signal path leaves the transmitter, passes through the mud column, travels along the borehole wall and is collected at multiple receivers spaced out along the tool body. The {{time it takes for}} the sound wave to travel through the rock is dependent on a number of properties of the existing rock, including formation porosity, lithology, permeability and rock strength. Different types of pressure waves can be generated in specific axis, allowing geoscientists to determine anisotropic stress regimes.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum chip disposal capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute heel side. Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and reamed hole. A subsidiary objective is to design the form milling cutter that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used. To control the grinding parameter, a prototype drill grinder was designed and built upon the framework of an existing cincinnati cutter grinder. The design and build of the new grinder is based on a computer <b>aided</b> <b>drill</b> point geometry analysis. In addition to the conical grinding concept, the new grinder is also used to produce spherical point utilizing a computer <b>aided</b> <b>drill</b> point geometry analysis...|$|R
