H. pylori strain VacA s 2 /m 2 positive and CagA negative, from a gastric biopsy of a patient with peptic ulcer disease, was isolated and cultured in brucella agar. Both spiral and coccoid forms were harvested and ruptured by sonication. The cytoplasmic solutions of both forms were collected and their fractions obtained by gel chromatography and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fractions were analyzed by MTT assay for their antiproliferative activity. We isolated two proteins with a significant dose dependent antiproliferative activity that analyzed with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, one of them that was urease positive showed two bands with 61 and 27 kDa, which is resumed to urease of H. pylori, another consist of 57 and 63 kDa.

40|$|Abstract Traumeel® S (Traumeel), {{a mixture}} of highly diluted (10 - 1 - 10 - 9) {{extracts}} from medicinal plants and minerals is widely used in humans to relieve trauma, inflammation and degenerative processes. However, {{little is known about}} its possible effects on the behavior of immune cells. The effects of Traumeel were examined in vitro on the ability of resting and PHA-, PMA- or TNF-α-activated human T cells, monocytes, and gut epithelial cells to secrete the prototypic pro-inflammatory mediators IL- 1 β, TNF-α and IL- 8 over a period of 24 - 72 h. Traumeel inhibited the secretion of all three agents in resting, as well as activated immune cells. IL-β secretion was reduced by up to 70 % in both resting and activated cells; TNF-α secretion was reduced by up to 65 and 54 %, respectively, and IL- 8 secretion was reduced by 50 % in both resting and activated cells (P< 0. 01 for all cells). Interestingly, the effect appeared to be inversely dose-related; maximal inhibition (usually 30 - 60 % inhibition; P< 0. 01) was seen with dilutions of 10 - 3 - 10 - 6 of the Traumeel stock material. This finding suggests that Traumeel does not <b>inhibit</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> functions by exerting a toxic effect. Indeed, Traumeel did not affect T cell and monocyte proliferation. Although additional studies are needed to clarify the mode of action of Traumeel and to demonstrate causative relationship between the inhibition of cytokine/chemokine secretion in cell culture and the reported clinical effects of the preparation, our in vitro results offer a mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of Traumeel observed in clinical use...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{encloses}} {{the interplay}} between {{the immune system and}} tumor <b>cells.</b> The <b>immune</b> system is, next to defending the body against pathogens, specialized in tumor cell recognition and elimination in various ways. NK-cells, NKT-cells, CD 8 + T-cells, and γδ T-cells are important players in tumor surveillance. Tumor cells are distinguished from healthy cells by the expression of tumor-specific antigens (TSA) and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Diverse receptors on the before mentioned <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> recognize these antigens, leading to <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> activation and it provides a license to kill. The main killing mechanisms are the perforin / granzyme pathway, the death-receptor pathways, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Attacking tumor cells is accompanied by the production of cytokines, primarily interferon gamma (IFN-γ). IFN-γ steers into an anti-tumor, Th 1 direction. Tumor surveillance is counteracted by immune evasion performed by tumor cells and cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Tumor cells (and associated cells) developed many possibilities to evade the immune system; they prevent recognition by <b>immune</b> <b>cells,</b> become apoptosis resistant, deceive the <b>immune</b> system, <b>inhibit</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> development, proliferation, and maturation or induce immune tolerance.

Previous studies indicated its various biomedical properties including antioxidant and anti-coagulation potencies. However, {{its effect on}} inflammation, notably within the cardiovascular system, has not been investigated yet. In the present study, we utilized human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) to elucidate the effect of Crocetin on vascular inflammation. Methods: Cell viability and toxicity were evaluated by MTT and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, respectively. Pro-inflammatory chemokine Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) expressions were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. With fluorescence labeled U 937 <b>cells,</b> we examined <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion to the inflamed HUVEC in vitro, which was further confirmed by the H&E staining in the murine subcutaneous endothelium in vivo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Besides its {{anti-inflammatory}} effects, cinnamaldehyde {{has been}} reported to have anti-carcinogenic activity. Here, we investigated its impact on <b>immune</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: Activation of nuclear factor-κB by cinnamaldehyde (0 - 10 µg/ml) alone or in combination with lipopolysaccharide was assessed in THP 1 XBlue human monocytic cell line and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Proliferation and secretion of cytokines (IL 10 and TNFα) was determined in primary <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> and the human cell lines (THP 1, Jurkat E 6 - 1 and Raji cell lines) stimulated with cinnamaldehyde alone or in conjunction with lipopolysaccharide. Nitric oxide was determined in mouse RAW 264. 7 cells. Moreover, different treated PBMCs were stained for CD 3, CD 20 and AnnexinV. RESULTS: Low concentrations (up to 1 µg/ml) of cinnamaldehyde resulted in a slight increase in nuclar factor-kB activation, whereas higher concentrations led to a dose-dependent decrease of nuclear factor-kB activation (up to 50 %) in lipopolysachharide-stimulated THP 1 cells and PBMCs. Accordingly, nitric oxide, interleukin 10 secretion as well as cell proliferation were reduced in lipopolysachharide-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells, PBMCs and THP 1, Raji and Jurkat-E 6 <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of cinnamaldehyde in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis of PBMCs revealed that CD 3 + were more affected than CD 20 + cells to apopotosis by cinnamaldehyde. CONCLUSION: We attribute the anti-inflammatory properties of cinnamaldehyde to its ability to block nuclear factor-κB activation in <b>immune</b> <b>cells.</b> Treatment with cinnamaldehyde led to inhibition of cell viability, proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in primary and immortalized <b>immune</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, despite its described anti-carcinogenic property, treatment with cinnamaldehyde in cancer patients might be contraindicated due to its ability to <b>inhibit</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> activation...|$|R

40|$|Tumor cells {{subvert the}} control of the immune system by {{downregulation}} of their antigenicity and production of an immunosuppressive microenvironment including the upregulation and engagement of inhibitory receptors on <b>immune</b> <b>cells.</b> Therapeutic strategies have demonstrated that the immune system can be reactivated and control established cancers by blocking inhibitory receptors on <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> such CTLA- 4 and PD 1. While such activation of the immune system is successful in some patients, many patients still show cancer progression after some time. Thus, the definition of new targetable immunomodulatory pathways is needed to improve the outcome in those patients. Recent evidence suggests that sialic acid dependent ligands on tumor cells can engage inhibitory sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) on NK cells and cells of the myelomonocytic lineage and thereby facilitate evasion of immune-mediated killing. Moreover, the presence of a natural variant of Siglec- 9 with reduced binding capacity to sialic acid dependent ligands in patients with non-small cell lung cancer improved the two year survival in a retrospective multivariate analysis. Here we identify a novel cancer-associated ligand for immuno-inhibitory Siglecs by affinity chromatography and subsequent proteomic analysis.

In this study we show, for the first time, that the LAIR- 2 gene is broadly transcribed in human PBMC, mirroring the expression profile of LAIR- 1. LAIR- 2 protein is expressed as a soluble receptor exhibiting high affinity for various collagen molecules to which it binds in a hydroxyproline-dependent manner. In vitro stimulation of PBMC induces secretion of LAIR- 2. We detect high amounts of LAIR- 2 in urine of pregnant women, indicating that the soluble receptor is indeed produced in vivo and can be cleared from the body via urine. Furthermore, LAIR- 2 levels are increased in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis as compared with osteoarthritis patients. We hypothesize that soluble LAIR- 2 may function as a natural competitor for LAIR- 1, thereby regulating its inhibitory potential. Indeed, LAIR- 2 prevents binding of human LAIR- 1 to collagens and LAIR- 1 cross-linking in vitro, suggesting that the protein has an immunoregulatory function in vivo.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{immune system}} has to eliminate pathogens, while preventing damage to the host. An adequate function {{of the immune system}} therefore requires the coordinate action of activating and inhibitory signals. Loss of inhibitory signals may lead to chronic inflammation or auto-immune disease. A part of the negative regulation of the immune system is mediated by receptors that contain so-called Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motifs (ITIMs). In the past decade, a large number of ITIM-bearing receptors have been identified on different types of <b>immune</b> <b>cells.</b> However, while studies in mice revealed non-redundant functions in the regulation of the immune system, it is still incompletely understood how these receptors exert their function. The research described in this thesis focuses on the function of Leukocyte-Associated Ig-like Receptor (LAIR) - 1, an inhibitory receptor expressed on most <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> in peripheral blood. In the first part, we show that the expression of LAIR- 1 on one type of <b>immune</b> <b>cells,</b> neutrophils, is regulated during differentiation and activation, suggesting that LAIR- 1 may regulate both neutrophil differentiation and function. In the second part, the mechanisms by which LAIR- 1 <b>inhibits</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> function have been investigated. LAIR- 1 contains two ITIMs that recruit the phosphatases SHP- 1 and SHP- 2 upon phosphorylation of the receptor. These phosphatases are generally believed to mediate the inhibitory function of ITIM-bearing receptors by inactivating key components involved in cellular activation. By separate mutation of the ITIMs of LAIR- 1, we found that they contribute differentially to the recruitment of the phosphatases and to the inhibitory function. We also found that LAIR- 1 was still functional in cells lacking both SHP- 1 and SHP- 2, indicating that LAIR- 1 may recruit additional molecules. By screening for molecules that specifically bound to phosphorylated LAIR- 1, we identified Csk, a known regulator of <b>immune</b> <b>cells,</b> as a third LAIR- 1 interacting protein. Further research is required to investigate the contribution of SHP- 1, SHP- 2 and Csk to the function of LAIR- 1 and other ITIM-bearing receptors.

At high LBP concentrations, the SP-A–mediated cellular inhibition of Re-LPS–induced activation was abrogated. Because LBP-catalyzed binding of LPS to CD 14 is essential for low-dose LPS-induced signaling, we then hypothesized that SP-A <b>inhibits</b> Re-LPS–induced <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> activation via <b>inhibiting</b> the binding of Re-LPS to LBP.

Previously we identified collagens as ligands for the inhibitory leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor- 1 (LAIR- 1), revealing a novel mechanism of peripheral immune regulation by inhibitory immune receptors binding to extracellular matrix collagens. This interaction can be blocked by LAIR- 2, a secreted member of the LAIR- 1 family. LAIR- 1 specifically interacts with synthetic trimeric peptides containing 10 repeats of glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (GPO) residues which can directly <b>inhibit</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> activation in vitro. Here we studied the interaction of human LAIR- 1 and LAIR- 2 with collagen in more detail by using novel overlapping synthetic trimeric peptides (Toolkits) encompassing the entire triple-helical domain of human collagens II and III. LAIR- 1 and LAIR- 2 bind several of these collagen-like peptides, with LAIR- 2 being able to bind more than LAIR- 1. LAIR binding to trimeric collagen peptides was influenced by GPO content of the peptide, although additional non-GPO triplets contributed to the interaction. Furthermore, we identified several trimeric peptides that were potent LAIR- 1 ligands and could efficiently induce inhibition of T cell activation and FceRI-induced degranulation of RBL- 2 H 3 cells through binding to LAIR- 1. A detailed understanding of the LAIR recognition motifs within collagen {{may lead to the}} development of potent reagents {{that can be used in}} in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo functional studies to dissect the biology and function of the collagen/LAIR- 1 interaction...|$|R

Bregs can <b>inhibit</b> other <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> through cytokines secretion and antigen presentation, which give them the role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and cancers. There are no clear criteria to identify Bregs; different markers {{were used in the}} different experimental conditions. Massive researches had described the functions of <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), dendritic cells (DCs), and B cells in the autoimmune disorder diseases and cancers. More and more researches focused on the roles of Bregs and the cytokines such as Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) secreted by Bregs. The aim of this review is to summarize the characteristics of Bregs and the roles of Bregs in cancer...|$|R
40|$|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a multi-functional {{cytokine}} {{produced by}} many tumor cells {{that is known}} to potently <b>inhibit</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> functions. Secretion of TGF-β by malignant cells may therefore be a mechanism by which tumor cells escape destruction by tumor-specific T lymphocytes. If this is the case, prevention of TGF-β production by tumor cells {{could be expected to}} eliminate tumor-derived immunosuppression and enable the development of effective anti-tumor immune responses. To evaluate the role of tumor-derived TGF-β on tumor progression, production of this cytokine was interrupted by introducing a gene encoding antisense TGF-β 1 into the EMT 6 murine mammary tumor cell line using a retroviral vector (LasTGF-β 1 SN). EMT 6 cells transduced with this vector (EMT 6 asTGF-β 1) stably expressed the antisense gene and secreted 48 % less TGF-β than did tumor cells transduced with the backbone vector alone (EMT 6 -Neo). Supernatant fluid recovered from tumor calls expressing the antisense TGF-β 1 gene also exhibited a decreased capacity to suppress alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vitro. Furthermore, tumor growth in mice injected with EMT 6 asTGF-β 1 tumor cells was inhibited compared to mice injected with control EMT 6 -Neo tumor <b>cells.</b> <b>Immune</b> <b>cell</b> involvement in the growth inhibition of the antisense TGF-β transduced tumors was suggested by the ability of EMT 6 asTGF-β tumors to grow unchecked in immunodeficient scid mice and by the finding that immunocompetent mice that rejected antisense TGF-β 1 -expressing tumors developed long term tumor immunity. These results demonstrate that expression of antisense TGF-β 1 by transduced EMT 6 cells decreases their tumorigenicity and that this approach of eliminating immune suppression is a potentially useful strategy to enhance antitumor responses...|$|R
40|$|G protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinase 2 (GRK 2) was initially {{identified as a}} key player, together with β-arrestins, in the regulation of multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Further research has revealed a complex GRK 2 interactome, that includes a variety of proteins related to cell motility, and a role for GRK 2 kinase activity in <b>inhibiting</b> chemokine-induced <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> migration. In addition, we have recently reported that GRK 2 positively regulates integrin and sphingosine- 1 -phosphate-dependent motility in epithelial cell types and fibroblasts, acting as a scaffold molecule. We suggest that {{the positive or negative}} correlation of GRK 2 levels with cell migration would depend on the cell type, specific stimuli acting through plasma membrane receptors, or on the signalling context, leading to differential networks of interaction of GRK 2 with cell migration-related signalosomes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransgenic pigs are {{currently}} the most favored {{potential source of}} organs for xenotransplantation. Like all mammalian species they all harbor endogenous retroviruses in their genome. These porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are produced from several primary cells and cell lines {{and are able to}} infect human cells. Here we demonstrate that different pig strains and different animals of one strain differ in their ability to produce PERVs from normal blood cells. We report that purified PERV particles show a protein pattern typical for type C retroviruses and are antigenically related to mammalian leukemia viruses. Like most retroviruses, purified PERVs and peptides derived from the highly conserved immunosuppressive domain of their transmembrane envelope protein <b>inhibit</b> human <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> functions. This indicates that high titer replication of PERVs in the transplant recipient could therefore lead to an immunodeficiency disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{is unable to}} {{regenerate}} after injury largely due to growth‐inhibition by an inflammatory response to the injury that fails to resolve, resulting in secondary damage and cell death. An approach that prevents inhibition by attenuating the inflammatory response and promoting its resolution through the transition of macrophages to anti‐inflammatory phenotypes {{is essential for the}} creation of a growth permissive microenvironment. Viral gene delivery to induce the expression of anti‐inflammatory factors provides the potential to provide localized delivery to alter the host inflammatory response. Initially, we investigated the effect of the biomaterial and viral components of the delivery system to influence the extent of cell infiltration and the phenotype of these cells. Bridge implantation reduces antigen‐presenting cell infiltration at day 7, and lentivirus addition to the bridge induces a transient increase in neutrophils in the spinal cord at day 7 and macrophages at day 14. Delivery of a lentivirus encoding IL‐ 10, an anti‐inflammatory factor that <b>inhibits</b> <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> activation and polarizes the macrophage population towards anti‐inflammatory phenotypes, reduced neutrophil infiltration at both day 7 and day 28. Though IL‐ 10 lentivirus did not affect macrophages number, it skewed the macrophage population toward an anti‐inflammatory M 2 phenotype and altered macrophage morphology. Additionally, IL‐ 10 delivery resulted in improved motor function, suggesting reduced secondary damage and increased sparing. Taken together, these results indicate that localized expression of anti‐inflammatory factors, such as IL‐ 10, can modulate the inflammatory response following spinal cord injury, and may be a key component of a combinatorial approach that targets the multiple barriers to regeneration and functional recovery...|$|R

The management of AMD is constrained by our insufficient knowledge of its underlying mechanisms. Recent studies point towards an emerging involvement of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a soluble cytokine associated with innate and adaptive immunity. IFN-γ promotes proinflammatory responses by activating proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby recruiting <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> such as macrophages and T cells. On the other hand, IFN-γ modulates inflammatory response by upregulating anti-inflammatory factors or <b>inhibiting</b> development of <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> related to autoimmune response.
