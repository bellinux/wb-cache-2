50|$|Due {{to modern}} {{selective}} breeding, laying hen strains {{are different from}} those of meat production strains. Male birds of the laying strains do not lay eggs and are unsuitable for meat production, therefore, they are culled soon after being sexed, often on the day of hatching. Methods of culling include cervical dislocation, asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and maceration using a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chick culling is {{the process}} of killing newly hatched poultry for which the {{industry}} has no use. It occurs in all industrialised egg production whether free range, organic, or battery cage - including that of the UK and US. Because male chickens do not lay eggs and only those on breeding programmes are required to fertilise eggs, they are considered redundant to the egg-laying industries and are usually killed soon after they hatch and shortly after being sexed. Many methods of culling do not involve anaesthetic and include cervical dislocation, asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and maceration using a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder.</b>|$|E

This {{study was}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling and numerical investigation about the dynamic and static stiffness of coupled double-rotor spindle system of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder.</b> The moment balance and the transition matrix, the state vector, field matrix of spindle system of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder</b> were analyzed and deduced. The theoretical models about dynamic and static stiffness were established using the transfer matrix method. The numerical results showed that increased rigidity of front bearing significantly increased static and dynamic rigidity of spindle end and the rigidity of front bearing increased, dynamic rigidity increased more significantly than static rigidity. Furthermore, it can be conclued that increased overhang length reduced dynamic and static rigidity of spindle end at an increasingly slower rate and the span of bearing increased, static and dynamic rigidities of spindle end were reduced...|$|E

This allowed {{the production of}} flapwheels for use with <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> angle <b>grinders.</b> These disks were different in format: flatter, like the original rigid angle grinder disks, and with the flaps arranged in a densely overlapped layout rather than radial. The extra lifetime this gave to the disk allowed their use for stock removal and metal shaping, not just finishing and polishing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{components}} of the FBE formulation are weighed and pre-blended in <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> mixers. The mix is then transferred to a high-shear extruder. FBE extruders incorporate a single or dual screw setup, rotating within a fixed clamshell barrel. A temperature range from 50 °C to 100 °C is used within the extruder barrel. This setup compresses the FBE blend, while heating and melting it to a semi-liquid form. During this process, the ingredients of the molten mix are dispersed thoroughly. Because of the fast operation of the extruder and relatively low temperature within the barrel, the epoxy and hardener components will not undergo a significant chemical reaction. The molten extrudate then passes between cold-rollers and becomes a solid, brittle sheet. It then moves to a “Kibbler”, which chops it into smaller chips. These chips are ground, using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinders</b> (classifiers) to a particle size of less than 150 micrometers (standard specifications requires 100% pass through in 250 micrometer sieves and maximum 3% retains in 150 micrometer sieve). The final product is packaged in closed containers, with particular care given to avoid moisture contamination. Normal storage temperatures of FBE powder coatings are below [...] in air-conditioned warehouses.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRoasted peanuts of China and India origin were {{ground in}} a {{commercial}} ultra-high <b>speed</b> <b>grinder</b> operated at 20, 000 rpm for 2. 0 – 5. 0 min for natural peanut butter production. Grinding characteristics of both peanuts were evaluated in terms of specific energy consumption, Esc with respect to its grinding time and mean particle size. The Esc increased with grinding time with China peanuts having higher Esc than India peanuts. The specific energy consumption modeled to the size reduction ratio of China and India peanuts was predicted more accurately using a linear and exponential model respectively compared to the classical models by Bond, Rittinger and Kick. From the comparison of Bond’s working index, Wi, the ultra-high <b>speed</b> <b>grinder</b> {{is said to be}} more energy efficient than other comminutors in terms of its capability to produce finer particle size in shorter time than the rest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling and numerical simulation about the unbalanced response for coupled double-rotor spindle system of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder.</b> Based on the rotor dynamics, a theoretical model was established using the transfer matrix method. The moment balance equations, and the transition matrix, the state vector, field matrix of coupled double-rotor spindle system of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder</b> were analyzed and calculated. The numerical results showed that the amplitude of unbalance response increased by the same multiple as that of the amount of unbalance at different locations and at different speeds. Furthermore, the position most sensitive to the unbalance was the front end of rotor 2, followed by the middle and back end of rotor 2. Rotor 2 was especially sensitive to unbalance. Moreover, the vibration amplitudes of the front end, front and back bearings of rotor 1 increased in response to unbalanced increase of rotate speed. The vibration amplitude abruptly increased at 17500 r/min corresponding to first-order critical speed...|$|E

50|$|Blade {{grinders}} also resemble industrial blade (propeller) mixers, which like meat grinders rotate at {{much slower}} <b>speeds.</b> Unlike blade <b>grinders,</b> these mixers do not alter (break, cut, shred, macerate, pulverize) the material being mixed. The <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> of rotation of blade grinders {{is necessary to}} achieve their cutting action. In a blender application, the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> of rotation contributes to shearing, which in turn contributes to aeration {{and the formation of}} emulsions. These are desirable qualities in many food preparations. A blade grinder can run on batteries or more commonly on electricity.|$|R

Scratching modes on a surface of glass ground with a single point diamond were observed in detail by scanning tunnel microscopy. It was found from the experiments that the grinding mode depends exceedingly upon the circulating speed of the disc. The depth of cut observed with STM was about 20 - 30 % smaller than calculated one. Grinding mode changes due to the shape of stylus tip and the cut of depth is influenced by crossing of the scratches...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for environmentally friendly materials has {{ushered in a}} new generation of bio plastics and plant fibre based composite materials. The quality of the raw components is very important when manufacturing a bio based material. For example, many plant fibres are hygroscopic, which means that moisture becomes an important quality determining factor. Therefore, a better understanding and knowledge of moisture adsorption equilibrium is of importance. The moisture adsorption equilibrium of several different plant fibres is examined in paper I. Differences in moisture adsorption equilibrium was found between unretted and retted hemp fibres, while differences between varieties were small. An example of a renewable composite material, investigated in this thesis, is a wheat gluten plastic reinforced with hemp fibres. Paper II shows the effect of hemp fibre reinforcement on the mechanical properties of a wheat gluten based plastic film. Different fibre contents and fibre quality levels were tested. It was found that the fibres did improve the mechanical properties of the plastic and that fibre content was {{the most important factor in}} creating a stronger material. However, there were problems encountered with regards to fibre distribution in the material, poor adhesion between the fibres and plastic and a large variation in the material properties. In paper III, we attempted to improve the fibre distribution by using a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>grinder</b> to mix the fibres and the plastic. Further a diamine was used as a cross linker between the fibres and the plastic to improve the bonding. It was found that the grinder did improve the fibre distribution but not sufficiently to avoid clusters of fibres. The diamine did not improve the interaction between the fibres and the plastic but it did strengthen the plastic itself to a certain degree. It is concluded that hemp fibres can be used to improve the mechanical properties of wheat gluten plastics. However, the fibre distribution and interaction with the plastic needs to be much improved. A possible solution for the fibre distribution problem might be to decrease the viscosity if the wheat gluten dough while the fibre-plastic interaction might be improved by selecting a different cross linking substance...|$|E
