40|$|Concern about {{reliability}} of elastomeric bearings is increasing {{along with the}} rapid development in application of such devices. Studies on experimental and in-service bearings have revealed the occurrence of permanent and transient changes in engineering properties of these devices. This property loss, however, varies in quality and magnitude, depending on service or environmental conditions at which bearings are employed. Knowledge about {{the magnitude of the}} lost property and the rate of degradation is critical for the safe performance of the isolated structure. Availability of such measures helps avoid unnecessary cost and service interruptions of bridge structures by optimizing monitoring and maintenance activities. It is necessary to identify the service and environmental conditions contributing in such degradation phenomenon.
