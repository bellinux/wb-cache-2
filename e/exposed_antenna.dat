5000|$|Titan was {{originally}} planned for a 1 X 10 (one control center with 10 launchers) [...] "soft" [...] site.

The Titan I was first American ICBM based in underground silos, and it gave USAF managers, contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival. The complexes were composed of an Entry Portal, Control Center, Powerhouse, Terminal Room, two Antenna Silos for the ATHENA guidance radar antennas, and three launchers each composed of: three Equipment Terminals, three Propellant Terminals, and three missile Silos. All connected by an extensive network of Tunnels. Both Antenna Terminals and all three Launchers were isolated with double door Blast Locks to ensure that if there was an explosion or the site was under attack, that only the <b>exposed</b> <b>antenna</b> and/or missile silo would be damaged.|$|E

A wireless sensor on a high-voltage line has the potential to form corona discharges, particularly on an <b>exposed</b> <b>antenna.</b> The effects of corona formation on the antenna of a wireless radio frequency (RF) communication system were studied. The physics of corona plasma formation and charge composition was analyzed, leading to a theoretical understanding of corona interaction with the antenna. Through a series of high-voltage experiments, the effects of corona on the impedance and gain of an antenna, as well as the RF interference generated by corona current pulses, were identified. RF interference and low-frequency corona current were observed to have the largest impact on a wireless RF system. Corona was found to have no significant impact on the impedance or gain of an antenna.

40|$|Poster) In {{the context}} of the {{concerns}} and fears over mobile telephony and health, various research programmes have been launched worldwide. Several of our research projects deal with molecular biology that uses techniques investigating biological effects at the DNA, protein and cellular level. Among them are cytogenetics, gene and protein expressions that can be related to cancer and can be studied using in vivo models. DNA damage and Hsp 70 expression in the brain of rats have been investigated after exposure to the GSM- 900 signal used for mobile telephony. The head of the rats was only exposed using an antenna operating at 900 MHz. After a one-week training period, rats were <b>exposed</b> (<b>antenna</b> ON) or sham-exposed (antenna OFF) to GSM- 900 in individual rockets. Free moving rats were used as cage-controls. (i) The DNA damage caused by GSM- 900 microwaves in brain cells at different SAR was assessed using the alkaline comet assay method. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups: cage control (n= 5), positive control (n= 8) (25 mg/kg of ethylmethane sulfonate, i. p.), sham-exposed (n= 8) and exposed animals (n= 8) to 1, 5; 3 or 6 W/kg local SAR for 2 hours and killed by decapitation immediately after exposure. A tissue press was used to obtain a single cell suspension from the whole brain. No consistent difference in the amount of damaged cells could be observed whatever the SAR used. (ii) The expression of Hsp 70 after a one-hour exposure to GSM- 900 signal was assessed in male Wistar rats. The animals were divided in four groups: positive controls (kainic acid injected) (n= 2), cage-controls (n= 4), sham-exposed (n= 5) and GSM- 900 (2 W/kg) exposed rats (n= 5). Immediately after exposure, brains were perfused with paraformaldehyde solution (4 % in PBS) by intracardiac pathway and frozen. Brains are currently under analysis for Hsp 70 expression by immunohistochemistry. The results will be presented at the meeting...|$|E

The present work aimed at investigating heat shock proteins (HSP) expression - as a cellular stress marker - in the skin of Hairless rats exposed to GSM- 900 and - 1800 signals. Materials and methods: We studied {{the expression of the}} Heat-shock cognate (Hsc) 70, and the inducible forms of the Heatshock proteins (Hsp) 25 and 70.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{electromagnetic}} characterization of composite materials reinforced with carbon and metallic nanoparticles is presented. In particular, the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability {{as a function}} of the frequency are used to evaluate the electromagnetic absorption capability of the nanocomposites. The aim is the study of possible applications in advanced coating able to tune the electromagnetic reflectivity of satellite surfaces in specific frequency ranges, in a special way for those surfaces that for some reason could be <b>exposed</b> to the <b>antenna</b> radiation pattern. In fact, the interference caused by the spurious electromagnetic multipath due to good electric conductive satellite surface components could in turn affect the main radiation lobe of TLC and Telemetry antennas, thus modifying its main propagation directions and finally increasing the microwave channel pathloss. The work reports the analysis of different nanostructured materials in the 2 – 10 GHz frequency range. The employed nanopowders are of carbon nanotubes, cobalt, argent, titanium, nickel, zinc, copper, iron, boron, bismuth, hafnium, in different weight percentages versus the hosting polymeric matrix.

The possibility to design multi-layered structures optimized to provide specific microwave response is finally analyzed by the aid of swam intelligence algorithm.

40|$|Electric field {{measurements}} are {{fundamental to the}} study of thunderstorm electrification, thundercloud charge structure, and the determination of the locations and magnitudes of charges deposited by lightning. Continuous field observations {{can also be used to}} warn of impending electrical hazards. For example, the USAF Eastern Range (ER) and NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida currently operate a ground-based network of electric field mill sensors to warn against lightning hazards to space vehicle operations/launches. The sensors provide continuous recordings of the ambient field. Others investigators have employed flat-plate electric field antennas to detect changes In the ambient field due to lightning. In each approach, electronic circuitry is used to directly detect and amplify the effects of the ambient field on an <b>exposed</b> metal conductor (<b>antenna</b> plate); in the case of continuous field recordings, the antenna plate is alternately shielded and unshielded by a grounded conductor. In this work effort, an alternate optical method for detecting lightning-caused electric field changes is Introduced. The primary component in the detector is an anisotropic electro-optic crystal of potassium di-hydrogen phosphate (chemically written as KH 2 PO 4 (KDP)). When a voltage Is placed across the electro-optic crystal, the refractive Indices of the crystal change. This change alters the polarization state of a laser light beam that is passed down the crystal optic axis. With suitable application of vertical and horizontal polarizers, a light transmission measurement is related to the applied crystal voltage (which in turn Is related to the lightning caused electric field change). During the past two years, all critical optical components were procured, assembled, and aligned. An optical housing, calibration set-up, and data acquisition system was integrated for breadboard testing. The sensor was deployed at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in the summer of 1998 to collect storm data. Because solid-state technology is used, future designs of the sensor will be significantly scaled down In physical dimension and weight compared to the present optical breadboard prototype. The use of fiber optics would also provide significant practical improvements...|$|R
40|$|Copepods create feeding {{currents}} {{to entrain}} water over their sensory receptors and through their feeding appendages. The flow field also creates a hydrodynamic disturbance {{which may be}} detected by the animal's potential prey and predators. A method is described for the 3 -dimensional analysis of the flow field of feeding copepods. The equipment used is a laser-illuminated flow visualization system and video recordings made from 2 perpendicularly mounted cameras which permitted {{the determination of the}} X, Y and Z coordinates of individual particles and their trajectories. Flow within narrow volumes of water are used to minimize the error in flow rate estimates associated with analysying flow within a large unspecified volume of water compressed into a 2 -dimensional plane. Three planar views are combined to create a 3 -dimensional model describing the shape and magnitude of the flow field of Pleuromamma xiphias. A maximum velocity of 38. 00 mm⋅s- 1 occurred {{at the base of the}} downward swing of 2 nd antennae just lateral to the sides of the body. We found lateral symmetry in the flow field with water velocity decreasing exponentially from the head to the distal tips of the <b>antennae</b> <b>exposing</b> different parts of the sensor to different flow regimes. Asymmetry in the flow field was found between the dorsal and ventral side of the animal with the 1. 00 mm⋅s- 1 velocity isoline approximately 1. 5 times further from the body ventrally than dorsally. The asymmetry between the dorsal and ventral flow is predominantly within the region of low flow, therefore there is relatively little difference in the amount of water entrained from each side. However, because the escape responses of mechanoreceptive prey may be elicited by steep velocity gradients, the asymmetry may allow prey to be entrained closer ventral than dorsal to the animal. The hydrodynamic disturbance defined by the 1. 00 mm⋅s- 1 velocity isoline was detected as far as 4. 10 mm above the head, 4. 60 mm lateral, 5. 60 mm ventral and 3. 60 mm dorsal to the animal. The lower extent of the 1. 00 mm⋅s- 1 isoline was not detected however the lower portion of the 7. 00 mm⋅s- 1 isoline was found 7. 50 mm directly below the head. Using the above dimensions and a spheroid model, the volume of the hydrodynamic disturbance created by the animal (approximately 4 ml) is greater than 175 times the actual volume of the physical body of the animal. This created signal may reveal the identity and location of Pleuromamma xiphias to its predators...|$|R
40|$|Insects under {{different}} stimuli {{from the environment}} modify behavioural responses due {{to changes in the}} sensitivity of neurons at the peripheral and/or at the central level of the nervous system. This phenomenon is called neuronal plasticity, and sensory adaptation is an example of it. An insect repellent is a chemical that produces oriented movements of the insects away from its source. In this work we studied the modulation of the behavioural and electrical response to the repellent N, N-diethyl- 3 -methylbenzamide (DEET) in males of the German cockroach B. germanica produced by previous exposure to the same repellent. Methods. We determined repellency using a circular arena, one half of which was treated with DEET. The time spent by insects in each half of the arena was measured, and a repellency coefficient (RC) was calculated. The RCs of pre-exposed and non-pre-exposed insects were compared. To determine a possible role of nitric oxide in the modulation of the response to DEET after pre-exposure, the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-acetyl-cysteine (SNAC) was applied on cockroaches’ antennae. The electrical activity of the cockroaches’ antennae in response to DEET was recorded using electroantennogram (EAG) technique. The response to DEET was recorded also after a long stimulation with the same repellent, and after topical application of SNAC and dbcGMP (a cGMP analogue) on the antennae. Results. We found that previous exposure of B. germanica males to the repellent DEET produced an increase of the repellency at the behavioural level, measured as RC. A possible role of nitric oxide (NO) in the transduction pathway of this phenomenon is suggested, since treatment of the cockroaches with the NO donor SNAC also produced an increase of the repellency elicited by DEET. On the other hand, the response of the cockroaches’ <b>antennae</b> <b>exposed</b> to DEET was determined electrophysiologically. The electrical activity in response to DEET decreased when the insects’ antennae were stimulated with a long pulse of the repellent. The activity of the antennae was restored after 10 min. Treatment of the antennae either with SNAC or dbGMPc also produced a decrease in the response of the antennae to the repellent. Discussion. The previous exposure to a chemical stimulus can modify the behaviour associated to the same stimulus, increasing or decreasing the behavioural response. In the case of DEET we found that pre-exposure increased DEET repellency in male cockroaches. We also found NO involvement in a similar phenomenon. On the other hand, the test showed that DEET is perceived by insects’ antennae as an odour. A long exposure of the antennae to DEET caused a transient decrease in the response of the antennae to the same compound. The same effect was achieved by treating the antennae with SNAC or dbcGMP, suggesting the involvement of the NO/cGMP system in the transduction pathway of the sensory adaptation phenomenon elicited by an odour in this species...|$|R
