University of Missouri 1911 Among the {{principal}} characters that crowd the busy stage of Plautus, none are more {{vital to the}} action than the old gentlemen. But while the women of Plautus have received lengthy treatment {{at the hands of}} Le Benoist in "de personis muliebribus apudd Plautum," yet the senex type, save for brief attention given it in Ribbeck's "Geschichte der Romischen Dichtung" and Schanz, "Romische Litteraturgeschichte," has received little detailed discussion. The senex is the most common of the stock characters which we learn to expect in the old Roman comedies; and although Plautus lived over twenty-one hundred years ago, <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> are wonderfully interesting to us. The more we look at them, the more we are impressed with their modernity. (<b>His</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> have much in common with all men the world over; and while they are influenced to some degree by Roman and Greek conventionalities and standards of morals, yet we feel a sympathetic familiarity with them because they are real people.

She really was trembling very much; her wrap had slipped off her head. [...] "Poor devil!" [...] he thought. [...] "Never mind about that chap. I daresay he'll change his mind before to-morrow.

6000|$|I have {{described}} what image--always opposite {{to the natural}} self or the natural world--Wilde, Henley, Morris copied or tried to copy, but I have not said if I found an image for myself. I {{know very little about}} myself and much less of that anti-self: probably the woman who cooks my dinner or the woman who sweeps out my study knows more than I. It is perhaps because nature made me a gregarious man, going hither and thither looking for conversation, and ready to deny from fear or favour his dearest conviction, that I love proud and lonely images. When I was a child and went daily to the sexton's daughter for writing lessons, I found one poem in her School Reader that delighted me beyond all others: a fragment of some metrical translation from Aristophanes wherein the birds sing scorn upon mankind. In later years my mind gave itself to gregarious Shelley's dream of a young man, his hair blanched with sorrow studying philosophy in some lonely tower, or of <b>his</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> master of all human knowledge, hidden from human sight in some shell-strewn cavern on the Mediterranean shore.
