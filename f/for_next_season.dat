25|$|After a year hiatus, the Greys {{returned}} with a short bench and started the rebuilding process. Not much hope of a competitive season was ever tossed Owen Sound's way. But what makes the return a success isn't the season record—it {{was the lack of}} a mass exodus of players at the Christmas Break. Players bought into the rebuilding process and stuck it out which earned a tremendous amount of respect from around the league and left the Greys in a good position with a solid nucleus to build on <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 26 August 2014, {{he joined}} Premier League club Hull City on a three-year {{contract}} for an undisclosed fee understood to be £3.5million. He made his debut on 31 August 2014 at Villa Park in a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. During {{the course of the}} 2014–15 season, Dawson established himself in the team and was even selected captain on 17 occasions. With five matches left to go in the Premier League season, Hull played Liverpool, in which Dawson scored his first goal for the club and the only goal in the match, earning a vital three points in their fight against relegation. However, this was not enough as Hull went on to lose their next three matches and in their final match against Manchester United they only drew 0–0, sending Dawson and Hull to the Championship <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 21 May 2015, Xavi {{announced}} that he would join Qatari club Al Sadd {{at the end of the}} 2014–15 season on a three-year contract. According to his agent, the deal would involve him becoming an ambassador for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in the country, and also start his coaching qualifications. He made his debut for Al-Sadd in a 4–0 win over Mesaimeer on 13 September 2015, assisting in the team's first goal. In the following match, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw with Umm Salal. Al Sadd ended the league campaign in third position putting them in a place <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season</b> AFC Champions League. Xavi scored three goals during the season. In the Champions League, Al Sadd were knocked out from the qualifying rounds by Emirati side Al Jazira on penalties; Xavi missed his spot kick.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} less consistent, although he qualified for all tournaments except the Malta Cup, {{and his best}} result was a quarter-final loss to Ding Junhui at the China Open. He finished the season ranked 25, falling seven places. The 2005/2006 season did not look better either, a series of first round defeats saw him provisionally {{drop out of the}} top 32. However, he had a good run at the 2006 World Championship, beating three seeded players – Alan McManus 10–3, Stephen Maguire 13–4, and Ken Doherty 13–10 – to reach the semi-finals, where he lost to world no.7 and 2002 World Champion Peter Ebdon 16–17. In that match, Fu was 9–15 down with only one session left to play, but won seven out of the next eight frames to send the match into the deciding frame, which Ebdon eventually won. Fu's success in this tournament can be largely attributed to working with coach Terry Griffiths. Fu had used Griffiths for a short while some years ago – but did not commit to the necessary changes in technique. This run enable him to stay in the world top 32 <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season,</b> ranked 22.|$|E

25|$|The Phillies were 36-45 and 11 {{games behind}} {{the first place}} Nationals after their series against the Marlins. The Phillies started the month by taking 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. The one win, however, came with Cliff Lee finally winning his {{first game of the}} season after 13 starts. The streak tied for 5th for the longest winless streak for a pitcher. The Phillies would end the first half by getting swept by the Atlanta Braves. They ended the first half with a {{disastrous}} 37–50 mark, their worst since 1997. The Phillies seemed to have woken up in the second half, as they would take 2 of 3 from the Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles Dodgers. Although they only took 1 of 3 from the San Francisco Giants, they would make it up by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers, all from late comebacks. The sweep was their first 3-game sweep of the year. The sweep, however, got taken back by the Braves as they would get swept by them again because they had a hard time with runners in scoring position. The sweep woke up the Phillies, as they would blow out the Washington Nationals in the 1st game of the series on July 31, 8–0. The Phillies would end up taking 2 of 3 from the Nationals. After the series against the Nationals on August 2, the Phillies were 47–58, 15 and a half games behind the first place Nationals, and 13 game behind the second wild card. Although their playoff chances are slim, the Phillies performance after the all-star break looked promising <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season.</b> Throughout the month, knowing that they will likely not make the post-season, the Phillies made trades with some of their players. One of the trades were Hunter Pence getting traded to the Giants for Nate Schierholtz, Tommy Joseph, and Seth Rosin. Another trade was Shane Victorino getting trading to the Dodgers for 2 pitchers. Pitcher Joe Blanton also got involved in a trade with the Dodgers. The Phillies would also resign Cole Hamels to a six-year, $144 million extension, the second-largest contract for a pitcher in baseball history.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–", {{arguing that it}} was an example of the series' {{continued}} growth: he wrote, [...] "as Finn grows, so does this series". Sava opined that, [...] "the final minute of “Billy’s Bucket List” drops a major plot-bomb that gives the series an exciting direction <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season,</b> and while the events leading up to the cliffhanger aren't quite as provocative or substantial as the last few episodes, they represent all the things that make this show such a great 10-minute oasis {{at the beginning of the}} week."

Fickett opined however that the episode was at its weakest during the Dwight's take-over scenes in Scranton, as he knew Michael would be returning. He concluded his review on a more positive note by commenting that Ryan's selection [...] "makes for some interesting scenarios <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season.</b> All in all this was a funny episode that wrapped up some key story lines while still leaving open some questions to be answered next season. It wasn't a home run finale, but it certainly has us eagerly await the fall premiere." [...] AOL TV contributor Jay Black highlighted scenes he found humorous, including Dwight's preferred choice of an assistant and Michael's reaction to Jan's implants. He gave the episode [...] "7 Shrute Bucks out of 7." [...] Various cast members were also lauded for their performances, including Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Melora Hardin.|$|E

The Senators faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Quarter-final and lost the series 4–0. The result led to speculation in the media that Ray Emery's contract would be bought out and free agents Mike Commodore, Martin Lapointe, Wade Redden, Luke Richardson and Cory Stillman would not return for the 2008–09 season. GM Bryan Murray was given a public endorsement by Owner Eugene Melnyk and was expected to return <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season.</b> On April 18, Murray confirmed to the media in an end-of-season press conference that Emery would not return: [...] "My plan is not to have him back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{stated that}} the fourth season risked {{predictability}} by returning to a successful formula of storytelling, but he nonetheless preferred those episodes to those of season three. Maureen Ryan reviewed the fourth season positively. She praised the addition of Lincoln Potter (played by Ray McKinnon), comparing the character's quality to that of Breaking Bads antagonist, Gustavo Fring. The A.V. Club called the fourth season more [...] "focused" [...] and [...] "operatic". A.V. Club reviewer Zack Handlen was fond of the season but felt disappointed with the finale, saying it featured a [...] "lousy case of dictated convenience, of an arbitrary and unbelievable reveal used to shift characters around to where the writers {{want them to be}} <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>season,</b> as opposed to where they might land organically." [...] However, the review did praise Charlie Hunnam's performance in the finale. TIME said the fourth season was the strongest since season two, but the show needed to end sooner rather than later.
