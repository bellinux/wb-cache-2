5|$|Yet despite {{significant}} reorganisations of the post-Federation Army in 1903 and 1906, the force-in-being {{was increasingly}} seen as dysfunctional and inadequate, suffering from perceived <b>institutional</b> <b>problems</b> regarding structure, command, and administration, {{as well as}} limited financial resources, lack of modern equipment, and poor training. In time this led the government to decide to adopt an entirely new military system. In 1911, two significant changes followed a report by Lord Kitchener following his inspection of local forces in 1909. The Royal Military College, Duntroon was established to train staff officers, and a system of universal national service began with boys aged 12 to 18 becoming cadets, and men aged 18 to 26 serving in the Citizen Forces. These reforms {{were part of a}} process of raising a large civilian militia to defend the country against a feared attack by Japan. This force was based on conscription, and was intended to be complete in 1920. The resources devoted to this plan greatly exceeded those allocated to preparations to raise an expeditionary force to serve outside Australia. In total, a peace-time force of around 80,000 citizen soldiers, with a war-time establishment of 135,000, was to be raised and would include 84 infantry battalions (later increased to 92), 28 light horse regiments (subsequently raised to 31), 49 field batteries and seven howitzer batteries (total of 224 guns), 14 field engineer companies, seven communication companies, and various support troops.|$|E

40|$|Background: The main aim of China’s Health Care System Reform was to {{help the}} {{decision}} maker find the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection. A pilot health care provider research system was recently organized in China’s health care system, and it could efficiently collect the data for determining the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from various experts, then {{the purpose of this}} study was to apply the optimal implementation methodology to help the decision maker effectively promote various experts’ views into various optimal solutions to this problem under the support of this pilot system. Methods: After the general framework of China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection was established, this study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics of China to commission a large-scale 2009 to 2010 national expert survey (n = 3, 914) through the organization of a pilot health care provider research system for the first time in China, and the analytic network process (ANP) implementation methodology was adopted to analyze the dataset from this survey. Results: The market-oriented health care provider approach was the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from the doctors’ point of view; the traditional government’s regulation-oriented health care provider approach was the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from the pharmacists’ point of view, the hospital administrators’ point of view, and the point of view of health officials in health administration departments; the public private partnership (PPP) approach was the optimal solution to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection from the nurses’ point of view, the point of view of officials in medical insurance agencies, and the health care researchers’ point of view. Conclusions: The data collected through a pilot health care provider research system in the 2009 to 2010 national expert survey could help the decision maker effectively promote various experts’ views into various optimal solutions to China’s <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> of health care provider selection...|$|R

25|$|The Sanbō Kyōdan {{was also}} {{influential}} in introducing charismatic authority in Western Zen, by its dependency on {{the authority of}} Yasutani, while simultaneously standing outside the mainstream of Japanese Zen. It was transplanted into a culture that is unaware of the specific characteristics of Japanese culture regarding authority. The stress on kenshō as means of authority, coupled to the primacy of maintaining the correct dharma transmission, led to <b>institutional</b> <b>problems</b> when Yasutani's heir Yamada Koun died, {{in the view of}} some disaffected former members. Shortly before his death in 1989 Yamada Koun passed on the leadership of the Sanbo Kyodan directly to Kubota Jiun Roshi, who was its abbot until 2004, whereupon the abbacy passed to Yamada Ryoun Roshi. While a handful of Western teachers authorized by Sanbo-Zen left the organization, some 40 or so remain within it, and the institution itself has evolved and shows signs of growing strength and resilience. The direct lineage of the “Three Clouds” (Harada, Yasutani and Yamada) maintains a strong core and trunk in today's Sanbo-Zen. Seeing one's nature gives an autonomous confirmation of Zen's ultimate truth, which may conflict with the need to maintain institutions and traditions. On the other hand, it may foster a renewal and revitalization of the core of Zen teaching, and allow for styles of Zen practice to emerge that are more relevant to non-Japanese contexts.|$|E

30|$|The third abductive {{learning}} routine cycles {{back to the}} imagined configurations by refining or reframing the hypothesized interdependencies that are involved. Participants in the strategic or <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving cycles critically examine assumptions, deliberate over different perspectives, and bridge possible differences into new shared directions (Ansell 2011). Inquiry {{is based on the}} clash of different perspectives and communication for probing, adjudicating, and bridging these differences. Different people see different aspects of the product possibility and how it might function in the application setting. Iteratively integrating helps to overcome competency traps, push ideas, cross check possibilities, and generate a joint representation. Managers might refine and replace milestones, and develop new performance objectives that reflect new alternatives and consequences learned from evaluation (Grandori 2010). By reframing, managers holistically assess what they know so far and what they have learned. Reframing cycles back with a new hypothesis for the configuration of interdependencies, to be evaluated and reframed again.|$|R
30|$|As Dougherty (2016) details, cycling {{through the}} abductive {{learning}} routines for <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving begins with imagining a configuration of interdependencies among relational elements and rules {{that can produce}} the specific kind of collaboration needed to address a certain problem. For example, if the problem is developing improved models for the early evaluation of drug possibilities, participants would include large firms, research hospitals, regulators, and small firms. Leaders need to be appointed, perhaps a coalition with clear rules for IP, participation, and task forces to oversee particular processes. Evaluating digs into the hypothesized interdependencies to examine assumptions {{and figure out what}} works and not, and why and how. Over time, experiments generate insights into how to develop and deploy metrics about how well the collaboration is doing, update and revise the problem, arrive at joint decisions and agreements, and foster ongoing participation. Some collaborative commons will be relatively short-lived, while others may continue for years.|$|R

30|$|This essay {{argues that}} unless the {{strategic}} and <b>institutional</b> <b>problem</b> setting and solving cycles unfold productively and interactively with the project and process cycles, innovation cannot occur. The reason: the innovative problems and solutions unfold over many years, eco-system participants cannot muster the staying power to persist and learn for innovation over many, many years without strategies. Strategies for innovation integrate learning, direct activities, and shape ongoing knowledge co-evolution. Strategizing in complex innovation eco-systems requires a portfolio of future possibilities that maps out in various time periods potential value creating opportunities, because the knowledge needed for innovation emerges unpredictably and over a very long time. Imagine looking out 15 – 20  years and seeing a variety of possible value creating opportunities emerging, depending on various anticipated learning events. The imagined portfolio represents the competitive or strategic landscape out in time. Different firms and agencies would imagine the overall portfolio of possible opportunities out in time, but from their own perspective. The portfolio affords a deeper look in time because various possibilities work as stepping stones into the future.|$|R
