60|$|In {{the center}} of the circle were {{assembled}} hundreds of grasshoppers, of all sizes. The small ones were of a <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> color, and the middle-sized ones of a deeper green, while the biggest ones were a yellowish brown.|$|R
60|$|In {{the centre}} of one chamber, fed by a {{perpetual}} fountain, was a large alabaster basin, the edges of which were strewn with flowers just culled. The chamber was entirely of porcelain; a golden flower on a ground of <b>delicate</b> <b>green.</b>|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} {{it was the end of}} April; the season {{happened}} to be an early one, and our garden was gay with spring flowers, with which we had stocked it from a nursery close by, and the lime-trees in front were just putting out their <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> leaves.|$|R
60|$|Having no {{ornaments}} fine {{enough for}} this important occasion, Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white shoulders in <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> vines. Remembering the painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and chassed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.|$|R

It differs from the first of those species in a smaller and less contrasting white rump patch, while the solitary sandpiper has no white rump patch at all.|$|R
60|$|October 17th.--Some of {{the oaks}} {{are now a}} deep brown red; others are changed to a light green, which, at a little distance, {{especially}} in the sunshine, looks like the green of early spring. In some trees, different masses of the foliage show each of these hues. Some of the walnut-trees have a yet more <b>delicate</b> <b>green.</b> Others are of a bright sunny yellow.|$|R

60|$|It {{was then}} close on half-past seven. The final {{glory of the}} setting sun had yielded to the magic wand of night which had changed the vivid crimson and orange first to <b>delicate</b> <b>greens</b> and mauves and then to the deep, the {{gorgeous}} blue of a summer's evening sky. The stars one by one gleamed in the firmament, and soon the crescent moon, chaste and cold, added her incomparable glory to the beauty and the silent peace of the night.|$|R
5000|$|The name Chapeltown is {{in origin}} a reduced form, first attested in 1427, of Chapel Allerton, and once denoted the same place. Thus Ralph Thoresby, writing in 1715, records Chapel-Town {{as a common}} name for the {{township}} of Chapel Allerton, describing it as [...] "well situated in pure Air, upon a pleasant Ascent, which affords a Prospect of the Country ten or twelve miles". The open space to its east and north of Potter-Newton was [...] "a <b>delicate</b> <b>Green</b> commonly call'd Chapel-Town Moor"." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{snatched}} nervously at {{the long}} glass and directed it at the dark stockade. The sun had sunk behind the forests leaving the contour of the tree-tops outlined by a thread of gold under a band of <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> lying across the lower sky. Higher up a faint crimson glow faded into the darkened blue overhead. The shades of the evening deepened over the lagoon, clung {{to the sides of}} the Emma and to the forms of the further shore. Lingard laid the glass down.|$|R
60|$|A small, shaded lamp stood {{upon the}} table they had {{gathered}} round, {{and the light}} sparkled on <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> glasses and a carafe of wine. It touched the men's white clothes, and then, cut off by the shade, left their faces in shadow and fell upon the tiles. A colored paper lantern, however, hung from a wire near an outside staircase and Jake saw Clare a short distance away. It {{looked as if she}} had stopped in crossing the patio, but as he came forward Kenwardine got up.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{thought she}} had never seen a prettier chamber, {{although}} she had always been daintily cared for by her wealthy parents. The bedstead was of pure ivory, and the pillows were covered with creamy-white silk, embroidered with white flowers. The bedspread was of pure white, too, and over it were thickly sewn many brilliant diamonds, while the fringe along the edges was made of diamond beads. The chairs and sofas were covered with white brocaded silks, and the velvet carpet was scattered with lilies-of-the-valley on a <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> groundwork.|$|R
60|$|Thurston {{showed his}} {{pleasure}} almost too openly. They chatted lightly on many subjects {{as they walked}} together, knee-deep, at times, among scarlet wine-berries, and the <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> and ebony of maidenhair fern. The scents and essence of summer hung heavy in the air. Shafts of golden sunlight, piercing the somber canopy of the forest isles, touched, and, it seemed to Geoffrey, etherealized, his companion. The completeness of his enjoyment troubled the man, and presently he lapsed into silence. All this appeared too good, too pleasant, he feared, to last.|$|R
60|$|It {{was the end}} of July--dry, too dry, {{even for}} the season, the <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> herbs and {{vegetables}} that grew in this favoured end of the kingdom tasting rather of the watering-pot than of the pure fresh moisture from the skies. Baptista's boxes were packed, and one Saturday morning she departed by a waggonette to the station, and thence by train to Pen-zephyr, from which port she was, as usual, to cross the water immediately to her home, and become Mr. Heddegan's wife on the Wednesday of the week following.|$|R

6000|$|... "Conceive a jelly-fish such as sails in {{our summer}} seas, {{bell-shaped}} and of enormous size--far larger, I should judge, than {{the dome of}} St. Paul's. It was of a light pink colour veined with a <b>delicate</b> <b>green,</b> but the whole huge fabric so tenuous that it was but a fairy outline against the dark blue sky. It pulsated with a delicate and regular rhythm. From it there depended two long, drooping green tentacles, which swayed slowly backwards and forwards. This gorgeous vision passed gently with noiseless dignity over my head, as light and fragile as a soap-bubble, and drifted upon its stately way.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} {{she glanced at}} the wide belt of plowing that broke the <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> and silver of the grass. In the foreground, the rows of clods shone with an oily gleam in the fading light. Farther off, the rows converged and melted into a sweep of purple-brown that narrowed as it crossed a distant rise. There were two other belts; one where white grasses broke through the harrow-torn sod, and another flat and smooth where the {{land-packer}} had rolled in the seed. All told of strenuous effort in which sweating men and horses had been aided by tractor machines.|$|R
60|$|It is in {{gathering}} and testing the materials for a nest that the orioles display no little ingenuity. One day, {{a few years}} ago, I was lying under some shrubs, watching a pair of the birds that were building close to the house. It was a typical nest-making day, the sun pouring his bright rays through <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> leaves and a glory of white apple blossoms, the air filled with warmth and fragrance, birds and bees busy everywhere. Orioles seem always happy; to-day they quite overflowed {{in the midst of}} all the brightness, though materials were scarce and they must needs be diligent.|$|R
60|$|The prince {{followed}} John {{into the}} little sitting room. He was dressed, as usual, with scrupulous care. His white linen gaiters were immaculate, his trousers were perfectly creased, the hang of his coat had engaged the care of an artist. His tie was of a deep shade of violet, fastened with a wonderful pearl, and his fingers were perhaps a trifle overmanicured. He wore a bunch of Parma violets in his buttonhole, and he carried with him a very faint but unusual perfume, which seemed to John like the odor of <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> tea. It was just these details, and the slowness of his speech, which alone accentuated his foreign origin.|$|R
6000|$|Saturday {{proved an}} ideal {{day for a}} picnic [...] . a day of breeze and blue, warm, sunny, with a little rollicking wind blowing across meadow and orchard. Over every sunlit upland and field was a <b>delicate,</b> flower-starred <b>green.</b>|$|R
60|$|As he {{mounted the}} steps with Ferris, Mrs. Vervain came forward {{a little to}} meet them, while Florida rose and stood beside her chair {{in a sort of}} proud {{suspense}} and timidity. The elder lady was in that black from which she had so seldom been able to escape; but the daughter wore a dress of <b>delicate</b> <b>green,</b> in which she seemed a part of the young season that everywhere clothed itself in the same tint. The sunlight fell upon her blonde hair, melting into its light gold; her level brows frowned somewhat with the glance of scrutiny which she gave the dark young priest, who was making his stately bow to her mother, and trying to answer her English greetings in the same tongue.|$|R
60|$|One day, {{as we were}} {{crossing}} a dike between rice swamps spread with <b>delicate</b> <b>green,</b> I saw the white tops of wagons flashing in the sun {{at the far end}} of it. We caught up with them, the wagoners cracking their whips and swearing at the straining horses. And lo! in front of the wagons was an army,--at least my boyish mind magnified it to such. Men clad in homespun, perspiring and spattered with mud, were straggling along the road by fours, laughing and joking together. The officers rode, and many of these had blue coats and buff waistcoats,--some the worse for wear. My father was pushing the white mare into the ditch to ride by, when one hailed him.|$|R

6000|$|... 10. I am {{astonished}} hourly, {{more and}} more, at the apathy and stupidity which have prevented me hitherto from learning the most simple facts {{at the base}} of this question! Here is this myrtille bush in my hand--its cluster of some fifteen or twenty <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> branches knitting themselves downwards into the stubborn brown {211} of a stem on which my knife makes little impression. I have not the slightest idea how old it is, still less how old it might one day have been if I had not gathered it; and, less than the least, what hinders it from becoming as old as it likes! What doom is there over these bright green sprays, that they may never win to any height or space of verdure, nor persist beyond their narrow scope of years? ...|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes later, Foster {{left the}} inn {{and set off}} across the moor. The heath shone red, and here and there little pools, round which white stones lay in the dark peat, flashed in the sunshine. The pale-blue of the sky changed near the horizon to <b>delicate</b> <b>green,</b> and a soft breeze blew across the waste. Foster enjoyed the walk, {{although}} he was puzzled and somewhat disturbed. If inquiries had been made about Featherstone, he could have understood it, but the police were asking {{for a man with}} a glove on his left hand, which could only apply to him. Daly, of course, would be glad {{to get him out of}} the way, if he had learned that he was in Scotland, but the police could not arrest a man who had done nothing wrong.|$|R

6000|$|The buying of orchids {{always has}} in it a certain {{speculative}} flavour. You have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, {{and for the}} rest you must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good-luck, as your taste may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps--for the thing has happened again and again--there slowly unfolds before the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety, some novel richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or some subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom together on one <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> spike, and, it may be, even immortality. For the new miracle of Nature may stand in need of a new specific name, and what so convenient as that of its discoverer? [...] "Johnsmithia"! There have been worse names.|$|R
60|$|Upon the moor above Martinhoe and {{the farm}} lands adjoining, spring had fallen that year {{as gently as}} the warm rain of April. Tallente, {{conscious}} of an unexpected lassitude, paused {{as he reached the}} top of the zigzag climb from the Manor and rested for a moment upon a block of stone. Below him, the forests of dwarf oaks which stretched down to the sea were tipped with <b>delicate</b> <b>green.</b> The meadows were like deep soft patches of emerald verdure; the fruit trees in his small walled garden were pink and white with blossoms. The sea was peaceful as an azure lake into which the hulls of the passing steamers cut like knives, leaving behind a long line of lazy foam. Little fleecy balls of cloud were dotted across the sky, puffs of soft wind cooled his cheeks when he rose to his feet and faced inland.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{wonderful}} Whitsun-day morning {{that none of the}} little party could ever forget. The sunrise could not be seen in that deep, narrow place, but the sky was of a strange pale shining blue, and the tender young green of the trees overhead was touched with gold, the glades of the wood were intensely blue with hyacinths, and with all sorts of <b>delicate</b> <b>greens</b> twined above in the bushes over them. A wild cherry, all silver white, was behind their Altar, the green floor was marbled with cuckoo flowers and buttercups, and the clear little stream whose voice murmured by was fringed with kingcups and forget-me-nots. The scents were of the most delicious dewy freshness; and as to the sounds! Larks sang high up in the sky, wood pigeons cooed around, nightingales, thrushes, every bird of the wood seemed to be trying to make music and melody.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, florists {{had created the}} [...] "Gates Ajar" [...] floral piece. Obituaries began to {{describe}} these ornate tributes: Probably the most elaborate emblem Portland has ever seen was one brought by the Eastern Railroad conductors. It was entitled the Gates Ajar. The emblem was fully three feet long and on its face were erected seven pillars, each at least 10 inches in height. The base was composed of camellias, and double white pinks, interwoven with some <b>delicate</b> <b>green</b> plant, and the columns respectively of red gilliflowers, double white pinks, pansies and white roses. The gates and railings were composed of delicate heath and smilax was gracefully twined about the design. [...] Church organizations welcomed the symbolism, evidenced by the announcement that the Methodist Episcopal Church [...] "sent a floral representation of 'Gates Ajar.'"
