40|$|Macroinvertebrates {{were studied}} along a {{salinity}} gradient in the North Sea Canal, The Netherlands, {{to quantify the}} effect of trace metals (cadmium, copper, lead, zinc) on community composition. In addition, two methods for assessing metal bioavailability (normalizing metal concentrations on organic carbon and on the smallest sediment fraction) were compared. Factor analyses showed that normalizing trace metals resulted in an improved separation of trace metals from <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> (depth, organic carbon, granulometry, and chloride). The variation in the macroinvertebrate data was partitioned into four sources using partial canonical correspondence analysis, with the partitions being purely <b>ecological</b> <b>factors,</b> purely trace metals, mutual <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> and trace metals, and unexplained. Partial canonical correspondence analysis applied to total and normalized trace metal concentrations gave similar results in terms of unexplained variances. However, normalization on organic carbon resulted in {{the highest percentage of}} variation explained by purely <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> and purely trace metals.

50|$|Human ecology {{began in}} the 1920s, through the study of changes in {{vegetation}} succession {{in the city of}} Chicago. It became a distinct field of study in the 1970s. This marked the first recognition that humans, who had colonized all of the Earth's continents, were a major <b>ecological</b> <b>factor.</b> Humans greatly modify the environment through the development of the habitat (in particular urban planning), by intensive exploitation activities such as logging and fishing, and as side effects of agriculture, mining, and industry. Besides ecology and biology, this discipline involved many other natural and social sciences, such as anthropology and ethnology, economics, demography, architecture and urban planning, medicine and psychology, and many more. The development of human ecology led to the increasing role of ecological science in the design and management of cities.|$|E
5000|$|Cooperation {{in social}} organisms has {{numerous}} ecological {{factors that can}} determine the benefits and costs associated with this form of organization.

Another suggested benefit is the possibility of [...] "fortress defense", where soldier castes will threaten or attack intruders, thus protecting related individuals inside the territory. Such behaviors are seen in the snapping shrimp Synalpheus regalis and gall-forming aphid Pemphigus spyrothecae. [...] A third <b>ecological</b> <b>factor</b> that is posited to promote eusociality is the distribution of resources: when food is sparse and concentrated in patches, eusociality is favored. Evidence supporting this third factor comes from studies of naked mole-rats and Damaraland mole-rats, which have communities containing a single pair of reproductive individuals.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) wood density is related to ring width, but most have focused on within-tree variability and have never explored large ecological gradients. Other studies indicate that ring width is largely controlled by <b>ecological</b> <b>factors.</b> Hence it has been concluded that <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> have an effect on wood density, yet few studies have directly analysed the link between these two variables. The respective effects of climate, soil water capacity and nutrient richness on wood density are also debated. Lastly, sessile oak is a ring-porous species, so that earlywood and latewood are likely to be differently influenced by <b>ecological</b> <b>factors.</b> Our objectives were (1) to test whether wood density remains under the influence of <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> after statistically controlling for ring width, (2) to compare the direction and magnitude of site factors on ring width and mean ring density and (3) to compare the response of earlywood and latewood. A total of 18, 287 rings were analysed from 297 dominant sessile oaks in 99 plots distributed over north-eastern and north-western France in mature, even-aged high-forest stands. Wood density and width were measured using X-ray microdensitometry. Multiple regressions were performed on plot means using <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> as predictors, and then using ring width or latewood proportion as covariable. Regressions were followed by variance partitioning. The <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> had an effect on mean ring density that was independent of ring width, but their effect was slight. The percentage of variance explained by <b>ecological</b> <b>factors</b> was twice as high for radial growth components (earlywood, latewood and total ring width) as for wood density components (earlywood, latewood and mean ring density). Climatic, water-related and nutrient-related factors did not always have a consistent effect on radial growth and wood density. Earlywood and latewood responded slightly differently to the <b>ecological</b> <b>factors,</b> with a higher sensitivity of latewood to climate/water-related factors. Unexpectedly, mean ring density did not correlate with ring width at plot scale, although mean ring density and ring width were nearly always positively correlated within a tree. No correlation between ring width and ring mean density at plot scale {{may be due to the}} opposite effects of water-related factors on latewood proportion and latewood density.

5000|$|Ecology is a {{new science}} and {{considered}} as an important branch of biological science, having only become prominent {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics. [...] Its history stems all the way back to the 4th century. One of the first ecologists whose writings survive may have been Aristotle or perhaps his student, Theophrastus, both of whom had interest in many species of animals and plants. Theophrastus described interrelationships between animals and their environment as early as the 4th century BC. Ecology developed substantially in the 18th and 19th century. It began with Carl Linnaeus and his work with the economy of nature. Soon after came Alexander von Humboldt and his work with botanical geography. Alfred Russel Wallace and Karl Möbius then contributed with the notion of biocoenosis. Eugenius Warming’s work with ecological plant geography led to the founding of ecology as a discipline. Charles Darwin’s work also contributed to the science of ecology, and Darwin is often attributed with progressing the discipline more than anyone else in its young history. Ecological thought expanded even more in the early 20th century. Major contributions included: Eduard Suess’ and Vladimir Vernadsky’s work with the biosphere, Arthur Tansley’s ecosystem, Charles Elton's Animal Ecology, and Henry Cowles ecological succession. Ecology influenced the social sciences and humanities. Human ecology began in the early 20th century and it recognized humans as an <b>ecological</b> <b>factor.</b> Later James Lovelock advanced views on earth as a macro-organism with the Gaia hypothesis. Conservation stemmed from the science of ecology. Important figures and movements include Shelford and the ESA, National Environmental Policy act, George Perkins Marsh, Theodore Roosevelt, Stephen A. Forbes, and post-Dust Bowl conservation. Later in the 20th century world governments collaborated on man’s effects on the biosphere and Earth’s environment.|$|E
5000|$|Gause {{was born}} December 27, 1910 in Moscow, Russia to parents Frants Gause, a {{professor}} of architecture at Moscow State University, and Galina Gause, an industrial worker at an automotive steel plant. As a boy and into his teenage years, Gause and his extended family took summer vacations to the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia {{for months at a}} time. [...] Although his family was not wealthy, they were allowed these respites because his father, being a government architect, helped to build many structures at the university. It was during these trips to the Caucasus Mountains that Gause grew fond of nature, often chronicling the lives and behavior of several organisms including the Siberian Grasshopper (Aeropus sibiricus). The Russian university system requires a faculty advisor for all undergraduate and graduate students. His chosen advisor for his undergraduate career was Vladimir Alpatov. Alpatov, in the mid-1920s, was very impressed by the work of Raymond Pearl, a U.S. demographer who became well-known through his advocacy of the logistic curve. [...] Alpatov brings back a fascination for American science that is very influential on Gause. Gause argued that field work, with too many variables, could never adequately explain this relationship and only in the simplified laboratory environment, where variables could be controlled, would it be possible to determine precisely how a specific <b>ecological</b> <b>factor</b> influences a population. Eager to pursue this mechanistic direction of study and influenced by his advisor, Gause contacted Pearl to see if the American would take on another Russian student. He applied for a fellowship through the Rockefeller Foundation but was denied, perhaps because he was only 22 years old. He then published The Struggle for Existence in 1934 to improve his chances but he was still denied.Gause earned his BSc at Moscow University in 1931 and his DBiolSc in 1940.|$|E
