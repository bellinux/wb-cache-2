2500|$|Angus {{returned}} to Australia while Julia {{spent the rest}} of a year travelling. Julia later recalled, [...] " [...] was writing amazing songs ... had shown me how to play guitar in Bolivia, and those songs had gotten me through that year". She elaborated [...] "At that time the guitar was a new thing for me. I'd just bought it because I wanted to start learning. So we're {{in the middle of the}} jungle in Chalalan with this guitar and Angus was playing us these songs he'd been writing. I hadn't really been around him that much for the last couple of years – once I finished school I moved <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> boyfriend and Angus was off surfing and skating – and all of a sudden we're in the middle of the jungle and he's singing these songs that are so beautiful so I asked him to teach me some songs and that was the start of learning guitar and our friendship, I suppose, and the start of us having this amazing experience".|$|E
2500|$|Khan {{entered the}} García fight as a heavy {{favourite}} {{and through the}} first two rounds and most of the third he outlanded García while García was finding the range. However, the tide turned against Khan very late in the third round as García was able to land a hard counterpunch off a missed right. Khan hit the canvas and suddenly had to fight to stay alive as García's punch to the neck and jaw badly hurt him. Only the bell saved Khan from a second knockdown and García kept pressing early in round four, forcing Khan to take a second standing eight count after he touched the canvas with his glove. Khan regrouped and was temporarily able to go back at García, but with less than a minute left in the round Khan was dropped a third time. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight despite Khan assuring him he could continue, deciding enough was enough. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It wasn't my night. I was coming <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> hands down and Danny took advantage of that. He countered very well against me." [...] According to CompuBox stats, Khan landed 92 of 206 punches thrown (45%), with 46 jabs and 46 power shots landed. García landed 65 of his 216 thrown (30%), 60 of which were power shots. Khan earned $950,000, while García had a $520,000 purse. Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the fight generated a total gate of $426,152 from 3,147 tickets sold. The fight averaged 1.3 million viewers on HBO World Championship Boxing.|$|E

Records and on May 12, 2015, released their first new music under their new name. [...] "Im <b>in</b> Love <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Life", [...] "Betty Blue", and [...] "Cooler" [...] were all released on the same day, with a music video directed by Ethan Tobman for [...] "Im <b>in</b> Love <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Life" [...] released simultaneously.

2500|$|... “Many of the Indians {{would want}} to go out and buy {{trinkets}} and things to carry back home, such as nice blankets and shawls. [...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, {{when asked}} about the album's musical {{direction}} in an interview with gossip website Dean Piper's World, Goulding stated, [...] "It's started to sound very dark and very weird. This album is going to be even more emotional [...] I wanted to make it so there is hope. I want to make an effect whether it's happy or sad." [...] Goulding added, [...] "This album for me is a journey from dark into light from confusion to understanding [...] I didn't set out to write a break-up record but I think it became one." [...] In an interview with MTV News on 29 August 2012, Goulding elaborated on the sound of the album, saying, [...] "I've moved on quite a bit since the first album, because I've discovered so much; I've learned a lot more and I've grown up a lot more. I've gained more influences and different influences and people have influenced it; I suppose just circumstances. It's a bit more tribal and anthemic; a bit more piano and vocal than anything. The last album was very electronic, but it was tied <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> voice; this one, to me, is way more of a pop record." [...] Goulding revealed to The Sun that her former relationship with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James provided inspiration for the album, stating, [...] "The last record I felt like I was singing about stuff like that and I thought it was really sincere but I listen back and I think, God that was really naive, that was nothing. This time it's the real deal. There's stuff about Greg. I played it to him because I felt that was better than him hearing it randomly somewhere." ...|$|E
