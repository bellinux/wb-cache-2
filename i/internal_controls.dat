5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|The bank's {{expansion}} strategy hit {{trouble with}} {{the stock market crash}} of 1987 and involvement in the financial scandal surrounding the collapse of Blue Arrow. The Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair was critical of the bank's management and resulted in the resignation of several members of the board, including then chairman Lord Boardman. Later, the bank would divest its overseas subsidiaries. The North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hong Kong Bank of Canada, and the Australian and New Zealand branches were sold to Salomon Smith Barney and the National Australia Bank. Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group, reflecting its modern positioning as a portfolio of businesses. In 1993, the NatWest Tower was devastated by a Provisional IRA bomb and the bank vacated the building and later sold it. Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm formed in 1992, revealed that a £50m loss had been discovered, revised to £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder confidence was so badly shaken that the Bank of England had to instruct the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most senior executives in an effort to draw a line under the affair. The bank's <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> and risk management were severely criticised in 2000 and its aggressive push into investment banking questioned, after a lengthy investigation by the Securities and Futures Authority. The bank's move into complicated derivative products that it did not fully understand seemed to indicate poor management. By the end of 1997 parts of NatWest Markets had been sold, others becoming Greenwich NatWest in 1998.|$|E

30|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> {{literature}} explores how {{to construct}} <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> {{systems and the}} effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> in China. <b>Internal</b> <b>control</b> systems are <b>internal</b> monitoring mechanisms and should cover the following aspects: control environment, risk evaluation, control activities, information communication, and internal monitoring which is consistent with COSO. Further, internal audit is an auxiliary mechanism for <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> systems. Li et al. (2003) investigate the information disclosure of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> in China, in which they show that information disclosure of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> contains less efficient information and should be enhanced with auditing. For the effect of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> on innovation, <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> is divided into strategic <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> and financial <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> where they provide evidence that the former is positively related with disruptive innovation and negatively related with gradual innovation while the latter is reversed. As well, though there are audit committees in Chinese listed firms, audit committees are less effective which may result from the establishment of audit committees without endogenous power (Yang and Xu 2004). However, literature provides further evidence that audit committees may impede accounting restatement and fraud.|$|R

The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit.

The DOI was the first of 17 new Australian Government departments to be established during the war, and was responsible for both censorship and disseminating government propaganda. Treloar [...] ran the department in line with traditional Australian Public Service practices and took steps to prevent the its work from being politicised.

Murdoch's appointment was part of a government campaign to generate public support for increased armaments production following the fall of France, and he placed a stronger emphasis on generating propaganda.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> {{deficiencies}} and their remediation on accrual quality. We first document that firms reporting <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> deficiencies have lower quality accruals as measured by accrual noise and absolute abnormal accruals relative to firms not reporting <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> problems. Second, we find that firms that report <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> deficiencies have significantly larger positive and larger negative abnormal accruals relative to control firms. This finding suggests <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> weaknesses {{are more likely to}} lead to unintentional errors that add noise to accruals than intentional misstatements that bias earnings upward. Third, we doc-ument that firms whose auditors confirm remediation of previously reported <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> deficiencies exhibit an increase in accrual quality relative to firms that do not remediate their control problems. Finally, we find firms that receive different <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> audit opinions in successive years exhibit changes in accrual quality consistent with changes in <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> quality. Collectively, our cross-sectional and intertem-poral change tests provide strong evidence that the quality of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> affects the quality of accruals...|$|R
