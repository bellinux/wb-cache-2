40|$|The popularization of {{genome-wide}} {{analyses and}} RNA sequencing {{led to the}} discovery that {{a large part of}} the human genome, while effectively transcribed, does not encode proteins. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression in both normal and disease states. Studies of <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> expressed in the heart, in combination with gene association studies, revealed that these molecules are regulated during cardiovascular development and disease. Some <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> have been functionally implicated in cardiac pathophysiology and constitute potential therapeutic targets. Here, we review the current knowledge of the function of <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> in the cardiovascular system, with an emphasis on cardiovascular development and biology, focusing on hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia, and heart failure. We discuss potential therapeutic implications and the challenges of <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> research, with directions for future research and translational focus...|$|R

Tsix is a <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> that prevents repression of an X chromosome, while Xist is a <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> that acts to repress and condense an entire X chromosome. The actions of Xist serve to create a Barr body in the cell.|$|R
40|$|<b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> have {{in recent}} years emerged as {{regulatory}} molecules {{in their own right}} impacting transcriptional regulation at the level of chromatin. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> have also been implicated in regulation of embryogenesis and tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Regulation of gene transcription in yeast underpins a diverse array of cellular processes including metabolic regulation, sporulation and growth responses to nutrient deprivation. For most of these cases the transcription factors that regulate these processes have served as paradigms for our understanding of gene regulation in yeast and mammalian cells. More recently, an additional layer of transcriptional control in yeast has been uncovered in the form of <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> which originate as anti- sense transcripts of known genes or as intergenic transcripts overlapping gene promoters. These <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> and their transcription through promoter regions exhibits complex effects that directly affect promoter conformation at the level of histone modifications and chromatin structure. In this review we summarize some of the best characterized examples of transcriptional control through <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> and suggest that studies in yeast will greatly inform our understanding of the mechanisms of action of <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> in human cells...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> participate in all steps of cancer initiation and progression by regulating protein-coding genes at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> are in turn regulated by other genes, forming a complex regulatory network. The regulation networks between the p 53 tumor suppressor and these RNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains unclear. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the regulatory roles of the TP 53 gene in regulating <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> expression profiles and to study the function of a TP 53 -regulated <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> (LOC 401317) in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE 2. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> expression profiling indicated that 133 <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> were upregulated in the human NPC cell line HNE 2 cells following TP 53 overexpression, while 1057 were downregulated. Among these aberrantly expressed <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs,</b> LOC 401317 was the most significantly upregulated one. Further studies indicated that LOC 401317 is directly regulated by p 53 and that ectopic expression of LOC 401317 inhibits HNE 2 cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. LOC 401317 inhibited cell cycle progression by increasing p 21 expression and decreasing cyclin D 1 and cyclin E 1 expression and promoted apoptosis through the induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase- 3 cleavage. Collectively, these results suggest that LOC 401317 is directly regulated by p 53 and exerts antitumor effects in HNE 2 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells...|$|R

40|$|Neuronal {{development}} is a pro-survival process that involves neurite growth, synaptogenesis, synaptic and neuronal pruning. During development, these processes can be controlled by temporal gene expression that is orchestrated by both <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> and microRNAs. To examine the interplay between these different components of the transcriptome during neuronal differentiation, we carried out mRNA, <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> and microRNA expression profiling on maturing primary neurons. Subsequent gene ontology analysis revealed regulation of axonogenesis and dendritogenesis processes by these differentially expressed mRNAs and <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Temporally regulated mRNAs and their associated <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> were significantly over-represented in proliferation and differentiation associated signalling, cell adhesion and neurotrophin signalling pathways. Verification of expression of the Axin 2, Prkcb, Cntn 1, Ncam 1, Negr 1, Nrxn 1 and Sh 2 b 3 mRNAs and their respective <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> in an in vitro model of ischemic-reperfusion injury showed an inverse expression profile to the maturation process, thus suggesting their role(s) in maintaining neuronal structure and function.

40|$|Abstract Cancer {{has been}} a major public health problem that has {{threatened}} human life worldwide throughout history. The main causes that contribute to the poor prognosis of cancer are metastasis and recurrence. Cancer stem cells are a group of tumor cells that possess self-renewal and differentiation ability, which is a vital cause of cancer metastasis and recurrence. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> refer to a class of RNAs that are longer than 200 Â nt and have no potential to code proteins, some of which can be specifically expressed in different tissues and different tumors. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> have great biological significance in the occurrence and progression of cancers. However, how <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> interact with cancer stem cells and then affect cancer metastasis and recurrence is not yet clear.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, studies of <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> increase. <b>Non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> are divided in two classes: small and <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA.</b> It was shown that <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{regulate}} expression of 70 % of genes. <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{are involved in}} several cellular processes like epigenetic regulation, dosage compensation, alternative splicing and stem cells maintenance for example.

Furthermore, we study the H 19 /IGF 2 cluster: an imprinted genomic locus located on chromosome 11 p 15. 5. Genomic imprinting allows gene expression from a single allele in a parent-origin-dependent manner. This cluster encode for the first <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNA</b> identified: H 19.

It is possible to divide the non-coding elements of the transcriptome into three categories: short <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs,</b> circular <b>RNAs</b> and <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs.</b> <b>Long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> are those transcripts that are greater than 200 nts in length and lack any significant open reading frames that produce proteins greater then 100 amino acids. <b>Long</b> intervening <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs</b> (lincRNAs) are a subclass of <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> <b>RNAs.</b> In contrast to protein coding RNAs, lincRNAs are expressed in a more tissue- and species-specific manner. In particular, many lincRNAs are only conserved amongst higher primates.

We analysed 39 lincRNAs that are expressed in the frontal cortex and identified LINC 00507 as being expressed in a cortex-specific manner in non-human primates and humans. The expression patterns of LINC 00507 appear to be age-dependent, suggesting it may be involved in brain development of higher primates.
