25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every one got something for racing, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Comic Relief {{performed}} a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan. It featured Dawn French {{as a female}} Harry; Jennifer Saunders as Ron Weasley and J. K. Rowling; Miranda Richardson (who later became Rita Skeeter in the Goblet of Fire film) as Hermione; Nigel Planer as Dumbledore (wearing the beard and costume of Richard Harris); Jeremy Irons as Professor Severus Snape; Alison Steadman as Minerva McGonagall; Ronnie Corbett as Hagrid and Basil Brush as Dobby the house elf. The broadcast of this parody was preceded by a message from J. K. Rowling. French subsequently received a role as The Fat Lady in 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The end of Secret Chamberpot featured an advert for the sequel, Gobs of Fire, which was never made. It is unknown whether it was ever planned, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a spoof.|$|E

500|$|McCarthy {{argued that}} the rules already {{prohibited}} strikes {{to the back of}} the head and questioned <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the 12-6 elbow strike that was the problem. Following this discussion, Nick Lembo wrote the Unified Rules, including a rule prohibiting downward elbow strikes. McCarthy felt that Lembo wrote the rule relating to downward elbow strikes [...] "poorly" [...] as he felt the definition was broad and left the rule open to interpretation. Pride eventually did not adopt the Unified Rules; however, their ruleset prohibited any elbow strikes to the head. Eventually the rule on 12-6 elbows meant that very few fighters attempted them, which could also be attributed to the fact that it is difficult for fighters to get into a position where they could use them.|$|E

500|$|On 15March 2010, seismologist Mario Pardo {{from the}} University of Chile Seismological Service ruled out that Pichilemu was {{experiencing}} a seismic swarm, after public {{concerns about the}} continued aftershocks in the area; as of that date, more than 50 aftershocks had occurred in the area, the strongest of them measuring 6.7 in the moment magnitude scale, minutes after the initial quake. From the pattern of aftershocks, {{it has been suggested}} that this earthquake originated from rupture along a previously unknown geological fault, the Pichilemu Fault, between Pichilemu and the commune of Vichuquén in Maule Region, at 15km depth, 40km in length and 20km wide. At first it was not known whether this fault was formed during the earthquake or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> reactivated, however geologist José Cembrano from the University of Chile affirmed that [...] " [...] corresponds to a long life fault, in a million years time, whose activity had not been detected before." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Bozon {{has refused}} to blame Capcom, the {{publisher}} of the game, for responsibility in the game's failure. This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence. He says he went in [...] "very naive", believing that if the game was good, it would sell anyway. Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, he never really settled on a target audience, with the character being [...] "iconoclastic", [...] "too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game [...] "would probably not sell", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many market analysts were skeptical at {{the idea of having a}} female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably [...] "genuinely knew their markets". He still didn't give up, as he felt that Shantae had to exist, [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> to reach out and see if there was an audience reaching back." ...|$|E
500|$|Service {{stated that}} Lenin could be [...] "moody and volatile", and Pipes deemed {{him to be}} [...] "a thoroughgoing misanthrope", a view {{rejected}} by Read, who highlighted many instances in which Lenin displayed kindness, particularly toward children. According to several biographers, Lenin was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from his own. He could be [...] "venomous in his critique of others", exhibiting a propensity for mockery, ridicule, and ad hominem attacks on those who disagreed with him. He ignored facts that did not suit his argument, abhorred compromise, and very rarely admitted his own errors. He refused to change his opinions, until he rejected them completely, after which he would treat the new view as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as unchangeable. Lenin {{showed no sign of}} sadism or of personally desiring to commit violent acts, but he endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for the revolutionary cause. Adopting an amoral stance, in Lenin's view the end always justified the means; according to Service, Lenin's [...] "criterion of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution?" ...|$|E

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if {{he really wanted to}} be with her or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E
2500|$|Parker was {{inspired}} to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, [...] "I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used {{to get the most}} immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a few noises or drum patterns put together.

Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just,</b> 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film. Cranston, despite his positive opinion on the film, would later opine that killing off Joe Brody so early was a [...] "narrative mistake".|$|E

2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16. [...] "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," [...] Jemison said. [...] "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [...] go that far away from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E
2500|$|The Somalia Affair came as such as {{surprise}} to the Canadian public as {{no one would have}} thought Canada’s golden reputation for international peacekeeping could be tarnished. The Somalia Affair and the ensuing commission of inquiry has become the subject of intense criticism and has given rise to a great deal of comparative theoretical work on humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping. In her book Sherene Razack asks <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a case of ‘a few bad apples’ in the Canadian forces, or if the Somalia Affair speaks to a larger issue on the complex nature of peacekeeping and humanitarian intervention. Thomas Weiss comments that the failures in Somalia have led to this concept of ‘Somalia Syndrome’: “multilateral interventions to thwart starvation, genocide, the forced movement of peoples, and massive violations of fundamental rights are no longer politically or operationally feasible”. Peacekeepers {{are more likely to be}} involved in peace enforcement in more warlike conditions as unlike traditional peacekeeping; there is not always consent from all the conflicting parties. Such was the case in Somalia as the men were hypervigilent with a sense of fear and frustration as they were trained for combat yet charged with providing humanitarian aid. Faced with this strong Somali opposition and resentment and yet being responsible for providing aid meant that Canadian peacekeepers “increasingly could not find meaning in their activities” [...] There would be a ‘Somalia syndrome’ sentiment that would linger in the international community after the failures in the war torn country. Weiss, however, reminds us not to take Somalia out of context or draw upon the wrong lessons leading to isolationism or eschewing necessary humanitarian intervention. The debacle in Somalia would be so paralyzing that it would lead to an unwillingness from the international community to respond to future problems, like the Rwandan Genocide. The United States under the Clinton Administration would need to rethink its foreign policies and the rest of the world just did not want another Somalia Affair.|$|E

Her bright brown hair was simply brushed from off her forehead and tied in a knot behind her head. Her dress was as plain as a child's,--as though it was intended that she should still be regarded as a child.
