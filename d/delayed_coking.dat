30|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>coking</b> is an {{important}} process used to convert heavy oils to light products. Energy consumption and light oil yield are important factors for evaluating the <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> process. This paper analyzes the energy consumption and product yields of <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> units in China. The average energy consumption {{shows a decreasing trend}} in recent years. The energy consumption of different refineries varies greatly, with the average value of the highest energy consumption approximately twice that of the lowest energy consumption. The factors affecting both energy consumption and product yields were analyzed, and correlation models of energy consumption and product yields were established using a quadratic polynomial. The model coefficients were calculated through least square regression of collected industrial data of <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> units. Both models showed good calculation accuracy. The average absolute error of the energy consumption model was approximately 85 MJ/t, and that of the product yield model ranged from 1 wt% to 2.3 wt%. The model prediction showed that a large annual processing capacity and high load rate will result in a reduction in energy consumption.|$|E

40|$|Refinery thermal {{processes}} are diffused {{all over the}} world, because of their relatively simple configuration and operating flexibility compared to catalytic processes.

40|$|The thermal {{upgrading}} of Nigerian {{petroleum residue}} was studied at relatively low pressure in a <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> reactor system. In this work, {{the intent was}} to investigate the effects of process variables such as reaction temperature (200 (0) C to 600 (0) C), reaction time (0 to 120 min), additive concentration loading and additive-to-residue ratio on the amounts and quality of organic liquid product (OLP). The liquid products derived from the <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> process were characterized by means of instrumental analysis of gas-liquid chromatography. Results obtained from the analyses of the OLP revealed an upward trend of the conversion process and the selectivity of the aromatic compounds with additive-to-residue ratio (ARR) and increase in temperature. This led to maximum yield of 37. 2 % achieved with ARR of 5 compared to 31 % achieved with ordinary thermal conversion. The selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons was maximum at 83. 1 wt% the selectivity towards aromatics and aliphatic hydrocarbons were highest for methanol-potassium hydroxide and methanol respectively. In all additive system cases, maximum OLP was produced at an optimum reaction temperature of 370 (0) C in the <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> reactor and at higher residence time. The gaseous product consisted of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and C 1 - C 6 hydrocarbons, which amounted to about 20 to 30 wt% of liquid distillate.

40|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>coking</b> evolved {{steadily}} {{over the}} early to mid 1900 s to enable refiners to convert high boiling, residual petroleum fractions to light products such as gasoline. Pound for pound, coking is the most energy intensive of any operation in a modern refinery. Large amounts of energy are required to heat the thick, poor-quality petroleum residuum to the 900 to 950 degrees F required to crack the heavy hydrocarbon molecules into lighter, more valuable products. One common misconception of <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> is that the product coke is a disadvantage. Although coke is a low valued (near zero economic value) byproduct, compared to transportation fuels, {{there is a significant}} worldwide trade and demand for coke as it is an economical fuel. Coke production has increased steadily over the last ten years, with further increases forecast for the foreseeable future. Current domestic production is near 111, 000 tons per day. A major driving force behind this increase is the steady decline in crude quality available to refiners. Crude slates are expected to grow heavier with higher sulfur contents while environmental restrictions are expected to significantly reduce the demand for high-sulfur residual fuel oil. Light sweet crudes will continue to be available and in even greater demand than they are today. Refiners will be faced with the choice of purchasing light sweet crudes at a premium price, or adding bottom of the barrel upgrading capability, through additional new investments, to reduce the production of high-sulfur residual fuel oil and increase the production of low-sulfur distillate fuels. A second disadvantage is that liquid products from cokers frequently are unstable, i. e., they rapidly form gum and sediments. Because of intermediate investment and operating costs, <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> has increased in popularity among refiners worldwide. Based on the 2000 Worldwide Refining Survey published in the Oil and Gas, the <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> capacity for 101 refineries around the world is 2, 937, 439 barrels/calendar day. These cokers produce 154, 607 tons of coke per day and <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> accounts for 88 % of the world capacity. The <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> charge capacity in the United States is 1, 787, 860 b/cd. Despite its wide commercial use, only relatively few contractors and refiners are truly knowledgeable in delayed-coking design, so that this process carries with it a ''black art'' connotation. Until recently, the expected yield from cokers was determined by a simple laboratory test on the feedstock. As a result of Tulsa University's prior related research, a process model was developed that with additional work could be used to optimize existing delayed cokers over a wide range of potential feedstocks and operating conditions. The objectives of this research program are to: utilize the current micro, batch and pilot unit facilities at The University of Tulsa to enhance the understanding of the coking process; conduct additional micro and pilot unit tests with new and in-house resids and recycles to make current optimization models more robust; conduct focused kinetic experiments to enhance the furnace tube model and to enhance liquid production while minimizing sulfur in the products; conduct detailed foaming studies to optimize the process and minimize process upsets; quantify the parameters that affect coke morphology; and to utilize the knowledge gained from the experimental and modeling studies to enhance the computer programs developed in the previous JIP for optimization of the coking process. These refined computer models will then be tested against refinery data provided by the member companies. Novel concepts will also be explored for hydrogen sulfide removal of furnace gases as well as gas injection studies to reduce over-cracking. The following deliverables are scheduled from the two projects of the three-year JIP: (1) A novel method for enhancing liquid yields from delayed cokers and data that provide insight as to the optimum temperature to remove hydrogen sulfide from furnace gases. (2) An understanding of what causes foaming in coker drums and ways to minimize sulfur in the produced liquids. (3) An understanding of the HES impacts resulting from hot spots, poor drainage, and settling. (4) A screening model to quantify how other feedstocks and/or a combination of feedstocks will behave in a refinery, and kinetic/optimization models that can represent virtually any <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> unit across a wide range of process conditions and feedstocks. Primarily graduate students, post-Doctoral Research Associates and faculty members, will conduct the research in this project...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> process {{was used to}} produce petrol precursors, diesel precursors, methane rich gas, green and calcined coke from five previously untested South African heavy petroleum residues. The ash content of the heavy petroleum residues {{was found to be}} detrimental to the microstructure of the green coke and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of the calcined coke. The sulphur content of the calcined cokes produced was found to be in-line with typical global anode grade cokes. De-ashing of the feedstock would be necessary to produce anode grade fillers for the aluminium industry. The local production of anode grade coke would serve to reduce imports and supply the aluminium smelters on the east coast of South Africa. The heavy petroleum residues (also known as heavy fuel oil) are currently used as bunker fuel in the shipping industry and are responsible for substantial air pollution. <b>Delayed</b> <b>coking</b> of these residues could extend the production of petrol and diesel per barrel of imported crude oil and reduce the effect on South Africa’s balance of payments deficit and impact the environment in a beneficial manner with respect to carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions. The research also evaluated the replacement of heavy fuel oil with marine diesel produced by <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> of the former. Marine diesel was found to emit less sulphur oxides and have a higher energy density per unit of carbon dioxide emitted. While seawater scrubbing of the heavy fuel oil would be more cost effective in reducing the sulphur oxide emissions, it would not contribute to carbon dioxide reductions. The research created a hypothetical scenario to determine the required value of Clean Development Mechanism credits for a marine diesel replacement, were shipping to be incorporated under the Kyoto Protocol in futur...|$|E

40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry is challenged with {{the processing of}} present heavy crudes caused by high composition of sulfur and metals, which lead to a higher yield of unfavorable bottom product as vacuum residue. Vacuum residue is the least valuable fraction of four, such as saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. However, it can be upgraded to recover more valuable products such as light hydrocarbons. The <b>Delayed</b> <b>Coking</b> process {{is going to be}} used to transform the vacuum residue at different experimental conditions. First of all, the behavior of the vacuum residue needs to be analyzed with no additions in feedstock. Secondly, the vacuum residue can be mixed with unhydrogenated and hydrogenated light gas oil at different concentrations. Finally, the addition of different catalysts at various concentrations could be another method to achieve high yield of the desired product. Expected experimental conditions are 475 oC for reactor temperature and bimetallic or trimetallic catalysts for the <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> process. In this research, 3 different catalysts will be tested in several proportions with respect to the weight of the feedstock material. The recommended feed concentration of light gas oil depends on the molecular structure of the vacuum residue and can be determined only by actual experiment. Based on these experimental conditions, a conclusion about the yield of the light hydrocarbons and ways to improving the process can be drawn...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} {{networks in}} process plants recover usable heat from hot to cold process streams such as feedstock, product, and pumparound streams. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the design of a heat exchanger network for removing variable heat from a complex fractionator in <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> units. A superstructure-based mixed integer nonlinear programming model is presented to minimize the total annual cost, including the heat exchanger area cost and the utility cost. In the proposed model, duties and operating parameters of pumparounds are optimized and the optimized structure of the heat exchanger network is defined simultaneously. Meanwhile, two modifications are applied to improve the simultaneous optimization model for the integrated system of the complex fractionator and heat exchanger network. First, a predominant calculation method for the log mean temperature difference is introduced in order to obtain the results closest to the actual process; second, nonconstant specific heat of process streams with pseudocomponents is considered to represent real thermal properties of process streams in the process model. A case study is carried out to demonstrate simultaneous optimization of the fractionator and heat exchanger network. The optimal design for the model is compared to the one with conventional design heuristics. By applying the proposed model to integrate the operation of the fractionator and heat exchanger network in a <b>delayed</b> <b>coking</b> unit, the total annual cost is reduced by 2. 1 million CNY considering the constraints of the heat removals...|$|E
