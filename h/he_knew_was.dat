5|$|Benedict Arnold {{began the}} war as a captain in Connecticut's militia, a {{position}} {{to which he was}} elected in March 1775. His company marched northeast the following month to assist in the siege of Boston that followed the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord. Arnold proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety an action to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York, which <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> poorly defended. They issued him a colonel's commission on May 3, 1775, and he immediately rode off to the west, arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont) in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain. A Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June; Arnold had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort, and resigned his Massachusetts commission. He was {{on his way home from}} Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife had died earlier in June.|$|E
5|$|Iwadare {{was asked}} to create memorable melodies, but found {{creating}} suitable tracks difficult as many of his initial pieces were thrown out. For Kameoka, recording the live orchestral segments proved a time-consuming and difficult business: each element of a track was recorded separately, then mixed into a single track, then each orchestral element needed to be adjusted for speed and tone so they lined up correctly. According to Mitsuda, the live recording of music spanned seven full sessions, estimated by him as being the largest-scale musical production for a video game to that date. He was entirely dedicated to orchestration and recording for four months. Mitsuda was tasked with creating the music for the game's 2010 reveal trailer, which <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> an important task {{as it would have}} an international audience. He estimated that around 150 people in total worked on the score throughout its creation.|$|E
5|$|James B. Conant, the {{chairman}} of the NDRC and the S-1 Executive Committee, was concerned that the navy was running its own nuclear project, but Bush felt that it did no harm. He met with Gunn at Anacostia on 14 January 1943, and explained the situation to him. Gunn responded that the navy was interested in nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines. Liquid thermal diffusion was a viable means of producing enriched uranium, and all he needed was details about nuclear reactor design, which <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> being pursued by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. He was unaware that the it had already built Chicago Pile-1, a working nuclear reactor. Bush was unwilling to provide the requested data, but arranged with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, a fellow member of the Military Policy Committee that ran the Manhattan Project, for Abelson's efforts to receive additional support.|$|E

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
25|$|In 1889 Mark Twain used {{a similar}} plot device in his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. In that novel, Hank Morgan, a 19th-century {{resident}} of Hartford, Connecticut, after {{a blow to}} the head, awakens to find himself inexplicably transported back in time to early medieval England {{at the time of the}} legendary King Arthur. When Morgan is about to be burned at the stake, he pretends to conjure a solar eclipse that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> about to happen; this prediction saves Morgan's life.|$|E

It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash. Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.|$|E
40|$|<b>He</b> who <b>knows</b> not and <b>knows</b> {{not that}} <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> not <b>is</b> a fool; avoid him. <b>He</b> who <b>knows</b> not and <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> not <b>is</b> a student; teach him. <b>He</b> who <b>knows</b> and <b>knows</b> not that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> asleep; wake him. <b>He</b> who <b>knows</b> and <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>is</b> a wise man; follow him. The above ancient proverb is very {{relevant}} to categorization of excipient-related risks. Those who supply raw materials as excipients without knowledge of pharmaceutical requirements {{and those who}} use excipients pharmaceutically without understanding them, are to be avoided, especially in tandem. The International Pharmaceutical Council (IPEC) (1) and others seek to teach and reawaken {{understanding of the role}} of excipients in Pharmaceutical products. The IPEC approach of Total Excipient Control (2) should be followed. Excipient risk management must address the three sources of excipient-related risk...|$|R

25|$|In 1937, Ture Nerman and {{his friend}} August Spångberg, {{traveled}} to Spain where General Francisco Franco's National faction had taken power and a civil war was ravaging the country. They went through Nazi Germany and managed to get to Barcelona. The civil war was a chaos. At times the Stalinists were fighting the Trotskyists, {{and at other times}} the Anarchists were fighting everyone, and the Nationalists benefited from the turmoil within the left. Ture Nerman decided he could not side with any of the groups, all <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that he was an anti-fascist.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, {{along with}} many other Ivy League alumni, Buckley was {{recruited}} into the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); he served for two years including one year in Mexico City working on political action for E.

In a November 1, 2005, column for National Review, Buckley recounted that while he worked for the CIA, the only employee of the organization that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> Hunt, his immediate boss.

25|$|Throughout early 1999, The Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness {{had been}} feuding with WWF owner Mr. McMahon, {{trying to gain}} control of the Federation. To break Vince's spirits they began {{targeting}} his daughter Stephanie. Worried about his daughter, Vince shifted focus from his Corporation stable to Stephanie. With Vince occupied, his son Shane gradually took over the leadership of the Corporation. On April 12, Shane kicked Vince, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco out of the Corporation. His rationale was that there was no room in the Corporation for the old and that Vince no longer had his priorities straight. Shane then slapped his father, saying that the strong, ruthless man <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> gone.|$|E

25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, I witnessed first hand the duplicitous Iraq {{policies of the}} administration of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the American people about a threat <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration {{wanted nothing to do}} with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned its back on the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy as reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of the Clinton administration to remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E
25|$|His {{handling}} of the artillery was conspicuous in the repulse of Pickett's Charge on July 3. During a morning inspection, Hunt observed activity in the Confederate lines and rightly concluded an assault was being readied. Later, with the Union line on Cemetery Ridge under massive bombardment from Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, Hunt was able to resist command pressure from fiery II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock who had demanded Union fire to lift {{the spirits of the}} infantrymen pinned down under Alexander's bombardment. Hunt ordered that counter-battery fire cease to conserve ammunition, reserving sufficient amounts for anti-personnel fire in the attack <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> coming. Hunt also directed his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one, which fooled the Confederates into thinking his batteries were destroyed and triggered their disastrous charge. His concealed placement of Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery's batteries north of Little Round Top caused massive casualties in the infantry assault. Hunt was rewarded for his service with the brevet of colonel in the Regular Army. Hunt reported in detail on the artillery's role at Gettysburg.|$|E

On 1 August 1943, he served as pilot of the lead aircraft in his group in a daring low-level attack against enemy oil refineries and installations at Ploesti, Rumania. Although he had completed more than his share of missions and was no longer connected with this group, so high was his conception of duty that he volunteered to lead the formation in the correct belief that his participation would contribute materially to success in this attack. Maj. Jerstad led the formation into attack with full realization of the extreme hazards involved and despite withering fire from heavy and light antiaircraft guns. Three miles from the target his airplane was hit, badly damaged, and set on fire. Ignoring {{the fact that he was}} flying over a field suitable for a forced landing, he kept on the course. After the bombs of his aircraft were released on the target, the fire in his ship became so intense as to make further progress impossible and he crashed into the target area. By his voluntary acceptance of a mission <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> extremely hazardous, and his assumption of an intrepid course of action at the risk of life over and above the call of duty, Maj. Jerstad set an example of heroism which will be an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E
