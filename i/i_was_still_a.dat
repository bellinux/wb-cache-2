5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> part of a mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E

There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E

His powers were thus {{initially}} assumed by a three-member Regency Council, which was chaired by Prince Muhammad Ali (son of the late Khedive Tawfiq Pasha and thus first cousin of King Farouk I) and also included Aziz Ezzat Pasha (a former Foreign Minister married to Behiye Yakan Hanem, another cousin of Farouk I) and Sherif Sabri Pasha (Farouk I's maternal uncle). The Council was formally sworn in on 8 May 1936 {{in front of a}} joint session of Parliament.

2500|$|Paxton {{decided to}} try some more {{elaborate}} recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, {{as well as his}} acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. [...] Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with The Things I Notice Now in the summer of 1969, and also charted with Tom Paxton 6 in the spring of the following year. [...] His song [...] "Whose Garden Was This", an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. [...] The diverse [...] "Baroque Folk" [...] experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. [...] Regarding this time, he said, [...] "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most... I know I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> kid from a small town in Oklahoma. [...] And I just wanted to hear folk songs." [...] Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.|$|E

60|$|It struck me, if I {{could get}} Marble to attempt practising {{a sort of}} ruse, it would have the effect to prevent his resorting to club-law, towards which I {{knew he had a}} strong natural disposition, and of which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> little afraid.

60|$|When I at last {{concluded}} with a loud note of joy, a long, involuntary suspiration in the darkening room told me that I had been listened to with profound interest; and, although no word was spoken, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> stranger and under a cloud, it was plain that the experiment had succeeded, and that for the present the danger was averted.|$|E
