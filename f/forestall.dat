5|$|Back in La Pointe, Buffalo {{took several}} actions to <b>forestall</b> and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US {{government}} {{for the next two}} years to no avail. They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of the debacle in Sandy Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E
5|$|By April 1917 Heseltine had again {{tired of}} London life. He {{returned}} to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, {{and made a}} partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to <b>forestall</b> a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, {{with whom he had}} decided he was, after all, in love.|$|E

5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, the Germans {{were well}} aware that British and Allied forces had begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece. The Luftwaffe made substantial attacks against these departure points {{in a bid to}} prevent or <b>forestall</b> an evacuation. On Sunday 20 April — Hitler's 52nd birthday — the Luftwaffe mounted mass attacks against Allied shipping in Piraeus Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In July 1970, {{troops from}} the 196th Infantry Brigade reoccuppied Khâm Đức as part of Operation Elk Canyon I and II to disrupt North Vietnamese {{logistics}} system in Quảng Tín Province and <b>forestall</b> a VPA offensive in the autumn and winter.

5|$|Liebenow {{writes that}} the head of the National Guard was arrested, along with others, in February 1963, to <b>forestall</b> an alleged coup, and that Tubman had {{announced}} that following the labour strikes of 1966, a foreign power had attempted to bribe army officers to stage a coup. In addition, Albert T. White, Commanding Officer of the LNG, was 'rusticated' by Tubman to become the Superindendent of Grand Gedeh in 1966, though he was later 'rehabilitated'.|$|E

5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to <b>forestall</b> publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to <b>forestall</b> Native American uprisings. The fort {{established}} a {{camp on the}} south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first non-native settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe, but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to <b>forestall</b> the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to <b>forestall</b> any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates tried to <b>forestall</b> the capital's {{fall to the}} Komnenoi by sending for Melissenos and asking him to enter the city and assume {{imperial}} authority. His envoys, however, were obstructed by George Palaiologos and never reached Melissenos. Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to Caesar and gave him authority over Thessalonica, as well as allotting the city's revenues to his income. At the same time, however, Alexios raised his brother Isaac Komnenos to the newly created dignity of sebastokrator, which he placed above that of Caesar, bypassing Melissenos.|$|E
5|$|Bramlette {{resigned}} his judgeship {{and accepted}} a commission as a {{colonel in the}} Union Army on August 7, 1861. In violation of Kentucky's agreement to remain neutral in the Civil War, he raised and commanded the 3rd Kentucky Infantry. On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to <b>forestall</b> a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge. A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to <b>forestall</b> the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918. She was based in Murmansk between March and September 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ferried Soviet troops to Pechenga on 3 May to <b>forestall</b> an attempt by White Finns to seize the town. On 14 November 1918 she was stranded in the Mersey Estuary, while {{under the control of the}} pilot, and later broke in two, becoming a total loss. The wreck had been broken up in situ by June 1919.|$|E
5|$|Following the secession of Virginia {{and that}} state joining the Confederacy, Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of {{northern}} Virginia. The move {{was intended to}} <b>forestall</b> any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate States Army to seize {{the capital city of}} the United States. Over the next seven weeks, forts were constructed {{along the banks of the}} Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.|$|E

5000|$|The Domesday Book {{recorded}} that [...] "foresteel" [...] (i.e. <b>forestalling,</b> {{the practice}} of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices) {{was one of three}} forfeitures that King Edward the Confessor could carry out through England. As early as 1321 {{the practice of}} <b>forestalling</b> was recognized as a specific offence and was regulated in London in the early twelfth century, and in other cities and towns, including goods coming by land or sea. However, originally the word itself was not used. In the laws of Henry I of England <b>forestalling</b> was the crime of assault on the highway, an offence against the King's Peace. It acquired the meaning of the marketing offence through the distribution of the regulations of the Marshalsea whose officers were empowered by Edward I of England to regulate trade in the shires. In time these regulations became known as the Statute of Forestallers, though probably never passed by any formal process. The laws provided for heavy penalties against <b>forestalling.</b> In practice the normal penalty was a fine, or, for repeated cases, exposure in the pillory.|$|R
