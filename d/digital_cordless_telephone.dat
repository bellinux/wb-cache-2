50|$|CT1+ {{provided}} in 1987 {{for a set}} of 80 additional channels using the same technical standard with 885-887 MHz used by the phones and 930-932 MHz used by the base stations. While not part of the original GSM-900 band, the frequencies do overlap with the extended GSM-900 band. Thus between the advent of <b>digital</b> <b>cordless</b> <b>telephones</b> and the desire to free up spectrum for mobile telephones, these frequencies are being withdrawn for use as well.|$|R
50|$|Wireless network {{equipment}} compatible with IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g standards use the 2.4 GHz {{section of the}} S band. Some <b>digital</b> <b>cordless</b> <b>telephones</b> operate in this band too. Microwave ovens operate at 2495 or 2450 MHz. IEEE 802.16a and 802.16e standards utilize {{a part of the}} frequency range of S band; under WiMAX standards most vendors are now manufacturing equipment in the range of 3.5 GHz. The exact frequency range allocated for this type of use varies between countries.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its major}} acceptance, 802.11g {{suffers from the}} same {{interference}} as 802.11b in the already crowded 2.4 GHz range.

Additionally, the success of the standard has caused usage/density problems related to crowding in urban areas. To prevent interference, there are only three non-overlapping usable channels in the U.S. and other countries with similar regulations (channels 1, 6, 11, with 25 MHz separation), and four in Europe (channels 1, 5, 9, 13, with only 20 MHz separation). Even with such separation, some interference due to side lobes exists, though it is considerably weaker.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- University {{professors are}} {{expected}} to hold down (at least) two main jobs- teaching and research, sometimes {{at the expense of}} performing less than optimally on one or the other. In this work-in-progress, we are exploring the concept of combining teaching and research activities in the classroom to improve quality and productivity in both areas. The combination is being addressed by incorporating research tasks and results into a product design course. The evolution of such courses is overviewed and references to web resources are provided for those interested in exploring the subject in more depth. Index Terms- teaching, teamwork, product design, research Over the past three years, the author has developed several courses designed to expose students to teamworking as well as the technical skills needed in developing sophisticated electronic products. Beginning in the Fall of 1997, he co-taught an advanced VLSI course in which different students designed different parts of a biomedical telemetry IC with baseband filtering, temperature sensing, and on-chip radio transmitter circuits. Several lessons were learned in this effort, including the realization that such large-scale, team-oriented projects are difficult to complete without meticulous planning and oversight {{on the part of the}} instructor. In the Fall of 1998, a new course was developed to teach teamworking skills through the design, construction, and testing of a complete 900 MHz <b>digital</b> <b>cordless</b> <b>telephone</b> in a single semester [1]. A class of 14 seniors and 5 graduates was divided into two competing ‘companies’, with each divided into four teams responsible for design of RF/frequency-synthesis circuits, digital PLD circuits, microprocessor software, and PC boards/packaging, respectively. Heeding lessons learned in the previous course, lectures and homework/project assignments were carefully planned and timed to keep the project on schedule, and students were assigned individualized, but coordinated and interdependent tasks. Although highly successful (both ‘companies ’ produced working designs, and student and employer critiques of the course were overwhelmingly positive [2]), course management and homework/project assignment creation consumed nearly all of the instructors’ time, leaving little available for research that semester...|$|E

An improvement of about 2 dB of the conversion gain is achieved without a considerable degradation of the other characteristics. The models used for noise figure, conversion gain and IIP 3 used are studied. This study describes the nature of trade-offs inherent in such structures and gives insights that help in identifying which structure is better for given conditions...|$|R

At present, it is not realistic to expect that wireless communication will decrease or disappear within the near future. That is why we currently are investigating the mechanisms behind these effects and the effectiveness of possible solutions. In order to be efficient and effective, we designed and validated a fast and easy test on ants - these insects being used as a biological model - for revealing the effect of wireless equipments like mobile phones, smartphones, <b>digital</b> enhanced <b>cordless</b> <b>telephone</b> (DECT) phones, WiFi routers and so on.

40|$|A novel {{scheme to}} access the basic rate service of the Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) using the <b>Digital</b> Enhanced <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) radio {{interface}} standard is presented.

The design of a state of the art interworking unit is described which endeavors to make the use of DECT transparent to the ISDN equipment. The complete design has been simulated and the results presented quantify the overall quality of the link for varying qualities of the radio channel. The simulation results show that DECT radio link can actually replace the fixed S-bus hence locating and relocating of terminal equipment is achieved and this can form the stepping stone for user locating in the 3 G (third generation) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).

40|$|GMSK is most {{prominent}} standards around the world. Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), <b>Digital</b> European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT), Cellular <b>Digital</b> Packet Data (CDPD), Digital communications {{system in the}} 1800 MHz band (DCS 1800 in Europe), Personal communications services in the 1900 MHz band (PCS 1900) in U. S., all use GMSK as their modulation format. The reason GMSK is used for GSM is its High spectral efficiency, MSK uses phase variation for modulation so better immune to noise. Non linear amplifiers are used to give better response and consumes less power so low battery usage which is an important parameter in cellular technologies. Gaussian Minimum Shift keying modulation scheme is a derivative of MSK. In GMSK, the side lobe levels of the spectrum introduced in MSK are further reduced by passing the modulating NRZ data waveform through a pre modulation Gaussian pulse-shaping filter. ISI degrade the performance of GMSK. In this paper we suggested the methods for reduction in the ISI. GMSK performance is improved by using optimum filters, Viterbi-adaptive equalization and soft decision Viterbi decoding...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, low-IF {{receiver}} {{planning for}} <b>Digital</b> European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) systems operating around 1. 9 GHz is described. A low-IF receiver architecture is chosen, since it allows {{a high degree}} of integration. Unlike zero-IF receivers, this architecture does not have a DCoffset or self-reception problem. The main features of the DECT system are presented, including the translation from the DECT system specification to RF circuit specification. Analytical expressions are presented for the noise figure (F) and the third order intercept point (IIP 3) of a multi-stage two-path system, which are verified by simulation. These calculations are important for the low-IF receiver planning, since it has an in-phase and a quadrature branch. In order to incorporate the A/D-converter in the receiver planning calculations, a formula is derived which translates the Integral Nonlinearity (INL) of an A/D-converter to the IIP 3 definition. In addition, the optimum IF frequency and selectivity distribution is considered, taking the A/D-converter requirements into account. A detailed description of receiver planning is given applied to the DECT system but the approach is suitable for other standards as well...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of a multi-standard, high image-reject front-end is presented. The front-end {{is designed to be}} used for <b>Digital</b> European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) systems and wireless communications systems, which oper-ate in the 2 4 GHz Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band (like Bluetooth). A double-quadrature low-IF architecture is chosen, because it can provide a high image rejection ra-tio (IRR) and a flexibility in terms of different systems. In the selected architecture, an RC polyphase filter is applied as an RF I/Q generator. Building block specifications are optimized in order to achieve two goals: a high IRR and a high sensitivity of the receiver. Assuming a mismatch of 1 % between the elements of the RC polyphase filter and 2 phase mismatch in the local oscillator path, a simulated IRR of 63 dB is obtained in the frequency range 1 8 2 5 GHz. In {{spite of the fact that}} the RC polyphase filter deteriorates the front-end noise figure (NF), a NF of 6 dB and a sensitiv-ity of 93 dBm for the DECT receiver has been achieved. 1...|$|R

40|$|The intelligent, adaptively {{reconfigurable}} wireless {{systems of}} the near future require programmable source codecs in order to optimally configure the transceiver to adapt to time-variant channel and traffic conditions. Hence we developed a programmable 8 - 16 kbits/s low-delay speech codec, which {{is compatible with the}} G 728 16 kbits/s ITU codec [1] at its top rate and offers a graceful trade-off between speech quality and bit rate in the range 816 kbits/s. The issues of robustness against channel errors strongly influenced the algorithmic design of the 8 - 16 kbits/s speech codec, and hence special attention is devoted to these issues. Source-matched Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codecs combined with un-equal protection pilot-assisted 4 - and 16 -level quadrature amplitude modulation (4 -QAM, 16 -QAM) are employed in order to transmit both the 8 and the 16 kbits/s coded speech bits at a signalling rate of 10. 4 kBd. In a bandwidth of 1728 kHz, which is used by the <b>Digital</b> European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) system 55 duplex or 110 simplex time slots can be created. Good toll quality speech is delivered in an equivalent bandwidth of 15. 71 kHz, if the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are in excess of about 18 and 26 dB for the lower and higher speech quality 4 -QAM and 16 -QAM modes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a mixer {{topology}} {{selection for}} a multi-standard high image-reject front-end is presented. The receiver {{is intended to}} work for <b>Digital</b> Enhanced <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) systems (at 1. 9 GHz and 2. 4 GHz) and for Bluetooth (at 2. 4 GHz). It will be implemented in 18 m CMOS technology. A double-quadrature low-IF architecture is employed because it can provide a high image rejection and flexibility for different standards. Building block specifications are optimized {{in order to achieve}} high image rejection and high sensitivity. Since the downconverter is the core of the front-end, it is necessary to select a high performance mixer topology that can provide low noise figure, high voltage gain, low power consumption and moderate linearity. Instead of simply using standard Gilbert cell and focus on its optimization, as it is quite often done in the literature, three mixer topologies, are examined. The evaluation is done analytically and by simulations with SpectreRF. A novel folded switching mixer topology achieves the best performance. With this topology the following simulation results are achieved: noise figure (NF) 14 dB, voltage gain (G) 17 dB, linearity (IIP 3) 1 dBm with a power consumption of 4 5 mW at the operating frequency of 2 5 GHz. Good matching between expected and simulated results is observed. A low voltage operation, which implies robustness for technology scaling, is also considered. At the end the final results are reported and the most promising topology is selected...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} has been {{the development of a}} low power, radio frequency transmitter architecture. Specifically, a technique for in service automatic calibration of a modulated phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer has been developed. Phase/frequency modulation is accomplished by modulating the feedback divide value in a phase locked loop frequency synthesizer. A digital precompensation filter is used to extend the modulation bandwidth by canceling the low-pass transfer function of the PLL. The automatic calibration circuit maintains accurate matching between the digital precompensation filter and the analog PLL transfer function across process and temperature variations. The automatic calibration circuit, which is the main contribution of this thesis, operates while the transmitter is in service. This online calibration eliminates the need for production calibration and periodic down time for calibration cycles. (cont.) In addition the calibration circuitry provides greater accuracy in the modulation than what is possible via offline methods of calibration. The calibration circuit works with M-ary GFSK as well as 2 level GFSK. The automatic calibration circuit has been implemented in two forms to prove its operation. The first version is a circuit board level implementation with a center frequency of around 60 MHz. The second implementation of the system is in a full custom 0. 6,Lm BiCMOS integrated circuit. The integrated circuit contains the complete synthesizer with automatic calibration and operates in the 1. 88 GHz frequency band used by the <b>Digital</b> European <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telephone</b> (DECT) standard.
