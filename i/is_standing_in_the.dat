5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of a torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album {{from the beginning of the}} video.|$|E
25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one skis and two ski poles. The para-Alpine ski configuration {{is sometimes called}} a 3 track. FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In para-Nordic, skiers compete with two skis and two poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiers in this classification may use outriggers. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base, and are fitted for the skier based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when the skier <b>is</b> <b>standing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E

2500|$|Six {{scenes from}} the life of Jesus {{continue}} on the Feasts tier to the right from the central axis of the iconostasis. These icons are the most eventful paintings of the whole icon screen. The first image, following the chronology, is the Nativity of Jesus, celebrated {{on the first day of}} Christmas, on [...] December 25. In the center of the painting the infant Jesus is resting in a manger. He holds a blue orb in his right hand. Joseph and Mary are standing behind the baby. There are seven shepherds around the manger, each of them coming to express their veneration for the divine baby. Three angels praise the infant Redeemer on the top of the icon. The next image depicts the baptism of Christ, celebrated on January 6 as Epiphany. Jesus <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> River Jordan in front of John the Baptist. John pours water upon Christ's head from a shell, while he prays to his Father. The Holy Spirit as a white dove appears in the background of the painting, above three ladies who are watching the baptism. The third icon illustrates the transfiguration of Jesus, celebrated on August 6. Christ is metamorphosed and becomes radiant upon a mountain in front of three of his disciples: Peter, James and John. On the icon Moses appears on Jesus' right, while Elijah is on his left. The three frightened apostles are lying in front of them. The next icon shows the entry into Jerusalem, which is celebrated on Palm Sunday, a week before Easter Sunday. Jesus arrives in Jerusalem on a donkey, which symbolizes his coming in peace rather than as a triumphal king arriving on a horse. The crowd scatters flowers in front of Christ. The next icon is the Ascension of Christ, which also appears on the central axis of the iconostasis between the third and fourth tiers. The last painting on the tier depicts the descent of the Holy Spirit, the feast of Pentecost. The Holy Spirit is rendered as a white dove on the icon, and flames appear above each apostle to encourage them. Mary is in the center of the composition, surrounded by 11 apostles - Judas is not present.|$|E

A strong-armed fellow is that constable; and each time that he flourishes his lash in the air, you see a frown wrinkling and twisting his brow, and, at the same instant, a smile upon his lips. He loves his business, faithful officer that he is, and puts his soul into every stroke, zealous to fulfil the injunction of Major Hawthorne's warrant, in the spirit and to the letter. There came down a stroke that has drawn blood! Ten such stripes are to be given in Salem, ten in Boston, and ten in Dedham; and, with those thirty stripes of blood upon her, she is to be driven into the forest. The crimson trail goes wavering along the Main Street; but Heaven grant that, as the rain of so many years has wept upon it, time after time, and washed it all away, so {{there may have been a}} dew of mercy, to cleanse this cruel blood-stain out of the record of the persecutor's life! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Scene is {{the stage}} of the theatre set for the dress [...] {{rehearsal}} of the little play: [...] "Orpheus with his Lute." [...] The [...] curtain is up and the audience, though present, is not supposed [...] to be. The set scene represents the end section of a room, with [...] wide French windows, Back Centre, fully opened on to an apple [...] orchard in bloom. The Back Wall with these French windows, is [...] set only about ten feet from the footlights, {{and the rest of the}} [...] stage is orchard. What is visible of the room would indicate [...] the study of a writing man of culture. ( [...] Note.--If found [...] advantageous for scenic purposes, this section of room can be [...] changed to a broad verandah or porch with pillars supporting its [...] roof.) In the wall, Stage Left, is a curtained opening, across [...] which the curtain is half drawn.

6000|$|Well, with {{break of}} day she wakes and sits {{up in bed}} and <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the room. So nimble was she in the mornings (one of our {{troubles}} with her) that these three actions must be considered as one; she is on the floor before you have time to count them. She has strict orders not to rise until her fire is lit, and having broken them there is a demure elation on her face. The question is what to do before she is caught and hurried to bed again. Her fingers are tingling to prepare the breakfast; she would dearly love to black-lead the grate, but that might rouse her daughter from whose side she has slipped so cunningly. She catches sight of the screen {{at the foot of the}} bed, and immediately her soft face becomes very determined. To guard her from draughts the screen had been brought here from the lordly east room, where it was of no use whatever. But in her opinion it was too beautiful for use; it belonged to the east room, where she could take pleasant peeps at it; she had objected to its removal, even become low-spirited. Now is her opportunity. The screen is an unwieldy thing, but still as a mouse she carries it, and they are well under weigh when it strikes against the gas-bracket in the passage. Next moment a reproachful hand arrests her. She is challenged with being out of bed, she denies it—standing in the passage. Meekly or stubbornly she returns to bed, and it is no satisfaction to you that you can say, ‘Well, well, of all the women!’ and so on, or ‘Surely you knew that the screen was brought here to protect you,’ for she will reply scornfully, ‘Who was touching the screen?’ ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, my friends, I {{ask your}} {{attention}} to this matter {{for the purpose of}} saying something seriously, I know that the Judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the Saviour is true, but he may allege that I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that in my application I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show that I do not misapply it. When he undertakes to say that because I think this nation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will all become one thing or all the other, I am in favour of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he argues erroneously. The great variety of local institutions in the States, springing from differences in the soil, differences {{in the face of the}} country, and in the climate, are bonds of union. They do not make [...] "a house divided against itself," [...] but they make a house united. If they produce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section, and this other section can supply the wants of the first, they are not matters of discord, but bonds of union, true bonds of union. But can this question of slavery be considered as among these varieties in the institutions of the country? I leave it for you to say, whether in the history of our government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house. I ask you to consider whether so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise with the same moral and intellectual development we have--whether, if that institution <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division? ...|$|E
60|$|Besides the peach-tree and the pet deer {{there was}} only one other thing that my boy could remember, or seem to remember, of the few years before he came to the Boy's Town. He is on the {{steamboat}} which is carrying the family down the Ohio River to Cincinnati, {{on their way to the}} Boy's Town, and he is kneeling on the window-seat in the ladies' cabin at the stern of the boat, watching the rain fall into the swirling yellow river and make the little men jump up from the water with its pelting drops. He knows that the boat is standing still, and they are bringing off a passenger to it in a yawl, as they used to do on the Western rivers when they were hailed from some place where there was no wharf-boat. If they were going down stream, they turned the boat and headed up the river, and then with a great deal of scurrying about among the deck-hands, and swearing among the mates, they sent the yawl ashore, and bustled the passenger on board. In the case which my boy seemed to remember, the passenger is a one-legged man, and he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yawl, with his crutch under his arm, and his cane in his other hand; his family must be watching him from the house. When the yawl comes alongside he tries to step aboard the steamboat, but he misses his footing and slips into the yellow river, and vanishes softly. It is all so smooth and easy, and it is as curious as the little men jumping up from the rain-drops. What made my boy think when he grew a man that this was truly a memory was that he remembered nothing else of the incident, nothing whatever after the man went down in the water, though there must have been a great and painful tumult, and a vain search for him. His drowning had exactly the value in the child's mind that the jumping up of the little men had, neither more nor less.|$|E
60|$|And {{speaking}} of purses, reminds one of another essential {{difference between the}} male and female human animal. A man carries his money in his pocket. When he wants to use it, he takes it out and lays it down. This is a crude way of doing things, a woman displays more subtlety. Say she <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street, and wants fourpence to pay for a bunch of violets she has purchased from a flower-girl. She has two parcels in one hand, and a parasol in the other. With the remaining two fingers of the left hand she secures the violets. The question then arises, how to pay the girl? She flutters for a few minutes, evidently not quite understanding why it is she cannot do it. The reason then occurs to her: she has only two hands and both these are occupied. First she thinks she will put the parcels and the flowers into her right hand, then she thinks she will put the parasol into her left. Then she looks round for a table or even a chair, but there is not such a thing in the whole street. Her difficulty is solved by her dropping the parcels and the flowers. The girl picks them up for her and holds them. This enables her to feel for her pocket with her right hand, while waving her open parasol about with her left. She knocks an old gentleman's hat off into the gutter, and nearly blinds the flower-girl before it occurs to her to close it. This done, she leans it up against the flower-girl's basket, and sets to work in earnest with both hands. She seizes herself firmly by the back, and turns the upper part of her body round till her hair is in front and her eyes behind. Still holding herself firmly with her left hand--did she let herself go, goodness knows where she would spin to;--with her right she prospects herself. The purse is there, she can feel it, the problem is how to get at it. The quickest way would, of course, be to take off the skirt, sit down on the kerb, turn it inside out, and work {{from the bottom of the}} pocket upwards. But this simple idea never seems to occur to her. There are some thirty folds at the back of the dress, between two of these folds commences the secret passage. At last, purely by chance, she suddenly discovers it, nearly upsetting herself in the process, and the purse is brought up to the surface. The difficulty of opening it still remains. She knows it opens with a spring, but the secret of that spring she has never mastered, and she never will. Her plan is to worry it generally until it does open. Five minutes will always do it, provided she is not flustered.|$|E

I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house.

If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it--restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave trade, thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread. The public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. But lately, I think--and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives--lately, I think that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery. And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South. Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where Washington and Jefferson and Madison placed it, it would be in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind would, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. The crisis would be past, and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the States where it exists; yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races.|$|E
