5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee. The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution. Seating in the Senate is by party, {{with the leaders of}} each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.|$|E

500|$|Henderson {{would not}} accept {{the end of his}} major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Further cracks {{appeared}} in the [...] "working partnership" [...] between Paul Brown and Modell before the 1962 season. Brown made a trade without informing Modell, giving up star halfback Bobby Mitchell to acquire the rights to Syracuse running back Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Davis was chosen by the Washington Redskins with the first overall pick in the 1962 draft, but while Davis {{was the first black}} player ever selected by Washington, team owner George Preston Marshall made the move only after being given an ultimatum to add an African-American player or risk losing his stadium lease. Davis demanded a trade, leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the Browns, who signed him to a three-year contract worth $80,000. As Davis was preparing for the College All-Star Game, however, he came down with a mystery illness and was later diagnosed with leukemia. Brown ruled Davis out for the season, but the running back returned to Cleveland and began a conditioning program after one of his doctors said playing football would not exacerbate his condition. Modell thought Davis could be prepared to play, and Davis, who by then knew he was dying, {{wanted to be part of}} the team. Brown, however, continued to insist that he sit out, driving a deeper wedge between him and Modell. Davis died the following May.|$|E

[...] A minority faction, led by Colvin R de Silva and Leslie Goonewardena, opposed the move but opted {{to stay within the}} Party. Another minority faction led by Edmund Samarakkody, Merryl Fernando, V Karalasingham and Bala Tampoe, left the party and formed the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Revolutionary)- LSSP(R).|$|E

The mob first attempted to push the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> fire into the room, though Joseph Smith and the other prisoners pushed back and prevented this. A member of the mob fired a shot through the door. Hyrum Smith was shot in the face, just to the left of his nose, which threw him to the floor. He cried out, [...] "I am a dead man!"

2500|$|Finally, with 180 deputies {{voting against}} and 170 voting in favour {{in the second}} vote, Rajoy's {{investiture}} attempt was defeated on 2 September. PP and C's clashed after Rivera chose to end their accord and suggested that the PP should propose [...] "another, more electable candidate" [...] instead of Rajoy, with both parties violently breaking up amid mutual recriminations on the investiture's failure and the pact's continuity. Meanwhile, Pedro Sánchez, during his speech, left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> try to lead an alternative government but in such an ambiguous way that, immediately after the vote, raised concerns among journalists and political parties—including his own—on what his actual intentions were.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{this has}} often left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> quackery perpetrated by {{individuals}} who had no training {{at all in the}} domain, but who wished to convey the impression that they did, for profit or other motives. [...] As the scientific method became increasingly recognized as the means to provide sound validation for such methods, the need for a way to exclude quack practitioners became clear, not only as a way of preserving the integrity of the field (particularly medicine), but also of protecting the public from the dangers of their [...] "cures." [...] Furthermore, even where overt quackery was not present, it was recognized that there was a value in identifying what actually does work so it could be improved and promoted.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the rumors that he might run for the 2012 presidential elections, Amr Moussa refused {{to rule out the}} {{possibility}} of running for the office, leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> expectations. He argued that, [...] "It's the right of every citizen that has the capacity and efficiency to aspire to any political office that would allow him to contribute to the service of his nation". He further stated to the press that the qualities required of the President also apply to Gamal Mubarak, arguing that the citizenship, rights and obligations which apply to himself can also be applied to Gamal. He also expressed appreciation for [...] "the confidence expressed by many people when they talk about his candidacy for the Egyptian presidency, and expressed that the message reached him.".|$|E
2500|$|After {{years of}} reunion rumours, Led Zeppelin {{performed}} a full two-hour set on 10 December 2007 at the Ahmet Ertegün Tribute Concert, with Jason again filling in on drums. Despite enormous public demand, Plant declined a $200million offer to tour with Led Zeppelin after the 2007 show. In interviews following the 2007 show, Plant left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> possible future performances with Led Zeppelin, {{saying that he}} enjoyed the reunion and felt that the show was strong musically. Although Page and Jones have expressed the strong desire to tour as Led Zeppelin, Plant has consistently opposed a full tour and has responded negatively to questions about another reunion. In a January 2008 interview, he stated {{that he does not}} want to [...] "tour like a bunch of bored old men following the Rolling Stones around." [...] In a statement on his web site in late 2008, Plant stated, [...] "I will not be touring with Led Zeppelin or anyone else for the next two years. Anyone buying Led Zeppelin tickets will be buying bogus tickets." ...|$|E
2500|$|PAL resumed {{operations}} on October 7, 1998 after {{an agreement between}} PAL employees and top management, reported to be facilitated by Philippine President Joseph Estrada, was reached, with services to 15 domestic points out of Manila. [...] On October 29, the flag carrier resumed international services with flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco, with other international services being restored three weeks later. Asian services resumed on November 11 with flights to Tokyo and Hong Kong. PAL gradually expanded its network {{over the next two}} months, restoring services to Taipei, Osaka (via Cebu), Singapore, Fukuoka, Dhahran, Riyadh and Seoul. With the aviation industry still in the doldrums, PAL continued to search for a strategic partner but in the end, it submitted a [...] "standalone" [...] rehabilitation plan to the SEC on December 7, 1998. The plan provides a sound basis for the airline to undertake a recovery on its own while keeping the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the entry of a strategic partner in the future. PAL presented the new proposed rehabilitation plan to its major creditors during a two-week marathon meeting that started on February 14 in Washington D.C. and ended on March 1 in Hong Kong.|$|E

2500|$|A further Covenanter {{military}} intervention began in 1643. The {{leaders of the}} English Parliament, worsted in the English Civil War, implored {{the aid of the}} Scots, which was promised on condition that the Scottish system of church government would be adopted in England. Following considerable debate, a document called the Solemn League and Covenant was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between England and Scotland which called for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland [...] "according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches", and the extirpation of popery and prelacy. It did not explicitly mention Presbyterianism and included some ambiguous formulations that left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> Independency. It was subscribed to by many in both kingdoms and also in Ireland, and was approved by the English Parliament, and with some slight modifications by the Westminster Assembly of Divines. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War. The Scottish armies in England were instrumental in bringing about the victory of the English Parliament over the King.|$|E
2500|$|While expressing {{regret for}} {{civilian}} casualties, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak blamed [...] "Hamas and those firing rockets at Israel," [...] his office {{said in a}} statement, pledging to continue the offensive to protect Israeli towns and cities. The Israeli army said it was targeting rocket squads, and blamed militants for operating in populated areas. Associated Press photos showed rockets being launched from densely populated areas in northern Gaza. On 5 March 2008, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office announced that Israel would maintain its pressure on Hamas. Olmert did leave the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> an unofficial truce with Hamas. [...] "If there is no rocket fire at Israel, there won't be Israeli attacks on Gaza," [...] he told reporters. Israeli government spokesman David Baker said Israel was [...] "compelled to continue to take these defensive measures" [...] to protect more than 200,000 Israelis living under the threat of Palestinian rocket barrages.Militants [...] "hide behind their own civilians, using them as human shields, while actively targeting Israeli population centers," [...] Baker said. [...] "They bear {{the responsibility for the}} results." [...] Israeli military spokeswoman Maj. Avital Leibovich called Saturday's action a [...] "pinpoint operation" [...] provoked by the rocket attack on Ashkelon earlier in the week. She blamed the high civilian toll on Hamas' practice of using homes to store and produce projectiles. [...] "We are not targeting homes and we have no intentions of targeting uninvolved civilians," [...] she said. [...] "We will target launchers and Hamas militants, and bunkers." [...] In Washington, National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe expressed regret for loss of civilian life on both sides but put most of the blame on the Palestinians. [...] "There is a clear distinction between terrorist rocket attacks that target civilians and action in self-defense," [...] he said in a statement.|$|E
