Many of the surfaces are polished and striated indicating movement has occurred; others show no evidence of movement. The black zone is commonly 1 - 2 mm thick. The surface skin of the black zone, less than 1 ttm thick, commonly consists of well oriented thin clay and biotite <b>flakes</b> <b>coated</b> with amorphous hydrous Mn-Fe oxides.

Intercalation effect of epoxy/montmorillonite composite system {{and the influence of}} the addition of montmorillonite on the glass transition temperature (Tg), mechanical properties and barrier of H 2 S to coating under high temperature and pressure conditions were investigated. The results showed that it was easy to intercalate epoxy resin into the organic montmorillonite layers, and the interlayer spacing of Montmorillonite was further swelled. In addition, the epoxy/montmorillonite nanocomposite coating with intercalated / exfoliated structures were prepared. Compared to pure epoxy coating, the heat resistance and mechanical properties of epoxy/montmorillonite nanocomposite coating were slightly improved, and the barrier efficiency to H 2 S was substantially increased under high temperature and pressure oil-gas environment. Epoxy coating {{is one of the most}} widely used anti-corrosive coatings.

40|$|Two-dimensional transition-metal-dichalcogenide {{semiconductors}} {{have emerged}} as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices with unprecedented properties and ultra-compact performances. However atomically thin materials are highly sensitive to surrounding dielectric media, which imposes severe limitations to their practical applicability. Hence for their suitable integration into devices, the development of reliable encapsulation procedures that preserve their physical properties are required. Here, the excitonic photoluminescence of WSe 2 monolayer flakes is assessed, at room temperature and 10 K, on mechanically exfoliated flakes encapsulated with SiOx and AlxOy layers employing chemical and physical deposition techniques. Conformal <b>flakes</b> <b>coating</b> on untreated - non-functionalized - flakes is successfully demonstrated by all the techniques except for atomic layer deposition, where a cluster-like oxide coating is observed. No significant compositional or strain state changes in the flakes are detected upon encapsulation {{by any of the}} techniques. Remarkably, our results evidence that the flakes' optical emission is strongly influenced by the quality of the encapsulating oxide - stoichiometry -. When the encapsulation is carried out with slightly sub-stoichiometric oxides two remarkable phenomena are observed. First, there is a clear electrical doping of the monolayers that is revealed through a dominant trion - charged exciton - room-temperature photoluminescence. Second, a strong decrease of the monolayers optical emission is measured attributed to non-radiative recombination processes and/or carriers transfer from the flake to the oxide. Power- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements further confirm that stoichiometric oxides obtained by physical deposition lead to a successful encapsulation.

The separated size fractions (< 0. 2, 0. 2 - 1. 0, and 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm) consist of illite (90 - 100 %) with small to minute amounts of chlorite and detectable quartz and feldspars in the coarser fractions. Scanning electron microscopic and transmission electron microscopic observations showed two types of illite morphologies: <b>flakes</b> <b>coating</b> detrital framework minerals and laths and fibers invading the pore space. The data points of most size fractions fit two isochrons, with slopes providing ages of 191 ± 8 and 178 ± 1 Ma, with initial 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios reasonably close to the atmospheric value.

40|$|Mud-silk, {{a fabric}} made in Southeast China {{and other areas}} of Southeast Asia, was {{recently}} identified in museum collections in Hawaii and Canada. The fabric is characterised by a glossy black or dark-brown surface finish, achieved by spreading iron-rich river mud on silk dyed with a tannin-rich dye. Still produced and used by fashion designers today, {{little research has been}} done regarding its specific preservation requirements. Museums in Hawaii and Canada found that until recently mud-silk had been unacknowledged or misrepresented in their collections, and it is likely that this is common in collections worldwide. As mud-silk becomes more widely known and comes to light in other collections, more information will be needed on its care and preservation. During a survey of mud-silk garments at the Royal British Columbia (BC) Museum, Canada, the author noted that one mud-silk jacket had a <b>flaking</b> surface <b>coating.</b> The coating was highly unstable, with tiny flakes detaching and shedding whenever the jacket was handled. While the problem was not common, it severely affected the preservation of and ability to handle the affected jacket. The pressing conservation needs of this mud-silk jacket sparked the current investigation, which aims to explore methods for consolidating a <b>flaking</b> mud-silk <b>coating</b> while minimally affecting the fabric’s flexibility and appearance. The paper aims to contribute to the conservation literature in two ways. Firstly, one conservation aspect of a little-researched, culturally significant Southeast Asian textile will be discussed and practical solutions provided. Secondly, research into the consolidation of a thin surface coating, similar to a paint film, on a flexible textile will add to research previously undertaken on the conservation of painted flags and banners. The techniques investigated will add to the toolkit of textile conservators faced with an unstable film on a textile, whether it is paint or another kind of surface finish, where it is imperative that the textile retains its flexibility. This paper will discuss attempts to recreate the flaking condition on non-damaged mud-silk. Description of consolidation tests carried out and results from these tests will show which consolidants and techniques are effective at stabilising a flaky surface film on a flexible textile. Special emphasis will be placed on consolidation application techniques (e. g. brushing or spraying) and solution properties (e. g. volatility), as these are areas that have not been well explored in textile conservation. Evaluations of the effect of successful consolidation methods on the flexibility and appearance of mud-silk will be discussed, with a view to providing options for the consolidation of flaky mud-silk while minimally affecting its physical properties. This will provide a practical solution to the conservation issue noted at the Royal BC Museum that can also be applied to other textiles with flaky surface films...|$|R

50|$|Another {{expression}} of Chicano identity through their art is their depictions {{of life in}} the barrio - Spanish-speaking, Latino neighborhoods in a city or town. Often the barrios, as ethnic enclaves, have long histories of dislocation, marginalization, poverty, and inequity in access social services. In the United States, barrios can also refer to the geographical “turf” claimed by Latino gangs, most commonly limited to Chicano gangs in California. However, it was in these barrios that the most interesting forms of art were made by the Chicano community, particularly lowrider cars and bicycles, and graffiti.A very popular style of car, even to this day, emerged from Chicano barrios, known as a “Lowrider.” A lowrider is a style of car that sits lower to the ground than most other cars. Many lowriders have their suspension systems modified with hydraulic suspension so that the car can change height at the flip of a switch. Lowriding originated in the 1930s and blossomed in Southwestern Chicano communities during the post-war prosperity of the ‘50s. Initially, youth who were dressed in the “pachuco” style would place sandbags in the trunk of their customized cars {{in order to create a}} lowered effect. However, this method was quickly replaced by lowering blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed frames and drop spindles. The go al was to cruise as slowly as possible so that people could see what types of customizations were done to your car. Lowrider customizations consist of sun visors, fender skirts, bug deflectors, and swamp coolers. Expensive custom paint jobs are also common such as metal oxide flake or pearl <b>flake,</b> clear <b>coat,</b> metal leaf, airbrushed murals or script, pinstripes, and flames. Gold or chrome spoke wheels or rims such as Astro Supremes, Cragers, Tru spokes, Crowns, Daytons and Zeniths are also common. Many cars have the modification of having suicide doors, or doors which open in the opposite direction to a standard car door, scissor doors that open vertically, or gull-wing doors that open towards the roof, swinging up. Since the early 1990s, lowriders have become common in urban youth culture in general, primarily in West Coast hip hop. The lowriding scene is diverse including many different cultures, vehicle makes and visual styles, however it remains an important part of the Chicano community and identity.|$|R

The desirable propertiesare high absorptance (α) of solar radiation and low emittance (ε) of thermalradiation. A surface with these properties is known as a solar selective surface. There are several techniques used to produce selective surfaces, {{but one of the most}} common ones is electroplating. Research done by Vargas, indicates that {{optical properties}} of α = 0. 98 and ε = 0. 03 [1], which is superior to the best commercial alternatives (α = 0. 95 and ε = 0. 04 [2]), can be achieved by electroplating a Co-Cr coating on a stainless steel substrate. Additionally, Vargas used an electrolyte of trivalent chromium dissolved in a deep eutectic solvent, as opposed to the traditionally used aqueous electrolytes containing hexavalent chromium, which is toxic and carcinogenic. In this project, a coating of Co-Cr was electroplated on a stainless steel substratewith a method similar to that of Vargas in order to obtain a solar selective surface. The electrolyte was composed of ethylene glycol, choline chloride, CrCl 3 • 6 H 2 O and CoCl 2 • 6 H 2 O in a molar ratio of 16 : 1 : 0. 4 : 0. 2. The plating process was conducted using chronoamperometric electrodeposition with an applied potential of - 1. 2 V (against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode) for 15 min. The system was investigated using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The total absorptance was measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy, while the emittance was measured using an IR-thermometer. The microstructure and chemical composition was investigated using Scanning ElectronMicroscopy (SEM), Focused Ion Beam (FIB), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The thermal stability of the coating was investigated by exposingit to 400 °C in air for 24 h.

In this study influence of compressive strength of cermet powders are studied using compressive strength tester manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation type MCT-W 500. Three Al 2 O 3 -Ni cermet powders with a different Ni content are sprayed on SUS 304 stainless steel and also WC-Co powder is used for comparison with their powders. Al 2 O 3 -Ni and WC-Co cermet powders are agglomerated powders. Kinetic Metallization System manufactured by Inovati, USA is used as cold spray equipment. Cold spraying using Al 2 O 3 -Ni powders are carried out in various spray conditions. With decreasing in the gas pressure, the coating thickness become thicker but the <b>coating</b> <b>flaked</b> off from substrate and we cannot get good coatings in each spray conditions. The compressive strength of powder particle for using cold spray is lower than WC-Co powder for HVOF but behavior of Al 2 O 3 -Ni and WC-Co powder is different in compressive test and compressive strength of WC-Co is lower than Al 2 O 3 -Ni one. It is clarified that compressive strength of powder particle influenced on cold spray process...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{applying}} ceramic coatings to wires {{were examined in}} depth and a fourth (chemical vapor deposition) was studied briefly. CVD coatings were not reported in the thesis because it was realized early in the study that the deposition rate of the coatings was too slow {{to be used in}} a commercial process. Of the methods reported in the thesis, slurry coating was the most promising. This method consists of slowly drawing a platinum wire through a thixotropic slurry of alumina in a vehicle composed of polyvinyl butyral, methyl ethyl ketone, and toluene. The coatings produced by this method were continuous and free of cracks after sintering. The sintered coatings crack when the wire is bent around sharp corners, but most of the coating remains in place and still provides electrical insulation between the wire and any metallic structure to which the wire may be attached. The coating thickness was 0. 61 mm (16 micrometers). The electrical resistivity of the intact coating was 340 M-Ohm-cm at 800 C and 23 M-Ohm-cm at 1050 C. Therefore, these coatings more than meet the electrical requirements for use in turbine engines. Although adherence of the coating to the wire was generally excellent, a problem was noted in localized areas where the <b>coating</b> <b>flaked</b> off. Further work will be needed to obtain good coating adherence along {{the entire length of the}} wire. The next most promising coatings were made by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of Al 2 O 3 onto platinum wires, using mixtures of ethanol and acetone as the suspending liquid. These EPD coatings were made only on short lengths of wire because the coating is too fragile to allow spooling of the wire. The worst coatings were those made by electrophoretic deposition from aqueous suspensions. Continuous slurry coating of wire was achieved, but due to lack of suitable equipment, the wire had to be cut into short lengths for sintering...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{wet sand}} {{blasting}} on coated cutting tool inserts has drawn {{interest to the}} tooling industry due to its positive effects on cutting performance and tool life. This performance boost has partly been attributed to the buildup of compressive residual stresses in the coating during the blasting process. However, the mechanism of forming residual stresses in ceramic coatings during sand blasting is not fully understood. This work utilize x-ray diffraction as the main tool to study the formation and relaxation of residual stresses after wet sand blasting and annealing on 001, 012 and 110 textured α-Al 2 O 3 coatings. To minimize the influence of stress gradients in the samples, all stress measurements were set up with a fixed analysis depth of 2 µm. Sand blasting was made with an alumina based slurry at 2, 3. 2 and 4 bar pressure and the anneal was done at temperatures from 400 to 1000 °C for 2 hours or more. The coating hardness was evaluated by nanoindentation. Finally, the activation energy for the relaxation of residual stresses was estimated using the Zener-Wert-Avrami function. The results reveal the highest compressive residual stress with up to - 5. 3 GPa for the 012 texture while the stresses for the 001 and 110 textures peaked at - 3. 1 and - 2. 0 GPa, respectively. Further, a hardness gradient was present after blasting of the 001 and 012 textured samples indicating a higher stress at {{the surface of the}} coating. The 110 textured sample is the most brittle resulting in <b>flaking</b> of the <b>coating</b> during sand blasting. The different deformation mechanisms are related to difference in active slip planes between coatings with different textures. Both the stress and hardness decreased after heat treatment and the activation energy for stress relaxation was found to be as 1. 1 ± 0. 3 eV, 1. 9 ± 0. 2 eV and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 eV for the 001, 012 and 110 textures, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Bellows-type thermal shields {{were used}} on the bi-stems of {{replacement}} solar arrays installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the first HST servicing mission (SMI) in December 1993. These thermal shields helped reduce the problem of thermal gradient- induced jitter observed with the original HST solar arrays during orbital thermal cycling and have been in use on HST for eight years. This paper describes ground testing of the candidate solar array bi-stem thermal shield materials including backside aluminized Teflon(R) FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) with and without atomic oxygen (AO) and ultraviolet radiation protective surface coatings for durability to AO and combined AO and vacuum ultraviolet (VOV) radiation. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) conducted VUV and AO exposures of samples of candidate thermal shield materials at HST operational temperatures and pre- and post-exposure analyses {{as part of an}} overall program coordinated by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to determine the on-orbit durability of these materials. Coating adhesion problems were observed for samples having the AO- and combined AO/UV-protective coatings. Coating lamination occurred with rapid thermal cycling testing which simulated orbital thermal cycling. This lack of adhesion caused production of <b>coating</b> <b>flakes</b> from the material that would have posed a serious risk to HST optics if the coated materials were used for the bi-stem thermal shields. No serious degradation was observed for the uncoated aluminized Teflon(R) as evaluated by optical microscopy, although atomic force microscopy (AFM) microhardness testing revealed that an embrittled surface layer formed on the uncoated Teflon(R) surface due to vacuum ultraviolet radiation exposure. This embrittled layer was not completely removed by AO erosion, No cracks or particle flakes were produced for the embrittled uncoated material upon exposure to VUV and AO at operational temperatures to an equivalent exposure of approximately five years in the HST environment. Uncoated aluminized FEP Teflon(R) was determined to be the most appropriate thermal shield material and was {{used on the}} bi-stems of replacement solar arrays installed on HST during SMI in December 1993. The SMI -installed solar arrays air scheduled to be replaced during MST's fourth servicing mission (SM 3 B) in early 2002...|$|R
50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to <b>flaking</b> of the <b>coating).</b> Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|R
