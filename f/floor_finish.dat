25|$|A most {{significant}} feature of Ponce High School is its two-story high, elongated auditorium, which {{also contains a}} generous stage area and a U-shaped wood mezzanine supported from the concrete ceiling. Its original lighting fixtures were removed and replaced by fluorescent ones. Classrooms are well lit and ventilated; there are many openings. Walls are plain, having been painted over and over throughout the years. The original wood <b>floor</b> <b>finish</b> is still retained in the library, the auditorium, {{and many of the}} classrooms; some have been substituted or changed to concrete. Hallways and stairs are paved in concrete. Vinyl flooring is used at offices. Glazed concrete tile is found at the lobby, where the original iron grilles, of geometrical design, are still in use.|$|E
50|$|PVC tiles: Polyvinyl {{chloride}} tiles -These {{are another}} commonly used <b>floor</b> <b>finish.</b> After the floor has been laid with screed, these tiles are fixed with adhesive. They are attractive, smooth and cool, and damage can be repaired very easily {{as they are}} made in small square size, usually 150 mm to 225 mm. Though due to poor workmanship and dust this type of <b>floor</b> <b>finish</b> fails through lifting.|$|E

50|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) tiles are {{a commonly}} used <b>floor</b> <b>finish</b> made from polyvinyl chloride. Due {{to the small}} size of the tiles, usually 150mm, 225mm and 305mm, any damage can soon be repaired by replacing individual tiles (as long as some spares are kept).|$|E
50|$|The {{floor is}} also beautifully done, {{with a fine}} and perfect finish.

40|$|Korean {{residential}} buildings have been airtight {{due to the}} energy economization plan since 1970 ’s energy crisis. As a result of this, the {{residential buildings}} have faced lack of ventilation and resulted in poor indoor air quality of buildings. In addition, recently gradually increased using of construction materials containing chemical components has made indoor air worse. International organization, government and public association have presented permissible emission standard of volatile organic compounds of construction materials and recommendation standard of indoor air quality in order to solve indoor air pollution problems. In Korea, the traditional floor heating system, ONDOL has been mainly used for house heating. However, the test method and standard of <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> materials has been established {{on the basis of}} air heating systems. Thus, the test method and standard of the <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> materials are necessary to be established with the consideration of different heating methods. Thus, floor heating chambers have been manufactured by us with the consideration of floor heating system. PVC and wood, generally used for <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> materials in Korea, are tested with floor heating chamber and we have compared and analyzed results of existing test. Further study with the consideration of the traditional heating system of ONDOL for the establishment of permissible emission standard of the <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> materials should be performed in the future...|$|R

30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> material or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare <b>floor</b> without <b>finishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cement screed: The {{concrete}} floor may be {{topped with a}} 25 mm thick cement and sand screed trowelled to a smooth finish. The usual mix is 1:3 and a colouring agent may {{be added to the}} mix to obtain a more attractive finish.

50|$|Similar to {{the disk}} style, square {{oscillating}} floor scrubbers use a flat pad to scrub the floor. The {{difference is that}} instead of spinning, it moves in a vibrating motion at a much faster speed. The square design allows for cleaning closer to walls and in corners. The high speed motion and down pressure also allow this style of floor scrubber head to be useful for removing <b>floor</b> <b>finish</b> from vinyl composite tile and well as prepare wood floors for refinishing. A specialized, abrasive pad is used for these procedures.|$|E

40|$|Floor {{structures}} and <b>floor</b> <b>finishes</b> in cubicle houses were studied {{in relation to}} emission of ammonia from the housings. Slatted floors and solid sloping floors with a central gutter, {{with or without a}} finish were investigated on an experimental farm. In a cow house three identical compartments with the various floor systems were studied. Floor systems in two compartments were compared with a conventional slatted concrete floor. The ammonia emission of each compartment was determined by continuously measuring the ventilation rate and the concentration of the ammonia in the exhaust air. The emission from the compartments with the solid floors was about 50 % of the emission of the compartment with the slatted <b>floors.</b> The <b>floor</b> <b>finishes</b> did not affect the emission of ammonia {{in a way that was}} statistically significant...|$|R
