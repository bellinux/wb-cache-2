5|$|The exosome {{has been}} shown to be {{inhibited}} by the antimetabolite <b>fluorouracil,</b> a drug used in the chemotherapy of cancer. It is one of the most successful drugs for treating solid tumors. In yeast cells treated with <b>fluorouracil,</b> defects were found in the processing of ribosomal RNA identical to those seen when the activity of the exosome was blocked by molecular biological strategies. Lack of correct ribosomal RNA processing is lethal to cells, explaining the antimetabolic effect of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, <b>fluorouracil,</b> and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or {{carboplatin}} or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with <b>fluorouracil</b> (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial – for example – compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused <b>fluorouracil</b> or capecitabine.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel-based {{chemotherapy}} {{has shown}} a very good response in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Docetaxel is the only taxane approved by US FDA for head and neck cancer, in combination with cisplatin and <b>fluorouracil</b> for the induction treatment of inoperable, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include bone marrow suppression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and psychosis. {{anaphylaxis}} and other allergic reactions occasionally occur. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is {{safe for the}} baby. Flucytosine is in the fluorinated pyrimidine analogue family of medications. It works by being converted into <b>fluorouracil</b> inside the fungus which then blocks its ability to make protein.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include <b>fluorouracil</b> and capecitabine. <b>Fluorouracil</b> is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Decreasing {{exposure}} to ultraviolet radiation {{and the use}} of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell skin cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as <b>fluorouracil.</b> Treatment of melanoma may involve some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. In those people whose disease has spread to other areas of their bodies, palliative care may be used to improve quality of life. Melanoma has one of the higher survival rates among cancers, with over 86% of people in the UK and more than 90% in the United States surviving more than 5 years. However, the researchers add that newer creams often do not contain these specific compounds, and that the combination of other ingredients tends to retain the compounds {{on the surface of the}} skin. They also add the frequent re-application reduces the risk of radical formation.|$|E
2500|$|Flucytosine is intrafungally {{converted}} into the cytostatic <b>fluorouracil</b> which undergoes further steps of activation and finally interacts as 5-fluorouridinetriphosphate with RNA biosynthesis thus disturbing {{the building of}} certain essential proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Chemotherapy is {{predominantly}} used for cases {{of breast cancer}} in stages 2–4, and is particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. The chemotherapy medications are administered in combinations, usually for periods of 3–6 months. One {{of the most common}} regimens, known as [...] "AC", [...] combines cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin. Sometimes a taxane drug, such as docetaxel, is added, and the regime is then known as [...] "CAT". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and <b>fluorouracil</b> (or [...] "CMF"). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms. However, the medications also damage fast-growing normal cells, which may cause serious side effects. Damage to the heart muscle is the most dangerous complication of doxorubicin, for example.|$|E

50|$|After {{being pulled}} from {{the market in the}} U.S. and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, {{levamisole}} has been tested in combination with <b>fluorouracil</b> to treat colon cancer. Evidence from clinical trials support its addition to <b>fluorouracil</b> therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect.|$|E
50|$|If {{cancer has}} spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which {{is the case with}} stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding {{chemotherapy}} agents <b>fluorouracil,</b> capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used. Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, <b>fluorouracil,</b> irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT. The drugs capecitabine and <b>fluorouracil</b> are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication while <b>fluorouracil</b> being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI. Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy. Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the two FDA approved ones are cetuximab and panitumumab.|$|E
