5|$|<b>Demographers</b> or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. <b>Demographers</b> study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. <b>Demographers</b> may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} {{deals with a}} problem quite {{different}} than the typical one facing most applied <b>demographers.</b> It involves the identification of a “population” using a set of criteria established by a regulatory agency. Specifically, criteria established by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission for purposes of Site Characterization of the High Level Nuclear Waste Repository proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Consistent with other recent studies, this one suggests that {{a wide range of}} skills may be needed in dealing with problems posed to applied <b>demographers</b> by clients and users in the 21 st century. As such, budding applied <b>demographers,</b> especially those nearing completion of their graduate studies, should consider adopting a set of skills beyond traditional demography...|$|R
25|$|In the 1930 census the German-speaking {{population}} of Czechoslovakia was 3,231,688, 22.3% {{of the total}} population. Polish <b>demographer</b> Piotr Eberhardt maintains that the figure for the German-speaking population in Czechoslovakia included 75,000 Jews in 1930.|$|E
25|$|Croatian <b>demographer</b> Vladimir Žerjavić, in 1992, {{estimated}} that around 70,000 {{people were killed}} at Bleiburg and during the death marches in 1945, including between 45,000 and 55,000 Croats and Bosniaks, 8,000 to 10,000 Slovenes and around 2,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} it would make Israeli Jews an ethnic {{minority}} in the only Jewish country.

25|$|Russian <b>demographer</b> Rybakovsky found a {{wide range}} of {{estimates}} for total war dead. He estimated the actual population in 1941 at 196.7 million and losses at 27–28 million. He cited figures that range from 21.7–46 million. Rybakovsky acknowledged that the components used to compute losses are uncertain and disputed.|$|E
25|$|Boris Sokolov – In 1996 Sokolov {{published}} {{a study that}} estimated total war dead at 43.3 million including 26.4 million in the military. Sokolov's calculations claimed that official population figures in 1941 were understated by 12.7 million and the population in 1946 overstated by 4.0 million, yielding 16.7 million additional war dead, bringing the total to 43.3 million. Russian <b>demographer</b> Rybakovsky dismissed these calculations as not being based on sound judgment.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, the non-Hispanic white {{population}} in Harris County is declining. Steve H. Murdock, a <b>demographer</b> with the Rice University Hobby Center for the Study of Texas {{and a former}} director of the U.S. Census Bureau, predicted that by 2040, Hispanic residents of the county will increase by 2.5million, while the number of non-Hispanic Whites will decrease by 516,000. This assumes that the net migration rate is equal to one half of that of 1990–2000.|$|E
50|$|Migration {{refers to}} the {{movement}} of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some pre-defined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent. Thus <b>demographers</b> do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While <b>demographers</b> who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore in demography, overdispersion {{is often}} {{evident in the}} {{analysis}} of death count data, but <b>demographers</b> prefer the term 'unobserved heterogeneity'.|$|R
40|$|The {{approaches}} used by <b>demographers</b> and by epidemiologists {{for studying}} the fecundity of couples (i. e. their ability to conceive) have converged, whereas they were historically divergent. Demography traditionally focused on fertility - {{the circumstances in which}} livebirths occur - with the aim of predicting population changes, in particular. <b>Demographers</b> also rapidly became interested in fecundity, developing concepts such as fecundability and definitive sterility. The measurement of fecundability is based on determination of the time to pregnancy (TTP), the basic tool of the epidemiologist. However, while <b>demographers</b> were developing methods for estimating the distribution of fecundability among couples based on TTP, epidemiologists turned to methods for analysing the role of diverse factors potentially influencing fecundity at the individual level.

25|$|B. Czechoslovakia - Polish <b>demographer</b> Piotr Eberhardt {{estimated}} that there were 75,000 German-speaking Jews in the Czech lands in 1930; he did not give a figure for Slovakia. Based on the May 1939 census in the Sudetenland there were – using Nazi terminology – full Jews 2,363; one-half Jewish 2,183; and one-quarter Jewish 1,396. 2,035 Jews in the Sudetenland were included with the German population in the West German figures used to calculate expulsion losses.|$|E
25|$|Sabin Manuilă (or Mănuilă; February 19, 1894 – November 20, 1964) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian statistician, <b>demographer</b> and physician. A {{nationalist}} activist during World War I, {{he became}} noted for his pioneering {{research into the}} biostatistics of Transylvania and Banat regions, {{as well as a}} promoter of eugenics and social interventionism. As a bio- and geopolitician, Manuilă advocated the consolidation of Greater Romania through population exchanges, colonization, state-sponsored assimilation, or discriminatory policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory is}} based on an {{interpretation}} of demographic history developed in 1929 by the American <b>demographer</b> Warren Thompson (1887–1973). Adolphe Landry of France made similar observations on demographic patterns and population growth potential around 1934. In the 1940s and 1950s Frank W. Notestein developed a more formal theory of demographic transition. By 2009, the existence of a negative correlation between fertility and industrial development had {{become one of the most}} widely accepted findings in social science.|$|E

25|$|While {{epidemic}} {{disease was}} a leading factor of the population decline of the American indigenous peoples after 1492, there were other contributing factors, all of them related to European contact and colonization. One of these factors was warfare. According to <b>demographer</b> Russell Thornton, although many lives were lost in wars over the centuries, and war sometimes contributed to the near extinction of certain tribes, warfare and death by other violent means was a comparatively minor cause of overall native population decline.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 {{the state}} <b>demographer</b> {{projected}} slow {{growth in the}} borough for the next twenty years. Cruise ship tourism has expanded rapidly, from approximately 230,000 passengers in 1990 to nearly 1,000,000 in 2006, as cruise lines have built more and larger ships—even 'mega-ships.' They have sailed to Juneau {{seven days a week}} instead of six, and over a longer season, but the cruising tourism is still primarily a summer industry. It provides few year-round jobs but stimulates summer employment in the city.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>demographer</b> Pini Herman, this {{circular}} migration {{has been an}} economic boon to Israel. Israel {{does not have the}} technological, academic, and other infrastructural resources to absorb its disproportionate number of highly trained and skilled population, second only to the United States. As a result, many Israelis have worked overseas for extended periods of time. Upon their return, they have often attracted or repatriated with them to Israel new infrastructure, such as that provided by companies like as Intel, Google, Microsoft, and IBM.|$|E

Moreover, even before Lexis and Verweij, Becker had constructed a slightly different diagram which was equally efficient ! Should we therefore talk about a Becker, a Lexis, a Verweij, or a Pressat diagram...|$|R
