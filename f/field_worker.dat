25|$|Daniel Baron (born 1949) is an American winemaker. He is {{best known}} for his work with the Duncan family-owned Silver Oak Cellars and Twomey Cellars, and is Director of Winemaking for both. Originally a <b>field</b> <b>worker</b> for John Rolleri at Chateau Montelena, he gained {{experience}} in the Bordeaux region of France and was mentored by the likes of grape geneticist Professor Harold Olmo, and winemakers Jean-Claude Berrouet and Justin Meyer. He became general manager of Christian Moueix's Dominus Estate in the 1980s. He became winemaker for Silver Oak, an exclusive Cabernet Sauvignon producer, in 1994, and was trained by Justin Meyer to follow in his footsteps as Silver Oak's winemaker before Meyer’s retirement in 2001. In 1999, Baron was instrumental in persuading the Duncans to establish Twomey to pursue Merlot, Pinot noir, and Sauvignon blanc after discovering high quality Merlot grapes on Silver Oak’s Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard. He has served on boards such as the American Society of Enology and Viticulture and the Napa Valley Wine Technical Group.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this anthropometric study was to {{determine}} whether conventional anthropometric databases of the US general population are applicable to the population of US electric utility <b>field</b> <b>workers.</b> Based on anecdotal observations, electric utility <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> seemed to be taller and larger than the general population. Fourteen anthropometric measurements were recorded from 187 male <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> from three US electric power utilities. The anthropometric data from <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> were compared to seven well-known conventional anthropometric databases for North American males, including Central American. In general, the male <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> were taller and heavier than the people in the reference databases for U. S. males. The <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> were up to 2. 3 cm taller and 10 to 18 kg heavier on average than the reference databases.

40|$|Objectives: The brick field {{industry}} {{is one of}} the oldest industries in India, which employs a large number of workers of poor socioeconomic status. The main aim of the present investigation is i) to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among brick <b>field</b> <b>workers,</b> ii) to determine the prevalence of respiratory disorders and physiological stress among brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> compared to control workers. Material and Methods: For this study, a total of 220 brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> and 130 control subjects were selected randomly. The control subjects were mainly involved in hand-intensive jobs. The Modified Nordic Questionnaire was applied to assess the discomfort felt among both groups of workers. Thermal stress was also assessed by measuring the WBGT index. The pulmonary functions were checked using the spirometry. Physiological assessment of the workload was carried out by recording the heart rate and blood pressure of the workers prior to work and just after work in the field. Results: Brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> suffered from pain especially in the lower back (98 %), hands (93 %), knees (86 %), wrists (85 %), shoulders (76 %) and neck (65 %). Among the brick-making activities, brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> felt discomfort during spading for mud collection (98 %), carrying bricks (95 %) and molding (87 %). The results showed a significantly lower p value < 0. 001 in FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC ratio and PEFR in brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> compared to the control group. The post-activity heart rate of the brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> was 148. 6 beats/min, whereas the systolic and diastolic blood pressure results were 152. 8 and 78. 5 mm/Hg, respectively. Conclusions: This study concludes that health of the brick <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> was highly affected due to working in unhealthy working conditions for a long period of time...|$|R

This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the availability and adequacy of environmental information resources to support <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> at the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa's (WESSA) four environmental education centres in KwaZulu-Natal. It begins by examining the environment, the environmental crisis and environmental education {{as a response to the}} crisis, before giving an overview of the history of WESSA. To provide a wider context within which to view the study, literature dealing with environmental education, environmental education centres in South Africa and environmental information was examined. A study population consisting of 18 <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> and eight management staff, based at the four environmental education centres, was surveyed by means of interviews. This allowed for selected attributes such as length of employment at the centre, highest education qualification and previous environmental education experience to be elicited from <b>field</b> <b>workers.</b> Other information asked ofthe population concerned available environmental information resources, the environmental information support required by <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> and the adequacy of this support to <b>field</b> <b>workers.</b> Results were then analysed. With the responses to the open-ended questions, content analysis was used to determine categories which were subsequently tabulated, together with the responses from closed questions. The results revealed that WESSA provides a number of ongoing, in-house training opportunities which expose <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> to environmental information resources; WESSA publications dominate the environmental information resources used during the training offield workers and consequently, during the preparation and conducting of courses by field workers; booklets, books and colleagues are considered valuable information resources by field workers; and there is a recognised lack of environmental information by both <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> and management staff. Recommendations for improving the environmental information resource support to <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> are made in light of the results of the survey and the literature review...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} ongoing challenges facing humanitarian and development organisations is the effective and efficient coordination of resources, projects and priorities. This is often complicated by real and perceived disconnects between and amongst <b>field</b> <b>workers,</b> headquarters and local needs. We believe that increasing transparency and dialogue through participatory mapping of projects may help to address these issues. We have designed aidWORK, a web-based desktop and mobile mapping platform that allows organisations to share current and planned projects. The tool also empowers <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> to geographically highlight and tag areas that they believe are not being targeted by existing work. This democratises organisational project planning; <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> on the ground can help staff in headquarters visualise what areas need to be targeted and in what manner. Moreover, if deployed simultaneously across multiple organisations, <b>field</b> <b>workers</b> {{will be able to}} use the map to connect with their nearby peers.

However, after his freshman year in college, he tested positive for mononucleosis, and was rejected for a second term as a lifeguard. Without a job, he drove to San Francisco with friends and settled in Sonoma County in 1968, and from 1971 he worked as a tractor driver and <b>field</b> <b>worker</b> under vineyard manager John Rolleri at Chateau Montelena. While working there he developed an interest in winemaking and was taught the basics of viticulture by Rolleri, who taught him how to plant, prune, and harvest. He enrolled at University of California Davis in 1974. Over four years he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in viticulture and enology. He received Highest Honors for his Bachelor of Science, Plant Science Major before obtaining a Master of Science in Horticulture. During his studies there he was mentored by grape geneticist Professor Harold Olmo. After graduation, Baron was employed as a vineyard manager and assistant winemaker at Navarro Vineyards in the Anderson Valley.|$|E
