5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations {{that is much}} simpler to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, {{which happens to be}} one of the only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E
5|$|In Pest Control, the player's vision <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{small area}} of the screen around the Accu-Sight {{crosshairs}} while looking for cockroaches that attempt to eat an on-screen pizza. Two different power-ups briefly illuminate the screen and clear all bugs onscreen. Later levels feature larger insects that contain bombs and small, fast bugs.|$|E
5|$|Characters can {{continue}} to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering {{the end of a}} multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E

5|$|Reproduction {{starts in}} November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest; the estrous cycle runs {{approximately}} 22days, while estrus lasts {{only a day}} or less. The mating season in this southern population <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed, {{but at the time}} this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E
5|$|The brolga {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the sarus crane, but the latter's red head-colouring extends partly down the neck, while the brolga's is confined to the head. The brolga is more silvery-grey in colour than the sarus, the legs are blackish rather than pink, and the trumpeting and grating calls it makes are at a lower pitch. Additionally, in Australia the range of the sarus <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few scattered localities in northern Australia, compared to the more widespread distribution of the brolga.|$|E

No other South American rainforest muroid rodent is known to have a similar distribution. Musser and colleagues reported it from three locations and Patton and others added a fourth; in some of those it occurs together with E.macconnelli or Hylaeamys megacephalus.|$|E
5|$|While Mary Celeste {{prepared}} to sail, another brigantine, the Canadian , lay in nearby Hoboken, New Jersey, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar. Her captain, David Morehouse, {{and his first}} mate Oliver Deveau, were Nova Scotians, both highly experienced and respected seamen. As captains with common interests, {{it is likely that}} Morehouse and Briggs knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who, on the evening before Mary Celestes departure, dined together, but the evidence for this <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> recollection by Morehouse's widow, 50 years after the event. Dei Gratia departed for Gibraltar on November 15, eight days after Mary Celeste, following the same general route.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also {{have a copy of}} Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number as opposed to a separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E
5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species ‚Äì in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, Stage mode, {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from‚Äîthe buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version‚Äîas they pass over the target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously; and Shooting Stars, which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the easiest to the hardest.|$|E
