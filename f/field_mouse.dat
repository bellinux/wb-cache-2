She is finally given shelter by an old <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> and tends her {{dwelling}} in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E

5|$|Japan {{has nine}} forest {{ecoregions}} which reflect {{the climate and}} geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese <b>field</b> <b>mouse,</b> and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.|$|E
40|$|Detection of {{non-target species}} during {{distribution}} surveys {{may influence the}} detection of the focal species, due to bait being consumed, or trapping devices inactivated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of non-target species (<b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> Apodemus sp.) on the detection and occupancy estimates of a target species (the red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris) during hair-tubes surveys. Following a modelling approach that accounted for imperfect detection of both target and non-target species, we tested the hypothesis that detection probability of the red squirrel is affected by detection of <b>field</b> <b>mice.</b> We also investigated the level of bias that occurred in estimation of key-parameters such as probability of presence and detection probability. Our results show that detection of red squirrels and <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> using hair-tubes surveys is not independent. Detection probability of the red squirrel was higher when <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> did not visit the hair-tubes. Nevertheless, there was no bias in parameter estimates, therefore relatively accurate estimates would have been obtained despite this interference...|$|R

5|$|The Skidi {{people of}} Native Americans saw {{the stars of}} Corona Borealis {{representing}} a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed their messages to the gods, {{as well as how}} chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters, who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies the youngest and most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> to get close to her. They married though she later returned to the sky, with her heartbroken husband and son following later. The Mi'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as Mskegwǒm, the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland {{have resulted in}} a depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and house mouse are two of only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, of which there are three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400). It is possible that Apodemus was introduced from Orkney where a population has existed since at the least the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Two {{wild animal}} taxa {{are unique to}} St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis), which is a {{subspecies}} of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of house mouse known as the St Kilda house mouse (Mus musculus muralis), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It {{had a number of}} traits in common with a sub-species (Mus musculus mykinessiensis) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) now breeds on Hirta but did not do so before the 1930 evacuation.|$|E

25|$|The larger megafauna {{which once}} {{inhabited}} the High Alleghenies—elk, bison, mountain lion—were all exterminated during the 19th century. They survived longer in this area, however, {{than in other}} parts of the eastern United States. Naturalist John James Audubon reported that by 1851 a few eastern elk (Cervus canadensis canadiensis) could still be found in the Alleghany Mountains but that by then they were virtually gone from the remainder of their range. Mammals in the Allegheny region today include whitetail deer, chipmunk, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, opossum, weasel, <b>field</b> <b>mouse,</b> flying squirrel, cottontail rabbit, gray foxes, red foxes, gray squirrels, red squirrels and a cave bat. Bobcat, snowshoe hare, wild boar and black bear and coyote are also found in the forests and parks of the Alleghenies. Mink and beaver are much less often seen.|$|E

50|$|The last {{remaining}} human inhabitants of St Kilda abandoned the islands on 29 August 1930. Thereafter the mice that survived, even those occupying houses {{abandoned by the}} St Kildans, were <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> that had moved into the houses from the hills. The islands' house mice could not survive the harsh conditions {{for more than two}} years after the archipelago was abandoned by its human population. The islands currently have temporary human habitations. While <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> are widespread on Hirta, their concentration is more pronounced in the old village areas where holes provide access into buildings. Though rarely observed by casual visitors, the mouse is actually very common, and is present in every part of the habitat, from the harbour to the highpoint. The <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> can survive by eating snails, insects, moss and seeds, can feed on the carcasses of dead sheep and birds, and will also readily eat food brought in by visitors and intended for their own consumption.|$|R

2500|$|Mousey (voiced by Jane Bassett) - Mousey is an {{anthropomorphic}} talking mouse {{who lives}} under the floorboards {{of the flat}} that Bodger rents from Series 5-7. She and Badger are great friends, both constantly getting up to mischief. Mousey's presence is only known by Bodger in the first episode of Series 5 when he sets traps to try to catch her. After Badger makes friends with Mousey, he deceives Simon into believing Mousey has gone from the house. When Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford to run their hotel in Series 8, Mousey moves with them and takes up residence in the airing cupboard rather than under the floorboards. Even though Badger is known to several of the human characters, Mousey is kept a secret from everyone, although Mrs Dribelle spots her on two occasions in Bodger's flat and Mrs Melly on one occasion who tried to capture {{her when she was}} disguised as a rare bird to fool Miss Piper. She appears to be a fan of royalty, especially in the episode [...] "Mrs. Dribelle and The Queen" [...] where she thinks she's going to live in Buckingham Palace with the Queen unaware that it is Mrs. Dribelle in disguise. When Mousey speaks, it is clear Badger understands her perfectly, however in episode 1 of series 5 it is implied Bodger can only interpret her language as the normal squeaking of a <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> or house mouse.|$|E

60|$|To {{show you}} how remarkably {{indirect}} may be such natural selective agencies as I have referred to, I will conclude by noticing a case mentioned by Mr. Darwin, and which {{is certainly one of}} the most curious of its kind. It is that of the Humble Bee. It has been noticed that there are a great many more humble bees in the neighbourhood of towns, than out in the open country; and the explanation of the matter is this: the humble bees build nests, in which they store their honey and deposit the larvae and eggs. The <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> are amazingly fond of the honey and larvae; therefore, wherever there are plenty of <b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> as in the country, the humble bees are kept down; but in the neighbourhood of towns, the number of cats which prowl about the fields eat up the <b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> and of course the more mice they eat up the less there are to prey upon the larvae of the bees--the cats are therefore the INDIRECT HELPERS of the bees! [2] Coming back a step farther we may say that the old maids are also indirect friends of the humble bees, and indirect enemies of the <b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> as they keep the cats which eat up the latter! This is an illustration somewhat beneath the dignity of the subject, perhaps, but it occurs to me in passing, and with it I will conclude this lecture.|$|R
