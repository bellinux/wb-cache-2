40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{technology}} {{in the classroom is}} a significant issue for teachers as they are under increasing pressure to teach in technologically mediated ways. This ‘digital turn’ in education has culminated in the Australian federal government’s <b>Digital</b> Education <b>Revolution,</b> which represents a multi-billion dollar commitment to putting computers in schools and the implementation of technological pedagogical practice. This paper focuses on the confluence between globalised economic process, the <b>Digital</b> Education <b>Revolution,</b> and the discourse of the digital native; and describes the way in which students’ use of digital technologies is identity forming. I examine the <b>Digital</b> Education <b>Revolution</b> policy and related discourse in order to sketch out some of the educational implications. Drawing upon Giroux’s (2004) notion of ‘public pedagogy’ I argue that using digital technologies could potentially open up an educative space to allow students to author their own digital identity. While the <b>Digital</b> Education <b>Revolution</b> {{is a product of the}} influence of globalisation upon education, it, nonetheless, contains contradictory prohibitions and possibilities that can be utilised to take the use of digital technology beyond that of preparing students for work in a globalised information economy...|$|R

25|$|Launched in 2003 under Nanakshahi Trust, the Punjab Digital Library was {{a result}} of the early phase of the <b>digital</b> <b>revolution</b> in Punjab.

In the shadow of search engines, a Semantic Web approach conceived in the early 2003 reached maturity in 2006. This was when the organisation planned to expand its operations from a mere three-employee organisation to one of the leading NGOs working in the field of digital preservation all over India.|$|E
40|$|This article revises Foucault’s {{account of}} biopolitics {{in the light}} of the impact of the {{molecular}} and <b>digital</b> <b>revolutions</b> on ‘the politics of life itself’. The confluence of the molecular and <b>digital</b> <b>revolutions</b> informationalizes life, providing an account of what it is to be a living thing in terms of complex adaptive and continuously emergent, informationally constituted, systems. Also revisiting Foucault’s The Order of Things and its interrogation of the modern analytics of finitude, the article argues that our contemporary politics of life is therefore distinguished by the quasi-transcendentals that now distinguish informationalized life: circulation, connectivity and complexity. Here, too, the article argues, the figure of Man, which once united the quasi-transcendentals of life, labour and language, is replaced by the contingency that now unites circulation, connectivity and complex-ity. Observing that a life of continuous emergence is also one in which production is continuously allied with destruction, such a life is lived as the continuous emergency of its own emergence. This account of contemporary biopolitics, together with its emergency of emergence, contrasts, in particu-lar, with that offered by Agamben in his appropriation of Schmitt.

Then a different attempt of developing a so-called on-line conferencing ba is made to facilitate the intensive knowledge activities by pushing augmented information acquired {{by a variety of}} linkage mining to reveal the constructive concepts of the concerned discipline, research interest groups, and correspondence between authors and ideas or topics together with basic functions in data management as general conferencing system. Such endeavors aim to exhibit different perspectives of the concerned disciplines and support emergence of a ba for knowledge creation. I...|$|R
