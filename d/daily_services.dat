At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three {{intermediate}} stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone, in part because Norwegians were willing to pay more, and in part because the sales system in Sweden was more automated.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 <b>daily</b> <b>services</b> along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the {{eastbound}} platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the airline}} transported 14,000 people {{and had a}} revenue of NOK17 million, {{allowing}} Krohn Air to break even.

5|$|In July 2003, Linx {{reduced the}} number of <b>daily</b> <b>services</b> from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four. The company stated that this was because of {{insufficient}} ridership. Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports. With shorter travel time from center to center and comparable fares, Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx.|$|E

At the same time, Braathens SAFE announced that the airline would start selling more discounted tickets on the London-flights, to compete with Ryanair's new route from Stanstad to Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|The vicar from 1842 to 1892 was Thomas Chamberlain (later {{founder of}} St Edward's School), {{a firm believer}} in the Tractarian movement, who {{introduced}} <b>daily</b> <b>services</b> as well as such ritualist practices as altar candles and the wearing of Eucharistic vestments – the latter causing him to be rebuked by Bishop Wilberforce in 1855.

In the early days of the movement, Anglo-Catholicism was closely associated with St Thomas'. In 1847 Chamberlain founded the Community of St Thomas Martyr, which was devoted to the assistance of the poor of the parish, by now heavily slumland; this sisterhood remained active until 1958. The convent buildings for it were built in 1886, but have since been demolished.

The blocked tower arch and two blocked windows in the chancel were opened and a new chancel arch was built.|$|E
