500|$|The Cold War trappings {{made the}} match a media sensation. It was called [...] "The Match of the Century", and {{received}} front-page media {{coverage in the}} United States and around the world. Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players had dominated for the previous quarter-century; players closely identified with, and subsidized by, the Soviet state. Kasparov remarked, [...] "Fischer fits ideologically into {{the context of the}} Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it". Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory [...] "the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire". Fischer's sister observed, [...] "Bobby <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship".|$|E
500|$|According to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was {{a pioneer}} in several ways. [...] "Thanks {{in large part to}} Nadezhda von Meck", Wiley writes, [...] "he became the first {{full-time}} professional Russian composer." [...] This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style. He made an impact not only in absolute works such as the symphony but also in program music and, as Wiley phrases it, [...] "transformed Liszt's and Berlioz's achievements ... into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import." [...] Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> without a native school of composition upon which to fall back. They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook. He was, they write, {{for all intents and purposes}} alone in his artistic quest.|$|E

500|$|Several scenes {{within the}} film depict violence, torture and cruelty toward animals, leading to {{controversy}} and censorship attempts {{upon completion of}} the film. Most of these scenes took place during the raid of Vladimir, showing for example the blinding and the torture of a monk. Most of the scenes involving cruelty toward animals were simulated. For example, during the Tatar raid of Vladimir a cow is set on fire. In reality the cow had an asbestos-covered coat and was not physically harmed; however, one scene depicts the real death of a horse. The horse falls from a flight of stairs and is then stabbed by a spear. To produce this image, Tarkovsky injured the horse by shooting it in the neck and then pushed it from the stairs, causing the animal to falter and fall down the flight of stairs. [...] From there, the camera pans off the horse onto some soldiers to the left and then pans back right onto the horse, and we see the horse struggling to get its footing having fallen over on its back before being stabbed by the spear. [...] The animal was then shot in the head afterward off camera. This was done to avoid the possibility of harming what was considered a lesser expendable, highly prized stunt horse. The horse was brought in from a slaughterhouse, killed on set, and then returned to the abattoir for commercial consumption. In a 1967 interview for Literaturnoe obozrenie, interviewer Aleksandr Lipkov suggested to Tarkovsky that [...] "the cruelty in the film is shown precisely to shock and stun the viewers. And this may even repel them." [...] In an attempt to downplay the cruelty Tarkovsky responded: [...] "No, I don't agree. This does not hinder viewer perception. Moreover we <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> quite sensitively. I can name films that show much more cruel things, compared to which ours looks quite modest." ...|$|E
