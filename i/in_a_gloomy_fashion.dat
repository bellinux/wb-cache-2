60|$|Ursula {{went forward}} to the teachers' room that burrowed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> hole. She knocked timidly.|$|R
6000|$|Eugene (who {{would seem}} to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> state of suggestiveness), suggests, 'Suppose you have no means and live beyond them?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} written,' replied Arundel, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> voice, {{and with a}} {{changing}} countenance, 'and therefore will not trouble you. And yet----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' she answered, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> voice. 'All slatterns, my dear; all slatterns! Brought up in pig-sties. I wouldn't let {{one of them}} {{touch my}} hair for thousands.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I been a fool, Ann," [...] he said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> monotone. [...] "I been a brasted fool. But it's 'ard on us, all the same. It's 'ard." ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped. The nigger waited awhile, then said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> tone:--"You would.... What? Go an' fight {{another such}} one as yourself. Leave me alone. It won't be for long. I'll soon die.... It's coming right enough!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, 'twas Andrew," [...] said Jacob's son Billy, a {{child of}} forty, or thereabouts, who {{manifested}} the peculiarity of possessing <b>a</b> cheerful soul <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> body, and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here and there.|$|R
60|$|But Asad did not respond. He {{sat there}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> abstraction, staring {{straight}} before him. At last he sighed wearily. He was just, {{and he had}} a conscience, as odd a thing as it was awkward <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corsair Basha.|$|R
50|$|The band's main {{influences}} include Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Cabaret Voltaire, KMFDM, and Ministry. The band performs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy,</b> aggressive, and yearning mood. They {{are considered}} to have the styles of: heavy metal alternative, Indie Rock, Industrial Metal, etc.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This,' {{said the}} man, {{stopping}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> passage where <b>a</b> couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--'this {{is the place}} he passes through. If you step this way, {{you can see the}} door he goes out at.' ...|$|R
60|$|This he {{proceeded}} to do. Fascinated, I listened with a sickening sensation. It was <b>a</b> mild afternoon <b>in</b> spring, and we stood in the deep limestone gutter {{in front of the}} parsonage, a little Gothic wooden house set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> yard.|$|R
60|$|A light tap woke {{me in the}} sunlight, and {{a lighter}} voice. Mr. Rochester took breakfast with us <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> old dressing-room, moody and taciturn, unpacified by sleep. But Jane, {{whimsical}} and deft, had tied <b>a</b> yellow ribbon <b>in</b> the darkness of her hair.|$|R
50|$|Hannah and the {{mistress}} flee the plantation {{in the middle}} of the night, become lost, and stay the night <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> shack <b>in</b> the forest. The shack was recently the scene of a murder, and is strewn with bloodstained weapons and clothes. Under these conditions, Hannah's mistress starts to go insane.|$|R
5000|$|Arthur {{does not}} {{materialise}} with Ford and Slartibartfast, but elsewhere, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> room, with signs such as [...] "DO NOT BE ALARMED. BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT". The episode ends on a cliff-hanger, with the previously unintroduced character of Agrajag saying [...] "Bet you weren't {{expecting to see}} me again." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{video clip}} for [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] is set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> forest where Richards {{and the band}} perform. Plastic animals like deer and bears are seen passing by the band. The clip's {{atmosphere}} is very dreary and mysterious, represented by the band's clothes, instruments and the sky in grey.|$|R
60|$|He dwelt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> cavern {{on the top}} of the mountain, {{and used}} to wade over to the {{mainland}} in search of prey; when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist, and march back to his own abode.|$|R
50|$|A lonely senior lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> {{and dirty}} factory town and dedicates himself to {{caring for a}} small potted plant on his balcony. The world around him is dying, as is the flower on his plant. One day he {{receives}} <b>a</b> mysterious box <b>in</b> the mail, one which enables him to have impacting effects on his surroundings.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} of that day the Caves seem to have {{exhausted}} their emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had {{been out in the}} afternoon, supped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the previous days. For some time matters were very badly strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor customer reappeared.|$|R
60|$|That same {{afternoon}} {{a band of}} Indians {{belonging to}} the Blackfeet tribe encamped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> defile of the Rocky Mountains, not far from Mac's Fort. It {{was easy to see}} that they were a war-party, for, besides being armed to the teeth, their faces were hideously painted, and they had no women or children with them.|$|R
60|$|Marco {{thought that}} {{this would not be}} a very severe punishment, but he found, in {{enduring}} it, that it was in fact much more severe than he had imagined. He got very tired indeed, long before the forenoon was out. He concluded that solitary imprisonment for years, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> dungeon, must be a terrible punishment indeed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> {{frame of}} mind he sat down to write to Bob, who was playing {{regularly}} for the Varsity this season, and only the previous week had made a century against Sussex, so {{might be expected to}} be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently softened mood to advance the needful. (Which, it may be stated at once, he did, by return of post.) ...|$|R
60|$|After supper {{one evening}} {{they sat in}} the lobby of their shabby hotel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> mood. Jimmy had found {{temporary}} work, and since early morning had been loading a vessel with lumber <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pouring rain. All day he had been wet through, and he was tired and sore. He had grown thin, and had a gaunt, determined look.|$|R
5000|$|After Nemtsov's death, Leonid Bershidsky {{recalled}} {{meeting him}} in 1992 {{during his tenure}} as governor. [...] "A brilliant young physicist", recounted Bershidsky, [...] "he was trying to practice liberal economics <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> Soviet-era industrial city that had long been off-limits to foreigners." [...] Bershidsky described his eloquence and demeanor as that of [...] "a Hollywood movie politician transplanted into the Russian hinterland." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHAPTER XXVIII [...] Nor board nor garner own we now, [...] Nor roof nor latched door, [...] Nor kind mate, bound, by holy vow, [...] To bless a good man's store [...] Noon lulls us <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> den, [...] And {{night is}} grown our day; [...] Uprouse ye, then, my merry men! [...] And {{use it as}} ye may ...|$|R
60|$|To {{the devil}} lore of the county, however, the theory {{certainly}} will apply, for surely it is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> gorge, through which forked lightnings flash and chase each other, and the thunder rolls and reverberates, or {{on a dark}} and lonesome moor, rather than upon the shady side of Pall Mall, {{one would expect to}} meet the Evil One.|$|R
50|$|After 2000, Skyworth {{experienced}} problems {{resulting from}} such quick expansion. It shuttered a small appliances unit {{and sold to}} creditors an 80% equity stake in its newly minted mobile phone subsidiary for a nominal sum. The firm has experienced lower sales and tighter margins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sector that {{has been slow to}} bring out new products. Greener LED TVs are seen as <b>a</b> bright spot <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> market.|$|R
60|$|He {{pushed the}} door open with difficulty. They found {{themselves}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> chamber, with vaulted roof and stone floor. A faint streak of daylight from <b>an</b> opening somewhere <b>in</b> the roof, partially lit the place. Here, too, the walls were damp and the odour appalling. There were some fragments of broken barrels at one end, and <b>an</b> oak table <b>in</b> the middle of the floor. Jeanne looked round and shivered.|$|R
60|$|And yet, {{while that}} spirit of general extravagance seemed at work over a whole kingdom, another and very {{different}} sort of men were gradually forming the staid and resolved characters, which afterwards displayed themselves during the civil wars, and powerfully regulated and affected {{the character of the}} whole English nation, until, rushing from one extreme to another, they sunk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> fanaticism the splendid traces of the reviving fine arts.|$|R
60|$|I had {{scarcely}} {{had time}} to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning to get down, {{as if we were}} going to stop presently. And stop we presently did, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> street, at certain offices with an open door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.|$|R
60|$|The {{shrinking}} of her auditress {{stopped her}} for <b>a</b> moment <b>in</b> her flow of words, delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> retrospective <b>gloomy</b> voice.|$|R
60|$|When one stands {{where the}} Saviour was crucified, {{he finds it}} all he {{can do to keep}} it {{strictly}} before his mind that Christ was not crucified <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Catholic Church. He must remind himself every now and then that the great event transpired in the open air, and not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy,</b> candle-lighted cell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little corner of a vast church, up-stairs --a small cell all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation, in execrable taste.|$|R
6000|$|There, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> hollow glen, {{she found}} [...] A little cottage built of sticks and reeds, [...] In homely wise, and wall'd with sods around, [...] <b>In</b> which <b>a</b> witch did dwell in loathly weeds, [...] And wilful want, all {{careless}} of her needs, [...] So choosing solitary to abide [...] Far from all neighbours, that her devilish deeds, [...] And hellish arts, from people she might hide, [...] And hurt far off, unknown, whomsoever she espied.|$|R
50|$|Magnasco's {{style is}} strikingly {{original}} and transcends the tired, academic Baroque that epitomized much of contemporary Genoese art. Ultimately, his work {{may have influenced}} Marco Ricci, Giuseppe Bazzani, Francesco Maffei, and the famed painters de tocco (by touch) Gianantonio and Francesco Guardi in Venice. But for these Rococo painters, the loose brush became a tool for frothy landscapes, capricious historical scenography, and decorative frolics, while for Magnasco, {{it seemed to have}} entrapped his reality <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> cobweb.|$|R
50|$|Strasburgeria robusta is an {{evergreen}} {{tree with}} large toothed leaves and large but rather inconspicuous, single, pendulant flowers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> colorscheme of yellowish with brown markings, with about ten sepals, five petals, ten stamens, a very distinct circular nectar gland with radiating spikes and rather large globular fruits {{with a long}} persistent style, with a scent reminiscent of apples, which is endemic to New Caledonia. It is the only recognized species of the genus Strasburgeria.|$|R
60|$|I {{penetrated}} {{the recesses of}} the mystic grove. There stood the ancient and much slandered statues, overshadowed by tall larches, and stained by dank green mold. It {{is not a matter}} of surprise that strange figures, thus behoofed and be-horned, and set up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> grove, should perplex the minds of the simple and superstitious yeomanry. There are many of the tastes and caprices of the rich, that in the eyes of the uneducated must savor of insanity.|$|R
