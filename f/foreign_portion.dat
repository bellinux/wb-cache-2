40|$|This article {{examines}} the input choices for producers who assemble their goods abroad and imported them to the United States through the U. S. Overseas Assembly Provisions. Three findings emerge. First, firms reduce their use of foreign parts and assembly when foreign costs rise, but only with a lag. In contrast, recent foreign cost increases boost the <b>foreign</b> <b>portion</b> of final product value. Second, the effects of cost changes are more pronounced for U. S. outsourcing imports from developing countries. Finally, the degree of production responsiveness differs with industry capital intensity and is the greatest for low-capital intensity projects performed in non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) locations.

50|$|Since the 1980s {{the number}} of educated Americans has {{continued}} to grow, but at a slower rate. Some have attributed this {{to an increase in}} the <b>foreign</b> born <b>portion</b> of the workforce. However, the decreasing growth of the educational workforce has instead been primarily due to slowing down in educational attainment of people schooled in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} {{political}} labeling is the connotation surrounding the words “immigrants”, “aliens”, or “foreign-born” causes native citizens to perceive immigrants as “the other”. This {{way of thinking}} causes native citizens {{to distance themselves from}} immigrants’ problems in America today and pretend that the issue does not affect them. Anti-immigration arguments fail to consider the consequences of the social issue affecting 12. 9 % (the <b>foreign</b> born <b>portion</b> of the population) of the 2010 total population (Census, 2010). There needs to be a mental shift in the way people understand immigrants currently in America today...|$|R

Although Beach completed his dissertation in 1936, he did not receive the degree until 1940 due to his inability to pass the <b>foreign</b> language <b>portion</b> of the degree requirements. During this period, Beach married his second wife, Anna Beth Odenweller, with whom he had two children, Frank and Susan. In 1936, Beach accepted a one-year position at Karl Lashley's Cambridge laboratory, where he continued his studies of animal sexual behavior.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the Bank's management of the liquid <b>foreign</b> currency <b>portion</b> of the government's official reserves. It broadly outlines {{the operations of the}} Exchange Fund Account (EFA), the main account in which Canada's reserves are held. It then briefly reviews the evolution of the objectives and management of the EFA over the past 25 years, particularly in light of the changing level of reserves and developments in financial markets. The EFA is funded by Canada's foreign currency borrowings in capital markets. The article focuses on the comprehensive portfolio framework used to manage the Account, which matches assets and liabilities. Under this framework, funds are invested in assets that match, as closely as possible, the characteristics of foreign currency liabilities issued, helping to immunize the portfolio against currency and interest rate risks. ...|$|R

Camps were set up in and around Canterbury Racecourse and local parks in the district. Residents with foreign names were sent to internment camps as there was growing suspicion about residents with <b>foreign</b> names. A <b>portion</b> of these folk were Australian citizens who served with the Australian armed forces during World War I.|$|R
6000|$|... (1) (EXPLANATORY.) I {{regard the}} idea of this play as a {{valuable}} invention. I call it the Patent Universally-Applicable Automatically Adjustable Language Drama. This indicates that it is adjustable to any tongue, and performable in any tongue. The English portions of the play are to remain just as they are, permanently; but you change the <b>foreign</b> <b>portions</b> to any language you please, at will. Do you see? You at once have the same old play in a new tongue. And you can keep changing it from language to language, until your private theatrical pupils have become glib and at home in the speech of all nations. Zum Beispiel, suppose we wish to adjust the play to the French tongue. First, we give Mrs. Blumenthal and Gretchen French names. Next, we knock the German Meisterschaft sentences out of the first scene, and replace them with sentences from the French Meisterschaft--like this, for instance: 'Je voudrais faire des emplettes ce matin; voulez-vous avoir l'obligeance de venir avec moi chez le tailleur francais?' And so on. Wherever you find German, replace it with French, leaving the English parts undisturbed. When you come to the long conversation in the second act, turn to any pamphlet of your French Meisterschaft, and shovel in as much French talk on any subject as will fill up the gaps left by the expunged German. Example--page 423, French Meisterschaft: On dirait qu'il va faire chaud. J'ai chaud. J'ai extremement chaud. Ah! qu'il fait chaud! Il fait une chaleur etouffante! L'air est brulant. Je meurs de chaleur. Il est presque impossible de supporter la chaleur. Cela vous fait transpirer. Mettons-nous a l'ombre. Il fait du vent. Il fait un vent froid. Il fait un tres agreable pour se promener aujourd'hui. And so on, all the way through. It is very easy to adjust the play to any desired language. Anybody can do it.|$|R

50|$|Telephone fraud scams once {{revolved}} around the 809 area code; it was being used since calling international numbers from the United States is charged {{at a higher rate}} than domestic calls. The charge is set jointly by the originating and terminating countries; the <b>foreign</b> country <b>portion</b> of the charge could be very high, and there was no regulation by anyone. There may have been a resurgence with wireless telephones. The victim receives a message on their answering machine to call a number with an 809 area code. Since there were many new area codes being introduced in the US, the victim thinks nothing of it and dials the 809 number. The number dialed is however an international number with a share of the revenue going from the foreign telephone company to the operator of the number (the party that got the call to be placed). The victim could be put on hold indefinitely, and billed for each minute they are on hold. This is a form of fraud, though technically legal.|$|R

5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a <b>foreign</b> throne, or <b>portions</b> of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|R

If my honorable colleague and covoyager ventured a remark {{on the subject of}} <b>foreign</b> policy, a <b>portion</b> of politics to which he had given considerable attention, it was answered by a quotation from the stock market; an observation on a matter of taste was certain to draw forth a nice distinction between the tastes of certain liquors, together with a shrewd investigation of their several prices; and once, when the worthy monikin undertook to show, from what struck me to be singularly good data, that the foreign relations of the country were in a condition to require great firmness, a proper prudence, and much foresight, he was completely silenced by an antagonist showing, from the last sales, the high value of lots up town! ...|$|R

40|$|Primary role of food is {{to provide}} nutritive stuffs in {{sufficient}} amounts to meet nutritive requirements. However, recent scientific findings confirm assumptions that particular food or its ingredients had positive physiological and psychological effects on health. Functional food is referred to food rich in ingredients, having beneficial effects on one or more functions in an organism. By consuming functional food consumers can expect some health benefits. Production of poultry products as functional food is getting more important on <b>foreign</b> markets while <b>portion</b> of such products on domestic food market is insignificant. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present possibilities for enrichment of poultry products, such as broiler and turkey meat and chicken eggs, as they can be characterized as functional food. Functional ingredients in poultry products are polyunsaturated fatty acids (LNA, EPA and DHA) and antioxidants. Enrichment of poultry products with the stated ingredients that are beneficial for human health is subject of many researches, and only recently have researches been directed towards assessment of market sustainability of such products...|$|R

For 21 days were observed in four concentrations of fluoranthene, which accounted for commonly occurring (0. 1 and 0. 5 mg FLT / l) and slightly increased (1 and 5 mg FLT / L) concentrations of fluoranthene, metabolic and bioenergetic response. We were also observed growth and developmental changes and changes in the content of phytohormones. The study was focused on plant morphology. The results of this work, was evident that the presence of FLT has {{a significant impact on the}} appearance and production plants.

6000|$|But {{some one}} may think, and, indeed, {{it has been}} studiously inculcated into {{the minds of the}} multitude, that a monarchy, even a limited one, is a far more {{expensive}} mode of civil government than a republic; that a civil-list of a million a year is an enormous sum, which might be saved to the nation. Supposing that every shilling of this sum could be saved, and that every shilling of it was expended in supporting the dignity of the crown--both which suppositions are entirely false--still should I think the liberty, the prosperity, the tranquillity, the happiness of this great nation cheaply purchased by such a sum; still should I think that he would be a madman in politics who would, by a change of the constitution, risk these blessings (and France supplies us with a proof that infinite risk would be run) for a paltry saving of expense. I am not, nor have ever been, the patron of corruption. So far as the civil-list has a tendency to corrupt the judgment of any member of either house of parliament, it has a bad tendency, which I wish it had not; but I cannot wish to see the splendour of the crown reduced to nothing, lest its proper weight in the scale of the constitution should be thereby destroyed. A great portion of this million is expended in paying the salaries of the judges, the interpreters of our law, the guardians of our lives and properties; another portion is expended in maintaining ambassadors at different courts, to protect the general concerns of the nation from <b>foreign</b> aggression; another <b>portion</b> is expended in pensions and donations to men of letters and ingenuity; to men who have, by naval, military, or civil services, just claims to the attention of their country; to persons of respectable families and connections, who have been humbled and broken down by misfortunes. I do not speak with accuracy, nor on such a subject is accuracy requisite; but I am not far wide of truth in saying, that a fifth part of the million is more than sufficient to defray the expenses of the royal household. What a mighty matter is it to complain of, that each individual contributes less than sixpence a year towards the support of the monarchy! ...|$|R
40|$|Research {{results of}} {{previous}} literatures {{on the relationship}} between firms' performance and internationalization were not consistent to one another, in which scholars have proposed that the relationship is linear, non-linear, and S-shaped curved. What might have caused the divergence in the result findings might be the lack of measuring firms' internal resource and capabilities in the research model. Human resource {{plays an important role in}} both the internal and external portion of the firm. This research examines the internal manpower allocation of the firm, then uses the viewpoint of perceived differences of institutional environment to analyze the human resource complexity of firms. The main purpose of this research is to employ these two moderating variables and examines whether the firm's internal capabilities and external environments influence the relationship between firms' internalization and performance. This research further examines the direct effect of internal manpower allocation and human resource complexity on performance. In the literature, few have used human resource performance to measure the result of internalization, therefore other than using financial performance and operating performance, this research also incorporates the human resource performance variables. This research focuses on <b>foreign</b> direct investment <b>portion</b> of Taiwan's firms as the target of this research. Research findings show that: 1) the relationship between internationalization and firm's financial performance is U-shaped curved, 2) the level of internationalization negatively influences operating performance, 3) the level of internationalization positively influences Taiwan's personnel employment rate, 4) Host company's human resource allocation weakens the relationship between internationalization and firm's financial performance, 5) Host company's human resource allocation positively influences the adaptability of dispatched employees, 6) Host country's complexity of human resource negatively influences the adaptability of dispatched employees. In summary, this research find that human resource does indeed influence the management and operating efficiencies of both the internal and external firm and also proposed a possible variable when measuring internalization performance of firms. 過去對於國際化與廠商績效關係之研究結果始終相當分歧，從線性、非線性，一直到近來整合性S曲線關係的出現，導致實證上的不一致且矛盾的原因在於過去文獻沒有對母國公司內部的資源和能力加以考量。此外，人力資本在廠商國際化的過程中，無論是對於組織內部或是外部環境都扮演了極為重要的角色。本研究以資源基礎理論為主軸，探討組織內部之「母公司人力資源配適度」(亦即各價值單元人力資源之配適狀況) ；再從機構環境認知差異的觀點分析「地主國人力資源複雜度」(亦即當地勞工素質、薪資與法規等問題) ，期望以此兩項干擾變數討論廠商之組織內部能力，以及外部環境是否會影響廠商國際化程度與母公司績效間之關係，最後，再深入研究「母公司人力資源配適度」及「地主國人力資源複雜度」兩自變數對人力資源績效的直接關係。另外，過去文獻中，鮮少用「人力資源績效」衡量國際化的成果，故本研究討論國際化程度影響廠商績效時，除了沿用過去研究中常用的財務績效與營運績效外，尚加入人力資源 (對增加國內人才的雇用、母公司派駐至地主國人員之適應) 績效作為衡量的變數，以作為本文討論的重點之一。 本研究針對台灣廠商進行海外直接投資之部分為研究標的，實證結果顯示，「國際化程度」與「財務績效」呈現U型關係；「國際化程度」與「營運績效」呈現負向關係；「國際化程度」對「增加國內人才的雇用」有正向影響；另外，「母公司國內人力資源配適度」會強化國際化與財務績效間的關係、「地主國人力資源複雜度」對國際化與財務績效間的關係會有弱化的作用。另外，「母公司人力資源配適度」與「母公司派駐至地主國人員之適應」呈現正相關，以及「地主國人力資源複雜度」與「母公司派駐至地主國人員之適應」呈現負相關。本研究結果說明了人力資源確實會影響廠商內外部的管理與營運效率，也提供管理者於衡量國際化績效時一個新的思考面向。第一章	 緒論	 1 第一節	研究背景與動機	 1 第二節	研究問題與目的	 4 第三節	研究範圍與限制	 5 第四節	名詞說明與定義	 6 第五節	論文章節安排	 8 第二章	 理論背景與研究假說	 9 第一節	國際化的利益與成本	 11 第二節	廠商績效	 20 第三節	國際化程度與廠商績效之關係	 26 第四節	國際人力資源與廠商績效的關係	 45 第三章	 研究方法	 57 第一節	資料與樣本	 57 第二節	研究變數定義與衡量	 57 第三節	研究分析方法	 66 第四章	 實證結果與討論	 68 第一節	基本資料分析	 68 第二節 相關分析	 74 第三節 單因子變異數分析	 77 第四節	實證結果與討論	 83 第五章	 結論與建議	 108 第一節	結論	 108 第二節	理論與實務意涵	 113 第三節	後續研究建議	 116 參考文獻 	 11...|$|R
