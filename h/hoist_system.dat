It was 24 ft in diameter and 3 ft in width and produced [...] Power was transmitted by a line shaft. Using a suspension system, akin to the spokes on a bicycle, allowed the wheel to be lighter than the wooden one it replaced. Taking the power train off the rim rather than from axle reduces the stress and gears up the line-shaft leading to less power loss.|$|E

50|$|A canal {{warehouse}} is {{a commercial}} building principally {{associated with the}} expansions of canals from 1761 to 1896. This type of warehouse derived from coastal predecessors, had unique features: it had internal water filled canal arms that entered the building, it was multistorey with canal access at one level and road and even rail egress at another, and has a <b>hoist</b> <b>system</b> powered by a water wheel or at later stages steam. Canal warehouses were transhipment warehouses, holding goods until they could be shipped out to their next recipient.The first true canal warehouse was the Dukes Warehouse, at the Bridgewater Canal Basin in Castlefield, Manchester built in 1761. It has been demolished, but two later warehouses at Castlefield have been restored. The later Portland Basin warehouse, was built in 1834 by the architect, David Bellhouse. It has three shipping arms, and continued {{to be used as}} a storage warehouse after its serving canal became disused.|$|E
50|$|The Duke's Warehouse {{was built}} at the end Bridgewater Canal over the River Medlock. It has long since gone. It was first built in 1771, {{destroyed}} by fire in 1789 and rebuilt and extended including a fulling mill on the southern bank and cottages on the northern bank. It was destroyed again by fire in 1919. Built {{at the same time}} was the Grocers' warehouse 19.4 x 9.7m. This was a five storey warehouse with one then two shipping holes. It was cut back into the Collyhurst sandstone river cliff face {{to the north of the}} Medlock. It was designed by James Brindley and incorporated a waterwheel driven <b>hoist</b> <b>system.</b> The canal arm was continued into a tunnel in the cliff. It was modified and extended in the first decade of the 19th century when the Rochdale canal was cut behind it. The tunnel was severed and became an arm of the Rochdale Canal. Part of the facade has been restored and the canal arms are bridged by two Dutch style lifting bridges.|$|E

40|$|Storage {{space in}} sport and {{competitive}} rowing sheds is limited. The use of racking is common to improve the utilisation of available floor space. This project aims to develop a <b>hoisting</b> <b>system</b> suitable for the vertical storage of the small boats (tinnies) that are used for coaching and other functions in the sport. A search of available boat hoists revealed numerous manufactures and designs mainly in the United States. It seems the American people use boat hoists {{in the same way}} as we use boat trailers in Australia. These existing hoist products are used for out of water storage of small boats and are usually mounted lake side or attached to a wharf structure. None of the hoists located are capable of storing more than one boat vertically. A new type of hoist will be required. Due to the time available for the design work this project has focused on researching hoist requirements and design and is restricted to the <b>hoisting</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>hoisting</b> <b>system</b> is an integral part of the overall hoist structure therefore some preliminary design work of the hoist structure has also be undertaken.

The dynamic {{responses of}} tension, torsion, and acceleration are analyzed considering radius’ error of the drums, which indicates that the drive deviation between ropes can cause large influence on the tension difference and even cause one of the ropes to slack.

50|$|However, the {{autoloader}} is of a noticeably different design. Both the T-64 and T-72 {{carry their}} two-section 125 mm ammunition (shell and full propellant charge, or missile and reduced propellant charge) in separate loading trays positioned {{on top of}} each other; but firstly, in T-64, 28 of these were arranged vertically as a ring under the turret ring proper, and were rotated to put the correct tray into position under the <b>hoist</b> <b>system</b> in the turret rear. This had the disadvantage of cutting the turret {{off from the rest of}} the tank, most notably, the driver. Accessing the hull required partial removal of the trays. The T-72 uses a design that has lower width requirements and does not isolate the turret compartment: the trays are arranged in a circle at the very bottom of the fighting compartment; the trade-off is the reduction of the number of trays to 22. The second difference is that in the T-64 the trays were hinged together and were flipped open as they were brought into position, allowing both the shell/missile and propellant charge to be rammed into the breech in one motion; in the T-72 the tray is brought to the breech as-is, with the shell in the lower slot and the charge in the upper one, and the mechanical rammer sequentially loads each of them, resulting in a longer reloading cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{plans for}} Michael Boland's new {{building}} {{were approved by}} the Cairns Town Engineer in May 1912 and JT Bullock was awarded the contract for the construction. Reflecting Boland's increasing wealth and social status, the building was to be an impressive structure of reinforced concrete, the first three-storeyed building in Cairns. Although Boland had pioneered all-concrete construction methods in his 1902 building, in 1912 Cairns was still a town of timber, brick and corrugated iron {{and the use of}} concrete for the new building was still a comparatively early use of reinforced concrete in Queensland. Due to its strength and insulating qualities, concrete construction proved highly suitable to the tropical climate and cyclonic conditions experienced in North Queensland and in later decades dominated its building industry.The construction work, carried out during 1912 and 1913, was a major undertaking that elicited interest from the local press. The swamp at the site was drained and filled but due to the unstable nature of the ground the building sat on a floating foundation laid with girders rather than traditional piles. The walls, floors, internal columns and decorative details of the facade were cast in moulds. The Portland cement used for the building was imported in casks from England and poured using an innovative concrete roller mixer with an independent <b>hoist</b> <b>system.</b> An English firm, Dorman, Long and Co., who later supplied steel for the Sydney Harbour Bridge, prefabricated the steel work for the building.|$|E
