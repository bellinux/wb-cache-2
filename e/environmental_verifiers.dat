Environmental Management Systems {{in accordance}} with EMAS are used worldwide by companies and organisations of all sizes and types. EMAS registered organisations commit themselves to evaluate, manage and improve their environmental performance. EMAS is open to every type of organisation eager to improve its environmental performance. It spans all economic and service sectors and is applicable worldwide. Currently, more than 4,400 organisations and more than 8,150 sites are EMAS registered.Only independent <b>environmental</b> <b>verifiers</b> that are accredited/licensed and supervised by government authorities (Accreditation or Licensing Bodies) are authorised to validate EMAS environmental statements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of time use and contribution to the household income of men, women, and children in 12 households in a fishing village in Panay Island, central Philippines. The study highlights the differential impact of poverty on men and women and provides a glimpse of the intrahousehold dynamics within poor fishing households. Findings in previous studies in both industrialized and developing countries that women work longer hours than men were corroborated. Women contribute at least 22 % to the household cash income and 40 % of the value of unpaid labour. Their contribution to the household cash income becomes larger than that of men's when the value of livestock is computed. Women's daily participation in productive activities, such as fish vending and shucking oyster and mussel, unwittingly puts them in a position of being <b>environmental</b> recorders and <b>verifiers</b> of the state of fishery resources. Because they are burdened with the responsibility of making ends meet, they are also confronted with the challenge of realizing the dream of sending their children to university to enable them to escape poverty. This alone makes women one of the strongest stakeholders in the sustainable development of fishery resources...|$|R
