In both major plot arcs, George Venables wins a lawsuit against Darnford for seducing his wife; Darnford then abandons Maria, flees England, and takes another mistress. When she discovers this treachery, Maria loses the child she was carrying by Darnford (either through an abortion or a miscarriage). In one ending, Maria commits suicide. In another, more complete ending, Maria is saved from suicide by Jemima who has found her first daughter. Maria agrees to live for her child (as Wollstonecraft herself had done after her second suicide attempt). Jemima, Maria and Maria's daughter form a new family.|$|E

25|$|Even {{after the}} dissolution, Leland did not abandon his hunt for books. For instance, he {{obtained}} official permission to avail {{himself of the}} library belonging to the defunct monastery of Bury St Edmunds. The descriptions of Britain which he encountered in the manuscripts, however, and his personal experiences of travel, also sparked off fresh interests. By about 1538, Leland had {{turned his attention to}} English and Welsh topography and antiquities, embarking on a series of journeys which lasted six years. Probably over the summer of 1538 (though there may also have been earlier and/or later trips), he made an extended excursion through Wales. He subsequently made a number of journeys in England: the exact sequence and their dates are again uncertain, but there seem to have been five major English itineraries, taken over the summers of the years 1539 to 1543. His one firmly dated itinerary is that of 1542, which took him to the West Country. By that date he had been on a tour to the north-west, which went via the Welsh marches to Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumberland; while other itineraries took him to the west Midlands, the north-east (reaching Yorkshire and County Durham), and the Bristol region. He probably explored the south-east in shorter excursions. He is not known to have toured East Anglia, for which only a few <b>fragmentary</b> <b>notes</b> survive.|$|E

6000|$|Throughout {{the years}} of Sir Robert Peel's government, Mr. Gladstone had been keenly intent upon the {{progress}} of religious affairs at Oxford. 'From 1841 till the beginning of 1845,' {{he says in a}} <b>fragmentary</b> <b>note,</b> 'I continued a hardworking official man, but with a decided predominance of religious over secular interests. Although I had little of direct connection with Oxford and its teachers, I was regarded in common fame as tarred with their brush; and I was not so blind as to be unaware that for the clergy this meant not yet indeed prosecution, but proscription and exclusion from advancement by either party in the state, and for laymen a vague and indeterminate prejudice with serious doubts how far persons infected in this particular manner could have any real capacity for affairs. Sir Robert Peel must, I think, have exercised much self-denial when he put me in his cabinet in 1843.' The movement that began in 1833 had by the opening of the next decade revealed startling tendencies, and its first stage was now slowly but unmistakeably passing into the second. Mr. Gladstone has told us[182] how he stood at this hour of crisis; how strongly he believed that the church of England would hold her ground, and even revive the allegiance not only of the masses, but of those large and powerful nonconforming bodies who were supposed to exist only {{as a consequence of the}} neglect of its duties by the national church. He has told us also how little he foresaw the second phase of the Oxford movement--the break-up of a distinguished and imposing generation of clergy; 'the spectacle of some of the most gifted sons reared by Oxford for the service of the church of England, hurling at her head the hottest bolts of the Vatican; and along with this strange deflexion on one side, a not less convulsive rationalist movement on the other,--all ending in contention and estrangement, and in suspicions worse than either, because less accessible and more intractable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (M56) The {{chancellor}} of the exchequer introduced the Reform bill (March 12) in a speech that, though striking enough, was less impassioned than some of his later performances {{in the course of}} this famous contest. He did not forget that “the limbo of abortive creations was peopled with the skeletons of reform bills”; and it was his cue in a House so constituted as the one before him, to use the language and arguments of moderation and safety. Franchise was the real question at stake, and to that branch of reform the bill was limited. The other question of redistributing seats he likened to fighting in a wood, where there may be any number of partial encounters, but hardly a great and deciding issue. The only point on which there was a vital difference was the figure of the borough franchise. In 1859 Mr. Disraeli invented a quackish phrase about lateral extension and vertical extension, and offered votes to various classes who mainly had them already, without extending downwards; but whatever else his plan might do, it opened no door for the workmen. In 1860 the Palmerston government proposed a six pound occupation franchise for boroughs, and ten pounds for counties. The proposal of 1866 was seven pounds for boroughs, and fourteen for counties. We may smile at the thought that some of the most brilliant debates ever heard in the House of Commons now turned upon the mighty puzzle whether the qualification for a borough voter should be occupancy of a ten, a seven, or a six pound house;—nay, whether the ruin or salvation of the state might not lie on the razor-edge of distinction between rating and rental. Ministers were taunted with having brought in Mr. Bright’s bill. Mr. Bright replied that he could not find in it a single point that he had recommended. He was never in favour of a six pound franchise; he believed in a household franchise; but if a seven pound franchise was offered, beggars could not be choosers, and seven pounds he would take.

As a private member in opposition he had brought forward many financial proposals, but it now turned out that none of them was fit for real use. With a serene audacity that accounts for some of Mr. Gladstone's repulsion, he told the House that he had greater subjects to consider 'than the triumph of obsolete opinions.' His proposals dazzled for a day, and then were seen to be a scheme of illusory compensations and dislocated expedients. He took off half of the malt-tax and half of the hop duty, and in stages reduced the tea duty from two shillings and twopence to one shilling.

40|$|In {{this book}} chapter, the author traces {{the origin of}} the concept of Imagination and related terms in the English Romantic {{tradition}} (1785 - 1830), firstly introducing the most influential pre-Romantic notions of this mental faculty in the Anglophone context and moving on to the unique idea of the ‘creative’ or ‘divine imagination’ as conceived by the artist William Blake in his <b>fragmentary</b> and cryptic <b>notes.</b> The author then proceeds with a detailed explanation of the concept as it was originally developed, in manifesto-like prose works, by the first generation of Romantic poets, namely William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in conjunction or opposition with the twin concept of ‘fancy’ or fantasy, both thought of as involving highly complex perceptive, associative and (re) creative processes and as being displayed mostly in the synthetic and (esem) plastic features of poetry. The second or later generation of Romantic poets, embodied by the youthful and iconoclastic figures of P. B. Shelley and John Keats, in its turn, is particularly mentioned in the chapter not only as reinforcing the importance of the imaginative faculty, as both an instrument of ‘moral good’ or political change and as a synonym for ‘beauty’ and ‘truth’ in the Arts, but also as paving the way for more modern philosophical and aesthetic assumptions. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|R

The work was recorded to CD by Stephen Gutman in 2005 {{as part of the}} British Music Information Centre’s recording project, ‘Critical Notice’. Portfolio: Programmes from performances. Context: The research questions addressed in the work consider how texture and timbre can be used as large-scale structuring parameters. Texture is explored through the use of the sostenuto pedal, used to capture certain harmonic elements of the material {{in order to create a}} resonating background. In conjunction with this, material consisting of complementary pitch content is played, creating a foreground and establishing a layered texture. Timbre is explored, both through the resonating harmonies in the sosenuto pedal and a sequence of contrasting recurring motivic gestures, each functioning as a distinct sound. These take the form of large arpeggiated chords, <b>fragmentary</b> linear material, <b>note</b> clusters, trills and grace note figurations. These gestures are subjected to a sequence of repetitions, along with variations in one or a combination of the following: density, register, contour, dynamic, pitch content and duration, all of which create a change in timbre and/or texture. Through such an approach this work demonstrates an exploration of non-linear development and a non-narrative approach to structural form. Aspects of organic development are explored through a gradual increase in density of the material over the course of the work. Aspects of timbre and texture in this piece are discussed further in the composer’s PhD commentary...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{introduced}} by setting {{the scene at}} around {{the beginning of the}} second century CE, with a short description of the ‘Parting of the Ways’ between Judaism and Christianity. Particular emphasis is placed on the construction of Christianity’s identity and her assembly of Jewish and pagan identities. Attention will be drawn to the history of interpretation of this Christian identification, from perception of an attitude of anti-Judaism across-the-board to recognition of a more intricate interplay. Recognising that the investigation of this interplay is critical and can only be achieved through textual analysis, the KP is introduced with questions of authorship and provenance examined. The goal of the thesis is then stated; to determine the Petrine author’s perceptions of Jews and Judaism and whether they are based on historical stereotyping or real contemporary contact. The first chapter is foundational to the investigation that follows, for it is a critical text and translation of the KP. The text’s <b>fragmentary</b> nature is <b>noted</b> as well as the different schemes devised to refer to specific parts of the KP. With the appropriate nomenclature fixed upon, the fragments are then set out one after the other and where there is divergence in opinion about the meaning of the text, this is noted and all arguments considered before a judgement is given. With this background, the second chapter examines the instances within the text where the author may be accused of attacking Jews and Judaism. This occurs in two fragments { KP (IV) and KP (IX) } and over three separate issues {angelolatry, selenolatry and ‘Christ-killing’}. These topics are examined in turn, with the attitudes in the KP compared to those in contemporary texts. By making such comparisons it is possible to ascertain whether the Petrine author’s claims were justified and to help establish the extent of contact the Petrine author had with Jews and Judaism. The third chapter focuses on areas of Judaism that the Petrine author appropriated. This includes an examination of ‘Scripture’ and ‘Jerusalem’ in KP (IX) and the use of ‘νόμος’ and ‘λόγος’ in KP (I). Contemporary works are again analysed alongside the KP so as to permit an assessment of the extent of any appropriation. In the final chapter I turn my attention to KP (V) and KP (VI) which deal with the notion of ‘New Covenant’ and the possibility of Jews being part of this agreement.
