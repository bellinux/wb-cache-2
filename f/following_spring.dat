5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E

60|$|Then Ketel {{and another}} man of his <b>following</b> <b>sprang</b> forward with an oath, and their axes thundered loud on the shields of Eric and of Skallagrim. But Whitefire flickered up and the axe of Skallagrim crashed, and at once their knees were loosened, so that they sank down dead.|$|R
5|$|Extensive {{losses to}} {{agriculture}} also took place, with major crop losses reported and 900cattle killed. According to government officials, the entire banana, rice, and sugar cane crop was destroyed and harvests {{could not be}} made until the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> Offshore, nearly 500vessels sank or were destroyed by the storm and the 1,000ton Union Pacific ran aground.|$|E
5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{soon learned}} that no ship was likely to call at Godthaab until the <b>following</b> <b>spring,</b> though {{they were able to}} send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving Ivigtut at the end of October. He and his party {{therefore}} spent the next seven months in Greenland, hunting, fishing and studying the life of the local inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Salinger {{started his}} {{freshman}} year at New York University in 1936. He considered studying special education but dropped out the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> That fall, his father urged him {{to learn about the}} meat-importing business, and he went to work at a company in Vienna, Austria and in Bydgoszcz, Poland. He left Austria one month before it was annexed by Nazi Germany on March 12, 1938.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{selected}} the boat party: himself, Worsley as navigator, Crean, McNish, John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On instructions from Shackleton, McNish immediately set about adapting the James Caird, improvising tools and materials. Frank Wild {{was to be}} left {{in charge of the}} Elephant Island party, with instructions to make for Deception Island the <b>following</b> <b>spring,</b> should Shackleton not return. Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks, knowing that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the first}} season's depot-laying was to place a series of depots on the Barrier from its edge (Safety Camp) down to 80°S, for use on the polar journey which would begin the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> The final depot would be the largest, and would be known as One Ton Depot. The work was {{to be carried out}} by 12men, the 8fittest ponies, and two dog teams; ice {{conditions}} prevented the use of the motor sledges.|$|E
50|$|Refuse To Bend {{made his}} debut in August 2002 in Gowran, Ireland at Gowran Park, winning a Maiden race by four lengths. He then {{moved up to}} compete against {{top-level}} colts in the National Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse. A win in that race and another in the <b>following</b> <b>spring's</b> 2,000 Guineas Trial at Leopardstown Racecourse made him a contender for the 2003 British Classic Races.|$|R

5|$|The {{fair and}} the city were {{the setting of the}} Elvis Presley movie It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), with a young Kurt Russell making his first screen appearance. Location {{shooting}} began on September 4 and concluded nearly two weeks later. The film would be released the <b>following</b> <b>spring,</b> long after the fair had ended.|$|E
5|$|The otters {{may leave}} the den by eight weeks and {{are capable of}} {{sustaining}} themselves upon the arrival of fall, but they usually stay with their families, which sometimes include the father, until the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> Prior {{to the arrival of}} the next litter, the otter yearlings venture out in search of their own home ranges.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the <b>following</b> <b>spring,</b> when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E

5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein's alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led invasion of Iraq. British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. Other benefits are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the <b>following</b> <b>spring,</b> requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the <b>following</b> <b>spring</b> that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{served in}} the Caribbean {{throughout}} 1803 in Samuel Hood's fleet, then {{took part in the}} invasion of St Lucia in July, and of Surinam the <b>following</b> <b>spring.</b> Returning to home waters for repairs in 1806, she {{served in the}} western approaches before joining a fleet under Admiral James Gambier in 1809, and taking part in the Battle of the Basque Roads. In November 1811 she sailed to Portsmouth where she was laid up in ordinary. Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.|$|E
