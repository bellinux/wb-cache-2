5|$|Seaborg {{also became}} {{an expert in}} dealing with noted Berkeley {{physicist}} Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a <b>daunting</b> reputation, and often answered a junior man's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour.

5|$|Breckinridge's {{personal}} turmoil did not hinder {{his political}} accomplishments. He was appointed superintendent {{of public education}} by Governor William Owsley. He was the sixth person to hold the office since its creation in the 1830s.

5|$|But <b>daunting</b> {{technical}} problems remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was <b>daunting.</b> Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster House, an opulent government-owned period {{house in}} London, was rented (at £20,000 per day) for {{interior}} scenes of Buckingham Palace. The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall.

5|$|The Soviet Union had 7,192 {{airports}}, {{of which}} 1,163 had paved surface. By the 1980s most airports were having capacity problems, an example being the Lviv airport {{which had to}} cope with an average of 840 passengers each day, while the airport was built to handle 200. Another <b>daunting</b> problem was the lack of modernisation, with the Sheremetyevo International Airport (Moscow's main airport) being the only airport in the USSR to have been fully computerised.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of her first}} novel cast a standard for Affinity to follow, which Waters consciously made darker, set in a women's prison with a character who connects with spirits of the dead.

The Democratic–Republicans meanwhile nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} <b>daunting</b> for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Although by {{the close}} of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A <b>daunting</b> 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of the}} debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned {{in an age}} of almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and <b>daunting</b> but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's <b>daunting</b> political difficulties.|$|E
