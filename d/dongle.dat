5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or <b>dongle)</b> is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.|$|E

OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers {{may not have a}} safety <b>dongle</b> or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.|$|E

25|$|Companies {{that refused}} to pay the {{licensing}} fee or were rejected by Nintendo found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system.

To combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles and multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent unlicensed games from working.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Nintendo {{introduced}} the WaveBird Wireless Controller, the first wireless gamepad {{developed by a}} first-party console manufacturer. The RF-based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller. It communicates with the GameCube {{by way of a}} wireless receiver <b>dongle</b> connected to one of the console's controller ports. Powered by two AA batteries, which are housed in a compartment {{on the underside of the}} controller, the WaveBird lacks the vibration functionality of the standard controller. In addition to the standard inputs, the WaveBird features a channel selection dial – also found on the receiver – and an on/off switch. An orange LED on the face of the controller indicates when it is powered on. The controller is available in light grey and platinum color schemes.|$|E
25|$|Everything Everywhere {{announced}} on 22 August 2012 {{that it would}} introduce a third brand {{as part of a}} future 4G launch to sit alongside Orange and T-Mobile, and that Everything Everywhere would continue as the company's legal name. Further speculation commenced on 7 September 2012 when the company announced details of a press conference on the morning of 11 September 2012, the earliest date set by Ofcom to launch 4G services. It was also noted that this date was only 24 hours earlier than the expected launch of the latest generation of iPhone (the iPhone 5), thereby arousing suspicion that the new iPhone would support 4G and that Everything Everywhere would launch its service on this widely anticipated handset. Other commentators suggested that the HTC One XL would be the first handset to launch utilising Everything Everywhere's 4G network. The handsets that the company initially launched on EE are the iPhone 5 (iOS), HTC One XL (Android), Samsung Galaxy S III (Android), Samsung Galaxy NoteII (Android), Huawei Ascend P1 (Android), Nokia Lumia 920 (Windows Phone), Nokia Lumia 820 (Windows Phone). The company also announced that they would be using two 4G mobile broadband devices manufactured by Huawei - the E589 Mobile Wi-Fi device and E392 mobile broadband <b>dongle.</b>|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero III was bundled {{with newly}} {{developed}} wireless guitar controllers for the console releases, though previous controllers from other Guitar Hero games could be used. Lee Guinchard, RedOctane's {{vice president of}} hardware, stated that wireless controllers were the [...] "first, foremost consideration" [...] for the game. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of the controller was modeled after a black Les Paul guitar, with faceplates that can be swapped out. The PlayStation 3 version requires a <b>dongle</b> to achieve wireless capabilities. The Wii version is also a Les Paul design, but features a special slot to insert the Wii Remote into. [...] This slot allows the game to offer several features exclusive to the console, such as by using the internal speaker and rumble on the Remote to provide feedback on missed notes and Star Power. The PlayStation 2 guitar {{is based on a}} Kramer Striker model, and also uses a <b>dongle</b> to achieve wireless functionality. All models features a detachable guitar neck that would make it easier to transport the controller. The PC and Mac versions of the game are bundled with the same USB-based Gibson X-plorer model that shipped with Guitar Hero II.|$|E

500|$|Several reviews {{criticized the}} changes made to Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{compared}} to previous {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series. IGN's review of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions considered the game a [...] "pretty safe effort" [...] from Neversoft, doing little to change the game due to it being their first time working on the series. [...] They also criticized the lack of customizable characters. IGN's review of the Wii version described the game's presentation and art direction as feeling [...] "forced", and, as a result, less visually appealing than previous installments. GameDaily questioned the [...] "white boy soundtrack" [...] and {{would have liked to}} have seen more tracks from legends like Jimi Hendrix and Prince in the mix." [...] GameSpy criticized some of the difficulty tweaks in the game. They stated that [...] "Medium simply feels like Hard-minus-the-orange-button," [...] and that the Star Power phrases were too long, comparing the overall game to a [...] "trial by fire" [...] in contrast to the previous games in the series. They were also critical of the <b>dongle</b> approach used for the PlayStation 3 controllers, and failings in the online support for the PlayStation 3 version. GameSpot criticized the game for its [...] "heavy dose of in-game advertising." [...] GameSpy stated that the PlayStation 2 version received [...] "the short end of the stick" [...] because of a lack of online play. Official Xbox Magazine also criticized the game for being [...] "too competitive", a facet not readily found in the previous games. The PC version has been criticized for its high system requirements, and for lag and slowdown problems even on high-end systems.|$|E
