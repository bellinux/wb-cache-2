40|$|This {{project will}} address the {{important}} external drivers that influence water resources of the coastal zone and to assess the anticipated changes in flooding, drainage congestions, salinity intrusion, water availability, sedimentation and risk of inundation of cyclone induced storm surge {{as a consequence of}} these drivers. The water resources in the coastal zone of the Ganges basin are vital for crop production, ecosystem sustenance and livelihoods. These resources are largely shaped by tidal dynamics and upstream flows, and are affected by changes in the natural, socio-economic and institutional systems. It is important to identify and prioritize these drivers, and assess their effects on water resources towards building resilient water governance and management to cope with the projected future conditions. Key activities of the project are: review of the existing model studies, literature, available data and collection of data; identification and ranking of external drivers; adaptation, calibration and validation of Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP) models for assessing baseline hydrological conditions; setup, calibration and validation of Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin model, South West Regional Model (SWRM), and Bay of Bengal (BoB) model; assessment of water flow pattern, salinity distribution, storm surge risk, sedimentation pattern in baseline and projected conditions; assessment of adaptation strategies to changes caused by key drivers; and exploration of policy implications for adaptation strategies and water governance. Key outputs of the project include: list of key external drivers; climate change projections for the study region; projection of scenarios for land-use and climate change; flow availability; salinity zoning map of the coastal Ganges; <b>flood</b> depth-duration map; <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> inside polders; storm surge risk map; sedimentation rate in peripheral rivers; plan for improvement of khal system, sluices and embankments; operation rules for sluices. Methodology: This project will develop a comprehensive list of external drivers based on past researches, global literature review, interaction with the major stakeholders and peers. This list will then be put under a well designed priority and ranking criteria for identification of the key drivers contributing to about 85 - 90 % of the anticipated changes. On the basis of performance and field validation, appropriate models will be selected for studying the baseline conditions and effects of external drivers on salinity intrusion, water availability, drainage congestions and risk of inundation due to storm surges. The models available with IWM and partner organizations will be utilized to simulate the baseline and changed conditions in 2020, 2030 and 2050. The study will be conducted at two scales: regional level for the coastal regions of Bangladesh and at local level for the selected polders. On the basis of the anticipated impacts different adaptation strategies will be devised such as improvement of the land-use patterns, drainage canals, operation of sluices, strengthening of embankments, dredging, restoration of dry season freshwater flow for flushing salinity as well as restoration of the ecosystem. Specific adaptation strategies for choice and selection of the crops/aquaculture during different seasons and their salinity and submergence tolerance will be developed in consultation with G 2 and G 3 projects. Policy implications on these strategies and a required governance structure will be also explored in a participatory way. The implications of major national policies in the realm of national water policies, agricultural policy, environment policy, disaster management policy, and climate change adaptation strategy and action plan (BCCSAP) will be particularly emphasized. Likely Impacts: The output of this project is expected to be reflected in water use of local farmers and fishermen, water management by water control system managers and planning of the policymakers...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that healthy ecosystems can provide considerable benefits to people, including food, timber, freshwater, protection from floods {{and much of}} what we call quality of life. A global review of these ecosystem services carried out as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) provided a framework for national and local studies. Using the MA approach, this paper reviews the ecosystem services provided by the Somerset Levels and Moors wetland system in south-west England. This wetland provides a series of important services that are beneficial locally, regional and globally, including grazing for cattle, potential carbon sequestration, <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage,</b> recreation and archaeology. Some services are synergistic and reinforcing; for example, maintaining wet conditions supports wetland bird life that maintains biological diversity, attracts tourists, protects archaeological artefacts and reduces CO 2 emissions. Other services are potentially conflicting, for example raising water levels may reduce potential <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> and increase methane emissions. Comparison of the services of the wetland with those of drier habitats reveals for example that carbon sequestration, bird habitat provision and hay production is greater in wetlands, whilst grazing quality and plant diversity may be reduced and distributions of disease vectors may be altered by wetland restoration through raising water levels. Management decisions affecting wetlands may necessitate a trade-off of ecosystem services...|$|R

50|$|The {{constructive}} {{features of}} the initial study were as follows: By {{the construction of a}} dam on the river, the water would be diverted into a canal 2.33 mi long to the brow of the bluff, where it would fall through penstocks 800 ft to the powerhouse near the Lumbang River. The power would then be transmitted to Manila, a distance of 61 mi. To meet the dry-season flow and conserve the <b>flood</b> <b>waters,</b> <b>storage</b> reservoirs would be established on the river at suitable points. This development could be carried out at comparatively small cost and would not require exceptional engineering features. The capacity of the plant could also be increased by diverting the Lumot River to the Caliraya. However, the feasibility of the development was still in question because of storage problems. The theoretical horsepower available at the first proposed power house, with a moderate storage, was estimated at only about 6,000, which could be increased for about one-half of the year during the rainy season.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Flooding in the {{northern}} part of The Netherlands has caused serious economic threats to densely populated areas. Therefore a project has been carried out in a pilot area to assess the retention of water in two river basins as a way to reduce flooding. The physically-based groundwater and sur-face water model SIMGRO was used to model the hydrology of the basins. The model was calibrated using discharges and groundwater levels. Scenarios of measures to assess the possibility of retaining water in the basin were then defined and tested. The first measure was the retention of higher dis-charges using culverts or gates in the upstream part of the basin. The second measure was to make the streams shallower and thereby, increase flood plain storage. The last measure was <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> in a designated area in the downstream part of one basin. The analysis indicates that holding water in the upstream parts of the basins proved to be feasible and can result in significant reductions of peak flows...|$|R

40|$|Significant energy {{mismatch}} {{exists in}} solar water heating systems {{as the time}} and amount of solar energy supply are usually {{different from that of}} hot water demand. Using a hot <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> tank can reduce or eliminate such mismatch in short term while it is difficult to avoid this mismatch in long term. In many optimal design and life-cycle analysis methods, the energy mismatch is ignored which causes the system performance to be overestimated and also misleads the optimal design of the system. This paper presents a simplified method for optimizing the key parameters of solar water heating systems based on life-cycle energy analysis. This optimal method considering the energy mismatch phenomenon can be implemented through two steps. In the first step, a simplified energy model based hourly energy matching different components of the system, is developed for determining the operating performance of system with different solar collector areas and <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>volumes.</b> In the second step, the law of diminishing marginal utility is employed to determine the optimum size of the system.
