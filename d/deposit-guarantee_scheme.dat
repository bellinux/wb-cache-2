Although the <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> was unable to [...] "cope with the failure of 85% of the Icelandic banking system within a few days in October 2008", this does not require the Icelandic Government to be liable [...] "to pay the sums specified in the Directive in the event that the <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> fails". Also, Iceland did not discriminate on the grounds of nationality, when it transferred domestic depositors to a new bank.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of Landsbanki in October 2008, the Governments of the UK and Netherlands guaranteed for the deposits in Landsbanki's foreign branches. According to the Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes (94/19/EC) as implemented in Icelandic law (Act No. 98/1999), Iceland's deposit-guarantee schemes must cover up to €20.000 of deposits per person made in Landsbanki's foreign branches. Since the Icelandic <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> did not cover this sum, ESA claims that Iceland breached the Directive, specifically articles 3, 4, 7 and 10. In addition, ESA claims that Iceland has breached Article 4 of the EEA Agreement, by discriminating on grounds of nationality.|$|E
40|$|On January 28, 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Free Trade Association States {{held that}} Iceland was not {{required}} to compensate foreign depositors of Landsbanki, an Icelandic bank, when the <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> failed to reimburse depositors following the 2008 financial crisis. The court supported its conclusion with {{the text of the}} Directive that established deposit-guarantee schemes as well as policy arguments regarding consumer protection and moral hazard. The court also found that Iceland’s failure to repay foreign depositors did not constitute an act of discrimination. Although the court correctly interpreted both the text and policy goals of the Directive, the precedential value of the court’s decision may be limited due to the severity of the 2008 crisis...|$|E
40|$|More {{than ten}} {{years have passed since}} the European Commission adopted Directive 94 / 19 /EC on <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes.</b> The Directive laid the {{foundations}} for general harmonisation of deposit insurance across the European Union Member States, requiring them to legally set up <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> by a specified deadline. Based on minimum harmonisation, the Directive left it to Member States to develop their own deposit insurance systems in terms of e. g. definition of eligible deposits, level of cover, types of funding mechanism, and calculation of members’ contributions. This autonomy has resulted in quite divergent evolution of <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> and gives rise to a series of possible problems, which were the subject of the European Commission’s review of the Directive in 2006. This paper overviews the current state of deposit insurance across the European Union, highlights the main controversial issues which cause disparities in the implementation of deposit insurance between Member States (e. g. the definition of eligible deposits, the level of cover applied, the implementation of topping-up arrangements, the types of funding mechanism), and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} further harmonisation.

50|$|Nemea Bank {{was founded}} on 2 September 2008, upon its {{licensing}} as an EU-regulated bank by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The Bank {{is a member of}} the Maltese Depositor Compensation Scheme, which is based on EU Directive 94/19 on <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> and protects client deposits up to €100,000 per client. It is also a member of the Malta Investor Protection Scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Case E-16/11 Icesave {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the landmark case of the EFTA Court case, mainly due to its relation to the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis and Directive 94/19/EC on <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes,</b> which had also been transposed into EEA law. This directive obliged EU and EEA EFTA states to create <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes.</b> <b>Deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> reimburse a limited amount of deposits to depositors where their bank has failed, as a way to protect a part of depositors’ wealth from bank failures. In Icesave, the EFTA Court dealt with an action by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against Iceland. The Authority claimed that Iceland had violated the transposed Directive and thus EEA law in the aftermath of its major economic crisis and the collapse of the Icelandic banking sector in 2008, by failing to ensure that British and Dutch depositors using the ‘Icesave’ accounts offered by Icelandic banks received the minimum amount of compensation set out in Article 7(1) of the Directive. The Court noted that the nature of the result to be achieved fell to be determined by the substantive provisions of the particular directive. Moreover, it noted {{that as a result of}} the economic crisis, the regulatory framework of the financial system had been subject to revision and amendment in order to enhance financial stability. But the Court held that the Directive did not envisage the alleged obligation of result to ensure payment to depositors in the Dutch and British branches of Icelandic banks in a systemic crisis of the magnitude experienced in Iceland or how to proceed in a case where the guarantee scheme was unable to cope with its payment obligations remained largely unanswered by the Directive, with its Article 7(6) being the only operative provision that deals with non-payment. Still, the relevant question in Icesave was whether the EEA States are legally responsible under the Directive in an event of such magnitude. The Court held that the principle of non-discrimination requires that there to be no difference in treatment of depositors by the guarantee scheme itself and the way in which it uses its funds. Discrimination under the Directive is prohibited but the transfer of domestic deposits from some entities to new ones was made before the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority, Fjármálaeftirlitið, rendered its declaration that triggered the application of the Directive. Thus, depositor protection under the Directive never applied to depositors in Icelandic branches of the affected banks. Accordingly, the transfer of domestic deposits did not fall within the scope of the non-discrimination principle as stipulated by the Directive and could not lead to an infringement of the aforementioned provisions of the Directive read in light of Article 4 EEA.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of savings {{and the creation}} of insurance schemes is becoming a hot topic for the European Union Regulator: incoming Directives seem to state a sort of "financial guarantee scheme model" valid not only for deposit insurance but also for investor compensation schemes in case of failure of investment firms. The author describes the ongoing process, focusing on the recently approved <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> Directive which will compel the Member States to redraw their internal regulation; then, using a very simple game, the author studies the effects on the equilibria of different kinds of institutional regulations. The normative results, especially from this last analysis, are not easy to state: however, using also some results of DiNoia (1994 a and 1994 b), the author ends up with some suggestions on the way of regulating the single DIAs in the EU Member States. ...|$|E
40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis made clear the shortcomings in the European structure of financial supervision. In the cur­rent system of financial supervision the financial supervi­sor {{of the home}} Member State is in principle the only autho­rity entitled to supervise financial institutions even in case the institution operates across borders. If the home financial supervisor does not effectively supervise the financial insti­tution, this failure could affect clients and creditors in other Member States. The bankruptcy of Icelandic banks was felt by accountholders in the United Kingdom and the Nether­lands. The shortcomings in the Icelandic Deposit Guaran­tee scheme 1 threatened to expose these depositors to losses on their savings {{that should have been}} covered by that sche­me. In the end, the UK and the Dutch government guaran­teed these deposits under the applicable <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>scheme.</b> However, the problems arising in the execution of the agreement concluded between the UK, Dutch and Icel­andic government to recover the UK and Dutch taxpayers’ money from Iceland show the enormous consequences of failure in local supervision. Despite their significant relevan­ce in the current crisis, in this article I will not address these problems in micro-prudential supervision of banks. This ar­ticle focuses on the mechanism to ensure consistent applica­tion by the different national supervisors of the harmonised set of conduct of business rules, in particular, the rules laid down in the Prospectus Directive 20032 and the Transparen­cy Directive 2004. 3 In order to solve the shortcomings in the European struc­ture of financial supervision, the European Commission pro­posed to create a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) consisting of national supervisors and three new su­pranational European Supervisory Authorities. A Superviso­ry Authority for the banking sector 4, one for the insurance and pensions sector 5 and a supranational European Supervi­sory Authority to ensure compliance by financial institutions with conduct of business rules and the orderly functioning of the securities market. 6 The national financial supervisors remain the principal supervisory authorities. However, the supranational authorities will get decisive authority in case of emergency or continued non-agreement between national supervisors. In these cases the supranational authorities will have the authority to address directly financial institutions that do not comply with the European financial services and financial supervision legislation. In this article I will analyse in paragraph 2 the current struc­ture of financial supervision. In paragraph 3 I will discuss the de Larosière-report on the {{financial crisis}} and the present shortcomings in European financial supervision will be dealt with. Paragraph 4 provides a brief overview of the reaction of the European Commission to this report. In paragraph 5 I will describe the proposals of the European Commission. Paragraph 6 discusses the proposed future powers of the Eu­ropean Securities and Markets Authority to ensure compli­ance with the European rules on the prospectus and financi­al reporting. In paragraph 7 the proposed amendments of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Moneta­ry Affairs will be discussed. In paragraph 8 some concluding remarks are provided...|$|E
50|$|Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 30 May 1994 on <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> {{requires}} all {{member states}} to have a deposit guarantee scheme for at least 90% of the deposited amount, up to at least 20,000 euro per person. On October 7, 2008, the Ecofin meeting of EU's ministers of finance agreed to increase the minimum amount to 50,000. Timelines and details on procedures for the implementation, {{which is likely to}} be a national matter for the member states, was not immediately available. The increased amount followed on Ireland's move, in September 2008, to increase its deposit insurance to an unlimited amount. Many other EU countries, starting with the United Kingdom, reacted by increasing its limit to avoid that people transfer savings to Irish banks.|$|R

40|$|On {{the first}} of January 1993, the Second Banking Directive (1989) of the European Union {{and a number of}} the other EU Directives (1) related to the {{financial}} service industry were implemented. This heralded a new episode of deregulation, standardised minimum capital requirements and changes in supervision rules and <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes.</b> The single passport and mutual recognition have cleared the road for cross-border banking, while the introduction of the single currency on {{the first of}} January 1999 took away one of the last obstacles for a competitive and integrated banking market. The general belief among bankers and academics is that competition has significantly increased in this changing European banking environment. Indeed, the numerous cases of recent mergers and acquisitions in the financial world would indicate that bankers and insurers are trying to reshape their businesses into more profitable and lean (cost efficient) institutions in order to face national and global competitive pressures. Traditional income streams such as interest margins have dried up, whereas new sources of revenues such as brokerage services, investment banking products, risk management and portfolio management have become more and more important. Besides major changes in the regulatory environment, the banking industry will be further modernised by the implementation of new computer technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{analyzes the}} influence of the Icesave dispute on the EU application and answers a research question, if the dispute poses an essential threat to Icelandic membership in the EU. The conflict over the Icesave debt began after the collapse of Icelandic banking system during the global economic crisis in 2008. Icesave was an online brand by the bank Landsbanki, which provided savings account in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The biggest problem in the dispute was reimbursement of the Icesave debt, which should Iceland paid for to both of the countries due to the Icelandic membership in the European Economic Area and on the base of the EU directive on <b>deposit-guarantee</b> <b>schemes.</b> The first chapter of this bachelor thesis is dealing with a development of the Icelandic financial crisis and with an excursion to the Icelandic banking system. The cause of the Icelandic financial crisis wasn't the global economic crises itself but also the unsustainable size of the Icelandic banking sector.

And the last chapter is the analysis of possibilities, how the Icesave dispute can thwart the EU membership, and [...] ...|$|R
