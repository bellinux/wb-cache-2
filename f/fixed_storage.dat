40|$|Over {{the last}} years, the {{implementation}} of PV systems {{and the use of}} electric vehicles (EVs) have been significantly increased in the Netherlands. In order to satisfy consumer needs for charging their EVs, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE, i. e. charging station) has been deployed widely. However, the integration of EVSE into low-voltage (LV) grids can cause impairments to its components, due to intensive charging loads, which accumulate during the peak-hours of residential electricity demand. Grid violations that can be observed during these time periods are related with voltage deviations in the nodes and overloads either in the transformer or in the cables. The current study focused on defining potentials to enhance the deployment of EVSE in Dutch LV grids, by combining the power-out of PV systems and {{the implementation of}} storage solutions, such as the vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) approach and <b>fixed</b> <b>storage</b> batteries. For the needs of the study, the layout of a LV grid in the region of Lombok, in Utrecht, was designed based on the characteristics of typical Dutch LV grids. Thereupon, steady-state power-flow simulations were executed, by using real data concerning the demand of households and the PV power-out. In order to assess the performance of the examined LV grid, different scenarios (Base, EV, PV, EV&PV and EV&PV&V 2 G) with multiple investigated cases were set, in which the maximum power-out from the EVSE was varied, as well as the integration level of small-scale PV systems (1. 5 kWp). In the final scenario, the profiles of the supporting-EVs and the <b>fixed</b> <b>storage</b> were produced through a simplified control algorithm. To compare the results of each case the Grid Losses Indicator (GLI) was introduced. The outcomes of the simulations revealed that the performance of the examined LV grid was bounded by voltage violations, which occurred in the most overburdened node (Node 4 _ 4), which already comprises two EVSE and three big PV installations (CGU, Parkschool and Parkhuis). Moreover, the implementation of small-scale PV systems is preferred, since 100 % integration level can be achieved. Regarding the penetration of EVSE, the option of applying <b>fixed</b> <b>storage</b> in the most overburdened node and supporting-EVs in the other nodes favoured the implementation of additional EVSE, especially when fast-charging (11 kW) takes place. According to GLI, the V 2 G approach can be the first step to realise smart-grids, especially when slow-charging (3. 7 kW) is applied. To conclude, general assessment plans for deploying EVSE in Dutch LV grids should be adopted...|$|E
