5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating <b>depolarisation</b> and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial <b>depolarisation),</b> the QRS complex (ventricular <b>depolarisation)</b> and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes <b>depolarisation,</b> which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
40|$|Self-propagating {{waves of}} {{cerebral}} neuronal firing, known as spreading <b>depolarisations,</b> {{are believed to}} be at the roots of migraine attacks. We propose that the start of spreading <b>depolarisations</b> corresponds to a critical transition that occurs when dynamic brain networks approach a tipping point. We show that this hypothesis is consistent with current pathogenetic insights and observed dynamics. Our view implies that migraine strikes when modulating factors further raise the neuronal excitability in genetically predisposed subjects to a level where even minor perturbations can trigger spreading <b>depolarisations.</b> A corollary is that recently discovered generic early warning indicators for critical transitions may be used to predict the onset of migraine attacks even before patients are clinically aware. This opens up new avenues for dissecting the mechanisms for the onset of migraine attacks and for identifying novel prophylactic treatment targets for the prevention of attacks...|$|R
40|$|Buccal mass muscle of {{the pest}} slug Deroceras reticulatum was {{examined}} by conventional tension recording and the sucrose-gap electrophysiological technique. Elevated potassium salines induced dose-dependent <b>depolarisations</b> accompanied by tonic contractures with superimposed rapid twitch contractions. The latter were suppressed at over 40 mmol · l− 1 external potassium, where depolarisation-induced inactivation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels may have occurred. Acetylcholine caused significant dose-dependent <b>depolarisations</b> and tonic contractures, while 5 -hydroxy tryptamine induced lower <b>depolarisations</b> accompanied by phasic contractile activity superimposed on low level tonic force. Of the purines examined only guanosine triphosphate caused significant mechanical activity above a threshold of 0. 1 μmol · l− 1. The tetrapeptides inhibited buccal muscle spontaneous activity, but the related small cardioactive peptide B was weakly excitatory. The amino acids glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid were weakly excitatory on buccal muscle while the molluscicides metaldehyde and methiocarb disrupted normal mechanical {{activity of the}} feeding musculature. Acetylcholine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine appear to have major roles in regulating feeding muscle activity, seemingly modulated by guanosine triphosphate and inhibited by phenylalanine-methionine-arginine-phenylalanine-NH 2 and phenylalanine-leucine-arginine-phenylalanine-NH 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{striatum}} is {{the largest}} nucleus of the basal ganglia and is crucially involved in action selection and reward processing. Cortical and thalamic inputs to the striatum are processed by local networks in which several classes of interneurons play an important, but still poorly understood role. Here we investigated the interactions between cholinergic and low-threshold spike (LTS) interneurons. LTS interneurons were hyperpolarised by co-application of muscarinic and nicotinic receptor antagonists (atropine and mecamylamine, respectively). Mecamylamine alone also caused hyperpolarisations, while atropine alone caused <b>depolarisations</b> and increased firing. LTS interneurons were also under control of tonic GABA, as application of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin caused <b>depolarisations</b> and increased firing. Frequency of spontaneous GABAergic events in LTS interneurons was increased by co-application of atropine and mecamylamine or by atropine alone, but reduced by mecamylamine alone. In the presence of picrotoxin and tetrodotoxin, atropine and mecamylamine depolarised the LTS interneurons. We concluded {{that part of the}} excitatory effects of tonic acetylcholine (ACh) on LTS interneurons were due to cholinergic modulation of tonic GABA. We then studied the influence of LTS interneurons on cholinergic interneurons. Application of antagonists of somatostatin or neuropeptide Y receptors or of an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME) did not cause detectable effects in cholinergic interneurons. However, prolonged synchronised <b>depolarisations</b> of LTS interneurons (elicited with optogenetics tools) caused slow-onset <b>depolarisations</b> in cholinergic interneurons, which were often accompanied by strong action potential firing and were fully abolished by L-NAME. Thus, a mutual excitatory influence exists between LTS and cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, providing an opportunity for sustained activation of the two cell types. This activation may endow the striatal microcircuits with the ability to enter a high acetylcholine/high nitric oxide regime when adequately triggered by external excitatory stimuli to these interneurons...|$|R
5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called <b>depolarisation</b> and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.|$|E

30|$|Introduction Spreading <b>depolarisations</b> (SD) occur spontaneously in ischaemic cortex and are {{implicated in}} the {{evolution}} of the ischaemic penumbra. Subsequent enlargement of the ischaemic lesion causes worse neurological outcomes.

SDs can cause significant haemodynamic changes which may be amenable to non-invasive monitoring.|$|R
40|$|Neurones of the {{globus pallidus}} (GP) have been {{classified}} into three subgroups {{based on the}} visual inspection of current clamp electrophysiological properties and morphology of biocytin-filled neurones. Type A neurones (132 / 208; 63 %) were identified {{by the presence of}} the time- and voltage-dependent inward rectifier (Ih) and the low-threshold calcium current (It) giving rise to anodal break <b>depolarisations.</b> These cells were quiescent or fired regular spontaneous action potentials followed by biphasic AHPs. Current injection evoked regular activity up to maximum firing frequency of 350 Hz followed by moderate spike frequency adaptation. The somata of type A cells were variable in shape (20 × 12 μm) while their dendrites were highly varicose. Type B neurones (66 / 208; 32 %) exhibited neither Ih nor rebound <b>depolarisations</b> and only a fast monophasic AHP. These cells were spontaneously active while current injection induced irregular patterns of action potential firing up to a frequency of 440 Hz with weak spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were the smallest encountered (15 × 10 μm), oval in shape with restricted varicose dendritic arborisations. Type C neurones were much rarer (10 / 208; 5 %). They were identified by the absence of Ih and rebound <b>depolarisations,</b> but did possess a prolonged biphasic AHP. They displayed large A-like potassium currents and ramp-like <b>depolarisations</b> in response to step current injections, which induced firing up to a maximum firing frequency of 310 Hz. These cells were the largest observed (27 × 15 μm) with extensive dendritic branching. These results confirm neuronal heterogeneity in the adult rodent GP. The driven activity and population percentage of the three subtypes correlates well with the in vivo studies (Kita & Kitai, 1991). Type A cells appear to correspond to type II neurones of Nambu & Llinas (1994, 1997) while the small diameter type B cells display morphological similarities with those described by Millhouse (1986). The rarely encountered type C cells may well be large cholinergic neurones. These findings provide a cellular basis for the study of intercellular communication and network interactions in the adult rat in vitro...|$|R
5000|$|Glutamic acid {{has been}} implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons {{produces}} spontaneous <b>depolarisations</b> around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to {{what is known as}} paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage-activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization.|$|R
25|$|Hyperkalemic {{periodic}} paralysis is an {{autosomal dominant}} clinical condition {{where there is}} a mutation in gene located at 17q23 that regulates the production of protein SCN4A. SCN4A is an important component of sodium channels in skeletal muscles. During exercise, sodium channels would open to allow influx of sodium into the muscle cells for <b>depolarisation</b> to occur. But in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, sodium channels are slow to close after exercise, causing excessive influx of sodium and displacement of potassium out of the cells.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{to think of the}} advancing wave of <b>depolarisation</b> as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance—the propagation velocity—will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the wavefront.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that most cardiac myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the threshold potential. Cellular <b>depolarisation</b> can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions K+, a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions Na+, increased permeability to Na+, or a decreased permeability to K+. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to 50 to 60mV.|$|E
50|$|Birtoxin {{affects the}} gating {{mechanism}} of sodium channels by binding to neurotoxin receptor site 4 of the channel, {{resulting in the}} lowering of the voltage threshold of the channel {{and a reduction in}} the current amplitude.

40|$|Late sodium {{current in}} cardiac cells {{is very small}} {{compared}} with the fast component, but as it flows throughout the action potential it may make a substantial contribution to sodium loading during each cardiac cycle. Late sodium current may contribute to triggering arrhythmia in two ways: by causing repolarisation failure (early after depolarisations); and by triggering late after <b>depolarisations</b> attributable to calcium oscillations in sodium-calcium overload conditions. Reduction of late sodium current would therefore {{be expected to have}} therapeutic benefits, particularly in disease states such as ischaemia in which sodium-calcium overload is a major feature...|$|R
40|$|Calmodulin is a {{molecule}} implicated in regulating voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and the exocytotic machinery to fine tune neurotransmitter release. I {{have investigated the}} role this molecule plays in stimulus-secretion coupling in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by over-expressing either wild-type (CaMwt), or a mutated calmodulin (CaM 1234), rendered incapable of binding calcium by adenoviral infection. Stimulus-evoked secretion was monitored by combined measurements of membrane capacitance (DeltaC m) and voltage-clamp recording of calcium currents in single cells. Cells were clamped in either the perforated patch or whole-cell configuration and calcium-dependent exocytosis evoked by single depolarising voltage steps or trains of <b>depolarisations.</b> I show that the exocytotic efficiency, derived by dividing DeltaCm by the intergral of the calcium current, is reduced for N-type channels compared to P/Q-type channels. Cation substitution experiments revealed that pharmacologically isolated N-type channels displayed the most profound sensitivity to calcium-dependent inactivation. Studies aimed at eluding the molecular mechanisms underlying calcium-dependent inactivation show that inhibiting calcinuerin by 20 mins preincubation with 1 muM cyclosporine A or by introducing 30 muM calmodulin inhibitory peptides through the patch pipette did not significantly reduce the level of whole cell calcium-dependent inactivation. In contrast, adenoviral mediated expression of a mutant calmodulin deficient in calcium binding resulted in a highly significant reduction in N-type, but not P/Q-type channel inactivation. This {{is the first time}} that calmodulin has been shown to regulate endogenously expressed N-type calcium channels. These results are consistent with calmodulin acting directly to control N-type channel inactivation and therefore limit this channel's ability to couple to exocytosis during prolonged stimulation. Ca 2 +/calmodulin was also found to interact with the secretory machinery. Expression of CaM 1234 significantly reduced the exocytotic efficiency of brief <b>depolarisations</b> (≤ 100 ms), however, the exocytotic efficiency to longer <b>depolarisations</b> (≥ 200 ms) was not significantly different between cells expressing CaM 1234 and CaMwt. This suggests that Ca 2 + -Calmodulin is required for filling and/or release from a rapidly releasable pool of vesicles which is easily depleted, but not from the slowly releasable pool which dominates exocytotic responses measured with prolonged responses...|$|R
25|$|In physiology, {{an action}} {{potential}} {{occurs when the}} membrane potential of a specific axon location rapidly rises and falls: this <b>depolarisation</b> then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarise. In the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model of Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley, speed of transmission of an action potential was undefined and {{it was assumed that}} adjacent areas became depolarised due to released ion interference with neighbouring channels. Measurements of ion diffusion and radii have since shown this to not be possible. Moreover, contradictory measurements of entropy changes and timing disputed the HH as acting alone. More recent work has shown that the HH action potential is not a single entity but is a coupled synchronised oscillating lipid pulse (action potential pulse) powered by entropy from the HH ion exchanges.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{re-entry}} or circus {{motion was}} demonstrated separately by Mines and Garrey. Mines created {{a ring of}} excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the ray fish. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the turtle ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of <b>depolarisation</b> would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, {{it is necessary that}} there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium, or underlying scar tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of galectin-3 is elevated in {{the circulation of}} patients with some types of cancer including breast cancer. It has also been identified bound to glycans {{on the surface of}} breast cancer cells. In cancer patients whose cancer has metastasised, galectin-3 is higher still, suggesting that this galectin has a crucial role in metastasis. Galectin-3 also binds to MUC-1, a very large transmembrane mucin, which on cancer cells changes expression from long core 2 type O-glycosylation to shorter core 1 type O-glycosylation. Core 2 glycans terminate in galactose or sialic acid, whereas core 1 is branched and has potential for large carbohydrate extensions. High levels of MUC-1 are associated with poor prognosis and increased potential of metastasis. This cancer-associated MUC-1 is a natural ligand for galectin-3. In normal cells, MUC-1 has distinct polarisation and acts as a protective barrier around the cell, reducing cell-cell interactions. In breast cancer cells, it is hypothesised that galectin-3 has high affinity for cancer-associated MUC-1, causing <b>depolarisation</b> and breaking the cell's protective shield. This exposes small adhesion molecules {{on the surface of the}} cell, which interact with adhesion proteins on endothelial cell walls, such as E-selectin, promoting intravastion into the blood stream. Experiments shows that overexpression of MUC-1 alone is not enough to increase metastatic potential, and in fact it inhibits tumour cell entry into the blood stream. It requires the presence of upregulated galectin-3 in addition to MUC-1 to increase invasive and metastatic properties of the cancer. This is supported by other studies showing that inhibition of galectin-3 in human breast cancer cells lose their malignancy in vitro. This may provide a clue towards developing therapeutics for cancer, such as galactin-3 inhibitors.|$|E

We analysed the distribution of the EEG bursts in 11 very preterm (23 - 30 weeks gestational age) human babies through two estimates of the Hurst exponent.

In order to correctly characterize optical media in polarization, group theory is employed and Mueller-coherence matrix defined.

40|$|Ca 2 + {{release from}} the sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) in skeletal muscle in response to small <b>depolarisations</b> (e. g. to - 60 mV) should be the sum of release from many isolated Ca 2 + release sites. Each site has one SR Ca 2 + release channel activated by its associated T-tubular voltage sensor. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether it also includes neighbouring Ca 2 + release channels activated by Ca-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). Ca 2 + release in frog cut muscle fibres was estimated with the EGTA/phenol red method. The fraction of SR Ca content ([CaSR]) released by a 400 ms pulse to - 60 mV (denoted fCa) provided a measure of the average Ca 2 + permeability of the SR associated with the pulse. In control experiments, fCa was approximately constant when [CaSR] was 1500 - 3000 μm (plateau region) and then increased as [CaSR] decreased, reaching a peak when [CaSR] was 300 - 500 μm that was 4. 8 times larger on average than the plateau value. With 8 mm of the fast Ca 2 + buffer BAPTA in the internal solution, fCa was 5. 0 - 5. 3 times larger on average than the plateau value obtained before adding BAPTA when [CaSR] was 300 - 500 μm. In support of earlier results, 8 mm BAPTA did not affect Ca 2 + release in the plateau region. At intermediate values of [CaSR], BAPTA resulted in a small, if any, increase in fCa, presumably by decreasing Ca inactivation of Ca 2 + release. Since BAPTA never decreased fCa, the results indicate that neighbouring channels are not activated by CICR with small <b>depolarisations</b> when [CaSR] is 300 - 3000 μm...|$|R

5000|$|Neural {{accommodation}} or neuronal accommodation {{occurs when}} a neuron or muscle cell is depolarised by slowly rising current (ramp <b>depolarisation)</b> in vitro.

The open sodium channels allow more sodium ions to flow into the cell and resulting in further <b>depolarisation,</b> which will subsequently open even more sodium channels. At a certain moment this process becomes regenerative (vicious cycle) and results in the rapid ascending phase of action potential. In parallel with the <b>depolarisation</b> and sodium channel activation, the inactivation process of the sodium channels is also driven by <b>depolarisation.</b> Since inactivation is much slower than activation process, during the regenerative phase of action potential, inactivation is unable to prevent the [...] "chain reaction"-like rapid increase in the membrane voltage.|$|E
40|$|How {{the outputs}} of populations of sensory neurons {{are used by}} motor systems to {{generate}} appropriate behaviour is a long standing question in neuroscience. I address this problem by studying a comparatively simple model system. In the fly, Neck Motor Neurons control gaze-stabilising head movements that occur during wholebody rotations. These motor neurons receive several sensory inputs including one from well-characterized visual interneurons, Tangential Cells (TCs), which respond to panoramic image shifts induced during self-motion. In chapter one, I provide a general introduction to sensory-motor circuits and the fly gaze-stabilisation system. In chapter two, I report that the visual receptive fields of Neck Motor Neurons {{are similar to those}} of the TCs. Using this result, I show an alignment between the coordinate systems used by the visual and the neck motor systems to process visual information. Thus, TCs encode visual inputs in a manner already closely matched to the requirements of the neck motor neurons, considerably facilitating the visual-motor transformation In chapter three, I analyse the gating of neck motor neuron visual responses by convergent mechanosensory inputs from the halteres. Some neck motor neurons do not fire action potentials in response to visual stimuli alone, but they will in response to haltere movements. I show that visual stimuli produce sustained sub-threshold <b>depolarisations</b> in these neurons. These visual <b>depolarisations</b> increase the proportion of haltere-induced action potentials in neck motor neurons. Thus, visual inputs can only affect the spiking output if the halteres are moving. This simple mechanism could explain why flies only make visually induced head movements during walking or flight: behaviours that involve beating the halteres. By analysing how the outputs of a model sensory system are used, I have shown a novel alignment between sensory and motor neuron populations and a simple mechanism underlying multisensory fusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptor (mGluR) subtype selective compounds on the excitability of sympathetic preganglionic neurones (SPNs) were investigated. Non-selective mGluR agonists (1 S, 3 R) -aminocyclopentane- 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid and (2 S, 1 %S, 2 %S) - 2 -(carboxycyclopropyl) glycine, induced dose-dependent <b>depolarisations</b> in 96 and 75 % of SPNs, respectively and hyperpolarisations in 2 and 21 % of SPNs. Both agonists could induce subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in previously non-oscillating SPNs and either increased or reduced {{the frequency of}} spontaneously occurring oscillations. A selective group I mGluR agonist, 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenylglycine, depolarised all SPNs tested, induced oscillations in membrane potential of otherwise non-oscillating SPNs and increased the frequency of spontaneous oscillations. Agonists with selectivity for group II mGluRs (1 S, 3 S) -aminocyclopentane- 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid and (S) - 4 -carboxy- 3 -hydroxy-phenylglycine ((S) - 4 C 3 HPG) did not induce depolaris-ing responses. However (S) - 4 C 3 HPG induced hyperpolarising responses associated with {{a reduction in the}} frequency of spontaneous oscillations in two of six SPNs tested. Depolarising and hyperpolarising responses were maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin indicating a direct action of the agonists upon SPNs. In individual SPNs responses of opposite polarity could be induced from the same initial membrane potential using different agonists, indicating that the opposing responses involved different ionic mechanisms. The broad spectrum mGluR antagonist (S) -a-methyl- 4 -carboxyphenylglycine and the selective group I mGluR antagonist (S) - 4 -carboxyphenylglycine reversibly depressed mGluR agonist induced <b>depolarisations.</b> These results indicate that SPNs express two mGluR populations with opposing actions on neuronal excitability: group I mGluRs depolarise SPNs and can drive oscillatory membrane potential activity; a minority of SPNs express group II mGluRs which mediat...|$|R

We investigated effects of ET- 1 on human atrial cellular electrophysiological measurements expected to influence the genesis and maintenance of AF. Action potential characteristics and L-type Ca 2 + current (I CaL) were recorded by whole cell patch clamp, in atrial isolated myocytes obtained from patients in sinus rhythm. Isoproterenol (ISO) at 0. 05 μM prolonged the action potential duration at 50 % repolarisation (APD 50 : 54 ± 10 vs. 28 ± 5 ms; P &# 60; 0. 05, N = 15 cells, 10 patients), but neither late repolarisation nor cellular effective refractory period (ERP) were affected. ET- 1 (10 nM) reversed the effect of ISO on APD 50, and had no basal effect (in the absence of ISO) on repolarisation or ERP. During repetitive stimulation, ISO (0. 05 μM) produced arrhythmic <b>depolarisations</b> (P &# 60; 0. 05). Each was abolished by ET- 1 at 10 nM (P &# 60; 0. 05). ISO (0. 05 μM) increased peak I CaL from – 5. 5 ± 0. 4 to – 14. 6 ± 0. 9 pA/pF (P &# 60; 0. 05; N = 79 cells, 34 patients). ET- 1 (10 nM) reversed this effect by 98 ± 10 % (P &# 60; 0. 05), with no effect on basal I CaL.

In the presence of antagonists for iGluRs and for GABA(A) receptors, brief tetanic activation evoked a slow metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) -dependent EPSP (mGluR-EPSP). This mGluR-EPSP was blocked by the selective mGluR 1 antagonists LY 367385 and CPCCOEt, but not by the mGluR 5 antagonist MPEP. Group II agonists affected neither iGluR-EPSP nor mGluR-EPSP. Conversely, L-AP 4 and L-SOP, group III mGluR agonists, inhibited both iGluR- and mGluR-EPSPs. The <b>depolarisations</b> evoked by both AMPA and group I agonists were unaffected, indicating a presynaptic action of group III mGluRs.

These properties resemble those of L-type Ca 2 + channels in other tissues. It is suggested that this Ca 2 + channel participates in the generation of the B-cell action potential and mediates the increase in Ca 2 + influx required for insulin secretion...|$|R
40|$|Tetraethylammonium (TEA) induces {{a form of}} {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) that is independent on N-methyl [...] aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation (LTPK). LTPK may be a suitable chemical model to study molecular mechanisms underlying LTP. We monitored the phosphorylation state of two identified neural-specific protein kinase C (PKC) substrates (the presynaptic protein GAP- 43 /B- 50 and postsynaptic protein RC 3) after different chemical <b>depolarisations.</b> TEA induced a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy in the CA 1 field of the hippocampus and increased the phosphorylation of both GAP- 43 /B- 50 and RC 3 (51 and 56. 1 %, respectively). These effects were blocked by the voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, but not by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP 5. These data show that in LTPK the in situ phosphorylation of pre-and postsynaptic PKC substrates is increased, indicating that NMDA receptor-dependent and NMDA receptor-independent LTP share common Ca 2 +-dependent expression mechanisms, including activation of pre- and postsynaptic PKC...|$|R
