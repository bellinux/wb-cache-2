In 1994, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog. In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published [...] "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia, showing that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvisation. In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil-for-Food Programme—in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions—had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of kickbacks. An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved, as well as raising [...] "significant" [...] questions about the role of Kojo Annan, the son of Kofi Annan.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} planned changes {{in the way that the}} regulatory function is to be conducted in England and Wales in the future (Department of Health, 1998). These include the setting up of independent regional authorities responsible for regulating care services, the extension of regulatory requirements to services not currently covered by regulatory legislation and the setting of standards at a national level. An important issue to consider in this context is the setting of fees to those who are being regulated. A key recommendation of the Burgner report on regulation and inspection of social services was that the cost of regulation should be independently reviewed with a view to relating fee levels more closely to the actual costs of regulation (Burgner, 1996; p 8). This report describes the results of an extension to a Department of Health and Wales Office funded study of health and local authority <b>inspection</b> <b>units</b> in England which had investigated the costs of regulating care homes for adults (Netten, Forder and Knight, 1999 a). The principal aim of this study was to establish the costs of regulating residential care services for children, in a way that could be used to identify cost-based fees to establishments. Residential care services for children were taken to include residential homes, family centres, boarding schools, foster care agencies, and adoption agencies. Of these services Units currently have statutory responsibility for inspecting homes registered under the Children’s Act 1989 and independent boarding schools. The Social Services Inspectorates of the Department of Health and Wales Office inspect voluntary homes and voluntary adoption agencies. There are no statutory requirements to regulate the other services. Under the Children Act 1989 local authorities have the power to charge a “reasonable” fee for registration and inspection of private children’s homes, but voluntary homes, local authority homes and boarding schools do not pay fees. The main data collection was a survey of local authority and <b>joint</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>units</b> undertaken during the autumn of 1999. The data collection built on data collected in the previous survey (Netten, Forder and Knight, 1999 a). For this study supplementary data were collected about unit policies and practice with respect to services for which they had no statutory responsibilities, children’s services’ inspector characteristics and a sample week’s time use; and a sample of recently undertaken inspections and registrations. Information was also collected about enforcement actions undertaken during the previous year. SSI inspectors involved also provided equivalent information on the amount of time spent on inspecting and registering voluntary homes. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: to {{identify}} the rate of closure of nursing homes for older people, the types of homes closing {{and the reasons for}} closure. Design: mixed method study including a census and telephone survey of registration and <b>inspection</b> <b>units</b> and interviews with independent providers. Participants: 81 of 96 health authority and <b>joint</b> registration and <b>inspection</b> <b>unit</b> managers in England completed the census and 39 managers participated in a further telephone survey. Twenty-five independent providers were interviewed. Results: closures resulted in a net loss of 6 % of nursing homes and 4. 9 % of nursing places during 2000 – 2001. Smaller homes were more likely to close and were increasingly seen as unviable. The majority of closed homes were reported to have provided good quality care. Shortages of nursing staff were of widespread concern. The dominant combination of factors identified by providers was low fees and concerns about the cost implications of the new care standards. Changes in demand were reflected in the placement of high dependency residents in residential rather than nursing homes. Conclusions: in the absence of policy interventions capacity will continue to reduce, with smaller homes most likely to disappear. There is an urgent need to address the supply and efficient use of nursing staff skills in care homes. While fee levels are the primary concern the effect of the proposed care standards was clearly having an effect. Even with subsequent amendment to these standards, unless authorities use capacity funding to raise fees and improve expectations, providers are likely to continue to exit the market...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} critical opinions addressed {{at present}} to the UNO by the States and scholars. It was already during the San Francisco conference that the States raised objections to the adopted solutions. After 43 years of its existence, the UNO is still far from fulfilling the hopes which were fostered {{at the time of}} its foundation. The causes of shortcomings may be found in structural and managerial deficiencies. The complexity of the UNO structure influences the dissipation of efforts and makes the coordination more difficult. The waste of means on countless programmes, sub-programmes and projects has often been subject to criticism. The efforts to increase efficiency through establishing organs which were to improve the system failed (eg. Administrative Commitee on Co-ordination, Commitee on Programme and Co-ordination, <b>Joint</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Unit).</b> However, those organs helped to record and disclose shortcoming and their sources by way of Publishing critical reports. Managerial problems consist mostly in difficulties with poor professional qualifications of the UNO staff. The view that the professional level decreases constantly is shared by 69 % of diplomats employed in the UNO-affiliated missions. Critical opinions are voiced also with respect to the unreality of projects, declarativity and mere talk present in the UN system. Particular organizations established on regional and political grounds, the number of which grows constantly and at present is close to 330, are far more efficient. The UNO documents indicate that the member-States most often call for the amendments of provisions on the Security Council, and in the first place on its composition and voting system. The author shares the view that multiplying agencies and organs, or abortive attempts to limit the role of superpowers in the Security Council will not bring adequate effects. Little efficiency of the UNO in maintaining the world peace may be eliminated not through a direct structure reform of the system but indirectly through activities aimed at improving the economic situation of the South. The UNO should work out a worldwide welfare programme which would influence indirectly the consolidation of the world peace through increasing the economic level of conflict-generating regions. Such a programme would have to adopt a system of preferences, for the existing free-market rules the disproportions between the North and the South.

The sensory tests carried {{out at the same}} time rejected 61. 5 % of heavily contaminated eggs. Rejection by the sensory testing for eggs contaminated with Pseudomonas, which often occurred when stored at 23 and at 13 C, was not so effective as that by the combined assessment. The combined assessment did not reject eggs contaminated with certain Enterobacteri-aceae that were frequently found in the eggs stored at 23 C. No methods used in this study could detect the eggs contaminated with Alcaligenes, the growth of which produced no change in the appearance or odor of the egg contents. In heavily contaminated eggs, the number of Pseudomonas-contzmmazeA eggs (63) was larger than that of Enterobacteriaceae-contaminated eggs (28); For this reason, combined assessment was superior to the sensory tests.
