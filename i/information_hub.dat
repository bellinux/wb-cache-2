40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the top-k <b>information</b> <b>hubs</b> in a social network. Identifying topk <b>information</b> <b>hubs</b> is crucial for many applications such as advertising in social networks where advertisers are interested in identifying hubs to whom free samples can be given. Existing solutions are centralized and require time stamped information about pair-wise user interactions and can only be used by social network owners as only {{they have access to}} such data. Existing distributed algorithms suffer from poor accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to identify <b>information</b> <b>hubs</b> that preserves user privacy. Our method can identify hubs without requiring a central entity to access the complete friendship graph. We achieve this by fully distributing the computation using the Kempe-McSherry algorithm, while addressing user privacy concerns. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed technique using three real-world data set; The first two are Facebook data sets containing about 6 million users and more than 40 million friendship links. The third data set is from Twitter and comprises of a little over 2 million users. The results of our analysis show that our algorithm is up to 50 % more accurate than existing algorithms. Results also show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the rank of the top-k <b>information</b> <b>hubs</b> users more accurately than existing approaches.

2500|$|Despite {{the need}} to {{centralize}} patient information, PHR adoption has been very low. In 2002, a study {{was carried out in}} an effort to assess the functionality and utility of online PHRs. An abstraction from real-life case of a patient suffering from a thyroid condition was utilized to create various online PHRs. The outputs generated were examined for accuracy and completeness of clinical information. A team of researchers identified 19 websites offering different versions of PHRs. To evaluate the PHRs, researchers identified criteria based on their promotional advertisements. Ideally, centralized PHRs should help patients relate accurate history during clinical encounters, check for drug interactions, eliminate unnecessary duplication of laboratory tests and diagnostic studies, and serve as an <b>information</b> <b>hub</b> for patients’ health management. An analysis of web-based PHR applications showed that most websites did provide access to personal medical information, however each demonstrated limited capacity in a different way: ...|$|E

40|$|When {{disaster}} events capture global attention {{users of}} Twitter form transient interest communities that disseminate information and other messages online. This paper examines content related to Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda) as {{it hit the}} Philippines and triggered international humanitarian response and media attention. It reveals how Twitter conversations about disasters evolve over time, showing an issue attention cycle on a social media platform. The paper examines different functions of Twitter and the <b>information</b> <b>hubs</b> that drive and sustain conversation about the event. Content analysis shows {{that the majority of}} tweets contain information about the typhoon or its damage, and disaster relief activities. There are differences in types of content between the most retweeted messages and posts that are original tweets. Original tweets are more likely to come from ordinary users, who are more likely to tweet emotions, messages of support, and political content compared with official sources and key <b>information</b> <b>hubs</b> that include news organizations, aid organization, and celebrities. Original tweets reveal use of the site beyond information to relief coordination and response. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
