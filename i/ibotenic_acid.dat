5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid.</b> Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid.</b> Muscimol and <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to}} each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E
5|$|Recently, an {{analysis}} of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia {{have shown that the}} release of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol.|$|E

40|$|Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a {{large area}} of the brain and its {{neonatal}} lesion with <b>ibotenic</b> or kainic <b>acid</b> is used to study the early abnormalities in neurodevelopment that lead to behavioral changes linked to schizophrenia. However, these exitotoxic drugs produce a large and asymmetric damage in the PFC. We produced the bilateral lesions of the dorsal part of the PFC of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 7, P 7) at the anteroposterior + 2. 5 mm and mediolateral +/- 0. 4 coordinates by the new laser technique that employ the confined radiation of the CO 2 laser in the pulsed mode. The laser was used because its coherent radiation can be focused in a very small spot and as small as of several tens of micrometers in diameters. The CO, laser radiation is strongly absorbed by water that is present in any soft tissue. Thereafter, the configuration of the heated zone and, consequently, that of the lesion does not depend on the morphological non-homogeneity of particular structures. We obtained the symmetric, conical in shape and small-size bilateral lesions of the PFC. The size of the lesion depended on the beam spot-size and could be as small as several dozens of micrometers in diameter. Our data suggests that the laser technique will be used for the anatomical-functional studies of the PFC in the brain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{cholinergic}} {{hypothesis of}} Alzheimer's Disease (AD) {{has led to}} a number of animal models to study in vivo the pathogeny of cortical cholinergic involution. The lesion of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, especially of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) of rodents, has been the most utilized method for obtaining these models. Toxic substances such as quinolic, kainic, NMDA, <b>ibotenic</b> and quisqualic <b>acids,</b> the specific cholinergic toxin AF 64, amyloid, and antibodies to neurotrophic factors; etc, have been used to produce such lesions. These investigations have helped our understanding of the role of cerebral cholinergic innervation in cognitive disorders and their treatments. However, this research has provided conflicting results, and much controversy has developed surrounding the role of the cholinergic systems and the suitability of these models. It is very important {{to take into account the}} exact type of nbm/cortical lesion produced, and its evolution, if meaningful results are to be obtained. This review covers the theoretical and practical use of nbm lesion models, and examines the main positive and negative results obtained by different authors in the light of our own observations on the long-term (3 years) morphological and biochemical changes that occur in several kinds of nbm-lesion model rats. The changes seen were very different, but many of them were increased up to the end of life with no clear relationship with the development of the original lesion. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{traditionally}} used for catching flies possibly {{due to its}} content of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid,</b> a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg muscimol or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol than autumn fruitings.|$|E
5|$|The active {{constituents}} {{of this species}} are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A.muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
2500|$|A few {{species in}} the Amanita genus, most recognizably A. muscaria, but also A. pantherina, among others, contain the psychoactive {{compound}} muscimol. [...] The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of Amanitas contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due {{to the presence of}} <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid.</b> The Amanita intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is part of}} Amanita section Vaginatae, {{and like}} other species in this group, it is {{characterized}} by its lack of an annulus, [...] pileus margin, thick universal veil remnants comprising the veil, volva, and pileus patches, inamyloid spores, and lack of [...] characteristic Amanita toxins such as amatoxins and <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid.</b> It is distinguished from other species in section Vaginatae by its lack {{of any kind of}} umbo on its pileus, its short pileus , and its distinct pale orange to pale salmon coloration when young. Its coloration can become more brownish with age and entirely white specimens are occasionally seen as well. Like many other Amanita, the gills are white, but occasionally have a distinct pinkish or orangish tint. In older specimens, the odor can become pungent and fishy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> {{typically}} affects NMDA and trans-ACPD receptors in {{the central}} nervous system. Due to their targeting of these systems the symptoms associated with <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> poisoning are often related to perception and control.|$|E
50|$|Typically when lesioning is {{done with}} other {{chemicals}} the subject can not relearn a task. However, due to Ibotenic acid's reactivity with glutamate receptors such as the NMDA receptor, <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> lesioning does allow the subject to relearn tasks. Due to this, <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> lesioning is preferred in studies where re-learning a task after lesioning is essential.When compared to other lesioning agents, <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is one of the}} most site-specific, however, on going research is searching for less-damaging alternatives.|$|E

5000|$|Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) - Contains the psychoactive {{muscimol}} and the neurotoxin <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> decarboxylates into muscimol upon curing of the mushroom, rendering it relatively non-toxic, though death via {{respiratory depression}} is possible. Muscimol intoxication is often considered unpleasant and undesirable, however, {{and as such}} has seen little recreational use compared to the unrelated psilocybin mushroom, though {{it has been used}} as an entheogen by the native people of Siberia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> or (S)-2-amino-2-(3-hydroxyisoxazol-5-yl)acetic acid, also {{referred}} to as ibotenate, is a chemical compound and psychoactive drug which occurs naturally in Amanita muscaria and related species of mushrooms typically found in the temperate and boreal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a conformationally-restricted analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and due to its structural similarity to this neurotransmitter, acts as a non-selective glutamate receptor agonist. Because of this, <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> can be a powerful neurotoxin, and is employed as a [...] "brain-lesioning agent" [...] in scientific research.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> {{poisoning}} {{is limited}} and varies as the toxic {{dose of the}} compound varies from person to person. Patients {{admitted to the hospital}} for <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> poisoning are typically given charcoal in order to stop the absorption of the compound and prevent further intoxication. Upon receiving charcoal treatment the patient’s vital signs are monitored and toxicity usually lasts between 6 and 8 hours; however, some symptoms may take up to a few days to subside. Occasionally, to reduce the discomfort associated with symptoms, benzodiazepines will be administered to control panic attacks and hallucinations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> acts as {{a potent}} agonist of the NMDA and group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors. It is inactive at group III mGluRs. <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> also {{acts as a}} weak agonist of the AMPA and kainate receptors. In addition, due to in vivo decarboxylation into muscimol, it acts indirectly as a potent GABAA and GABAA-ρ receptor agonist. Unlike muscimol, the principal psychoactive constituent of Amanita muscaria that is understood to cause sedation and dissociation, ibotenic acid's psychoactive effects are not known independent of it serving as a prodrug to muscimol.|$|E
50|$|Monosodium L-aspartate has an umami taste {{about four}} times less intense than MSG whereas <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and tricholomic acid (likely as their salts or with salt) are claimed to be many times more intense.|$|E
50|$|Isoxazole {{rings are}} found in some natural products, such as <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid.</b> Isoxazoles also {{form the basis for}} a number of drugs, {{including}} the COX-2 inhibitor valdecoxib (Bextra) and a neurotransmitter agonist AMPA. A derivative, furoxan, is a nitric oxide donor.|$|E
50|$|Muscimol is the psychoactive {{compound}} {{responsible for}} the effects of Amanita muscaria intoxication. <b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid,</b> a neurotoxic secondary metabolite of Amanita muscaria, serves as a prodrug to muscimol when the mushroom is ingested or dried, converting to muscimol via decarboxylation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> is an agonist of glutamate, {{specifically}} {{at both the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA and trans-ACPD receptor sites in a multiple of systems in the central nervous system. Ibotenic neurotoxicity can be enhanced by glycine and blocked by dizocilpine. Dizocilpine acts as an uncompetitive antagonist at NMDA receptors.|$|E
5000|$|Amanita muscaria is edible if {{parboiled}} {{to leach}} out toxins, fresh mushrooms cause vomiting, twitching, drowsiness, and hallucinations due {{to the presence of}} muscimol. Although present in A. muscaria, <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> is not in high enough concentration to produce any physical or psychological effects unless massive amounts are ingested.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> {{toxicity}} {{comes from}} {{activation of the}} NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are related to synaptic plasticity and work with metabotropic glutamate receptors to establish long term potentiation or LTP. The process of long term potentiation {{is believed to be}} related to the acquisition of information. The NMDA receptor functions properly by allowing Ca2+ ions to pass through after activation at the receptor site. The binding of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> allows excess Ca2+ into the system which results in neuronal cell death or apoptosis. Ca2+ also activates CaM-KII or Ca2+/Calmodulin Kinase which phosphorylates multiple enzymes. The activated enzymes then begin producing reactive oxygen species which damages surrounding tissue. The excess Ca2+ results in the enhancement of the mitochondrial electron transport system which will further increase the number of reactive oxygen species.|$|E
50|$|The active {{constituents}} {{of this species}} are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A. muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E
50|$|It {{is natural}} that {{accidental}} ingestion of hallucinogenic species also occurs, but is rarely harmful when ingested in small quantities. Cases of serious toxicity {{have been reported}} in small children. Amanita pantherina, while it contains the same hallucinogens as Amanita muscaria (e.g., <b>ibotenic</b> <b>acid</b> and muscimol), has been more commonly associated with severe gastrointestinal upset than its better-known counterpart.|$|E
