40|$|Abstract. —The {{majority}} of interior subspecies of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii have been extirpated from large rivers by anthropogenic activities that have fragmented habitats and introduced nonnative competitors. Selective pressures against migratory behaviors and main-stem river occupation, coupled with conservation strategies that isolate genetically pure populations above barriers, have restricted gene flow and prevented {{expression of the}} fluvial life history in many populations. Existing knowledge about the movements and home range requirements of fluvial cutthroat trout is, therefore, limited. Our objectives {{in this study were}} to (1) determine the extent of seasonal home ranges and mobility of Bonneville cutthroat trout O. c. utah (BCT) in the Thomas Fork and main-stem Bear River and (2) evaluate the role of a water diversion structure functioning as a seasonal migration barrier to fish movement. We implanted 55 BCT in the Thomas Fork of the Bear River, Idaho, with radio transmitters and located them bimonthly in 1999 – 2000 and weekly in 2000 – 2001. We found fish to be more mobile than previously reported. Individuals above the <b>diversion</b> <b>barrier</b> occupied substantially larger home ranges than those below the barrier (analysis of variance: P � 0. 0003; median � 2, 225 m above barrier; median � 500 m below barrier) throughout our study, and they moved more frequently (mean, 0. 89 movements/contact...|$|E

50|$|After a long {{struggle}} the Raydanites succeeded, {{under the leadership}} of the king Yasir Yahnam and his son Shamar Yahrash, in ending the struggle for their favor besting their adversaries and extending their influence and power reached the Sabaean capital Ma’rib and the districts attached to it. This victory, 270 AD, led to stability in Yemen in general, and in Dhamar in particular. Soon afterward, in about 293 AD, military forces sent by the Raydanite king Shamar Yahrash conquered Hadramawt. Yemen was now united, and in this new era Dhamar witnessed great prosperity manifested in reconstruction of cities and cultic centers, in construction of palaces, temples and fortification walls, and in creation of water facilities such as dams, tunnels, <b>diversion</b> <b>barriers,</b> etc. The bronze statues of Dhamar Ali Yahbar and his son Tha’ran Yahna’am discovered at Nakhlat Al-Hamra’ are physical illustrations of high cultural attainments of Yemen under these Himyarite kings. This cultural florescence came to an end when invading Abyssinians conquered Yemen and destroyed Himyarite cities, particularly in Dhamar governorate.|$|R
40|$|Yucca Mountain {{activities}} for FY 1999 are anticipated to require specific {{information on the}} chemical and physical properties of the candidate getter materials and other backfill components necessary for defensible modeling of the source term, and possible controlling of the source term. There should be three tasks to this activity: {{at the end of}} this report is a draft test plan reflecting the present funding anticipated, the other tasks may be added as funding becomes available. (Task 1) The immobilization capacity of the getter materials for specific radionuclides. This task will primarily include column sorption tests of getter materials with solutions spiked with radionuclides. The getter materials will include Apatite II, MgO (with NaPO{sub 4 } plus Ba,SrCO{sub 3 } and soluble sulfate, with and without Apatite II), Gibbsite/Boehmite, and Hematite. Radionuclides will include Pu, U, Np, Am, Ra, Tc, and Th. Experiments will be performed under various anticipated repository conditions and with anticipated solution compositions. Occasional batch tests will be used to obtain specific K{sub d}s and other thermodynamic data. Solid and liquid analyses will be needed for characterization of the effluent concentrations from the columns to assess performance and for use in geochemical modeling. (Task 2) Intrinsic stability of the getter materials under repository conditions. The use of any candidate getter material will depend upon its anticipated lifetime in the backfill environment. Literature search for any existing data will be performed and augmented by solubility experiments on the getter materials. This is especially important for the reactive materials such as MgO and the soluble sulfates and phosphates that may be a limited lifetime in the backfill. It is also necessary to decide how much getter material to emplace. (Task 3) Diffusion of radionuclides across a Richards Barrier. The Richards Barrier, if emplaced, will act as a hydraulic <b>diversion</b> <b>barrier</b> for the diversion of water around the waste package, and sand and gravel may be used beneath the packages for various reasons. It has been postulated that these materials will also act as diffusion barriers to radionuclide migration across them, especially under unsaturated conditions. Macroscale experiments in LANL's hot facility will be used to measure radionuclide migration across the interface of these barriers which will be constructed using crushed YM tuff and Overton Sand from Nevada. Tritium will be used as a conservative tracer. These experiments will provide the data necessary to evaluate the retardation properties of the backfill materials and to determine whether precipitation or adsorption dominates in each material, and whether the repository environment is favorable for its performance. The scope of work may change as information develops from this activity and from other activities, as close interactions will occur between these activities. In anticipation of these activities, the authors are performing several calculations and experiments. First, they are compiling information on the properties of the candidate backfill and invert materials for use in decision-making, for modeling purposes and for identifying data gaps. Table 1 provides the first draft of information on the possible backfill materials and Table 2 provides information on the possible invert materials...|$|E
40|$|Lava flows {{produced}} during Etna flank eruptions represent severe hazards for the nearby inhabited areas, {{which can be}} protected by adopting prompt mitigation actions, such as the building of <b>diversion</b> <b>barriers.</b> Lava <b>diversion</b> measures were attempted recently during the 1983, 1991 - 93, 2001 and 2002 Etna eruptions, although with different degrees of success. In addition {{to the complexity of}} barrier construction (due to the adverse physical conditions), the time available to successfully slow the advance of a lava flow depends on the lava effusion rate, which is not easily measurable. One method to estimate the average lava effusion rate over a specified period of time is based on a volumetric approach; i. e. the measurement of the volume changes of the lava flow over that period. Here, this has been compared to an approach based on thermal image processing, as applied to estimate the average effusion rates of lava flows during the 1981 and 2001 Etna eruptions. The final volumes were measured by the comparison of pre-eruption and post-eruption photogrammetric digital elevation models and orthophotographs. Lava volume growth during these eruptions was estimated by locating the flow-front positions from analyses of scientific papers and newspapers reports, as well as from helicopter photographs. The analyses of these two eruptions contribute {{to the understanding of the}} different eruptive mechanisms, highlighting the role of the peak effusion rate, which represents a critical parameter for planning of mitigation actions and for hazard evaluation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Lava flows {{are common}} at volcanoes {{around the world}} and on other {{terrestrial}} planets, but their behavior is not fully understood. In Hawai`i, advances in remote sensing are offering new insights into lava flow emplacement. In this dissertation, I develop new techniques using satellite-based synthetic aperature radar, aerial photographs, and airborne lidar to produce three-dimensional high-resolution maps of lava flows from data collected before, during, and after emplacement. These new datasets highlight complex lava channel networks within these flows, which are not incorporated into current predictive or probabilistic lava flow models yet may affect flow behavior. I investigate the origin and influence of these channel networks through morphologic analysis of underlying topography, network topology, and flow morphology and volume. Channel network geometries range from distributary systems dominated by flow branching around local obstacles to tributary systems constricted by topography. I find that flow branching occurs where the flow thins over steeper slopes and that the degree of flow branching, network connectivity, and longevity of flow segments all influence the final flow morphology. Furthermore, because channel networks govern the distribution of lava supply within a flow, changes in the channel topology can dramatically alter the effective volumetric flux in any one branch, which affects both flow length and advance rate. Specifically, branching will slow and shorten flows, while merging can accelerate and lengthen them. To test these observations from historic eruptions and morphologic analysis, I use analogue experiments to simulate the interaction of a lava flow with a topographic obstacle and determine the conditions under which the flow branches and the effects of the bifurcation on flow advance rate. These experiments support the earlier results but also demonstrate the importance of flow dynamics and obstacle morphology on governing when flows may overtop obstacles. Consideration of channel networks is thus important for predicting lava flow behavior and mitigating flow hazards with <b>diversion</b> <b>barriers.</b> One video of Kilauea lava flow activity from 2003 - 2010 accompanies this dissertation as a supplemental file.

40|$|This is the publisher’s final pdf. The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] interfaces of fine over coarse porous material have been considered for use as barriers to infiltration for many years. Previous literature has developed analytical solutions for flow over such interfaces, numerical simulation of such flow, and the effects of anisotropy on the diversion capacity of such a system. In all of these analyses, however, the interface was assumed to consist of a constant slope, facilitating certain calculations. In this note it is shown that both from a performance perspective (as measured by the ability to divert fluid) and a design perspective (ease of computing diversion capacity) the shape of the interface should be curved, typically in a parabolic shape. Use of this shape is predicted to double <b>barrier</b> <b>diversion</b> capacity. Interfaces made up of easy to construct segmented approximations to the parabola are predicted to provide significantly enhanced performance as well...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{concern has}} arisen over {{potential}} fish mortality at hydropower facilities operating on water bodies that support resident, warmwater fisheries. At the Harry S. Truman hydropower facility, initial pumpback operations resulted in mortality of fish {{residing in the}} tailrace. This facility has a generating flow capacity of 60, 000 cfs and a pumpback capacity of 27, 500 cfs, and because of these large flows, the Kansas City District Corps of Engineers (COE) expressed concern over long-term impacts of the project to the fisheries resources of the area. Accordingly, COE suspended all pumpback operations and initiated studies of alternative fish protection methods that could be implemented to prevent further fish losses. A number of fish diversion systems and fish barriers were conceptually designed and studied to determine their potential for cost-effective application at the Truman Project. These methods included angled diversion screens and louvers, inclined plane <b>diversion</b> screens, <b>barrier</b> nets, and bar rack systems. Laboratory studies with live fish indicated that angled screens, louvers, and bar racks operating at reduced flow rates offered the best potential for preventing mortality. Based on these findings, a field study program was initiated at the Truman Project to 1) obtain {{a better understanding of}} which fish species in the tailrace area would be most susceptible to turbine passage, 2) determine what effect various reduced flow rates would have on the susceptibility of these fish to turbine passage, and 3) estimate the level of mortality due to turbine passage. The ultimate goal {{of the study was to}} supply the data necessary to identify the potential effectiveness of the alternative fish protection systems. This paper presents a discussion of the design and operation of the alternative systems and summarizes the studies that were conducted and the way in which the data were used to identify the potential effectiveness of each system.

40|$|Longitudinal {{connectivity}} of {{flowing water}} ecosystems has been dramatically altered by the widespread construction of dams, road crossings, and water <b>diversion</b> structures. These <b>barriers</b> limit {{the ability of}} fish to move among different habitats, escape disturbance, and breed with other populations. Strategic barrier removal has been recognized as an efficient means to benefit fish populations, {{and there is a}} major effort underway nationally to understand the effects of reduced connectivity on fish, identify the most significant barriers, and prioritize connectivity restoration for multiple objectives. This presentation will report on the progress of a multi-agency team in the Great Lakes Basin to build a common infrastructure for storage and analysis of fish passage barrier data. The team is focusing on road crossing barriers, which because of their sheer numbers, may represent a greater problem for fish passage than dams. The objectives of this effort include: designing a standardized road crossing assessment protocol; creating a centralized database for fish passage barrier assessment data; integrating analysis tools into this database that will allow users to quantify the connectivity status of watershed and prioritize barrier removal; and engaging a wide range of stakeholder groups, including federal, state, and tribal natural resource agencies, transportation agencies, and nonprofit and volunteer conservation groups...|$|R
40|$|We use {{selected}} {{monitoring data}} {{to illustrate how}} localized water <b>diversions</b> from seasonal <b>barriers,</b> gate operations, and export pumps alter water quality across the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (California). Dynamics of water-quality variability are complex because the Delta is a mixing zone {{of water from the}} Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, agricultural return water, and the San Francisco Estuary. Each source has distinct water-quality characteristics, and the contribution of each source varies in response to natural hydrologic variability and water diversions. We use simulations with a tidal hydrodynamic model to reveal how three diversion events, as case studies, influence water quality through their alteration of Delta-wide water circulation patterns and flushing time. Reduction of export pumping decreases the proportion of Sacramento- to San Joaquin-derived fresh water in the central Delta, leading to rapid increases in salinity. Delta Cross Channel gate operations control salinity in the western Delta and alter the freshwater source distribution in the central Delta. Removal of the head of Old River barrier, in autumn, increases the flushing time of the Stockton Ship Channel from days to weeks, contributing to a depletion of dissolved oxygen. Each shift in water quality has implications either for habitat quality or municipal drinking water, illustrating the importance of a systems view to anticipate the suite of changes induced by flow manipulations, and to minimize the conflicts inherent in allocations of scarce resources to meet multiple objectives...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2013 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 10 - 11, 2013, Athens, Georgia. In 14 major {{watersheds}} {{and thousands}} of miles of rivers, Georgia’s waterways provide some of the highest levels of aquatic biodiversity in the United States. Hydrologic disconnection by dams, roads, water <b>diversions,</b> and other <b>barriers</b> have led to local declines in both migratory and resident fishes. To counteract these trends, numerous organizations and stakeholders have invested in fish passage structures and dam removal. Techniques for prioritizing barrier improvement, measuring passage efficacy, and designing passage structures are rapidly developing in both research and practice. We review the status of fish passage improvement in the state of Georgia as it relates to two key topics. First, what methods exist (or are being developed) to prioritize barrier improvement? Second, what lessons have been learned from recent fish passage and dam removal projects? We address these questions by way of example projects conducted by a variety of agencies and entities. We conclude by summarizing some emerging challenges and opportunities for future research in fish passage improvement. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division; U. S.

40|$|Soil covers on {{mining waste}} are {{typically}} designed for temperate climates and often rely on fine-grained soils to limit net percolation. Mine sites in cold regions, such as Northern Canada, have limited fine-grained materials and have climates that reduce {{the effectiveness of}} designs utilized in more temperate climates. A new cover system that harnesses the cold climate and available coarse textured materials has been proposed. The cover system, a seasonally frozen capillary <b>barrier</b> <b>diversion</b> cover system, relies {{on the ability of}} frozen soils with high levels of water saturation, to divert infiltrating meltwater downslope and away from the underlying mine waste. The thermal effects of flowing water on heat transfer in the frozen soil were studied in this research. The potential for early thaw due to the convection and conduction associated with water flow was examined {{through the use of a}} numerical model to simulate several case studies and cover geometries. Vertical forced convection was investigated through a case study of frozen column experiments. Lateral convection was investigated through a case study of a natural analogue at Wolf Creek, Yukon, while conduction was investigated through a case study of ponding water and increased conduction. Illustrative cover design models incorporated climate data and idealized materials from a representative mine site into several different geometries, each representing a potential thermal failure mode. These simulations reveal that no one thermal process dominates in frozen soil. Lateral convection can dominate in sloped high hydraulic conductivity soil, given enough water is available to generate large lateral water flows. Under low flow conditions, the influence of lateral convection drops. Vertical convection will result when large amounts of water percolate vertically, causing greater thaw rates throughout the slope than by conduction alone. Conduction will occur regardless of water flow, but increased rates of conductive heat transfer can occur when water ponds on the ground surface, which results in increased rates of thaw leading to preferential infiltration of water below ponded areas. In finer layers of low hydraulic conductivity, conduction will always dominate, as water cannot achieve the flow rates necessary for convection to dominate. This research has shown that the proposed cover design is a viable alternative to the current practice. Further modelling, laboratory and field studies are recommended for future research...|$|R
