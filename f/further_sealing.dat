50|$|On 28 December 1814 Betsey, {{under the}} command of Philip Goodenough, left Sydney for Macquarie Island, where she arrived on 13 February 1815. Goodenough landed a sealing party of {{thirteen}} men and then headed north to the Auckland Islands to undertake <b>further</b> <b>sealing.</b> Contrary winds meant that Betsey was unable to return either to Macquarie Island or to Sydney.

Twenty miles from the Bay of Islands, with several of his crew dead from scurvy and the remaining crew starving and parched from lack of water, Goodenough ordered the ship abandoned. Fourteen Europeans and six lascars had left Macquarie Island. At the time of abandonment only twelve men were alive. Goodenough placed four in the jollyboat as they were so sick they could not crew a boat; the remainder took to the whaleboat, which towed the jollyboat. Goodenough then headed for New Zealand. Progress was very slow, and soon after abandoning Betsey, Goodenough ordered the rope between the jollyboat and the whaleboat to be cut. The four sick sailors were never seen again. Eventually Goodenough made land and shortly after landing a lascar died; Goodenough died shortly thereafter, on 1 November 1815.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Soil sealing has {{negative}} impacts on ecosystem services since urban green and soil get lost. Although there is political commitment to stop <b>further</b> <b>sealing,</b> no reversal {{of this trend}} {{can be observed in}} Europe. This paper raises the questions (1) which strategies can be regarded as being efficient toward ecologically sustainable management of urban soil sealing and (2) who has competences and should take responsibility to steer soil sealing? The analyses are conducted in Germany. The assessment of strategies is carried out using indicators as part of a content analysis. Legal-planning, informal-planning, economic-fiscal, co-operative, and informational strategies are analyzed. Results show that there is a sufficient basis of strategies to secure urban ecosystem services by protecting urban green and reducing urban gray where microclimate regulation is a main target. However, soil sealing management lacks a spatial strategically overview as well as the consideration of services provided by fertile soils...|$|E

With crystal lifetimes typically in the millisecond range and latest generation detector technologies with high framing rates up to 1 kHz, fast sample exchange has become a bottleneck for such experiments. We have developed a micro-patterned chip from single crystalline silicon which acts as a sample holder for up to thousands of microcrystals at a very low background level. The crystals can be easily loaded on the chip and excess mother liquor can be efficiently removed. Dehydration of the crystals is prevented by keeping them in a stream of humidified air during data collection. <b>Further</b> <b>sealing</b> of the sample holder, e. g. with Kapton, is not required.

40|$|Several {{tools are}} sold and {{recommended}} for closing and sealing flexible {{intermediate bulk containers}} (bulk bags) which are used to transport product that has been mined and processed. However, there is limited information on the risks, physical demands, or the benefits of using one tool over another. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the physical demands involved with two closing methods and several sealing tools in order to provide recommendations for selecting tools to reduce exposure to risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. In this study, twelve participants completed bag closing and sealing tasks using two different closing methods and eight sealing tools on two types of bulk bags. Physical demands and performance were evaluated using muscle activity, perceived exertion, subjective ratings of use, and time. Results indicate that using the "flowering" method to close bags required on average 32 % less muscle activity, 30 % less perceived exertion, 42 % less time, and was preferred by participants compared to using the "snaking" method. For sealing, there was no single method significantly better across all measures; however, using a pneumatic cable tie gun consistently had the lowest muscle activity and perceived exertion ratings. The pneumatic cable tie gun did require approximately 33 % more time to seal the bag compared to methods without a tool, but the amount of time to seal the bag was comparable to using other tools. <b>Further,</b> <b>sealing</b> a spout bulk bag required on average 13 % less muscle activity, 18 % less perceived exertion, 35 % less time, and was preferred by participants compared to sealing a duffle bulk bag. The current results suggest that closing the spout bag using the flowering method and sealing the bag using the pneumatic cable tie gun that is installed with a tool balancer is ergonomically advantageous. Our findings can help organizations select methods and tools that pose the lowest physical demands when closing and sealing bulk bags.

40|$|Large {{congenital}} diaphragmatic hernias {{are sealed}} using synthetic meshes or other biomaterials. In {{spite of the}} progress achieved {{in the development of}} improved biomaterials, there is still a demand for functionally enhanced meshes, in order to reduce both complication and recurrence rate. In the present work, {{on the way to the}} ideal mesh, already tested meshes were nano-surface modified and investigated in vivo for the first time. After coating of Ultrapro- and Prolene-meshes with six-armed star configured poly(ethylene oxide-stat-propylene oxide) based molecules (sP(EO-stat-PO)) a nanoweb spinning with short-time absorbable PLGA/sP(EO-stat-PO) (Polylactidecoglycolide with integrated sP(EO-stat-PO) molecules) was performed for air sealing at the diaphragm. For <b>further</b> <b>sealing</b> the meshes were additionally covered with a NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) -hydrogel. Six-armed sP(EO-stat-PO) -molecules react with each other. Up to four arms per molecule remain free, which can be loaded with active substances. This technology provides the possibility to modify meshes according to the requirements needed to influence wound healing or adhesion of surrounding cells. These requirements can vary depending on the localization of the implant and on the type of application. Iatrogenic generated diaphragmatic defects in growing rabbits were closed with three types of meshes (surface modified Ultrapro-, surface modified Prolene-mesh und Ultrapro-control mesh). Diaphragmatic mobility was radiologically determined preoperatively, two and four months after mesh implantation. After four months the meshes were explanted. Adhesive properties, defect size and mesh shrinkage were determined. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. In respect to their adhesive and histological properties as well as their impact on apoptosis and proliferation, on the number of myofibroblast, macrophages, and the collagen I/III ratio, surface modified base meshes showed no significant differences when compared to each other or to the control group. In contrast, the defect size was reduced for both modified meshes. Radiologically a good diaphragm excursion was seen. The surface modification described here shows an equally good biocompatibility compared to conventional meshes. Modified base meshes can therefore be used as carrier for bioactive substances. The possibility to apply these meshes at the diaphragm is further supported by the relative good diaphragm mobility, even after four months of implantation time...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{simulations of}} reactive transport {{which may be}} induced in the caprock of an on-shore depleted gas reservoir by the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide. The objective is to verify that CO{sub 2 } geological disposal activities currently being planned for the study area are safe and do not induce any undesired environmental impact. In our model, fluid flow and mineral alteration are induced in the caprock by penetration of high CO{sub 2 } concentrations from the underlying reservoir, where {{it was assumed that}} large amounts of CO{sub 2 } have already been injected at depth. The main focus is on the potential effect of precipitation and dissolution processes on the sealing efficiency of caprock formations. Concerns that some leakage may occur in the investigated system arise because the seal is made up of potentially highly-reactive rocks, consisting of carbonate-rich shales (calcite+dolomite averaging up to more than 30 % of solid volume fraction). Batch simulations and multi-dimensional 1 D and 2 D modeling have been used to investigate multicomponent geochemical processes. Numerical simulations account for fracture-matrix interactions, gas phase participation in multiphase fluid flow and geochemical reactions, and kinetics of fluid-rock interactions. The geochemical processes and parameters to which the occurrence of high CO{sub 2 } concentrations are most sensitive are investigated by conceptualizing different mass transport mechanisms (i. e. diffusion and mixed advection+diffusion). The most relevant mineralogical transformations occurring in the caprock are described, and the feedback of these geochemical processes on physical properties such as porosity is examined to evaluate how the sealing capacity of the caprock could evolve in time. The simulations demonstrate that the occurrence of some gas leakage from the reservoir may have a strong influence on the geochemical evolution of the caprock. In fact, when a free CO{sub 2 }-dominated phase migrates into the caprock through fractures, or through zones with high initial porosity possibly acting as preferential flow paths for reservoir fluids, low pH values are predicted, accompanied by significant calcite dissolution and porosity enhancement. In contrast, when fluid-rock interactions occur under fully liquid-saturated conditions and a diffusion-controlled regime, pH will be buffered at higher values, and some calcite precipitation is predicted which leads to <b>further</b> <b>sealing</b> of the storage reservoir...|$|E
