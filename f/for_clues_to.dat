5|$|At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler {{attempts}} to assassinate the President of the United States but fails and escapes. Meanwhile, Wolverine explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> his past, but finds nothing. He returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go {{to question the}} imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X-Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Meanwhile, military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier.

5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> the crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.|$|E
5|$|Zoran Lazarević is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Graham McTavish. He is a homicidal Serbian terrorist. The {{majority of the world}} believes he is dead after a bombing, but he survives with half of his face scarred. Lazarevic pays Flynn to betray Drake, tricking him into giving Flynn information on the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and causing Drake's arrest. In reality, Lazarevic wants to possess the mythic Cintamani Stone, which the fleet was supposedly transporting. He discovers that the fleet never had the stone, and dispatches a group of mercenaries to Nepal <b>for</b> <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> the location of the legendary city of Shambhala. He incites a civil war in the region to aid in his search and distract from any possible discovery. In Nepal, Lazarevic personally executes Fisher's cameraman Jeff, and follows Drake after he discovers the location of Shambhala's entrance. Lazarevic invades the small Tibetan village harboring Drake and Elena, seeking the key to reveal Shambhala. He kidnaps Schäfer and forces him to reveal the general area of the entrance. When Drake and Fisher follow, Lazarevic apprehends them and forces Drake to reveal the entrance to Shambhala. There, he drinks the sap of the Cintamani Stone, which is made of the sap of the Tree of Life. He battles Drake with his newfound powers, but is defeated by Drake and beaten by the guardians of Shambhala and assumingly killed when the temple falls apart. He appears later along with Harry Flynn and Eddy Raja in the online co-op story in Uncharted 3. Lazarevic uses a pump-action shotgun as his main weapon.|$|E

After venturing to the island, Erdrick was never heard from again. Many years later, during King LorikXVI's reign, the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin. Many heroes tried to rescue the princess and recover the Ball of Light from the Dragonlord's castle, called Charlock, but none succeeded. The prophet Mahetta predicted that [...] "One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord." [...] However, when the descendant (the game's hero) arrives, {{many of the people}} of Alefgard have forgotten the story of Erdrick, and those few who do remember consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta's prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|The {{headless}} body of {{an unidentified}} male {{was found in}} a boxcar in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on July 1, 1936.

In September 1940 an article in the New Castle News refers to the killer as [...] "The Murder Swamp Killer". The almost identical similarities between the victims in New Castle to those in Cleveland, Ohio, coupled with the similarities between New Castle's Murder Swamp and Cleveland's Kingsbury Run, both of which were directly connected by a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, were enough to convince Cleveland Detective Peter Merylo that the New Castle murders were the work of the [...] "Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run".
