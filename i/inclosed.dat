25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be <b>inclosed</b> by the rest; and the color used for the <b>inclosed</b> county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

500|$|Even {{before the}} {{convention}} approved the Declaration of Rights, Mason was busy {{at work on}} a constitution for Virginia. He {{was not the only one}} occupying himself so; Jefferson sent several versions from Philadelphia, one of which supplied the eventual constitution's preamble. Essex County's Meriwether Smith may have prepared a draft, but the text is unknown. As an original writing in Mason's hand is not known, the extent to which the final draft was written by him is uncertain. Nevertheless, William Fleming on June 22, 1776, sent Jefferson a copy of the draft before the Cary Committee, telling him [...] "the <b>inclosed</b> [...] printed plan was drawn by Colo. G. Mason and by him laid before the committee".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{household}} {{did not go}} into mourning (it was not prescribed for royal children younger than fourteen), his parents took the loss harshly. According to Lady Charlotte Finch, the Queen [...] "cried vastly" [...] and was [...] "very much hurt by her loss and the King also." [...] Later in August 1782 the Queen sent Finch a lock of Alfred's hair stating [...] "Receive This ... as an Acknowledgement for Your very affectionate attendance upon my dear little Angel Alfred, and wear the <b>inclosed</b> Hair, not only in remembrance of that dear Object, {{but also as a}} mark of esteem from Your Affectionate Queen". Alfred was buried at Westminster Abbey, though his remains were later moved to the Royal Vault in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 11 February 1820. His father continued to dwell on his death, and the sight of Alfred's posthumous portrait in a family painting by Thomas Gainsborough nearly a year after Alfred's death sent his three eldest sisters into tears. Six months after Alfred's death, his elder brother Octavius succumbed to the smallpox virus, further devastating the king. During one of his bouts of madness in 1812, George would have imaginary conversations with his two youngest sons.|$|E

500|$|... "A parish, in the poorlaw {{union of}} Cardiff, hundred of Kibbor, county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, 3½ miles (N. W. by W.) from Cardiff; {{containing}} 279 inhabitants. This parish probably derives its name, signifying [...] "a cataract," [...] from the rushing {{waters of the}} river Tâf, by which it is bounded on the north-east. It was formerly comprehended within the hundred of Miskin, but has been recently separated therefrom. It comprises about eleven hundred acres of arable and pasture land, <b>inclosed</b> and in a profitable state of cultivation: the surface is in some parts elevated, and in others flat, but no where subject to inundation; the soil is a strong brown earth, favourable {{to the production of}} good crops of grain of all kinds, potatoes, and hay. The substratum is partly a hard brown stone, and partly limestone of very good quality. Radyr Court, formerly the seat of the family of Matthew, ancestors of the late Lord Llandaf, has been partially taken down, and the remainder has been modernised, and converted into a farmhouse. The turnpike-road leading from Cardiff to Llantrissent passes a little to the south of the parish; and the Tâf-Vale railway runs through it, nearly parallel with the river, which is crossed by the line in this vicinity. Some of the inhabitants are employed at the iron-works in the parish of Pentyrch.|$|E

2500|$|The Library absorbed smaller lending {{libraries}} and outgrew its rooms, renting larger {{space on the}} second floor of the new Carpenters' Company hall in 1773. [...] "The Books (<b>inclosed</b> within Wire Lattices) are kept in one large Room," [...] Franklin was informed in London, [...] "and in another handsome Apartment the [...] Apparatus is deposited and the Directors meet." [...] On September 5, 1774, the First Continental Congress met on the first floor of Carpenters' Hall, and the Library Company extended members' privileges to all the delegates. The offer was renewed when the Second Continental Congress met the following spring, and again when the delegates to the Constitutional Convention met in 1787. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence — Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Rush, Francis Hopkinson, Robert Morris, George Clymer, John Morton, James Wilson, Thomas McKean, and George Ross — owned shares, some of them serving as directors. The Library Company served virtually as the Library of Congress until the national capital was established in 1800.|$|E

If, on the other hand, the lines meant are such [...] straight lines as we do meet with in experience, lines straight [...] enough for practical purposes, but in reality slightly zigzag, and [...] with some, however trifling, breadth; as applied to these lines the [...] axiom is not true, for two of them may, and sometimes do, <b>inclose</b> a [...] small portion of space.

2500|$|Alexander II was a {{constant}} target for assassination attempts, one of which occurred inside the Winter Palace itself. This attempt on the Tsar's life was organized by a group known as Narodnaya Volya (Will of the People) and led by an [...] "unsmiling fanatic", Andrei Zhelyabov, and his mistress Sophia Perovskaya, who later became his wife. Perovskaya, {{the daughter of a}} former Governor of Saint Petersburg, was well placed to learn information concerning happenings within the palace and through her connections learnt of repairs being carried out in the palace's basement. One of the group, a trained carpenter, was subsequently enrolled as one of the workmen. Every day he carried dynamite charges concealed amongst his tools, placing them beneath the private dining room. So great was the quantity of dynamite that the fact there was an intervening floor between the dining room and the basement was of no significance. Plans were made to detonate the bomb on the evening of , assassinating the Tsar and Imperial family as they dined. Fortunately for the Romanovs, a guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, {{and for the first time}} in years dinner was delayed. As the family left the drawing room for the dining room the bomb exploded. So great was the explosion that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. The dining room was completely demolished and 11 members of the Finnish Guard in the Guard Room below were killed and a further 30 wounded. The incident represents one of the first uses of a time bomb for political purposes. The New York Times (March 4, 1880) reported [...] "the dynamite used was <b>inclosed</b> in an iron box, and exploded by a system of clockwork used by the man Thomas in Bremen some years ago." ...|$|E
