If Buddhist monks [...] "see, hear or know" [...] a living animal was killed {{specifically}} {{for them to}} eat, they must refuse it or else <b>incur</b> an <b>offense.</b> However, {{this does not include}} eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased. In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant meat, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.|$|R

[...] No sooner had she reached it, than Mr. Lush was there, and had the burnous in his hand: to annoy this supercilious young lady, he would <b>incur</b> the <b>offense</b> of forestalling Grandcourt; and, holding up the garment close to Gwendolen, he said, [...] "Pray, permit me?"

5000|$|Traditional islamic {{jurisprudence}} divides crimes into offenses against God {{and those}} against man. The former {{are seen to}} violate God's hudud, or 'boundaries'. These punishments were specified by the Quran, {{and in some instances}} by the Sunnah. The <b>offenses</b> <b>incurring</b> hudud punishments are zina (unlawful sexual intercourse), unfounded accusations of zina, consuming intoxicants, highway robbery, and some forms of theft. Jurists have differed as to whether apostasy and rebellion against a lawful Islamic ruler are hudud crimes.|$|R

This {{project was}} {{developed}} in the Laboratory of Plasma for Fusion Energy Applications at Tecnológico de Costa Rica, it has approximately 25 contributors, among which researchers and students engaged in various projects. The main processes that take place are referred to research nuclear fusion, magnetic confinement devices, plasmas and industrial waste treatment. To carry out the project started with a detailed identification of hazards for each process and equipments, then a respective assessment of each risk group {{and with the help of}} various tools and regulations, Occupational Safety Program was created, since the laboratory for about seven years it has developed its investigations without a formal document that standards for all security features relating to each of its processes. In addition, were established alternatives of control engineering and administrative, to promote improvements in the areas of job safety, all with the purpose of raising awareness on the issue of accident prevention, which subsequently can <b>incur</b> serious <b>offenses</b> that affect the optimum functioning of the Laboratory of Plasmas.

40|$|AbstractThis is a stylistic {{analysis}} of an extract from Dickens’s Great Expectations. The {{focus is on}} impoliteness incurred in a convivial setting of a Christmas dinner among low class people. As {{a result of the}} {{analysis of}} the text, I propose to establish another variety of impoliteness, namely “underpoliteness”. This is impoliteness exercised without malice or spite which occasionally appears to be incidental and a result of socializing habits. Nevertheless, similar to other types of rudeness it creates feelings of discomfort, disharmony and even revenge. The analysis is made at the micro level of single utterances. Occasionally, more than one utterance is taken into consideration for the reconstruction of the speech activity to assist determining the exact degree of <b>offense</b> <b>incurred.</b> The method of analysis depends on positive and negative impoliteness strategies as proposed by Culpeper (1996, 2003). This is complemented with a reversal of Leech’s 1983 politeness maxims. The heart of this paper comprises analysis of interaction in the Christmas dinner in Great Expectations...|$|R

Abstract Background: Until the investigations indicate that addictive substances in transport are serious social and security problem. Studies attribute {{the most efficient}} for drivers caught several times - repeatedly with a concentration of 1. 5 g / kg and higher, unfortunately, but at higher concentrations higher probability of risk of addiction, {{which is due to}} natures rehabilitation programs, counterproductive, because mastering addiction is not the goal of the course (Ferguson et. all., 2001). Goals: The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the issue of traffic offenses where the offender is in a state of excluding fitness to drive, which brought about the consumption of addictive substances and follow-up upon return of a driving license in the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015.

25|$|While Middlebury College {{certainly}} {{began the}} sporting craze for quidditch, an independent {{form of the}} sport originated {{in the early spring}} of 2007 {{on the campus of the}} University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, Georgia. This version of the sport uses a Flying Disk as its quaffle, dodge balls as bludgers, and a golden-yellow 'super ball' for the snitch. This form of the game (known affectionately as 'Corrigan Quidditch' after its originator, an English professor at the university who taught a Harry Potter class that term and developed the game for tournament play as an outgrowth of that course) does not call for players to hold a broom between the legs. Additionally, all of the playing apparatus is located within the playing pitch (quaffle, bludgers, snitch, beater's bats, and keeper's brooms). The two brooms are used only to defend the goals, which rise five, ten, and fifteen feet above the pitch at each end of an elongated octagonal playing field approximately 200 feet long. 'Corrigan Quidditch', as does the Middlebury version, has its own official rule book but features whimsical offenses including a 'Queensbury' (moving both feet whilst holding the quaffle) and an 'Impermissible' (which allows the offended chaser to run with the quaffle (without <b>incurring</b> a Queensbury <b>offense)</b> and make a 'try' at the goals, defended only by the opposing keeper). Play includes non-participating teams who stand around the pitch and take control of both 'bludgering' players as well as 'sending off' the snitch at irregular intervals during play to allow the seekers (who are kept secret during play) to attempt a game-winning catch. 'Corrigan Quidditch' was the form of play originally covered in the world press during that significant summer when the seventh Harry Potter book (and fifth Harry Potter movie) was released. Unlike the world-popular Middlebury version, 'Corrigan Quidditch' remains a local event still played on its originating campus.|$|R
