500|$|The {{springbok}} ( [...] ; Antidorcas marsupialis) is {{a medium-sized}} antelope found mainly in southern and southwestern Africa. The sole {{member of the}} genus Antidorcas, this bovid was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780. Three subspecies are identified. A slender, long-legged antelope, the springbok reaches [...] at the shoulder and weighs between [...] Both sexes have a pair of black, [...] long horns that curve backwards. The springbok is characterised by a white face, a dark stripe running from the eyes to the mouth, a light-brown coat marked by a reddish-brown stripe that runs from the upper <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> to the buttocks across the flanks, and a white rump flap.|$|E
2500|$|Beat Two: the {{simultaneous}} grounding {{phase of the}} inside hind leg and outside <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b> The inside <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> is still off the ground. The outside hind leg (beat one), is still touching the ground, but {{is about to be}} lifted off. [...] At the gallop, this beat is divided, with the inside hind landing first, making the gallop a four-beat gait ...|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 50 {{million years}} ago, in the early-to-middle Eocene, Eohippus {{smoothly}} transitioned into Orohippus through a gradual series of changes. Although its name means [...] "mountain horse", Orohippus {{was not a}} true horse and did not live in the mountains. It resembled Eohippus in size, but had a slimmer body, an elongated head, slimmer forelimbs, and longer hind legs, {{all of which are}} characteristics of a good jumper. Although Orohippus was still pad-footed, the vestigial outer toes of Eohippus were not present in Orohippus; there were four toes on each <b>fore</b> <b>leg,</b> and three on each hind leg.|$|E

50|$|The {{males of}} P. alceae were {{reported}} to court with an elaborate dance. The courting male may move his <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> {{up and down in}} front of the female. He may also shake his <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> turn sidewise to his partner and lift one of his wings, tap on the head or thorax of the partner and probe her with his proboscis (mouthparts).|$|R
50|$|The head is brown to black, {{with fine}} scales. The <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> {{similarly}} possess fine scales. The limbs generally have five claws, which are darkly colored at their base. The hind legs are noticeably thicker than the <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> almost plump. The particularly strong tail {{ends in a}} spike, which may be very large in older male specimens. Females have noticeably smaller tail spikes, which are slightly bent toward the body.|$|R
2500|$|An {{additional}} amber fossil, JZC Bu1646, entombed two fighting Gerontoformica workers. [...] The smaller G. tendir {{worker is}} gripping the right antennae between its mandibles. The larger G. spiralis worker is in turn in gripping the right <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> protarsus between its left mandible and clypeus comb. [...] Each ant is missing several antennae segments, and a bubble is exuding from the broken {{tip of the}} G. spiralis antennae. [...] The bubble indicates the workers were alive while being entombed. [...] Though fighting, neither of the workers has their metasoma curled under {{in an attempt to}} sting their foe, as is seen in modern ant fighting.|$|E
60|$|Harry {{proved to}} be right. On {{reaching}} the spot they found a beautiful black fox, caught by the <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> in a steel trap, and gazing at them {{with a look of}} terror.|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} {{lasted only}} five minutes; but Neal {{would have said}} an hour had passed since he was first seized, and then Cummings won the victory by slipping from the alligator's back regardless of the rapidly moving tail, and stabbing him under the <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The horse {{does not}} move his <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> {{backwards}} toward his hind legs, {{so that they are}} more under his body, but rather keep them perpendicular to the ground.|$|R
60|$|Pancrazio {{went back}} over the stream with the light. Alvina saw the dim ass come up, wander uneasily to the stream, plant his <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> and sniff the water, his nose right down.|$|R
50|$|The Stenopodainae are a {{subfamily}} of Reduviidae (assassin bugs). Many {{species of}} this subfamily are endemic to tropical rainforests, and some smear their <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> with sticky, plant-derived resin, {{to aid in}} prey capture.|$|R
60|$|But Buck {{possessed a}} quality that made for greatness--imagination. He fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though {{attempting}} the old shoulder trick, {{but at the last}} instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz's left <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b> There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b> Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time {{he was the one who}} was beaten.|$|E
60|$|It {{did seem}} that the Indians would head them off. Neale and King labored over the rocky ground as best they could, and by dint of hard effort came up with their party. The Indians were {{quartering}} the other ridge, riding as if on level ground. The going grew rougher. Baxter's horse slipped and lamed his right <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b> Henney's saddle turned, and more valuable time was lost. All the men drew their rifles. At every dip of ground they expected {{to come to a}} break that would make a stand inevitable.|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Mills benignantly {{dismissed}} me, saying, 'Go back to Dora!' and I went; and Dora {{leaned out}} of the carriage to talk to me, and we talked {{all the rest of}} the way; and I rode my gallant grey so close to the wheel that I grazed his near <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> against it, and 'took the bark off', as his owner told me, 'to the tune of three pun' sivin'--which I paid, and thought extremely cheap for so much joy. What time Miss Mills sat looking at the moon, murmuring verses--and recalling, I suppose, the ancient days when she and earth had anything in common.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are surely}} mistaken, sir," [...] said Solomon, with the gravity {{that comes from}} great wisdom, [...] "these are our dog's <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> are they not?" [...] {{pointing}} to the front legs of the dog.|$|R
5000|$|Torynorrhina flammea {{can reach}} a body length of about 30 - 35 mm. In the females tibia of <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> are wider. This species is {{characterized}} by great variability in colours (cobalt blue, emerald green, scarlet red, etc.).|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes'm," [...] Miller said absently. He {{lifted one}} of Wolf's <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> and {{examined}} the foot-pads, pressing them and denting them with his thumb. [...] "Kind of soft," [...] he remarked. [...] "He ain't been on trail for a long time." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the exact}} {{dimensions}} {{of this particular}} bear were taken and noted down on the spot, we will give them here {{for the benefit of}} inquiring minds. It weighed, as nearly as could be guessed by men who were practised in estimating weights, 600 pounds. On its hind legs it stood 8 feet 7 inches. Round the chest it measured 5 feet 10 inches; round the neck 3 feet 11 inches. The circumference of the thickest part of the <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> was 2 feet, and the length of each of its claws was 4 and a quarter inches. It was whitey-brown in colour, and a shaggier, fiercer, uglier monster could not well be imagined.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the black}} fought at a disadvantage, {{for he was}} on but three feet and his neck was drawn about in an awkward and unnatural position. His efforts became weaker and weaker. The boy talked incessantly {{to him in a}} quiet voice, and there was a shadow of a smile upon his lips. Now he bore heavily upon the black withers, pulling the horse toward him. Slowly the beast sank upon his bent knee--pulling {{backward}} until his off <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> was stretched straight before him. Then, with a final surge, the youth pulled him over upon his side, and, as he fell, slipped prone beside him. One sinewy hand shot to the rope just beneath the black chin--the other grasped a slim, pointed ear.|$|E
60|$|Far {{up on the}} {{hillside}} in a little opening of the woods the scattered pack came together again. At the first uproar, so unbearable to a silence-loving animal, they had vanished in five different directions; yet so subtle, so perfect is the instinct which holds a wolf family together that the old mother had scarcely entered the glade alone {{and sat down to}} wait and listen when the other wolves joined her silently. Malsunsis, the big cub, scarcely felt his wound at first, for the arrow had but glanced through the thick skin and flesh, and he had torn it out without difficulty; but the old he-wolf limped painfully and held up one <b>fore</b> <b>leg,</b> pierced by a seal shot, as he loped away over the snow.|$|E
30|$|Biology. The female {{specimen}} documented for {{the present}} paper (FigureÂ  3 B,C) has numerous pollen grains sticking to the setulae of the proboscis and on the <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> strongly indicating that the adults of this species have a habit of visiting flowers.|$|R
60|$|Peter looked, {{and sure}} enough there was a pollywog {{with a pair of}} legs {{sprouting}} out. They were his <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> and they certainly did make him look funny. And only a few days before there hadn't been a sign of legs.|$|R

6000|$|... "Come along, Doctor," [...] he said; [...] "we shall go {{and look}} him up. I'll {{tell you one thing}} which may help you in the case," [...] he continued, turning to the two detectives. [...] "There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b> In all {{probability}} the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you." ...|$|E
60|$|The first terrier {{was back}} upon him, {{and he was}} {{whirling}} to meet it, when a new and equally unprovoked assault was made upon him. This time it was Captain Duncan, in a rage at sight of his slain cat. The instep of his foot caught Michael squarely under the chest, half knocking the breath out of him and wholly lifting him into the air, so that he fell heavily on his side. The two terriers were upon him, filling their mouths with his straight, wiry hair as they sank their teeth in. Still on his side, as {{he was beginning to}} struggle to his feet, he clipped his jaws together on a leg of one, who screamed with pain and retreated on three legs, holding up the fourth, a <b>fore</b> <b>leg,</b> the bone of which Michael's teeth had all but crushed.|$|E
60|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{was indeed}} exhausted, and allowed {{itself to be}} dragged ashore at the next effort without opposition. As soon as it did so he was attacked with spears by the hunters, Jethro, and the boys. The latter found that {{they were unable to}} drive their weapons through the thick skin, and betook themselves to their bows and arrows. The hunters, however, knew the points at which the skin was thinnest, and drove their spears deep into the animal just behind the <b>fore</b> <b>leg,</b> while the boys shot their arrows at its mouth. Another noose had been thrown over its head as it issued from the water, and the peasants pulling on the ropes prevented it from charging. Three or four more thrusts were given from the hunters; then one of the spears touched a vital part--the hippopotamus sank on its knees and rolled over dead.|$|E
50|$|Manx {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} cats, broad-chested with sloping shoulders and flat sides, and in show condition are firmly muscular and lean, neither bulky nor fatty. Lane reported the original, native, naturally occurring pure breed as ranging typically from {{eight to ten}} pounds for males and six to eight pounds for females, with many smaller examples but only rare ones larger. The hind legs of Manx are notably longer than the <b>fore</b> <b>legs,</b> causing the rump {{to be higher than}} the shoulder and creating a continuous arch from shoulders to rump giving the cat an overall rounded or humped appearance, though the breed is comparatively long when stretched out. The <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> are strong and straight. The shape is often described as rabbit-like.|$|R
50|$|Siren is a genus {{of aquatic}} {{salamanders}} {{of the family}} Sirenidae. The genus consists of two living species, along with one extinct species from the Eocene Epoch and three from the Miocene. The two living species have elongated, eel-like bodies, with two small vestigial <b>fore</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under Side. Palpi white, {{tipped with}} black. <b>Fore</b> <b>legs</b> red underneath, and black above, the ends being black: the other legs grey, the tips black.

6000|$|P.S. Some day I shall {{write a book}} (for the profession), and entitle it, [...] "Around the World on the Hospital Ship Snark." [...] Even our pets {{have not}} escaped. We sailed from Meringe Lagoon with two, an Irish terrier and a white cockatoo. The terrier fell down the cabin {{companionway}} and lamed its nigh hind leg, then repeated the manoeuvre and lamed its off <b>fore</b> <b>leg.</b> At the present moment it has but two legs to walk on. Fortunately, they are on opposite sides and ends, {{so that she can}} still dot and carry two. The cockatoo was crushed under the cabin skylight and had to be killed. This was our first funeral--though for that matter, the several chickens we had, and which would have made welcome broth for the convalescents, flew overboard and were drowned. Only the cockroaches flourish. Neither illness nor accident ever befalls them, and they grow larger and more carnivorous day by day, gnawing our finger-nails and toe-nails while we sleep.|$|E
60|$|If ever a pig in this sublunary sphere regretted {{a foolish}} act, that Pitcairn pig {{must have been}} steeped in repentance to the latest day of its life. With one howl in unison, the entire field, minus the infants, ran at that pig like a human tornado. It was of no avail that the pig made {{straight}} for the gate by which it had entered. That gate had either removed or shut itself. In frantic haste, the unhappy creature coursed round the square, followed by its pursuers, who soon caught it by the tail, then by an ear, then by the nose and the other ear, and a <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> and two hind ones, and finally hurled it over the fence, amid a torrent of shrieks which only a Pitcairn pig could utter or a Pitcairn mind conceive. It fell with a bursting squeak, and retired in grumpy silence to ruminate over the dire consequences of a too earnest gaze {{in the face of}} a child.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the astonished team-dogs had {{burst out of}} their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such dogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins. They were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them terrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by three huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. The din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and Sol-leks, dripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. Joe was snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on the <b>fore</b> <b>leg</b> of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike, the malingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. The warm taste of {{it in his mouth}} goaded him to greater fierceness. He flung himself upon another, {{and at the same time}} felt teeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.|$|E
50|$|Southern dwarf sirens are thin, slimy {{salamanders}} {{that are}} frequently mistaken for eels. They have long bodies with bushy gills and small, three-toed <b>fore</b> <b>legs.</b> Coloration is generally brown, black, or gray, with yellow or tan stripes {{on their backs}} and sides. Adults reach a length of 10-25 cm.|$|R
50|$|Wingspan of male {{is about}} 50mm and 40mm in female. Fore wings {{with a very}} large tuft of hair beyond the cell below costa in male, and the costal nervules curved. Fore wings with veins 8 to 10 stalked in both sexes. Male has greyish red-brown base color. Head, collar and abdomen crimson. Coxa of <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> and tibia of <b>fore</b> and mid <b>legs</b> are crimson. Female has a white spot at end of cell of fore wings.|$|R
50|$|Insects in {{this family}} are {{commonly}} called stilt-legged flies, after their characteristically long <b>legs.</b> The <b>fore</b> <b>legs</b> are markedly smaller than the other pairs. Mostly, they are long-bodied, often black flies, usually with infuscated (darkened) wings. Wings are reduced in the genera Calycopteryx and entirely absent in the ant-like Badisis ambulans.|$|R
