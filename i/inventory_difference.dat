40|$|The {{operation}} of the Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) {{is based on the}} electrometallurgical processing of spent metallic reactor fuel. The pin casting operation, although only one of several operations in FCF, was the first to be on-line. As such, it has served to demonstrate the material accountancy system in many of its facets. This paper details, for the {{operation of}} the pin casting process with depleted uranium, the interaction between the mass tracking system (MTG) and some of the ancillary computer codes which generate pertinent information for operations and material accountancy. It is necessary to distinguish between two types of material balance calculations [...] closeout for operations and material accountancy for safeguards. The two have much in common, for example, the mass tracking system database and the calculation of an <b>inventory</b> <b>difference,</b> but, in general, are not congruent with regard to balance period and balance spatial domain.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the Fuel conditioning Facility (FCF) {{is based on the}} electrometallurgical processing of spent metallic reactor fuel. It differs significantly, therefore, from traditional PUREX process facilities in both processing technology and safeguards implications. For example, the fissile material is processed in FCF only in batches and is transferred within the facility only as solid, well-characterized items; there are no liquid steams containing fissile material within the facility, nor entering or leaving the facility. The analysis of a single batch lends itself also to an analytical relationship between the safeguards criteria, such as alarm limit, detection probability, and maximum significant amount of fissile material, and the accounting system`s performance, as it is reflected in the variance associated with the estimate of the <b>inventory</b> <b>difference.</b> This relation, together with the sensitivity of the <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> to the uncertainties in the measurements, allows a thorough evaluation {{of the power of the}} accounting system. The system for the accountancy of the fissile material in the FCF has two main components: a system to gather and store information during the {{operation of}} the facility, and a system to interpret this information with regard to meeting safeguards criteria. These are described and the precision of the inventory closure over one batch evaluated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a safeguards approach {{that can be}} deployed at any modern plutonium processing facility to increase the level of safeguards assurance and significantly reduce the impact of safeguards on process operations. One of the most perplexing problems facing the designers of plutonium processing facilities is the constraint placed upon the limit of error of the <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> (LEID). The current DOE manual constrains the LEID for Category I and II material balance areas to 2 per cent of active inventory up to a Category II quantity of the material being processed. For 239 Pu a Category II quantity is two kilograms. Due to the large material throughput anticipated {{for some of the}} modern plutonium facilities, the required LEID cannot be achieved reliably during a nominal two month inventory period, even by using state-of-the-science non-destructive assay (NDA) methods. The most cost-effective and least disruptive solution appears to be increasing the frequency of material balance closure and thus reducing the throughput being measured during each inventory period. Current inventory accounting practices and systems can already provide the book inventory values at any point in time. However, closing the material balance with measured values has typically required the process to be cleaned out, and in-process materials packaged and measured. This process requires one to two weeks of facility down time every two months for each inventory, thus significantly reducing productivity. To provide a solution to this problem, a non-traditional approach is proposed that will include using in-line instruments to provide measurement of the process materials on a near real-time basis. A new software component will be developed that will operate with the standard LANMAS application to provide the running material balance reconciliation, including the calculation of the <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> and variance propagation. The combined measurement system and software implementation will make it possible for a facility to close material balances on a measured basis in a time period as short as one day...|$|E
40|$|Hold-up of {{processing}} facilities is an insidious problem from both safety and safeguards point of view.

40|$|How {{different}} are retailers' inventory levels {{around the}} world? Specifically, are retailers' inventories constant across countries, converging, {{or at least}} co-integrating?

For this purpose a reference time is considered which contains a sequence of n inventory periods, i. e. during this reference time a physical inventory is performed n times and compared with the book inventory at that time. A decision problem arises if all necessary measurements can only be performed with limited accuracy as in this case one has to decide if a book-physical <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> is caused by missing material or simply by measurement errors.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Large {{discrepancies}} {{exist among}} data-based estimates and model reconstructions {{of the ocean}} bomb radiocar-bon inventory. In order to resolve this gap, it has been proposed that the CO 2 piston velocity should be revised downward (Sweeney et al. 2007; MÃ¼ller et al. 2008). This article compares the transient 14 C distributions in the ocean obtained with dif-ferent formulations of the isotopic ratio commonly used in modeling studies. It is found that both the CO 2 increase and the air-sea CO 2 flux significantly contribute to the 1990 ocean bomb 14 C inventory, by around 10 % each. Moreover, these 2 processes explain more than 25 % of the <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> between 1974 and 1990. These results imply that, as already argued by Naegler (2009), inventories based on observations that lack information about CO 2 invasion are underestimated. Further, this work provides insight into the reasons for discrepancies among model results. It suggests that while a comprehensive isotopic formulation is needed when addressing the global 14 C cycle, a simplified form is more relevant for model calibration and pis-ton velocity assessment based on currently available bomb 14 C inventories...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{documentation}} of the precision and bias of holdup (residual nuclear material remaining in processing equipment) measurements and presents previously unreported results. Precision and bias results for holdup measurements are reported from training seminars with simulated holdup, which represent the best possible results, and compared to actual plutonium processing facility measurements. Holdup measurements for plutonium and uranium processing plants are also compared to reference values. Recommendations for measuring holdup are provided for highly enriched uranium facilities and for low enriched uranium facilities. The random error component of holdup measurements {{is less than the}} systematic error component. The most likely factor in measurement error is incorrect assumptions about the measurement, such as background, measurement geometry, or signal attenuation. Measurement precision on the order of 10 % can be achieved with some difficulty. Bias of poor quality holdup measurement can also be improved. However, for most facilities, holdup measurement errors have no significant impact on <b>inventory</b> <b>difference,</b> sigma, or safety (criticality, radiation, or environmental); therefore, it is difficult to justify the allocation of more resources to improving holdup measurements. 25 refs., 10 tabs...|$|E

40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) treats spent {{nuclear fuel}} using an electrometallurgical process that {{separates}} the uranium from the fission products, sodium thermal bond and cladding materials. Material accountancy is necessary at FCF for two reasons: first, it provides a mechanism for detecting a potential loss of nuclear material for safeguards and security; second, it provides a periodic check of inventories to ensure that processes and material are under control. By weighing material entering and leaving a process, and using sampling results to determine composition, an <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> (ID) results when the measured inventory is compared to the predicted inventory. The ID and its uncertainty, based on error propagation, determines the degree of assurance that an operation proceeded according to expectations. FCF uses the ID calculation in two ways: closeout, which is the ID and uncertainty for a particular operational step, and material accountancy, which determines an ID and its associated uncertainty for a material balance area through several operational steps. Material accountancy over the whole facility for a specified time period assists in detecting diversion of nuclear material. Data from depleted uranium operations are presented to illustrate the method used in FCF...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to evaluate reported inventories of plutonium contained in stored transuranic (TRU) waste generated by the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP). From 1970 to 1989, this waste was shipped to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and placed in aboveground retrievable storage at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) -Transuranic Storage Area (TSA). This evaluation was initiated to address potential uncertainty in quantities of stored plutonium reported in the Radioactive Waste Management Information System (RWMIS). The RWMIS includes radionuclide information from generators that shipped TRU waste to INEL for storage. Recent evaluations performed on buried TRU waste (1954 - 1970) resulted in significant revision to the original reported values of plutonium, americium, and enriched uranium. These evaluations were performed based on Rocky Flats Plant (RFP) <b>Inventory</b> <b>Difference</b> (ID) records. This evaluation for stored TRU waste was performed to: (1) identify if significant discrepancies exist between RWMIS reported values and RFP ID records, (2) describe the methodology used to perform the RWMIS evaluation, (3) determine a Best Estimate (BE) and 95 % Upper Confidence Bound (UB) on the plutonium inventory, (4) provide conclusions based on this evaluation, and (5) identify recommendations and/or actions that might be needed...|$|E

In this study, the effectiveness of three methods for sampling syrphids(Diptera: Syrphidae) in tropical forests is compared: Malaise trapping, collecting adults with an entomological net, and collecting and rearing immatures. Surveys were made from 2008 to 2011 in six tropical forest sites in Costa Rica. The results revealed signiÃcant differences in the composition and richness of syrphid faunas obtained by each method. Collecting immatures was the most successful method based on numbers of species and individuals, whereas Malaise trapping was the least effective. This pattern of sampling effectiveness was independent of syrphid trophic or functional group and annual season. An advantage of collecting immatures over collecting adults is {{the quality and quantity}} of associated biological data obtained by the former method. However, complementarity between results of collecting adults and collecting immatures, showed that a combined sampling regime obtained the most complete <b>inventory.</b> <b>Differences</b> between these results and similar studies in more open Mediterranean habitats, suggest that for effective inventory, it is important to consider the effects of environmental characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Environmental impacts {{are caused}} the by {{consumption}} {{of material and}} energy or the release of emissions. They can be reduced by optimizing corporate material and energy flows based {{on the principles of}} eco-efficiency management. The basis for this is a higher transparency on corporate material flows. It can be reached by setting up an environmental controlling. The most practicable instrument within environmental controlling is the application of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPI). They can be used to efficiently monitor and control material and energy efficiently on a continuous basis. In the presented dissertation, a procedure model is described for the introduction of an integrative environmental controlling and the development of the required information supply using an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP System). The development of the EPI systemâs information supply uses the ERP System as an information source and as a basis to implement the IT support of the EPI system. The material master data in the ERP System is enhanced by an EPI key. Booking locations (cost center groups, cost centers or storage locations) are attributed to EPIs. Existing material bookings are classified according to their movement type and are attributed to the respective EPIs with booking rules. The material bookings goods receipt/good issue, confirmed production order, overhead order, capital spending order, and <b>inventory</b> <b>difference</b> adjustment are used. Information not available in the ERP System is identified in other information systems and imported into the ERP System. Additional data required is acquired separately. Finally, an IT support for the EPI system is implemented using functionalities in the ERP System to administrate corporate performance indicators. The practical implementation of the procedure model is described based on its application with two industrial companies. In both cases, the ERP System SAP R/ 3 by SAP AG was used. It was shown that the developed EPI System supplies structured information on corporate material flows and increases the transparency on material and enegry flows in the company. Thus, a basis for the systematic reduction of material and energy consumption and the emission of pollutants was created. The achieved solution also serves to give account to stakeholders customers, shareholders, employees and public authorities. Internal reports (to inform cost center responsibles or employees) as well as external reports (e. g. on CO 2 or VOC emissions or on the consumption of substances containing heavy metals) can be generated more easily...|$|E

So are per capita GHG emissions from agriculture significantly lower for New Member States and Candidate Countries (0. 64 Â± 0. 25 t CO 2 -eq/inhabitant) than for the EU- 15 countries (1. 34 Â± 1. 02 t CO 2 -eq/inhabitant), whereby the large standard deviation for EU- 15 originatesfrom the âoutlyingâ Ireland with 4. 8 t CO 2 - eq/inhabitant. The development of agricultural GHG emissions saw slight increases to significant decreases of emissions for EU- 15 countries, which, however, followed a more or less linear path. For the New Member States and Candidate Countries emissions from the agricultural sector, as for the total GHG inventory, decreases were substantial in the early years of the 1990 s. Emissions from agriculture stabilized at a low level or increased again in the late 1990 s. Even though the variability of the sub-sectoral composition of emissions from agriculture across the countries is high, there is no general principal difference between EU- 15 countries and New Member States.

40|$|Traditional {{materials}} accounting is focused {{exclusively on the}} material balance area (MBA), and involves periodically closing a material balance based on accountability measurements conducted during a physical inventory. In contrast, the physical inventory for Los Alamos National Laboratory's near-real-time accounting system is established around processes and looks more like an item inventory. That is, the intent is not to measure material for accounting purposes, since materials have already been measured in {{the normal course of}} daily operations. A given unit process operates many times {{over the course of a}} material balance period. The product of a given unit process may move for processing within another unit process in the same MBA or may be transferred out of the MBA. Since few materials are unmeasured the physical inventory for a near-real-time process area looks more like an item inventory. Thus, the intent of the physical inventory is to locate the materials on the books and verify information about the materials contained in the books. Closing a materials balance for such an area is a matter of summing all the individual mass balances for the batches processed by all unit processes in the MBA. Additionally, performance parameters are established to measure the program's effectiveness. Program effectiveness for verifying the presence of nuclear material is required to be equal to or greater than a prescribed performance level, process measurements must be within established precision and accuracy values, physical inventory results meet or exceed performance requirements, and <b>inventory</b> <b>differences</b> are less than a target/goal quantity.
