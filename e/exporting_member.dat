5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing member state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the importing member state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|E
50|$|When {{a vendor}} in one member state sells goods {{directly}} {{to individuals and}} VAT-exempt organisations in another member state and the aggregate value of goods sold to consumers in that member state is below €100,000 (or the equivalent, e.g. in the UK as of April 2013 it is £79,000) in any 12 consecutive months, then such a sale of goods may qualify for a distance sales treatment. Distance sales treatment allows the vendor to apply domestic place of supply rules for determining which member state collects the VAT. This means that VAT is charged at the rate applicable in the <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> state. However, there are some additional restrictions to be met. For instance, supply of new motor vehicles like cars, trucks and boats does not qualify. As well, a compulsory VAT registration is required for a supplier of excisable goods to the UK (like tobacco and alcohol).|$|E
30|$|Different {{scenarios}} are implemented and discussed where RTA’s initial benefits and losses experience considerable changes following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries. The analysis underlines important redistributions {{of the benefits}} and losses between importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries and between consumers and producers. Also, {{the implications of these}} adjustments for global welfare are found not to be necessarily different in {{the presence or absence of}} regional trading blocs. This outcome is revealed through the illustrated scenarios which show equivalence of these implications with and without the RTA in place. This paper also presents and discusses some analytical considerations in the case of vertical agricultural markets where RTA preferential schemes cover imports of upstream (primary or intermediate) and downstream (final) products.|$|E

30|$|The {{formation}} of an RTA is expected to generate various implications for agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries. This is because the {{formation of}} an RTA, which promotes intra-regional increases in agricultural trade flows, would eventually magnify market competition levels. In this context, several studies (e.g., Krugman, 1991; Frankel, 1997; Perdikis, 2007) noted that reductions in regional and bilateral trade barriers would not only decrease market prices, but would also compel firms in RTAs’ member countries to upgrade their production technologies and to realize more efficient uses of inputs.|$|E
30|$|This paper shows {{changes in}} the initial {{benefits}} and losses from RTAs and depicts their redistributions following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries. It is important to underscore the relevant study by Anania and McCalla (1995) that examined the implications of some domestic and trade policies, which are commonly used in developing countries, for the distribution of benefits from agricultural technology improvements. Using a partial equilibrium framework, Anania and McCalla (1995) identified different cases where policy interventions increase, reduce, or do not impact the overall benefits from agricultural technology improvements. Yet, in all cases, the distribution of benefits from agricultural technology improvements {{is found to be}} different with policy interventions.|$|E
30|$|This paper aims {{to enhance}} our {{understanding}} of the relationship between RTAs and agricultural technology and productivity. The implementation of an RTA is expected to induce increases in market competition levels, in domestic markets through increases in imports and in foreign markets through increases in exports. These increases in market competition levels could eventually result in important implications for agricultural technology and productivity in importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries of regional trading blocs. This paper examines these implications in the context of Viner’s (1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the importing member country, and in the context of Pomfret’s (1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the importing member country.|$|E

30|$|Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) {{represent}} a prominent {{feature of the}} current international trading system. For instance, the number of RTAs that {{have been reported to}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) exceeded 500 in 2012 (WTO, 2012). RTAs normally encompass reductions (or eliminations) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs, non-tariff barriers) between member countries. Also, RTAs often bring about higher levels of business cooperation and trade facilitation measures (e.g., development of regional trade-enhancing infrastructure) between member countries that further promote intra-regional trade flows. RTAs are commonly associated with increases in intra-regional trade flows in agricultural productsa. Naturally, such increases in intra-regional trade would be accompanied with a rise in market competition levels, in domestic agricultural markets for producers in importing member countries and in foreign regional agricultural markets for producers in <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries.|$|E
30|$|Turning to the RTA <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> country F, the post-upgrading {{gains from}} the RTA formation, which are {{equivalent}} to the area [CιIιXιVι[*]+[*]KιGιWι], are higher than the pre-upgrading gains, which are {{equivalent to the}} area [CIXV[*]+[*]KGW] (see previous section). Specifically, the net post-upgrading increases in country F’s welfare, resulting from a higher price received on additional exports, {{is equivalent to the}} area [CιCιιιVιιVι]. Meanwhile, the pre-upgrading gains and the post-upgrading gains in country F’s producer surplus (i.e., the areas [KGW] and [KιGιWι], respectively) are equivalent by construction under the current scenario. Turning to the non-RTA member country J, the losses from the RTA formation are attenuated, being reduced from the pre-upgrading adjustments area [P 4 UYP 5 [*]+[*]UVY] (see previous section) to the post-upgrading adjustments area [P 4 ιUιYιP 5 ι[*]+[*]UιVιYι]. Hence, given that [UVY] is equivalent to [UιVιYι] by construction, the post-upgrading losses are lower than the pre-upgrading losses by the area [UιιUYYιι]. The latter is derived from the lower quantities subjected to an RTA-induced lower price.|$|E

About 20 percent of total marine catch dried round the year and marketed both in domestic and international market. In the supply chain of marine dried fish marketing four intermediary stakeholders are involved between producers and consumers. Besides, involvement of backward stakeholders with the primary producer is considerably high that results 22 percent value addition to raw fish. The value addition is found highest 105 percent from wholesaler to retailer, followed by 90 percent from wholesaler to exporter. In long supply chain profitability is {{not as high as}} the value added. In contrary both the profit maximization and profit distribution are considerably higher in a short supply chain. Supermarket secure as high as 150 percent profit. In all cases, primary producers secure less profit, only 5 to 8 percent whereas their involvement in terms of labor, time etc. is the highest. The major cause of price exploitation is dadan (non institutional money lending) that make producers bound to go for 'conditional engagement' in fish drying business. In relation to dry fish export, the increasing non-tariff measures (NTMs) acts as critical barrier despite having huge international market demand. The WTO SPS and TBT agreements impose a bound obligation to the <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries to improve food quality as per set international standard, but the compliance cost related to SPS obligation is too high, and the government is reluctant, otherwise unable to meet the set criteria. The study recommends appropriate policy intervention for financing dry fish producers and to strengthen domestic technical regulations to overcome technical barriers to dry fish trading in international market.

50|$|The {{decline in}} coffee exports {{in the mid-1980s}} {{resulted}} largely from the depletion of stocks that had earlier cushioned exports as production declined. <b>Exports</b> to <b>members</b> of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) have remained fairly stable since 1983, but <b>exports</b> to non-ICO <b>members,</b> of which East Germany has been {{by far the most}} important market in the late 1980s, have declined. The fall in sales to the non-ICO market has eroded coffee earnings because these sales have traditionally been at substantially higher prices than those to ICO members.

40|$|Standard theory {{says that}} a country's welfare is {{unaffected}} by being excluded from a small regional trade agreement. But for most products,"small"countries and regional trade agreements do have some measure of market power. Such market power can arise if (1) supply is geographically concentrated; (2) tastes differ; (3) there is product differentiation (such as quality); (4) transport costs are high; (5) the principal importing countries impose quantitative restrictions; and (6) there is hysterisis because of irreversible costs. The authors show, based on two case studies, that regional trade agreements among small countries may have negative welfare implications for outside countries. In the first case, they find that Argentina's cattle and beef exports to Peru fell when Peru formed a regional trade agreement (the Andean Pact) with various countries, including Colombia, and exporter of the same products. Argentina also lost because of the higher unit price it received on its exports to Peru. Interestingly, Venezuela's entry into the Andean Pact (that is, {{the formation of a}} larger bloc) seems to have resulted in a welfare gain for the outside country (Argentina). In the second case, rather than examine whether formation of the Central American Common Market (CACM) had a negative impact on outside countries (for which they lacked data), they examine the impact of the CACM's breakdown on member countries. Although the CACM has essentially been trade-diverting for manufactures, it seems to have been trade-creating for white maize, with both importing and <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> countries gaining from the regional trade agreement. So, one would expect that a breakdown of the CACM, which resulted in member countries becoming relatively more"outsiders"to the bloc, may have led to a decline in the welfare of both the exporting and importing member countries. This is supported by the data, and implies that if one of the five member countries had been left out of the CACM, it would have been worse off where white maize was concerned.

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} simple, formal {{framework}} for clarifying the tradeoffs involved in choosing between a fixed and {{flexible exchange rate}} system. They apply this framework to the countries of Africa's CFA Zone, which have maintained fixed parity with the French franc since independence. Because a few agricultural products and natural resources dominate their <b>exports,</b> <b>member</b> countries of Africa's CFA Zone have suffered frequent shocks in terms of trade. A flexible exchange rate could possibly have alleviated the costs of these external shocks. On the other hand, CFA member countries have managed to maintain lower inflation levels than their neighbors. The fixed exchange rate of the CFA Zone acts as a credible committment. The government"ties its own hands"so {{that it will not}} be tempted to use the exchange rate, thereby eliciting lower wage and price increases from the private sector.
