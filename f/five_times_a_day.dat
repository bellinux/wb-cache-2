25|$|The main {{belief of}} The Nation of Islam and its {{followers}} {{is that there}} is no god but Allah. Their most important worship is praying <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> The official beliefs as stated by the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization as well as speeches by Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, and other ministers. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in Message to the Blackman in America and The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad (Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah, 1992). Many of MalcolmX's teachings of NOI theology are in his The End of White World Supremacy, while a later more critical discussion of those beliefs can be found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, co-written with Alex Haley. It is important to note that near the end of Malcolm X's life, Malcolm, along with Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Muhammad, broke away from major parts of Elijah Muhammad's theology. This was spurred originally by immoral actions by Elijah Muhammad, which were in-congruent with the Nations own teaching, but then mainly from Malcolm's experience at the Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca. Malcolm, following Wallace's footsteps, along with many other followers entered traditional Islam (Autobiography of Malcolm X). They rejected that Fard Muhammad was God incarnate, as God cannot be in human form, and that Elijah Muhammad was a prophet sent by God, as the Prophet Muhammad from 570 CE to 632 CE is the last prophet for humankind, according to Islam - Qur'an Verse 40, Surah Al-Ahzab (chapter 33).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} experimentally {{design of}} a cleaning system for the surface of photovoltaic panel using wiper control mechanism utilizing ATmega 16 microcontroller. The proposed cleaning system operates by spraying an amount {{of water on the}} PV panel surface and then actuating the wiper using a DC motor. Two limit switches are used to sense the wiper position {{at the edge of the}} PV panel. In the experimental test, an amount of dust is deployed on the PV panel surface to test the control power performance. The proposed design is high effectively used to bring back to the initial efficiency output of the PV panel over the efficiency of dirty panel. The wiper can be managed to work periodically for example <b>five</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> <b>day</b> or can be manually activated using remote control mechanism. The power consumption performances of the proposed system are only about 0. 79 % and 8. 94 % under standby and operation conditions, respectively.
