50|$|Hydraulic power {{steering}} systems work {{by using a}} hydraulic system to multiply force applied to the steering wheel inputs to the vehicle's steered (usually front) road wheels. The hydraulic pressure typically comes from a gerotor or rotary vane pump driven by the vehicle's engine. A <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> applies a force to the steering gear, which in turn steers the roadwheels. The steering wheel operates valves to control flow to the cylinder. The more torque the driver applies to {{the steering wheel and}} column, the more fluid the valves allow through to the cylinder, and so the more force is applied to steer the wheels.|$|E
5000|$|A {{double-acting}} cylinder is a cylinder {{in which the}} working fluid acts alternately {{on both sides of}} the piston. In order to connect the piston in a {{double-acting cylinder}} to an external mechanism, such as a crank shaft, a hole must be provided in one end of the cylinder for the piston rod, and this is fitted with a gland or [...] "stuffing box" [...] to prevent escape of the working fluid. Double-acting cylinders are common in steam engines but unusual in other engine types. Many hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders use them where it is needed to produce a force in both directions. A <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> has a port at each end, supplied with hydraulic fluid for both the retraction and extension of the piston. A double-acting cylinder is used where an external force is not available to retract the piston or where high force is required in both directions of travel.|$|E
50|$|Rear {{drum brakes}} are {{typically}} of a leading/trailing design (for non-servo systems), or primary/secondary (for duo servo systems) the shoes being moved {{by a single}} <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and hinged at the same point. In this design, one of the brake shoes always experiences the self-applying effect, irrespective of whether the vehicle is moving forwards or backwards. This is particularly useful on the rear brakes, where the parking brake (handbrake or footbrake) must exert enough force to stop the vehicle from traveling backwards and hold it on a slope. Provided the contact area of the brake shoes is large enough, which isn't always the case, the self-applying effect can securely hold a vehicle when the weight is transferred to the rear brakes due to the incline of a slope or the reverse direction of motion. A further advantage of using a single hydraulic cylinder on the rear is that the opposite pivot may {{be made in the}} form of a double-lobed cam that is rotated by the action of the parking brake system.|$|E

[...] This design was normal for that time.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{systems of}} a Wave Energy Converter for {{extraction}} of wave energy is the Power Take-Off (PTO) device. This device transforms the mechanical energy of a moving body into electrical energy. This paper describes the model of an innovative PTO based on independently activated <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> array. The model has been developed using a simulation tool, based on a port-based approach to model hydraulics systems. The components and subsystems used in the model have been parameterized as real components and their values experimentally obtained from an existing prototype. In fact, the model takes into account most of the hydraulic losses of each component. The simulations show the flexibility to apply different restraining torques to the input movement depending on the geometrical configuration and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> on duty, easily modified by a control law. The combination of these two actions allows suitable flexibility to adapt the device to different sea states whilst optimizing the energy extraction. The model has been validated using a real test bench showing good correlations between simulation and experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|All Wave Energy Converters (WECs) {{based on}} wave {{activated}} bodies comprises a Power Take- Off (PTO) system among other subsystems like the reaction mechanism, the {{supervisor of the}} system and the electrical generator. One of the most applied PTO systems consists of oil high pressure hydraulic devices. These devices are able to apply high forces, to store large quantities of energy through accumulators and to provide smoother power output to the motor coupled to a generator. In these systems the poor efficiency and the oil leakages contaminating the environment are considered main drawbacks. Despite of this, they are widely used in several promising WECs with the aim of optimizing the harvested wave energy along the time. The initial challenge to absorb an oscillating movement of ± 30 º at 5 rad/s as a maximum angular speed absorbing up to 16000 Nm from a specific WEC, {{led to the development of}} a simplified hydraulic model before manufacturing a PTO prototype to be verified in a Test Bench (Figure 1). The experimental results of PTO under different conditions have been used to adjust a full detailed PTO Model using Mathworks® software platform. This work presents a patented oil high pressure hydraulic PTO prototype based on an array of four <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> This prototype has been designed and completely modelled as a proof concept at 1 : 4 scale being able to apply a variable Coulomb type damping torque through the activation of each <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> independently and through the modification of geometrical parameters easily. The complete model of the PTO has been accurately tuned up through adjustment of model parameters using the results of the experimental tests. This will allow the study of control strategies to optimize the extracted wave energy from a specific WEC, like point-absorbers...|$|R

The linear motion from vehicle vibration is converted into rotational motion by using a <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> a hydraulic motor and associated hydraulic system. The rotational motion drives an electrical generator, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.

In this paper we present some preliminary results on twin-type hydraulic experiments, employing equal parts containing water and oil. Our initial findings suggest the need for modifications to the test rig, and a comparison of the behaviour between two similar hydraulic test rigs is shown. The main parameters measured during the investigation were the pressures, the spool displacements and the responses of the piston in the <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> However, transient phenomena in the water and oil hydraulic test rig were also analysed and compared.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{behaviour}} at high pressure operation points of a hydraulic Power Take-Off (PTO) using a highly detailed model based on four double-acting hydraulic cylinders modelled by a port-based approach. The developed model {{takes advantage of the}} availability of basic hydraulic components which can be parameterized based on real ones, including most of the hydraulic losses. With the aim of optimizing the extraction of wave energy, this PTO is able to modify its restraining torque through the independent activation of the hydraulic cylinders located in the primary transmission and modifying some geometrical parameters related to their fixation points respecting to the axis torque. The ultimate objective of this PTO is to provide a wide range of torques that can be modulated by modifying the operating high pressure of the HP accumulator, the combination of the available areas of the <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the location of their fixation points with respect to the applied movement. This factor can help to improve the control of WEC based on activated bodies with the aim to optimize the extraction of wave energy.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model that represents the dynamics of a hydraulically operated forestry crane. The model was derived with the traditional Euler-Lagrange formalism and considers the crane mechanics, three <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> and the valve control unit. On the basis of the derived model we reproduced the entire crane model in MATLAB in order to run simulations herewith. This gave us the possibility to do parameter changes for further studies of the crane in motion. Another major goal within the thesis work was to estimate cylinder friction of the hydraulic actuators. We built up a test rig and used double-acting cylinders for determing their frictional behaviour. For this, we ran open-loop experiments in order to create velocity-friction maps that represented the static friction force of the cylinders. In this concern, we varied system pressure and cylinder load to study their influence on the friction force. By means of the derived static friction maps we approached the cylinder’s dynamic friction behaviour and applied both step and ramp control inputs to examine the spring-damping characteristics of the microspoic bristles in the contacting area. The dynamic friction experiments have been exerted in the fashion of the LuGre model. As a result we acquired different nominal friction parameters that we necessarily used to develope adequate friction models. A third {{objective of}} this thesis was to establish a crane-tip control. Instead of a traditional control, providing a direct relationship between joystick input and cylinder extension, the focus was to build up a control for the end-effector’s trajectory in a two-dimensional frame. This could be achieved by using inverse kinematics {{in order to determine the}} required joint angles that corresponded to the desired position of the crane-tip.

5000|$|Heinkel had {{designed}} a relatively small, 'sporty'-looking aircraft, with a sleek, streamlined fuselage. Overall, {{the look of}} the plane was extremely modernistic for its time, appearing quite contemporary in terms of layout and angular arrangement even to today's eyes. The BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet was mounted in a pod nacelle uniquely situated atop the fuselage, just aft of the cockpit and centered directly over the wing's center section. Twin roughly rectangular vertical tailfins were perpendicularly mounted at the ends of highly dihedralled horizontal tailplanes - possessing dihedral of some 14º apiece - to clear the jet exhaust, a high-mounted straight wing (attached to the fuselage with just four bolts) with a forward-swept trailing edge and a noticeably marked degree of dihedral, with an ejection seat provided for the pilot — which the Heinkel firm had pioneered in a front-line combat aircraft, with the earlier He 219 night fighter in 1942. The He 162 airframe design featured an uncomplicated tricycle landing gear, the first such landing gear system to be present from the very start in any operational Axis Powers single-engined fighter design, that retracted into the fuselage, performed simply with extension springs, mechanical locks, cables and counterweights, and a minimum of any hydraulics employed in its design. Partly due to the late-war period it was designed within, some of the He 162's landing gear components were [...] "recycled" [...] existing landing gear components from a contemporary German military aircraft to save development time: the main landing gear's oleo struts and wheel/brake units came from the Messerschmitt Bf 109K, as well as the <b>double-acting</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders,</b> one per side, used to raise and lower each maingear leg. The Heinkel firm's previous experience with designing flightworthy, retractable tricycle undercarriage-equipped airframes extended as far back as late 1939 with the Heinkel He 280 jet fighter prototype, and further strengthened with the unexpectedly successful Heinkel He 219A night fighter, which also used a tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
