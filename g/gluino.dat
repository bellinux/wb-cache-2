5000|$|The {{striking}} {{feature of}} split supersymmetry {{is that the}} <b>gluino</b> becomes a quasi-stable particle with a lifetime that could be up to 100 seconds long. A <b>gluino</b> that lived longer than this would disrupt Big Bang nucleosynthesis or would have been observed as an additional source of cosmic gamma rays. The <b>gluino</b> is long lived because it can only decay into a squark and a quark and because the squarks are so heavy and these decays are highly suppressed. Thus the decay rate of the <b>gluino</b> can roughly be estimated, in natural units, as [...] where [...] is the <b>gluino</b> rest mass and [...] the squark rest mass. For <b>gluino</b> mass {{of the order of}} 1 TeV, the cosmological bound mentioned above sets an upper bound of about [...] GeV on squarks masses.|$|E

40|$|We study {{constraints}} on one-loop neutral naturalness at the LHC by considering gluon partners which {{are required to}} ameliorate the tuning in the Higgs mass-squared arising at two loops. This is done with a simple orbifold model of folded supersymmetry which not only contains color-neutral stops but also bifundamental <b>gluinos</b> that are charged under the Standard Model color group $SU(3) _C$ and a separate $SU(3) _C'$ group. The bifundamental <b>gluinos</b> reduce the Higgs mass tuning at two loops and maintain naturalness provided the <b>gluinos</b> are lighter than approximately 1. 9 TeV for a 5 TeV cutoff scale. Limits from the LHC already forbid bifundamental <b>gluinos</b> below 1. 4 TeV, and other non-colored states such as electroweakinos, $Z'$ bosons and dark sector bound states may be probed at future colliders. The search for bifundamental <b>gluinos</b> therefore provides a direct probe of one-loop neutral naturalness that can be fully explored at the LHC. Comment: 16 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|This note {{presents}} {{the combination of}} three ATLAS searches for squarks and <b>gluinos</b> in 20 fb− 1 of proton-proton collisions at s√= 8 TeV. The results of searches in final states with jets, missing transverse momentum and no or one isolated lepton are combined and interpreted in a simplified model where pair-produced squarks or <b>gluinos</b> decay through an intermediate chargino to the lightest stable supersymmetrical particle. In the model of pair-produced <b>gluinos,</b> <b>gluinos</b> below 1. 3 TeV are excluded at 95 % CL, for a neutralino mass below 500 GeV. Squarks are excluded up to 850 GeV at 95 % CL for massless neutralinos. These limits are an improvement of approximately 50 GeV {{with respect to the}} results of the separate analyse...|$|R

50|$|Several {{types of}} exotic baryons that require physics beyond the Standard Model have been conjectured {{in order to}} explain {{specific}} experimental anomalies. There is no independent experimental evidence {{for any of these}} particles. One example is supersymmetric R-baryons, which are bound states of 3 quarks and a <b>gluino.</b> The lightest R-baryon is denoted as S and consists of an up quark, a down quark, a strange quark and a <b>gluino.</b> This particle is expected to be long lived or stable and has been invoked to explain ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Stable exotic baryons are also candidates for strongly interacting dark matter.|$|E

50|$|R-hadrons are {{possible}} when a colored (in {{the sense of}} QCD) supersymmetric particle (e.g., a <b>gluino</b> or a squark) has a mean lifetime longer than the typical hadronization time scale, and so QCD bound states are formed with ordinary partons (quarks and gluons), in analogy with the ordinary hadrons.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} a theory {{predicting}} observable R-hadrons is Split SUSY.Its main feature is, in fact, that all the new bosons are {{at a very high}} mass scale, and only the new fermions are at the TeV scale, i.e. accessible by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in [...] collisions at LHC.One of such new fermions would be the <b>gluino</b> (spin 1/2, as dictated for the supersymmetric partner of a spin 1 boson, the gluon).The <b>gluino,</b> being colored, can only decay to other colored particles. But R-parity prevents a direct decay to quarks and/or gluons, {{and on the other hand}} the only other colored supersymmetric particles are the squarks, that being bosons (spin 0, being the partners of the spin 1/2 quarks) have a much higher mass in Split SUSY.|$|E
50|$|When {{considering}} {{extensions of}} the Standard Model, the s- prefix from sparticle is used to form names of superpartners of the Standard Model fermions (sfermions), e.g. the stop squark. The superpartners of Standard Model bosons have an -ino (bosinos) appended to their name, e.g. <b>gluino,</b> the set of all gauge superpartners are called the gauginos.|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{systematically}} {{the consistency}} of light <b>gluinos</b> with data on perturbative QCD from deep inelastic scattering, quarkonia, jets at LEP, and the total hadronic cross-section in e + e − annihilation on the Z peak and elsewhere. We demonstrate that, {{in addition to the}} well-known increase in the value of αs(mZ) inferred from lower-energy data due to the slower running of αs in the presence of light <b>gluinos,</b> the value of αs(mZ) extracted from the LEP data must also be increased, as a result of including the effects of virtual light <b>gluinos.</b> The effect of these increases in other estimates of αs(mZ) is to make them more consistent with the value extracted from the total e + e − cross-section, which would otherwise appear distinctly higher. We discuss the possibility of looking for light <b>gluinos</b> in four-jet events at LEP, and their possible implications for scaling violations at HERA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While <b>gluinos</b> and neutralinos are Majorana fermions in the MSSM, {{they can}} be Dirac fermion fields in {{extended}} supersymmetry models. The {{difference between the two}} cases manifests itself in production and decay processes at colliders.

5000|$|Looking for gluinos {{that have}} come to rest inside the {{detector}} and later decay. Such an event may occur if the <b>gluino</b> hadronize to form an exotic hadron which strongly interacts with a nucleon in the detector to create an exotic charged hadron. The latter will decelerate by electromagnetic interaction inside the detector and will eventually stop.|$|E
50|$|In {{models of}} {{supersymmetry}} that conserve R-parity, gluinos decay via the strong interaction to a squark and a quark, provided that an appropriate mass relation is satisfied.The squark subsequently decays to another quark and the lightest supersymmetric particle, LSP (which leaves the detector unseen). This {{means that a}} typical signal for a <b>gluino</b> at a hadron collider would be four jets plus missing energy.|$|E
5000|$|Energy loss: if the {{hadronization}} of the <b>gluino</b> {{has produced}} a charged R-hadron, it will lose energy by ionization when traversing the detector material. The specific energy loss (dE/dx) follows the Bethe-Bloch formula and depends on the mass and the charge (as well as the momentum) of the particle, making a striking difference between a R-hadron and the background of ordinary particles produced normally in [...] collisions.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the Yukawa Higgs-quark-quark {{interactions}} that are generated from radiative corrections of squarks and <b>gluinos,</b> in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We compute the corrections to the effective action for Higgs and quark fields that {{are produced by}} explicit integration in the path integral formalism of all the squarks and <b>gluinos</b> at the one-loop level and order alpha(s). In addition, we consider the limit of nearly degenerate heavy squarks and <b>gluinos,</b> with masses {{much larger than the}} electroweak scale, and we derive the effective Lagrangian containing all the relevant new local Higgs-quark-quark interactions. We show that these new interactions do remain nonvanishing, even in the case of infinitely heavy supersymmetric particles and, therefore, we demonstrate explicitly the nondecoupling behavior of squarks and <b>gluinos</b> in Higgs bosons physics. We present the set of new Yukawa couplings and finally derive the corresponding one-loop, order alpha(s), corrections to the Higgs bosons partial decay widths into quarks...|$|R
