6000|$|... "Believed!" [...] {{retorted}} {{a smooth}} {{young man who}} seemed to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> and sat by the staircase door. [...] "That's an easy task--to believe, sir. Ask any pretty minikin!" ...|$|E
60|$|For the rest, it {{was good}} to be there in the {{speaking}} silence, to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> on his outstretched palms and the cold wind on his cheek, to see the black wall lifting its bold outline and the crags reaching for the white stars.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care, Cap'n. It's {{just fun}} {{enough to be}} on the water," [...] she answered, {{trailing}} one hand overboard. So he rowed around by the North Promontory, where the great caves were, and much as they were enjoying the ride, they soon began to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the sun.|$|E
50|$|Because squash balls bounce with {{different}} amplitude and frequency {{depending on their}} temperature, squash ball machines need to encompass this feature and allow for <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> balls first to give <b>the</b> right <b>feel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>heating</b> system makes squash ball machines different from tennis ball machines which only pump out balls at different speeds and angles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{wants his}} master, and <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> Fed too well, perhaps. I'll keep {{him a few}} weeks and send him home all right,' said Dr Watkins, as Don laid his great head in his hand, and kept his {{intelligent}} eyes on his face, evidently feeling that this man understood his trials, and {{knew what to do}} for him.|$|R
50|$|While Chris {{eventually}} {{recovered from}} his paralysis, {{he ended up}} developing an addiction to painkillers. Greg initially acted as Chris' supplier but grew worried when Chris {{became more and more}} addicted to the pills. Greg was also dissatisfied with Kirsty and began sharing seeing Jo behind Kirsty's back. <b>Feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> for his shady activities, Greg broke up with Kirsty and decided to skip town with Jo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, I don't {{want to be}} hurrying you away, but I {{think you}} had better get back before the sun gets any higher. You may say you don't <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> much, but you are looking pale and fagged, and the less you {{are out in the}} sun the better." ...|$|E
60|$|Rose sat in silence. This {{had been}} another great period of growth. She could still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and turmoil in her brain. It {{was as if}} upon a {{seed-bed}} of quick-shooting plants a bright, warm light had been turned, resulting in instant, magical activity. At her door they put her down, and once more she thanked them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is pretty}} dusty out here," [...] Edgar agreed; [...] "and of course, with these little tents, the wind and dust sweep right through them. Over there in Cairo we have {{comfortable}} barracks, and as we keep close during the day we don't <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> Besides, it is getting cooler now. In August it was really hot for a bit even there." ...|$|E

5000|$|Finally, the Meades {{learn that}} Wilhelmina {{can return to}} Mode because of the unborn child and {{therefore}} can own a third of Meade Publications. As the family and Betty prepare to greet the new part owner, Daniel <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> when Wilhelmina makes her triumphant return to Mode amid a media frenzy, prompting Daniel to become very suspicious of her and he should be: It appears that Wilhelmina is using her comeback to divide the Meades.|$|R
50|$|As much as Heat hates Rook, {{she also}} feels a {{compelling}} force that draws him to her. <b>Heat</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> between them. Ms Heat tries to handle her professional work, {{as well as}} answer to the call of nature as she falls for her handsome, magnetic shadow. In her work, Heat has to dig into {{the case of a}} real estate millionaire who fell to his death. His widowed wife was attacked but survived the confrontation. All the action is set against the background of a killer heat wave that strikes the city.|$|R
60|$|Beneficent Fate {{maintained}} her in happy unconsciousness of {{the dread}} presence sneaking stealthily upon her. She {{did not know}} when the lion paused at her side. She did not hear the sniffing of his nostrils as he smelled about her. She did not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the fetid breath upon her face, nor the dripping of the saliva from the frightful jaws half opened so close above her.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the middle," [...] bawled Horrocks, [...] "temperature near a {{thousand}} degrees. If you were dropped into it [...] . flash into flame like {{a pinch of}} gunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of his breath. Why, even up here I've seen the rain-water boiling off the trucks. And that cone there. It's a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes. The top side of it's three hundred degrees." ...|$|E
6000|$|The rabbit {{did as he}} was told, {{and threw}} the little hare into the fire; but no sooner did the little hare begin to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the flames than he took some green bay leaves he had plucked for the purpose and held them {{in the middle of the}} fire, where they {{crackled}} and made a great noise. Then he called loudly 'Itchi, Itchi! Rabbit, my friend, be quick, be quick! Don't you hear how my skin is crackling?' ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Ignacio <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> when Constance {{pressures}} him to {{make their}} relationship a romantic one despite his non-attraction to her, knowing that her demands {{stands in the way}} of him obtaining a green card so he can stay in the United States. So despite warnings by Hilda not to go, Ignacio believes it's the only way he can see the lawyer that Constance hired for him. When he arrives to Constance's apartment, he discovers that Constance tricked him; she never called the lawyer and used this evening to lure him into marrying him.|$|R
50|$|Francesco wanders {{into the}} {{basement}} where the family business is located. He <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and humidity of the dye vats, passing through colorful lots of drying cloth, to see the workers with their families laboring in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> without much rest. Rejecting his father's offer {{to take over the}} family business, he instead pulls the laborers out of the building to enjoy the daylight. Then he throws the costly textiles out of the window to the poor gathered below. When his father sees the loss, Francesco invites him to join in throwing the cloth out the window so he can know the joy of being free of worldly possessions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aftermath}} is the show's biggest explosion, a huge rooftop blaze {{where the}} audience is actually able to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> radiating <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> [...] "pilot" [...] then rushes out of the door, vest blazing. He is extinguished and apprehended by the policemen, and the show ends.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{worry about}} that,' replied the girl, 'for I've thought it all over, and have {{settled on a}} plan which will make us each able to bear with the other! See, I have had a fur cloak made for each of us, and if we put them on I shall not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> so much nor you the cold.' So they put on the fur cloaks, and set out cheerfully on their way, {{and for the first}} time in their lives quite happy in each other's company.|$|E
60|$|Flattened {{against the}} side of the hut, yet not arousing a single warning rustle from its dried thatching, The Killer came closer and closer to the watcher. Now he was at his shoulder. Now he had wormed his sinuous way behind him. He could <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the naked body against his knees. He could hear the man breathe. He marveled that the dull-witted {{creature}} had not long since been alarmed; but the fellow sat there as ignorant of the presence of another as though that other had not existed.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was true}} that Honora was writing, and that the door was shut, and {{that she did not}} <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> In one of the bookcases she had chanced upon that immortal {{biography}} of Dr. Johnson, and upon the letters of another prodigy of her own sex, Madame d'Arblay, whose romantic debut as an authoress was inspiration in itself. Honora actually quivered when she read of Dr. Johnson's first conversation with Miss Burney. To write a book of the existence of which even one's own family did not know, to publish it under a nom de plume, and to awake one day to fetes and fame would be indeed to live! ...|$|E
50|$|His {{broadcast}} media career began at CKDH in Amherst, Nova Scotia {{in the summer}} after his graduation, followed by work at CKCW in Moncton, New Brunswick and at CHNS in nearby Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1986 he joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He worked for CBC bureaus in the Maritimes and Toronto, Ontario before moving to Vancouver, {{where he was a}} network reporter and hosted the now-defunct programs Pacific Rim Report, Foreign Assignment, and Times 7 (a joint venture with The New York Times) and also hosted a summer series on CBC Radio One, <b>Feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heat.</b>|$|R

50|$|This Nuggets {{trade was}} a {{disaster}} for the Pacers, as the Pacers fell in 10th place in the East halfway through the season and out of <b>the</b> playoff race. <b>Feeling</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> Pacers GM Donnie Walsh re-traded for Jackson at the deadline, giving up Vincent Askew, Eddie Johnson and a couple of 2nd round picks. The return of Jackson sparked the Pacers, but they still missed the playoffs for the only time in the last decade and a half. Jackson would eventually appear in his only NBA Finals as the Pacers' starting point guard in 2000, when they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.|$|R
60|$|A few {{guests were}} in this room when he first entered it, but the distant sound of some first notes of dance music drew them all away. After a {{careless}} look at the quaint decorations about him, he sat down alone on a divan near the door, and beginning already to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and discomfort of his mask, took it off. He had not removed it more than a moment before he heard a faint cry {{in the direction of}} a long refreshment-table, behind which the five waiting-girls were standing. He started up directly, and could hardly believe his senses, when he found himself standing face to face with Nanina.|$|E
60|$|It was bad {{and trying}} weather, {{and it was}} well to have only two old Banks Islanders on board, besides three Ysabel lads. The Bishop {{had plenty of time}} for writing; {{and for the first time}} in his life 'pronounced himself forward with that Report which was always on his mind.' He goes on: 'I read a good deal, but I don't say that my mind is very active all the time, and I have some schooling. Yet it is not easy to do very much mental work. I think that I <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> more than I used to do, but that may be only my fancy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, ill, {{extremely}} ill. I do {{not know}} what is the matter with me or Venice either, whereof the very air seems poisoned. <b>Feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and see the haze! It is most unnatural. Moreover, although in your bed doubtless you saw it not, a great ball of fire blazed and burnt over the city last night. So bright was it that even in a darkened room each of us could see the colour of the other's eyes. Later, too, as I watched at the window, there came a thin streak of flame that seemed to alight on or about this very house. Indeed I thought I heard a sound as of iron striking upon iron, but could find no cause for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had furs on," [...] said Mabel. [...] "What {{a lovely}} spot it is, {{even in this}} weather." [...] Then dinner was announced. She had not been cold. She could still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{tingling}} <b>heat</b> of her blood as she had implored him to love her.|$|R
40|$|All {{the thermal}} cloaks {{reported}} in the literature can be used to thermally hide an object inside the cloak. However, a common limitation of this kind of thermal cloaks is that the cloaked object cannot <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> external <b>heat</b> flow since it is located inside the cloak; thus we call these cloaks ``conventional thermal cloaks''. Here we manage to overcome this limitation by exploiting a class of unconventional thermal cloaks that enable the cloaked object to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> external <b>heat</b> flow. Our finite element simulations in two dimensions show the desired cloaking effect. The underlying mechanism originates from the complementary effect of thermal metamaterials with negative thermal conductivities. This work suggests a different method to design thermal devices where heat conduction can be controlled at will. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures; added Fig. 3 and more comments related to negative thermal conductivitie...|$|R
